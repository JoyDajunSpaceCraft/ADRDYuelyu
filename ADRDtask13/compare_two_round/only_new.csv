so my father just passed away yesterday. my mother has alz and asks ‚Äúwhere is bill?‚Äù every few hours and she basically has to re-live the news of his passing. i fear that this will completely break her. is it ok to just string her along with some white lies and shift her attention to something else? or do we have to continually explain that he has passed?thanks in advance.
"my friend‚Äôs father passed due to complications from alzheimer‚Äôs. the father‚Äôs wish was that in lieu of flowers for his funeral to make a small gift to ‚Äúalzheimer‚Äôs research‚Äù. people here who know much more about these organizations, i saw in the sidebar that  is a listed organization. my question is, is alzheimer‚Äôs association (link listed above) the best place to donate, in this sub‚Äôs opinion, for research related to alzheimer‚Äôs?  if not, i‚Äôd really appreciate opinions. thanks for reading. tl;dr:  is  the best place to donate for alzheimer‚Äôs research?"
"hello fellow redditors. i'm new here and just read through so many of your posts. you all seem so kind and supportive so i thought i would ask for your advice. my mom has early onset alzheimer's (she's 64) and it's progressing more each time i see her. i see her about twice a year. she still knows who everyone is but gets confused often, can't find her way through my house and needs help with things certain tasks like dressing and showering. not sure what stage that is but i can see things getting worse. my dad seems in denial (or maybe just doesn't want to talk about it) about the severity of the situation and what the future holds. being that he's not really prepared for the road ahead i was wondering what advice you could give me in planning for the future. is there something we/he should be doing now to make the road easier? she's been diagnosed and takes a couple different memory related medicines and is on an antidepressant."
"i‚Äôve always found honesty the best policy when it comes my mother. she has been my best friend for years.suddenly she asks me, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs mom?‚Äù and i made the mistake of telling her that she passed away years ago when i was around 11 years old (33 years now). i watched as my mom realized that the mom she was just calling out for was not able to answer. her face morphed into utter heartbreak. my mom is in hospice care at home and i‚Äôm financially and emotionally broke.  i guess i lie to her now? this breaks me more."
"how do you stop a loved one with alz from driving? she thinks she‚Äôs perfectly fine but too easily distracted on the road, losing her parked car, forgets where she‚Äôs going mid route and hitting all kinds of stuff as the norm. the funny part is, she thinks other ppl hit her carüò©. i tried to remind her the doc said she shouldn‚Äôt be driving at all. now she refuses to see the doc because she‚Äôs convinced the dr. will revoke her license.  and she says, ‚Äúthe dr doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about.‚Äù i tried reaching out to the mva to report her but in covid era, no one answers the phone or responds to emails. i cringe every time she tells me she‚Äôs ‚Äúout and about.‚Äù i can‚Äôt take the car or keys because she‚Äôll call the police or have new ones made. she‚Äôs resourceful as hell with 20 hours a day to find a way and fixates until satisfied. sigh. any help/ or experience with this?!?"
"my dad is advanced stage and is cared for at home. his wife is running the show and has found various people to help out. none of them are certified or professional but do this out of the goodness of their hearts and have some experience with caretaking. i‚Äôve always had my concerns in that i wish licensed professionals were caring for my dad, but his wife won‚Äôt spend the money. other than myself and the hospice nurse, nobody wears a mask around my dad, not even his wife. this seems grossly negligent and it scares me, but i don‚Äôt have any control. am i out of line for thinking this is dangerous? i just don‚Äôt understand putting someone so vulnerable at risk. does anyone have a similar problem?"
"today is my birthday and i called my grandmother this morning to thank her for the card i received in the main from her. she said your welcome and we talked for a while. anyway, she called me back about 6-7 hours later apologizing that she forgot about my birthday. she seemed upset with herself and i didn‚Äôt want to tell her she had already sent a card and that we were talking not to long ago so i wouldn‚Äôt confuse her. her sister has been struggling with alzheimer‚Äôs for a while and it‚Äôs gotten to the point where she can no longer recognize her children. i and worried my grandmother is showing early signs.has anyone had a similar experience and would like to share their thoughts? she has been having a lot of stress on her lately so i‚Äôm just hoping it‚Äôs that. thanks."
the doctor told dad that it was alzheimer‚Äôs and that was it. so what happens next? she knows who we all are but gets us mixed up. she has been showing signs of su downing for a couple of years and has been doubly incontinent for about a year but is mostly lucid.so what happens next? i‚Äôm just reeling currently and want to support a dad but i don‚Äôt know how.
"to stay on medicaid, my dad can only have $2000 in assets. since he can only keep $50/month from his social security and he has some minimal expenses (clothes, etc), it was gonna take a while to get up to $2000. but now with this $1200, he's over.i did see on [this website](&gt; stimulus checks will not be counted as income and therefore will not impact medicaid beneficiaries or applicants. however, should the stimulus money not be spent within 12 months, it may be counted as an asset, and therefore could impact eligibility in the year ahead.that's good, so it's not an immediate problem, but it still needs to be dealt with within a year.so what can i spend an extra $1200 on? as [this page says]( ""the money must be spent only for the medicaid beneficiary"". sadly my dad can't speak, can't walk, and basically doesn't show any sign that he's aware of anything around him. i'm not sure what i could buy that would benefit him at all.i guess i could buy him a bunch of junk he doesn't need, but it feels wasteful to do that. if he could still think and talk, i'm sure he would rather donate it, but seems that is not allowed? or can i just give it back to the government somehow? what if i just never cash the check lol?"
"my mom was diagnosed with early onset alzheimers while i was in my preteens. roughly 8 years later i can definitely see the toll the disease has taken, but at this stage my mom is still highly functional. over the past few years i've done a lot of research and have been helping my mom practice activities that combat alzheimers (running, healthy diet, cutting out alcohol, brain games). i've even decided to minor in cognitive science to get a better understanding of how the human brain works.even with my understanding of the disease and the precautions we've been taking, it's still incredibly painful to see what this beast does to the brain. my grandma on my dad's side has alzheimers as well, but is in a significantly later stage. it's difficult to think that one day my mom may end up like that. is there anything else i could be doing to fight it? any healthy coping mechanisms that you guys have found?"
i am considering hip pad for alz. people falling. does it help?
"hi folks,my 68 y/o mother was diagnosed with mild alzheimers this past april (though i noticed issues as early as 2014), and my aunt recently passed from the disease (technically renal failure, but you know how it goes). at the time, when my mother was diagnosed and the doctor said she was only in the mild stages, i somewhat disagreed with him, thinking that she was edging the moderates stages. after my aunt passed, though, my mom seems to take a downturn. here's a list of her current state:-sleeps quite a bit, maybe 10 hours a day.-not really repeating herself, as opposed to my aunt. we delayed getting her evaluated for quite a while because she never did this.-can no longer drive, manage her own finances, prepare her own food unless it's pb&amp;j or microwave, and has stopped the bulk of her cleaning aside from the kitchen (she was a very fastidious person previous and probably vacuumed once a week).-obsessively checks/cleans the kitchen whenever i leave it-wanders around the house quite a bit-has a grasp of the seasons, but i don't think she could tell me the date or even the month if i asked her (she didn't even realize it was christmas eve though we'd just told her the day before)-withdrawn, often speaks/whispers to herself-still bathing mostly daily, but lately has sometimes not changed out of sleepwear (again, unusual for her).-loss of inhibitions (i've heard the aricept made aid in this)most uncomfortably, she's developed several behavioral problems that are almost all directed at me, her caregiver. i've been called a thief and a leech, she's recently tried to block the front door with small stoneware jars (very unsuccessfully, of course), and it's like she can't wait to tell random people about how i've stolen her money or how it's my fault she can't drive anymore.is it safe to say that she's well into the moderate stages of alzheimer's at this point?"
"i‚Äôm a neuroscientist studying alzheimer‚Äôs disease and i manage my own blog called [alzscience](alzscience.wordpress.com). i would like to start incorporating interviews with other alzheimer‚Äôs disease researchers into the site. what are some questions would you be interested in asking these researchers? these questions can be about their research, career, advice, etc. "
my cousin had a post mortem study done on my aunt's brain and refuses to share the results with anyone. i am trying to get in a study and it would be helpful to have this data. why are people so embarrassed and secretive about dementia issues?
"have been close to my boyfriends family for years (used to date someone who was friends with my boyfriends brother). the mother and i are very close (over 5 years) she has very bad alzheimer‚Äôs. her husband struggles to let others help even though she needs more support, the children (including my bf) are struggling, it‚Äôs a terrible situation. how do i support the family? how do i get my bf to open up to me?how do i support him? what is my place? i tend to do too much for people. please and thank you tldr; how to support bf with alzheimer‚Äôs mother"
"my mom is 69 years old. she has been having some basic memory issues. that isn't my concern. the other day she had an episode where she became extremely disoriented and had to sit in the car. she drank a 32oz. bottle of water and then could not remember anything that happened earlier that day. on a couple occasions she has become confused (over the phone) and had to hand the phone over to my dad. i'm very concerned. i live out of state and am planning to go visit and take her to a doctor. does this sound like early-onset? any opinions would be greatly appreciated, i'm so worried."
my dad has early onset accelerated alzheimer's.  it sucks and it's unfair. he has gone through so much in his life and this just seems like it's the icing on a cake made of shit. it started when he was 8 and his big brother died. then his 1st wife (my mum) cheat on him and left him for someone else. after this she died in a car accident. being a single parent is never easy. he then had to deal with his only child joining the navy and going off to war. not to mention getting bowel cancer 2 years before getting diagnosed with alzheimer's. why does it always seem as those people who have a lot happen to them get the short straw every time?
"how would one pay to access any of these trials? my father is in oklahoma, and there just aren't any promising trials in the area.he has the money to self-fund it, he just needs the opportunity. how would one go about self-funding a trial?"
"my mom is in the early stages of alzheimers and has been interested in this. my dad really doesn't want to walk/take care of one more thing. my mom has nerve damage in her feet so she wouldn't be able to do a lot of walking. maybe a visitor therapy dog could help? just wondering, thanks for any help!"
"my wife is absolutely distraught over this.  it's a family history. do you guys know of any local groups in minneapolis/twin cities area to help with family of alzheimer's patients?i love my mother-in-law but i am detached enough to deal with the physical side and stay unbiased regarding her treatment.her children (my wife and my best friend) are not so lucky. they are her children.i'd be interested in getting them in a support group/educational situation, so they can prepare for the worse.any help would be appreciated.thanks."
"my dad is on hospice now and on multiple occasions i've had to call after hours for the on-call nurse and my calls have gone to voicemail. while this is annoying, i understand that they can't always be available and something else might have come up that they are addressing. however, they never even call back to follow up and ask if everything is okay. if you were in this situation would you change hospice providers? i just don't know much about it and am wondering if it's going to be a hassle to switch."
"my grandmother is mid stage, and in the past month or two, something new that has come up, is a couple times a week she will get upset and insist she's not in her house, despite living there for 51 years.  this will go on for hours, sometimes the whole day.  she gets very depressed and upset over it.  she remembers her address, she remembers the city, but she insists she is living in an apartment in ""a town i don't know the name of"" and goes on and on about how much she hates it there and wants to go home.  telling her it is her home, and trying to get her to recognize some of her belongings doesn't help, it just makes her very mad and she starts yelling that she's not crazy.  telling her she will be going home next week, and everything will be back to normal then doesn't help either.  she remains depressed and upset and lamenting about wanting to go home right away.  trying to redirect the conversation to another topic doesn't help either, she goes right back to talking about wanting to go home.  we're not sure *what* to say to her on the days she gets like this.  is this one of those things where there is nothing to do?  we just have to deal with her being upset/depressed on these days?"
i am trying to help my friend stay as strong as he can. he has dementia and it‚Äôs starting to affect his motor abilities. he‚Äôs struggling with balance a lot but also picking things up such as grabbing food and bringing it to his mouth. can anyone recommend any exercises that they have had success with for this kind of thing? thank you.
and they want us to pay the 1700 for her first month ? no one ever told us we would have to pay the first month. leaves me incredibly broke. is this normal ?
"mom is insisting that she‚Äôs already seen everything that i put on tv for her, even when that‚Äôs impossible because it‚Äôs just airing/brand new. it gets frustrating when i put something on for her so i can get a break, and she turns it off five minutes later because she‚Äôs ‚Äúseen it already‚Äù and then wants me to find something else for her. does anyone else experience this, what do you do?"
"her dementia has been worsening for years but the stroke really took a toll. she's also severely depressed and refuses food and water and my grandpa keeps going to the hospital to solve this but it's definitely related to her dementia and ongoing depression. she's very stubborn and every task is difficult. now she's not walking although she can physically, but gets nauseous when she tries. she hates pills and doesn't eat enough to hide them in anything. she sobs all day between her rambles. i just want her to be content, i don't know how to get her there. the family thinks it's so admirable that i'm here but i don't have any choice since my grandpa refuses a caregiver but i think that would make a huge difference given she hates my grandpa and it's especially bad without visitors. any advice in opening these conversations/what i could do? i feel so trapped here."
anyone have any tips on how to get the smell out of the mattress? grandmother peed bed and didnt know until i checked 30 minutes later. saw wet spot went close and felt wetness kn the carpet. anyone have tips on how to get pee smell from the mattress?
"dad has had noticeable mci for several years, recently got a diagnosis of alzheimer's / dementia, and was reported to the dmv by his neurologist. he has a wonderful girlfriend that basically lives with him and has been helping to organize his affairs as he experiences challenges. she now wants to recuse herself from everything, feeling (understandably) that it's not her place. the problem is that i live several states away, and my only sibling has zero desire or ability to be helpful in any way.dad misplaces his phone every 20 minutes. even when he's holding it, he does not notice when i call, he can't respond to texts, does not check email... it is a source of frustration for me as i try to manage his financial affairs, medical affairs, will / trust, driving situation, etc. from afar.i thought it might be helpful if he has an apple watch or fitbit or something that will alert him by vibration or sound if he gets a text or call, and can be used to set a daily alert to check his email from his computer. he is willing to try to learn how to use it. cost is not really a consideration.does anyone have knowledge / experience / ideas about devices that may aid in this situation?"
"after several hours of a neurocognitive psych eval two weeks ago, combined w results from an mri done in june 2021, her neurocognitive psychologist gave the diagnosis of ‚Äúmild cognitive impairment‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúearly stage vascular dementia‚Äù but based on what i‚Äôve seen (i live w my mom) i feel like i‚Äôm taking crazy pills. here are just a few examples: 1. she wrongfully believed she had cancer and told everyone that she was having a hysterectomy for her cancer 2. she cannot drive to any place she does not already know 3. when she drives w both hands on the wheel she wobbles and weaves 4. she cannot remember how to use her cell phone to do simple things like make a phone call‚Äîshe could not remember my phone # the other day &amp; could not figure out how to call me despite it being saved in her contacts5. backing out from the driveway, she hit a parked car (owner didn‚Äôt contact insurance, he said it was an old car &amp; didn‚Äôt matter)6. she never knows what day it is, misses appts or shows up on the wrong days/times 7. she gets aggressive &amp; violent w me over nothing 8. she‚Äôs sedentary 24/7 she is intelligent and charming and knows how to ‚Äúturn it on‚Äù long enough to fool someone during a phone call. i am keeping a list of all of my concerns to share w her neurologist, but that appt isn‚Äôt until the end of april. i am worried she may hurt someone in the meantime w her driving, but i also can‚Äôt say anything to her doctors in front of her (she was abusive to me growing up &amp; frequently explodes at me when she feels i‚Äôm ‚Äúunder-riding her authority‚Äù.) in your experience, have doctors sometimes misdiagnosed dementia? is there anything more i can be doing to keep her and others safe? i‚Äôm really stressed and i keep communicating w her doctors but it feels like it falls on deaf ears."
i was able to get my grandmother to willingly sign poa paperwork on a good day and have it notarized. what do i need to do with it other than get copies? probate office?
"background: i am the caretaker of my friend c, a 78 year old man with dementia. i am very close with and work alongside his bio son who is power of attorney and between us, we handle c's life for him. about two years ago we went through all of c's credit cards and shut them down, or so we thought.  there were about two cards that we did not know existed and subsequently missed paying them off and shutting them down. the initial charges were small, about $100, but the late fees really piled on.these cards over the past two years have substantially destroyed c's credit. we are worried that this destroyed credit will ruin his availability to get in to a nursing home of his choosing, which is a scenario that is approaching quickly. do we have any availability to challenge these credit damages, on the grounds that c's dementia has taken away his comprehension? how does this work? do we have any options to get back his previously stellar credit score?"
"i feel like i‚Äôm watching my grandmother die all over again - i‚Äôm a span of 4/5 years‚Ä¶  i‚Äôve watched my mom go from walking around to being in a wheelchair completely out of it. she was put into a horrible nursing home by family and i can‚Äôt get her out. i‚Äôm heart broken every time i see her and talk to her, i have no one to talk to about it and i‚Äôm crumbling and breaking inside. i‚Äôm only 23 and i‚Äôm so scared of the day i lose my mother, i feel helpless because i can‚Äôt help her. does anyone have any advice on how to deal with it? i would love your opinion, thank your ‚ù§Ô∏è."
"my mom started showing signs of early onset dementia when i was a teenager and died when i was 23 and i was thinking about how i had never met anyone outside of my own family who was as young as me when their parent was diagnosed. it‚Äôs been lonely, even the support groups don‚Äôt quite ‚Äúget‚Äù it since they‚Äôre all older. my mom started showing symptoms when she was still parenting me! talk about a role reversal! and of course there‚Äôs the fear that i‚Äôll start developing dementia in my 40‚Äôs. anyone else? wanna talk?"
"we‚Äôre moving my dad on monday and my mom is planning on telling him today. he has parkisonism so his dementia is manifesting almost more like an inability to form sentences or say what he is thinking rather than him actually forgetting things (maybe this is what it‚Äôs like for all? i dont know to be honest) and physically, he needs help with every aspect of daily life. any advice on the transition? what do we tell him? he understands he is burdening my mom. he apologizes all the time."
"my father in law has some spots on his brain and is starting to experience some forgetfulness.  last night we watched a movie (knives out) with my father in law.  three times during the movie he inquired about certain character and actor.  no one else, just the michael shannon character.  seems really weird and specific.  is this an indication of something or just an odd coincidence?"
"so my 83 yo dad will talk to himself non stop or not talk at all, there is no in between. it's keeping me awake and i'm becoming really sleep deprived! mum told his doctor and all they said was to put him in a nursing home and apparently they were really rude about it. he still showers and even makes himself breakfast, he doesn't need to be in a nursing home.surely talking that much can't be good for him? it's for hours on end, and he gets angry and sometimes even makes scary demonic noises. i would have thought a mild sedative or something would help. it was just his gp though, so would it be worth going back to the dementia specialist? this gp has been really rude before too so mum will be taking him to a different one from now on."
"hi, i have been taking care of my grandmother during the covid pandemic at her home. the family has decided to put her into memory care facility. i am the only family member in-state. i am looking for advice on how to support her transition. it breaks my heart to see her leaving her house where she feels safe. how have you all approached facility living and maintaining quality of life?"
i seem to cope with stress by drinking too much and it‚Äôs great for temporary relief but just leads to more exhaustion and burnout. my friends always used to be my release but now most of them have there own life and problems. do pets help or just add to the stress of it all?
"my 89 year old mother suffers from dementia and, for the past 4 years, has been a resident in the memory care section of a seniors residence. she has become convinced that a recently-arrived male resident, also suffering from dementia, though less advanced, is her long-deceased husband. at first the care aides considered it sweet or cute that they had ‚Äúformed a relationship‚Äù but they have taken to spending all of their time together. whereas she was happy and light-hearted previously she has behaved angrily or acted out in the past few weeks. a week ago, when she was found in a state of undress with him in her apartment, we asked the staff supervisor to ensure that staff understood that they weren‚Äôt to be left in either of their apartments alone. the other day, after a care aide had attended to her needs in her bathroom, the gentleman entered her apartment and, when the care aide advised him that he wasn‚Äôt to be in her apartment with her alone (as we, her family, had requested), my mother slapped the care aide in the face hard enough to leave a welt. prior to this incident we‚Äôd been processing the whole ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù situation and how to approach it and now, this. questions: has anyone encountered anything similar? what was the approach to the situation? what was the outcome?"
"i've been looking for studies on dementia patients that were known to use cannabis and other hallucinogenics through most of their life but not heroin, opioids or other similar pharmaceuticals.  my parents were drug free and the onset  of dementia has been, like most of your experience,  destructive.   i'm not doing any formal studies, just curious.  any insight?"
"we spend a lot of time talking about our wards, parents and patients - but what are we doing for ourselves to ward off dementia?do you have a supplement regime? exercise regime? specialized diet? brain exercises? meditation? what are your plans for the future? retire to the woods and go out fighting a bear? pass peacefully in a comfy bed? sign up as a neuralink beta tester?i recently started thinking about this and wondered what others were doing and planning.thanks for reading!"
"how do my family and i (27f) survive taking care of my grandpa who has vascular dementia? we had no idea he would be an absolute nightmare when he gets in a bad mood ! when he gets mad or feisty he treats mom horribly and acts like a 2 year old! tonight we were on our way home and he tried to grab moms pop and she tried to grab it back which caused the car to swerve slightly . we are fine but my question is , is there something we can do about how mean he‚Äôs being ?"
"my wife has had dementia for 5 years and takes seroquel. she saw a new neurologist today who wanted us to think about exelon patch. i hate it when the doc says, do you want to try exelon patch? how would i know? i said that and he said, ok, we won‚Äôt do that then. anyone take this med? what about it?"
so i've been caring for my grandmother with alzheimer's for some time and so far she has slowly gotten worse. since caring for her she has always had issues with certain food textures and frequently spits out her food and hates most things ( except sweets lol). i've just learned to ignore it and let it be.today i served her chicken noodle soup and for the first time she said it was too hard and couldn't swallow it. i found this odd considering she loves peanuts and eats them regularly as a snack. so i pureed her food and she ate some more thankfully. my concern is her comment about not being able to swallow and if this is a sign of disease progression or just her way of saying she doesn't like the food. going forward i guess i should just puree everything? i know that eventually she will not be able to swallow foods but i expected it to start popping up much later.
"yesterday, i traveled 600km to support my grandma, because my uncle (her son) died 3 weeks ago to a liver cirrhosis. now, my grandma has had dementia symptoms for years, but this is probably the last straw (and i get it, losing your own son is tragic)because she has advanced to a stage of having hallucinations and now i think that she has delusions too and i don't know what to do.so, i was just sitting in her living room, when she was like look there's a bus and it's full of people. yes there was a bus, but there was no one there. it was empty. and that there's bees. none. there was none.then i got kind of scared and panicked, and just answered 'okay...""and my cheeks got flushed because of how scared i was and she came and hugged me, and suddenly was like ""you have very high fever! go rest you're so hot"" and i can assure you, i'm fine. i have nothing wrong with me. but she insisted to the point of yelling, so i got scared and fled to another room (the room i sleep in) and pretended i was sleep.what should i do? i do not have anywhere else to go, and i can't leave before monday evening because of train schedules..."
"title says it guys, where are we right now in terms of research?have psychadelics been explored in controls with dementia? ketamine, psylocybin, low dose lsd? have seen studies that this improves neuroplasticity and creates new neuron connections but i dont know how much this would help dementia. also it has effect on glutamate.have any peptides been looking promising for dementia? there's a world of them out there that show brain regrowth, though i dont know as much as i would like about it. maybe you guys are more into?and anyone knows other drugs that might help? such as glutamage modulators? riluzole? the new drug fda approved that i dont remember the name? (havent seen anyone try this new drug)just wanna know more, if anyone could chip in some info or experiments would be greatly appreciated! danke"
"hello. if you have a loved one in memory care, what precipitates a call from the facility? i have gotten several calls re: my dad falling (without injury). i have always figured that those calls were sort of liability covering and they haven't concerned me. but today i got a call that a staff member had been suspended for a verbal altercation with my dad. again most of me thinks this is just a procedure and they are covering themselves, i shouldn't be worried. but should i be worried? for what it's worth, we visit 3 times a week."
"i just got back from vacation with my father who is 66. he has just struck me as incredibly absent minded, although i‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs always been like this and i haven‚Äôt noticed when i was younger. when we got back to the car after returning home, he lost the long term parking tickets. okay, not necessarily dementia. he then finds it in his wallet behind some stuff. he comes back up to the car after paying and can‚Äôt find the ticket again (you need it to get out). he had it in the exact same spot in his wallet. then he starts asking where the keys are even though i had them in my hands in plain view of him the whole time. before that, on the flight, the tsa took a plastic water bottle from him out of his briefcase. it was the same exact brand that our relative we were visiting provided for us, and he claimed the tsa put a water bottle in his brief case to spite him‚Ä¶.. our trunk got partially opened at another point in the car and he claimed the gas station attendant might have been looking for something to steal. he comes up with theories like this every time he misplaces something or messes up in some way and it sounds incredibly abnormal to me at least. does this sound like dementia, or some kind of mental illness?"
"my mother was formally diagnosed with dementia caused by alzheimer's about a month ago, she scored 21/30 on the mme. she clearly needs 24/7 care, but she refuses to even discuss visiting an assisted living facility, with an anger and energy that i didn't know she had. her anosognosia is strong, and is completely unaware she has dementia; according to her ""those doctors are wrong.""so, from your experience, how much longer do i have for her to calm down so i can get her into assisted living? i don't think they'll take someone who is -- literally -- kicking and screaming."
"my grandmother‚Äôs dementia has progressed significantly in the past few months since my grandfather passed away. they were living in their home independently, but without him, things took a sharp turn and right away, my grandmother couldn‚Äôt be left alone anymore even for a few hours. my mom and her two siblings all live in different states from each other and my grandmother, but took turns looking after her in her home and their own homes for a period of several weeks, trying to figure out the best place to move her long term that would make her happiest. she became very aggressive and threatening toward my mom and my aunt during this time over the discussion of assisted living facilities, and eventually got so violent that she had to stay in a psychiatric hospital for a month before being moved to a memory care facility near my uncle, since she remembered fighting with my mom and aunt and didn‚Äôt want to see them anymore.i wanted to know if anyone has advice for how to best support my mom. my grandmother cursed my mom out and said some very horrible things to her then ended by saying she never wanted to see her again. my mom and grandmother have always had a good relationship overall, but my grandmother had been known to say some hurtful things here and there before she got sick. however, i know her very well and i have no doubt that she would not have wanted to say that to my mom if she had been in her right mind, no matter how upset she may have been over anything. my mom is really hurt though and said because my grandmother remembered it all the next day, she thinks she really meant it and it wasn‚Äôt the disease talking. i said that i don‚Äôt think someone with advanced dementia is ever not affected by it in some ways, trying to make her feel better, but my saying that seemed to make things worse. she basically said she thinks blaming the disease invalidates how hurtful it was to her.i love my mom and want to give her the best support possible during this hard time. what is a better way for me to relate to her over what happened?"
hi i've just be found out that my to be grandfather in-law got diagnosed with dementia. i know what is dementia. but because of long distance me and my fiance don't go that often to him (living with his wife). i really care for him because he took care of my to be wife and looking if there is something i can do to help dementia to slowdown? best regards david
my dad's neurologist just prescribed him memantine. just wondering your guys' experiences with it! did it help? hurt? have any affect?
"she's beyond the ability (or interest) to play games and is *very* hard of hearing, so music and movies are out. my parents have been looking after her pretty well, but there are times when she needs to stay occupied for a few hours while my mom gets dinner ready and such. so far, picture books sort of help, but i don't think she's getting much meaning from them anymore; sometimes she just turns the pages without looking at the images. the problem is that she can't get up and walk around; if she tries, she'll fall, so we have to keep an eye on her and keep her occupied when she's awake. any suggestions for keeping her from constantly trying to leave her chair?"
"my grandmother just turned 91 and for a little while now has been on the gradual decline in terms of memory. when there are a couple of us in conversation, i have noticed that more and more she sort of tunes out. she is also constantly losing things. she lives with my parents and i can see the affect it is having on them and her.just yesterday i was visiting and she was attempting to pay her taxes online, but couldn't find her wallet. in the search, we found her check book in the sleeve of a sweater in her dresser. this is becoming a constant problem.when i asked her if everything was ok, she nearly broke down, but she would not let me help her to continue to search. she is about as stubborn as they come. i am curious if anyone has any tips on how myself and my parents might be better able to help the situation. do we hold onto all valuable items for her? i know that she wont like that, but seems like losing the items is more traumatizing each time then the anger she might have from losing that independence. any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated."
i used to feel like growing up with a parent with early onset dementia was a horrible experience but thankfully i‚Äôm starting to reframe it. now i feel lucky that my mom developed dementia and not something like cancer. i‚Äôm lucky she wasn‚Äôt an addict. i‚Äôm lucky she had to move into a nursing home while in high school taking the burden off of me. i‚Äôm lucky that while she hasn‚Äôt been able to talk or feed herself or walk for the past 3 years she is still alive. honestly dementia really isn‚Äôt that bad and i‚Äôm so thankful that i‚Äôm finally seeing it for what it is. i used to be sad and feel like i lost a parent and all that but did i? she is still alive so what do i have to complain about? she is in hospice and looks terrible and is covered in bed sores but she is still alive and i still have my mom and that is more than what most others have
"hey, my mom was diagnosed with lewy body back in 2019. her neurologist has been ordering an eeg every 6 months or so and i'm not sure why this is necessary. her boyfriend is convinced it's to ""milk insurance."" is this a common test to monitor progress of the disease or is this superfluous?"
"we‚Äôre moving mom to memory care within the month.  it‚Äôs a lovely place, but she‚Äôs moving to a typically tiny memory care apartment and will be losing 90%+ of her stuff.  she‚Äôs obsessed with losing her things, actually since a house fire 15 years ago and even though we were able to replace many items, she is getting ready to lose most of her things again.fortunately, she will be able to take her little dog, but what other kinds of things can we move with her that might minimize the sense of loss?"
"this is not only my first time posting here, but my furst time even discussing it. my grandmother (who passed in 2015, aged 95) spent her final years with dementia and crippled from arthritis.my mother has inherited the same arthritis, which has gotten worse after she turned 65. i already know that i've inherited the arthritis, but what really scares me is the possibility of inheriting dementia. mom's mental processing is slower than it used to be but she doesn't have dementia, so i worry now that i will inherit it too. i work on battling arthritis by working out my joints, and continuing my weight loss goal. however i have no idea what to do with battling dementia. i already have processing disabilites, so the idea of my brain going more wonky that it already does worries me. mom's own processing is slower than it used to be, so it's not a good preview of things to come. what are the chances of inheriting dementia, and how can i combat it and keep my faculties as long as i'm alive?"
"so my moms social security and pension are going to be paying for the rent/services at a home with a caregiver. she needs 100% of it and is in a ton of debt, i know that credit card companies cant garnish but she owes taxes which i recently learned can be garnished from her ss.is there any help to get rid of this debt with the irs? i can try and make her set up a payment plan but that's still going to be taking quite a bit away. i mean is there a stage where the irs has to back off because she needs somewhere to live?"
"when mom is having a day when she is friendly and kind to me and her caregiver, she also grunts and moans constantly. it is rough to hear that 24 hours a day. even at night and when eating, she kind of moans. it's difficult to describe this noise (i sleep with ear plugs to block how bad it gets at night). you can try to redirect, etc., but she will always go back to the groaning.but one weird thing is that when mom is aggressive, she doesn't make these noises. on days when she is threatening people, calling people names, etc., there is no grunting and moaning. no clue why this is, but it's a weird phenomenon to observe. today is one of those days where even her medicine is ""poison"" and we're ""trying to kill her"" and all of that. but the moans and grunts? completely silent around here. anybody else ever witness a phenomenon like this?"
"dementia's my greatest fear, and i want to help my grandpa - who has it - however i can. i think he's in early to mid stage 4, but i'm not sure... he has stage 5 liver failure (i'm unsure what kind), smoked for most of his life and has some type of diabetes, so he's incredibly weak. he can barely walk, doesn't speak much, and he seems really distant. he still lives with my grandma, and he is rejecting the procedure that cleans out your blood (i forgot what it's called and can't find the name). i wanna help him feel better, so i've been comforting him and giving him some of the gemstones i tumble when i visit, but i want to help more. how can i?"
"my moms stage...oh i don‚Äôt know. her short term memory is gone and some of her long. can‚Äôt be alone. can‚Äôt sleep alone. convinced aliens ans ghosts are moving and stealing her stuff. she‚Äôs kind of mean. it‚Äôs a lot. well i‚Äôm pregnant. single - she hasn‚Äôt met my boyfriend though she knows of him and i think remembers. how do i tell her this news? she‚Äôs so depressed and anxious and worried already. i know she wants a child for me, i‚Äôm almost 40. but i also think this will make her feel like more of an inconvenience and more alone and depressed."
"greetings all,&amp;#x200b;this sub has been such a tremendous help to me and my brothers in dealing with my mother's dementia, and i'm eternally grateful for all the feedback i've received over the years.&amp;#x200b;unfortunately my mother, currently living at assisted living with late stage early-onset dementia, has had yet another setback in life. she now has been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer with a life expectancy of 2-3 weeks or months.&amp;#x200b;obviously this is terrible news and the family is very sad about all of this. but now my brothers and i  are worried about end-of-life expenses. &amp;#x200b;my brothers and i can't really afford to pay for these things when they happen in the near future. we were originally guesstimating that mom had at least a few more years left according to doctors, and were waiting to start thinking about this. but now, with the latest diagnosis - she does not have much time left.&amp;#x200b;now we must think about things like end-of-life expenses. funeral homes, cremations, burials, cemetery plots, etc.  and someone suggested i look into life insurance , or final expense insurance to help with these expenses. but i have no idea where to start, or if it's even a possibility.&amp;#x200b;does anyone have any suggestions?  we live in maryland usa.&amp;#x200b;thank you all for taking the time to read this, it is truly appreciated."
"my mother is in a nursing home and they have stopped taking visitors (i‚Äôm in nyc). i am concerned about what her body might look like (bruises sores etc). would it be strange/unreasonable to ask that the nursing home send me pictures of her? i‚Äôm sure at her age, wear and tear might be inevitable, i just want to make sure there‚Äôs nothing else going on."
"my dad has early onset dementia, he‚Äôs 65 and has had it for probably about 8 years and i would say he‚Äôs been in various treatment and diagnosis of sorts for about 5 years but only got a dementia ‚Äúdiagnosis‚Äù two years ago (it was like pulling teeth to get it from the doctor, he didn‚Äôt want to make anything official for some reason? but we needed it for disability plus to get his license taken away). we initially thought it was alcohol induced dementia but now we don‚Äôt because he hasn‚Äôt had alcohol in about two years and no improvement. the doctor still has never given a diagnosis, like alzheimer‚Äôs or anything. now he says my dad is past the point where he can get a four  hour test to actually determine what he might have. he says it doesn‚Äôt matter because the treatment will be the same. is this normal? i do want to know partially for treatment reasons but also partially because selfishly i want to know if it might be a type my brother and i are more likely to get. my grandfather also had early onset dementia and we think they said it was alzheimer‚Äôs but  everyone in my family who was involved with that has passed away."
"my grandmother has dementia caused by alzheimer's for many years now. her condition is declining rapidly. the last few days, her body would sometimes feel really warm. 37.5¬∞c (99.5¬∞f). what could be the cause of this? should we worry? we've now given her aspirin hoping to lower her temp back to normal. she hasn't been exposed to strangers, and none of us her caretakers have developed any covid symptoms."
"grandpa‚Äôs sex drive is high and i noticed it when i regularly visit him, he harasses her caregiver and employees from the facial spa and hair and nail salon to have sex with him or fulfill his fantasies. is it normal for a dementia patient to have a sky high sex drive? how should i intervene to help him control his urges and fantasies to not harass more women?"
"hi everyone,first time posting here. i was wondering if anyone has any tips / advice on convincing someone to stop driving. my father has been told by his doctor to stop driving, and he is not taking it well and seems to be in denial. anything we can do short of taking the keys away? thanks so much."
"as the title states, she hasn't stopped staring at this clock. i got it because it says the date, year and time and what time of day it is and such as she's always confused about the time.but ever since i plugged it in she's done nothing but stare at it thoughtfully, sometimes looking rather sad. she's asked if its right a couple of times then goes straight back to staring. we keep checking on her and asking if she's ok and she says she is but i'm not sure if the clock was acctually a good idea or if i should take it away because its just upsetting her?any advice would be gratefully received.thanks"
"so along with my mother and the help of an aid, i have been taking care of my grandmother for the past 4 years. the last month she has progressed very rapidly. she is currently bed ridden at home and we have to pick her up to get her to the bathroom and force any liquids we can get into her. after that she just lays down and stares with her eyes half open occasionally making a few sounds but no intelligible words until she falls asleep. does she understand me? is there any way i can make her more comfortable? are people this advanced in pain or aware of anything?  we are determined to let her pass away in the house but we have no clue how long that will be."
"i just found out that my dad who lives in a nursing home has been moved to isolation since his roommate has covid. first, how in gods name did this even happen? does anyone have experience with this yet? my dad is 82 with heart failure and emphysema and dementia. he is being tested today for the virus. i am trying not to be just angry and worried....has anyone on here had their family member survive this thing with those types of health conditions?"
"hi,this concerns my father in law (70) , who lives in an other country and this is the first time we see him since her wife told us that she and the doctors think that he has for sure epilepsy and possibly dementiamy question is: is it possible that somebody has frontotemporal dementia and neither me nor my husband see any symptoms at all? no change vs previously observed behavior. he is visiting us, living under the same roof now for a few days and nothing.. he is nice, he helps and tries to make himself useful, he is chatty..his wife is saying that he is super agressive, argumentative and irrational at home and rapidly deteriorating- and we just don‚Äôt see it because now he is behaving.. - but they always had a very stormy relationship, and we don‚Äôt have any neutral / 3rd party confirming it.can he really ‚Äòbehave‚Äô for 3-4 days without slipping?i know that something is wrong with him as he is lost sometimes during the night and he has the epilepsy but i want to protect him from being put in a box where he does not belong and labeled agressive etc, plus i want to protect my husband constantly thinking about the eventuality that he inherited it..those of you who have an experience with this illness- what do you think?thank you!!"
"my mother in law is 82 and every morning i wake up to a fire hazard in front of my front door  blocking the exit. this has gone on for over a year. we remove as much as we can from the room but she will drag chairs, easels, stools, even trampolines from all over the house to block the front door. if you confront her it turns into a screaming fit and she starts throwing things and threatening my wife. i have a 6yr old boy who does not deserve to live in fear for his life but also have a wife who refuses to put this woman into a home. i‚Äôm done with her putting my family into danger and it is causing my marriage to fall apart because i won‚Äôt allow this to just happen every night of our lives. i‚Äôm so done, but she makes me sound like a terrible person because i won‚Äôt stand for it. i don‚Äôt care if her mother had dementia or not, this is an immediate danger to my family. why should i treat a person who puts my family in danger with any respect?"
"any advice on communicating a move?we are moving my grandma from assisted living into an adult family home on friday. i‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to tell her friday that she is transitioning to her new home. she is very attached to her current place of residence, but can no long afford it and needs higher level of care. she is not going to want me to touch any of her things, so i‚Äôm not sure how logistically this is going to work. i tried telling her yesterday about the move, saying that i‚Äôm excited we found her a beautiful home to live in, with a couple other ladies so she will never be lonely. i gave her a lot of positive points, but she got very upset and told me i‚Äôm throwing her out with the trash and that she refuses to move. she of course remembers nothing today... i‚Äôm just quite concerned as to how to make this as best a transition for her as possible?"
"was thinking of getting something like this for my mom: she loves animals, especially dogs, but i think having a real pet would be too much work for my dad on top of taking care of my mom. i was wondering if a pet toy like the one i linked might be a decent substitute?has anyone bought one for their loved one and any thoughts? does it help, did they play with it or just ignore it, etc...?"
"hi all, hope this finds you well. first post but may be availing myself of your help if i can over the next few months.i am a carer of my dad who has fronto-temporal dementia and am currently looking at technological solutions to a few problems that will become more prevalent as his condition degrades. he's at a mid-stage - lost language down to the verb ""to go"" and the noun ""things"" and of course memory is a large issue but he is currently in little danger of wandering or hurting himself. i and the family see this changing starkly in the next year or so, as the syndrome progresses.  to prepare there are a few products i have been researching and was wondering if anyone has experience or could suggest reliable products for a few needs that i see being the most pressing:1. a solid reliable universal tv control2. the next step is wandering solutions - i currently have ""find my phone"" monitoring his location but will need to step up as it becomes more of a risk, especially as his capacity to remember having his phone in his pocket changes.3. pill solutions - i know most are seniors specific and many solutions would work but anyone have  any experience with good solutions that might be memory and dementia specific?thankyou in advance for any advice you can give."
"ita been an incredibly long few days. thank you to everyone for your help and advice on my original post.father in law is in hospital (uk) under a dolls order and is being cared for properly while we get a chance to examine all our options.being on this ward and seeing all these people suffering the various stages of dementia has affected me in ways i did not expect, this whole experience has been traumatic but it has given me the drive to help if i can.i'm a salesman by trade and honestly i have never felt so utterly pointless. can anyone share any advice on ways i may be able to help once we have gotten through this either with work or money?"
"my mother recently became the caregiver of her father who has stroke induceded dementia. he hates activities that don't have a purpose. for example he hates puzzles or coloring, but will fold towels and dry dishes because it's a purposeful task. he used to love volunteering and always had a handyman project to do. i'd love to find some sort of project he could do at home and donate or something along those lines that would give him a sense of purpose. he is a fall risk btw. any ideas? thanks"
"my dad spends his day rt in front of the tv watching movies and such. not much else he can do. his comfort is clicking the remote. youtube, hulu, and prime are his best friends. problem is he cat understand what shows he has access to and what he has to pay extra for. this month he has ordered several extra channels and ten movies. it is his money and he can go broke if he wants, but he has told me he doesnt want anything he has to pay extra for. and i have shown him several times how to tell whats included in prime and what isnt.so today he bought soulsurfer for 12.99. a few days ago he bought a year sub to pga golf (he doesnt like golf) and several channels. this is just him randomly clicking around with no idea what hes doing. this is the only thing he has left that he can do. does anyone have any suggestions how i can keep him out of trouble?thx"
"does anyone have any good strategies for helping someone with alzheimer‚Äôs who needs help and but is incapable of accepting help? for a time, mom was cooperative. now however she demands to do it herself. the problem is that hygiene and other things are suffering. inadequate tooth brushing led to cavities and really bad gums. getting dressed is not successful, leading to backwards or inside out clothing, missing underwear, etc. just trying to kindly start her off, by prepping toothbrush is a problem. starting her off with shirts, shorts, etc. in the right directions and allowing her to go the rest of the way devolves into angry interaction that sometimes leads to her throwing punches and shoving. i don‚Äôt want her mouth to totally fall into ruin or to end up wearing shorts around her shoulders (has happened), but it is hard to help when she becomes violent. is there a way to help, or do you just have to let them fall into disrepair? i don‚Äôt want to be perceived as negligent, but i also don‚Äôt want to experience her throwing her arms wildly in punches every other day."
"so my dad (50) currently has no diagnosis but he and his doctors know that based off family history, it‚Äôs all but a guarantee. for years he‚Äôs pretty much been without any memories from his childhood.last week, while setting up the tree at my parent‚Äôs house (my sister is 17 and i‚Äôm 22) my mom mentioned that next year she wants to do a themed tree and retire all the random ornaments from over the years (i got a new ornament every year until i moved out and my sister is presumably moving out next year and she‚Äôs gotten one each year as well) my dad and i protested this because of tradition but later he came back to the room in tears and said the reason that he doesn‚Äôt want to retire that tree style is because he‚Äôs starting to lose memories from our childhood too and he‚Äôs terrified. how can i help him maintain as much as he can while also helping comfort him through things we can‚Äôt control? i‚Äôm also terrified going into this because most people from both sides of his family develop some level of memory issues early on and for some reason, most men on his paternal side don‚Äôt survive their fifties."
"thanks in advance for taking the time to read this. i will do my best to articulate this horrible anxiety i have over finances and dementia. i am 26 years old, married, and we have a very average income. i constantly lose sleep over the fact that my parents or my in-laws will develop dementia. neither of them have much money or assets, and while i would do anything to help and support them in my power, i don't see how i could ever afford to financially put them up in a nursing home or assisted living facility that costs $6000 per month. the costs of long term care is absolutely ludicrous to me. i guess my fear is that i would become financially ruined from trying to care for them. does medicaid come in to play for paying for people's dementia care if they run out of money and become broke? does a child have to go broke trying to pay for their parents care? has anyone had any experience navigating this?"
"i help take care of (converse with, prepare meals for, ensure medication is taken) a moderately functional dementia patient whenever her daughter in law is away. she is resistant to doing puzzles and games, but is sometimes receptive to hearing me read a poem and likes to listen to my own experiences. i'm looking for ways to enrich her daily experience in some way and thought to bring a book some time to read to her. are there any specific books/stories/collection of microstories that would be short or easy for her to follow? or does book length really matter so much as just being read to in general?any other ideas are certainly welcome."
"i am designing a stove/oven unit which would fit into the place of a normal kitchen range, for people living alone with early/moderate dementia, and/or vision or hearing issues.i want to bounce the idea off you guys.  the controls would be simple and visually self-explanatory.  buttons would be large so that they are easy to see and touch, even for someone with parkinson's.the stovetop would have two burners, not four (no one's cooking major meals here), button controls for each burner (h, m, l) and a timer (60 minute max) and off-button for each burner..the oven controls are on the front of the cooktop (well delineated from the cooktop itself by color or finish) above a side-opening oven with three well-labeled button options:  toast (max 10 minute timer), 350 and 375 degrees (max one hour timer).  there are prominent oven on and off buttons, and a visual (maybe mechanical) slider for timing the oven, up to 60 minutes.  the side-opening door would have a catch to hold it fully open so that it doesn't catch the user as they remove their meal, but is also easy to close.i am also considering a light bar and bell to notify when the oven cooking is complete.to go with it, a range hood that includes a smoke sensor and automatically triggering fire-suppression system.what do you think?  would you consider buying this product for your loved one?  i think it would also be useful for other situations, such as rec room/teen hangouts and offices.  any suggestions for improvement?"
"my mom is 57 (almost 58) and she has severe alzheimer‚Äôs. she was on medicaid but just recently she stopped qualifying (it‚Äôs a long story, not worth explaining why). basically i am now trying to figure out what to do next. does anyone here have experience with long term care insurance? what about getting insurance for someone else who already has serious impairments? will every company likely deny her??thank you!!"
"i had some friends over today (15yo guy here) and my dad was being weird. he kept saying ""freaking"" to my friends and even said ""ass.""i know that sounds super childish but 1) he never does this and 2) we are christian's and he has never cussed in front of my friends. i don't know if he was drunk but (he was hanging out with one of our neighbors and they usually have beer.) it was really weird and it was weirding me out. later on he asked my friend a couple questions he had already asked him today and even gave the same answers. does my dad have dementia? this really freaks me and makes me incredibly sad. thanks"
"my mil has undiagnosed dementia.  we are currently in the process of getting her screened.  the problem is that she has this jekyll/hyde thing going on, some days she is fine  but then others she becomes absolutely convinced she has a urinary tract infection.  the last 5 sundays she has insisted on being taken to the emergency room so she can get diagnosed.  the er workers are tired of seeing her, we are tired of taking her/trying to convince her she does not have one.  what (if anything) can we do to convince her that she does not have one?  it's so frustrating because she thinks we are trying to kill her by denying her medical care for something she does not have. thanks for reading."
"first, today was hard. periodt. i‚Äôm usually funny and thick skinned , not to brag, but today was extremely painful for me. i‚Äôm my dads poa and health care proxy as well as only daughter and he is a widower. he has been in a private facility that was at our cost for the past 2 years and i have no complaints there. sometimes it seemed the staff was over stretched and the residents could have been cared for better but it was rare i felt like that and regardless i appreciate the employees for the care and difficulty that their job brings. anyway, for financial and long term reasons i changed facilities today. ho boy was it a day. he was overwhelmed and agitated the entire time - cursing, yelling, threatening, it was a nightmare.  i think he will adjust to his new facility and it will be a good fit but wow today was hard. has anyone been through something similar? any advice or kind words help."
"hi all, please delete if this is not the right sub for this!my grandparents both have dementia and live with their daughter (my aunt) and my mom is close by to help out. my grandmother is just kind of living in her own bubble, going along with everything. my grandfather will swear up and down that he doesn't have dementia (he's actually diagnosed) and he's my main concern. he got violent and tried to choke my mother over a moldy cake around christmas. she opted to not take any legal action but elder services was involved. he is still living with my grandmother and aunt and i worry for their safety. he is creating a potentially volatile situation by claiming he is going to sell their second home which i live in and take care of. several years ago his name was removed from the deed to the house and it's now in my grandmother and mothers name. he does not seem to be aware of this situation and is planning to call a realtor and will eventually be informed that he has no legal claim to this house. i fear he may become violent again and possibly with my grandmother who is pretty frail. i live 3+hrs away and can't really be present, is there anything i can do beyond calling elder services? i feel like he may need to be placed in assisted living for everyone's safety but my mom and aunt are against it for some reason."
"my aunt has a habit of messing with the remote to the point of the staff having to reset her direct tv box daily. no one knows how she does it. she's gotten it stuck in spanish mode for days. she only speaks english.so, she needs a remote that just has volume, channel and on/off button. does anyone have suggestions on where to find something like that? i've looked on amazon and general search but i don't think i'm using the right filters. so far i haven't found anything of quality."
"i've found that parenthood has blessed me with the knowledge of using redirection in order to avoid a temper tantrum, whether it's for my daughter or for my dad. that being said, i'm curious if any of you have awesome prompts to help change the subject with your loved one with dementia when they start exhibiting  paranoia or ranting. i tend to use basic questions (dad, what's your favorite food? was the weather this hot when you were young?)"
i had a recent appointment with a new (to me) neurologist who stayed that dementia patients don't have good days.  i should only expect a downward slope of cognitive abilities.  is this true?
"right now i'm sleeping with my door locked, a knife in my bedside table and a baseball bat next to my bed. my dad is 83 and seems to be keying on my 81 year old mom. anyone with experience?"
"hello, i am concerned because i have been catching myself having irrational thoughts recently.  i am 26 years old, but i have had a handful of unrelated concussions in my life.  i had one just recently a week ago, but this is a problem i have been noticing for some time.as an example, just happened today:  i work on a big property.  i was planning on driving over to a storeroom.  i went to borrow my coworker's keys, but he was just about to run an errand of his own.  no problem, i thought, i will just bike over instead.  it took me a minute, on my way out, to realize that biking or driving over had nothing to do with the problem at hand:  he had the keys to the storeroom.  i am not sure why i thought biking vs driving would make a difference.i am scared, this is not the first time this has happened, every few weeks i will catch myself in some similar situation.  i have always been mildly forgetful, but over the last few months this has happened a handful of times.  i am not looking for specific medical advice, just a general opinion:  is this abnormal enough that something may be wrong?  i suspect that these kinds of brain farts do not happen to most people very often.  i have read up on the effects mild traumatic brain injury can have on long term brain health, so i am curious if i am experiencing early dementia symptoms.thanks for reading."
"i‚Äôve just come home to help my grandfather with my grandmother who was diagnosed 7 years ago.  i‚Äôve just thrown out all of the food that‚Äôs expired (2012 and 2015) but the hoarding situation is out of hand... in a 3 bedroom house every nook, wall and cranny is filled with vases, nicknacks, and my grandfather says that recently after her daughter died she‚Äôs started saving laundry detergent bottles, plastic silverware and to go plates from local restaurants when he brings dinner home. the most recent discussion led to me leaving to buy aspirin for my headache and her crying in the bedroom saying that ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt want to hurt the baby‚Äù which is me.. is there a way to delicately handle a situation like this without it ending with her in tears or yelling?"
"i posted here about a month ago about my mother, who has begun repeating questions and such.she saw a doctor and has a nurlogy appintment in nov.but now, i'm worried about myself. over the past few years, i've noticed that i am forgetting what people tell me sometimes. the major example is my best friend lives out of state. we talk on the phone every few weeks. and while i remember i spoke to him, i forget little details. i am a writer by trade, so, taking notes on our conversations didn't seem weird, but now, i think it might be.and just today, i was chatting with someone on snapchat. i said something and they responded like 30 minutes later. chats in snap disappear after while and i couldn't remember what i had said and so, my friends response didn't make sense. i had an idea of what i said, but i couldn't place it.so, my mother most likely has the disease. she's 65. her mother had it, began showing symptoms at 70. and i'm 29, and just kind of panicking.anyone have advice?"
"my mom (53) has always had less than stellar memory, but recently it's been worse. i'll ask her, for example, on wednesday if i can have a vehicle for plans being made for friday. by time friday comes around and i grab the keys and say bye, she'll ask me where i'm going and why like i never asked her on wednesday already. things like this have happened fairly frequently lately. what happened tonight was very concerning for me. i decided to leave for a bike ride, and she was sitting in the backyard as i left. a bit later i came back and passed her again on my way in. we didn't have a conversation but i walked right past her and she definitely would have noticed me. about an hour later, she came to my room and said something along the lines of ""that's where you are! i thought you were still biking."" should i be concerned?"
"my last grandparent (my nan) has dementia and asks us the same questions about every minute. usually requests for tea, wondering how old we are, asking when she's going home, etc. recently we've been told she has about two weeks to live as she is unable to eat and they've removed all meds except palliative ones. i've been visiting her about every two to three days although it never feels like enough and leaving feels like i'm the worst person in the world.one of the questions she's been asking is if she's dying. sometimes it's a statement. but what do/would you say to this? usually we say no and she forgets. sometimes my mum asks why she thinks that. yesterday she said because she's old and today she said because she could hear god.but what would you say? even knowing she's going to forget anyway i want to do right by her."
"had to put dad into a home a few months ago because he stopped eating. at the hospital he was diagnosed with lbd. at the time he was ok with going but now he calls every day asking for his car. i have told him multiple times that his doctors have told him he can't drive and discussed the disease with him, but he just blows it off and flips out. i try to distract and deflect, but i don't know if i am doing that right. how do you deal with the constant anger? "
"a few weeks ago, mum fell out of bed and broke her hip. since then she has gotten worse. she has dementia and now is refusing to eat or take any medication.the home has her on morphine for the pain, so she's very sleepy and confused.she has said to me and my brother that she's sorry and that she's going soon.she's now on palliative care and we're just waiting... for her to die.i find i'm ok most of the time, but sometimes it gets to me. i'll receive a simple message, next thing i know i'm crying.anyone else been through this, watching your parent die slowly?dad died two years ago quite suddenly of a heart attack. she says she's seen him recently, that we're lying and keeping dad from her."
"so my friend's grandma has dementia and she actually is doing relatively well so far. she can remember most things, but she constantly asks for something for her stomach. like every two to five minutes. it's driving their family crazy, because she knows she can't take anything she just keeps asking. they've tried giving her word searches and such to keep her mind occupied, but nothing seems to help. she's not healthy enough to do a whole lot and sitting around all day drives her crazy, is there anything that can help?"
"my grandmother has some issues with short term memory and isn't fully independent. she wears depends but does get up with her walker to go to the bathroom. however, a lot of days, especially if she's had enough water, she has accidents. she doesn't feel the urge to pee while she's comfortable in her chair. sometimes she has accidents on her way to the bathroom.part of my job as her part-time caregiver is to remind her to go!! but no matter how i try to phrase this suggestion, she is very stubborn and sometimes even gets insulted or angry. (she isn't the angry type - she is always very sweet.)i need some advice for how to remind my grandmother to use the bathroom.usually i might say something like, ""gram, has it been a while since you've been to the bathroom? ... could you try since it's a commercial break?"" another note: she feels ashamed when she has an accident and i don't want her to feel this way. i want to prevent this!"
"hello, i'd like to start with saying that i am new to the nursing field after quitting my college degree seeking in business and switching to pursue a degree in nursing. i currently work at an assisted living facility that also has its hospice licensing.working with patients with all types and severities of dementia and alzheimer's has been an eye opening experience- one that i've taken to heart to help the residents in the best way possible. that's certainly something i can't say some other cnas on staff care too much about.i have a particular patient that i'm unsure how to deal with and i was hoping someone here would have some advice for me on the best way to help her through her end of life.female, 96, severe dementia. constantly walking the halls of the facility entirely lost, constantly waiting for her sons or mother or husband. the issue is (and i'm sure some of you know what i mean) is that she can... switch personalities almost in seconds. one moment she will be sweet and sit and talk with you (despite it making no sense on your part). then it seems like she takes a deep breath and has a whole different look in her eye, she'll yell at you, spit at you, throw punches and kicks, call you horrible names, you name it.the question i have is that i know you should never tell a patient that so and so is dead and they won't see them again or that they are confused and that they're not going to go home and everything like that. but this resident will not allow you to change her, take her to the restroom (she is typically continent, but not always), put her to bed (i know that at least once she was up for close to 48 hours constantly roaming the halls). i know that her family wants the best care for her and i want to give that to her as well. i don't necessarily feel comfortable with what other cnas do where they force her to a wheelchair and bring her back to her room while she screams just to change her and shower her.does anyone have any advice? my manager has all but said do whatever you can, but make the facility look good. i'm just so new to this and am not sure what would be best.thank you in advance for any help!"
"my father is advancing through vascular dementia. for the last several months he will periodically begin breathing very shallow and rapidly, like a hyperventilating pant. it will come and go. when is goes on very long my mom can usually help him to regain normal breathing rhythm by having him focus on her and mimic her deep breathing pattern. this has been brought up with both his neurologist and cardiologist. neither were able to find a cause. yesterday he just wouldn't pull out of the pattern and mom took him to the emergency room. again, no physiological reason could be found. i have begun to wonder if the vascular nature of the disease could be affecting in the portion of his brain that controls respiration, and this issue is purely neurological. would there be any test that could definitely show this? what would be the physical effect if this is the case and he is increasing unable to respirate normally for long periods of time?"
"we've known for about a year that something was wrong. she has horrible short term memory, random migraines, black outs, and randomly loses her vision during bad migraines. she's seen multiple doctors but when we moved to our current location a doctor told her what he thinks.  earlier today she called me and told me that a loan got approved and what needs to happen before we pick it up, and 20 minutes later she calls and it's the same exact conversation.  it's frustrating and i'm not trying to show my frustrations. i'm scared shitless for my wife and what's inevitably going to happen. how does someone cope with this at such a relatively  young age?"
"my father was diagnosed with shrinkage of the brain. also known as frontotemporal dementia 8 years ago. although his doctors consider him to be in the advance stage of his illness, dad is able to speak well, sleep well, bathe and use the restroom on his own. the only time we see his symptoms really advance is when he takes medication for his enlarge prostate. he will suffer from insomnia, loses speech ability, loses control of his bowel movements. pain medications like percocet, and sleeping medications like ativan will cause him to also take his symptoms to an extreme stage. has anyone else experience this with someone that suffers from ftd? any info is appreciated."
"hello, i just came across this subreddit recently after finding out that not only has my girlfriend's grandpa been diagnosed with dementia, but my own grandmother as well. in light of the bad news, i hope to get them both a nice christmas gift that is functional, enjoyable, and thoughtful without being too in-your-face-you-have-alzheimer's kind of a gift. i'm looking to spend about $50-$100. please let me know if you have any ideas or know of any products that are good for alzheimer's. i was thinking of somethings like poker sets (card games improve brain activity), monopoly (same with board games), etc. **tl;dr what are some good christmas presents for people with alzheimer's?**"
"through education and work, my family moved around from country to country. i was young and made friends easily, dad had work, but mom didn't have a social network to lean on nor a base for any emotional support. i think, in that seclusion, my mother's depression was left unnoticed and untreated.11 years ago, i left home then she truly had no one...we all thought it was menopause 5 years ago, her mood swings and irritability... but things progressed worse, not better. her memory began to fail slowly. it started with being forgetful, then to telling me the same story over and over again. now, she cannot do simple math, such as adding change in her purse or tell time.  she doesn't see the point of living. in her words, ""today is no different from the last, and tomorrow will be the same"". her physical health deteriorated suddenly 15 months ago, where she experienced intense muscle cramps, dizziness, and could not get out of bed.the doctors can't make a diagnosis. all they can tell me is that it's not dementia, yet.for the past year she has been on a daily dose of:lexapro 10mgaricept 10mgneuromed 800mgher symptoms include: severe muscle cramps(not as often anymore), numbness in hand and legs, dizziness, suicidal behavior, moodiness, lack of motivation, depression, anxiety, disorientation, short-term memory, menopause, hot flashes, frustration, cognitive impairment, irritable, yawning, hyperventilation many of the symptoms seem like side effects of the drugs. any input would help... i just don't know what to do... has anyone else experienced better results with other medications??living on opposite side of the world, all i can do is make phone calls, visit once a year, and obsess over the medication."
"i‚Äôve been holding this in for years and never forgave myself for it. it‚Äôs been so hard to get it off my chest. when i was around 18, i was living with my dad/grandparents. i was an addicted to smoking weed, i know sounds dumb. i‚Äôd steal from my family and buy a lot of weed. my lowest point was stealing my grandpas ring right from him, he had dementia. i asked to see his ring, and after a few mins he had asked for it back, i played dumb like i didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about. he began looking for it knowing well that it was in my pocket. i went and pawned it off for some money. just a few weeks after this my grandpa had passed and my dad found out about it and said if i didn‚Äôt get it back he could never really forgive me. i went to the pawn shop and just to my luck the pawnshop had closed down for ever, i felt so sick to my stomach. going to the funeral with out the ring‚Ä¶ i died inside with him that day‚Ä¶ writing this has been very hard for me to do."
"we have multiple dogs. one is very old and has dementia. he is always walking around but his nails make so much noise on our floor. and everytime we want to cut his nails he starts trying to flee. everytime he sees someone walking down the street he starts barking so goddamn loud and he wont shut up, he starts trying to break open the door and when he is inside the garden he starts barking right next to them. but everyone know he doesn't bite so they pet him and then he shuts up. he always walks to my moms room to just, look at her and beg for food but when she trows him out he starts whining in front of the door for no reason. he is a very sweet dog, he never hurts anyone or anything. but i get so stressed out and anoyed by him i can't handle it anymore everytime i suggest to the rest of the familly if we can let him be put to sleep everyone starts yelling at me that he's part of the familly. that's about it, thanks for reading."
"my mother quit her job about 5 years ago to take care of my dad who can‚Äôt function on his own. he‚Äôs only 56 but we suspect he‚Äôs in the 6th stage of alzheimer‚Äôs. i dropped out of college to help them because my other has her own problems, but there isn‚Äôt much we can do for him. he‚Äôs always yelling and causing issues and we have to help him do every single task from bathing to eating. we have tried to get in home nurses or some kind of care but we have been turned down every time. i feel like i lost my father years ago and he is just a shell now. i wouldn‚Äôt want to live that way. i hope he dies peacefully and i know it will be hard, but  i know i will not be able to move on with my life until he dies."
"a little background:i'm the caregiver of both my maternal grandparents. my grandmother is still a bit independent but still requires a lot of patience and work. my grandfather on the other hand has: prostate cancer (very advanced, was given a year two years ago), advanced dementia, diabetes, blood pressure problems, had his leg amputated and is bedridden.i used to help my mother but recently she fell down and dislocated her shoulder, since then i'm basically doing everything plus working. i've been fortunate enough to not lose my job since the covid pandemic, but i'm starting to lose my mind and temper.i was raised in an overprotective and fairly conservative household so i never got to really enjoy my youth. i'm 29 right now and i have a whole host of mental and social problems because of this. i haven't been able to find a decent paying job since i entered the workforce so i haven't been able to move out, and my economic prospects don't look good at all (even worse now with the fallout of the pandemic).i can't do this anymore, i'm at the end of my rope. i've always had a love/hate relationship with religion but since this shit storm (pun intended) i've pretty much lost all faith. i wonder why a loving god would leave a shell of a man that can't even control his sphincters to keep suffering.i feel so bad and conflicted about it, but nothing would make me happier than if he died; does that make me a horrible person? i don't know and probably don't care. my life is a joke.thanks to anyone who takes some time to read this."
"this will be our first christmas with dad since he was diagnosed with dementia, and he is quickly losing his memories and grip on reality. he also has parkinson's, so using his hands and walking are becoming difficult for him. i'd like gift recommendations to help keep him comfortable and/or help with his memory.his interests before dementia: cars in general, star wars, sci-fi shows and movies, the band ac/dc, playing pool and cards, and the army. but over the past 6 months, he hasn't shown the ability to enjoy or interact with these things. he mostly stays lost in his mind. any advice would be appreciated."
my dad has parkinson‚Äôs with dementia and my mom and i help take care of him. recently he‚Äôs been really acting up and i‚Äôm starting to feel so overwhelmed. he keeps thinking people are ‚Äúafter him‚Äù and recently punched the tv and managed to fuck up the pixels because the people in the tv were ‚Äúafter him‚Äù i don‚Äôt know how much longer i can do this because tomorrow it‚Äôs like none of this happened and his mind hits a reset button and has no memory of it all. i feel like i‚Äôm giving up on him but i know it‚Äôs becoming like he needs professional help and i just can‚Äôt give that to him.
"this is my first night where i really had to step away - i've got an alzheimers father who just pissed himself and is just walking around cursing, and i've spent the last 24 hours awake taking care of a 77yo mother with food poisioning who is not able to get to the toilet fast enough so i've been cleaning up vomit and diarrhea all today.  i'm 49 single unemployed childless and don't have any real friends or support, and neither do they. sorry to vent but i also need some kind of help- i've never had to deal with any of this before because they both tried to be self reliant and kept saying i didn't need to worry about their problems.... but it turned out neither of them bothered to do anything besides get kaiser and medicare and then just wait for someone to tell them what to do. like a fool i let them get away with that and its become too much.  now i'm expected to step in and deal with one with dementia and one who is too sick to plan or decide or even know if she can go to the bathroom.  i think i need some kind of in-home care help, but will they come for emergencies like this when i need them or am i expected to juggle this myself?  will they deal with my parents filthy hoarder house or do i need to fight my mother to get that cleared up beforehand? what should i ask for? i had an assessment meeting with a geriatrics nurse from kaiser and nothing got done- it was like we werent asking the right questions.i'll get through tonight and learn how to deal with faeces everywhere like a new parent,  but what should my first step be as soon as the crisis is over? where do i start?"
"i currently live with an older man who is visually impaired, has family history of dementia and has been a chronic alcoholic for 20 years now. in exchange for watching out for him, taking him to doctor's appointments, paying his bills, filing his taxes, not literally stealing from him like his previous roommates have, i get free rent in a relatively big city in the us. every so often he gets poop all over the bathroom, i have cleaned it up in the past, but i am quite literally done with that s\*\*\*, and am planning to move out anyways. my question is are there cleaners in a large city that would clan this sort of thing? it is very bad. he has received warnings from the building that they will kick him out if his bathroom stays like that. he has money from social security and investments (that his late mother made) in oil, which is very high right now, so money is not the issue. i would like some advice as to what to do, i do not want him to get kicked out, as frustrating as the poop issue is."
"hi all, i know i've posted a few times lately but this community has been so very helpful and makes me feel hopeful. hope you dont mind sharing more advice.my dad lives with a traumatic brain injury and dementia. he has lived with me for three months since his wife passed. he has only had mental health services for the past two months without any mental health care ever before.dad's old primary care doctor certified his application for state disability insurance, citing ""dementia secondary to brain trauma, memory loss, unable to perform adls, needs supervision."" we have no other formal diagnosis.my siblings and i really need to build a pathway for social security but i am worried that we just don't have enough mental health evidence at this point. his head trauma is well documented by his old primary care, but memory issues, his erratic home behaviors, and declining daily living activities are not.in therapy sessions, he portrays a person wildly different than the unregulated, angry, and volatile person at home and i feel i have no way to get my observations onto health records.how can i ensure we are building evidence of his mental health for the social security application? a supervising psych said that we might need 6 months of records for social security app. i am worried especially because i just don't think i can take much more of this but dont want our application to be denied.it's very important for me to finish grad school in october after 2 quarters absent. i want to apply for social security well before then and get dad into an adult living facility by then. i am sorry if that sounds cold but i am now certain i don't have the tools to give my dad the proper care he requires. i also need to recommit to my own goals and try to sustain myself.any of your advice is much appreciated!!"
"it   was my second shift with a patient w/ dementia as a caregiver and it   was really really frustrating :/. i worked with another caregiver to   change their briefs, etc. and the whole time the patient was screaming   but we had to change it because it was dirty/soiled. after this, they   forgot who i was and told me that two workers hit them ""last night"" and   it made me upset that the experience was seemingly really traumatic for   them (also the risk of getting into trouble for a little thing). and   then an hour later i think they forgot but still felt sad/stressed and   it just upset me out so much. i vented to a caregiver and they said the   patient is basically always like that because they hate being changed   but it makes me so sad that this is normal. just wanted to vent :/"
"my dad is showing very early signs of dementia... using one word to replace another word, taking really long pauses to remember something. time passes very quickly for him. he easily gets stuck on a task and doesn't realize how long it takes. he easily getting confused especially online about online websites (what is accurate and inaccurate)  he's getting more hostile about his opinions and has even made mention of all this. my dad has been going down hill since my mom had a paralyzing stroke in 2016, she passed away this december. there hasn't been a major change but it is really starting to show. he's even made mention of it. he has brought it up to the doctor who thinks its all depression/ stress related, which it could be but he refuses to take anything other than depression medication he has been on years prior because he 'doesn't feel right"" if he takes anything else. he's always been narcissistic and demanding but now it's gotten to the point i can't even enjoy my time with him because he it seems like any time i find joy in something we do together he abruptly stops and goes onto something else, that he knows i don't like. i've discussed this with him and he says that i am the problem. he wants me over though every second i get and when i show up he ignores me, when i tell him i'm leaving he gets mad that i don't stay longer (and i always stay all day 11a-(as late as 10pm) we've gotten into a lot of heated arguments the last few weeks and now i'm the bad guy because i don't approve of everything he does, or i don't agree with him."
"i just had an existential crisis today.  i was folding some clothes for one of my recipients/patients while she was watching tv.  suddenly, she starting singing some country and western song almost at the top of her voice.  it kind of scared me.  she has never done this before but she does have alzheimer's.she really isn't that much older than i am but i started thinking, ""is this going to be me someday?""  anybody else ever had such thoughts?   ; ("
"i just started caring for a 85 years old women who's in the first stade of alzheimer. my task is to stimulate and entertain her, but i don't really know what activities i could do with her. we played cribbage without much difficulties, so it's clear that's she's still there intellectually. any ideas? :)"

"so long story short, i am in a relationship with a girl who is her moms caregiver. her mom has dementia and was diagnosed in 2012. we were two years into our relationship when this happened. we were both in school in another city and gave it all up to move home and help out. fast forward to present day and i have a solid job making enough to cover both our expenses so she doesn‚Äôt have to work so she can focus on her mothers care. we don‚Äôt do anything anymore and i am beginning to lose my mind. my friends are planning a trip to go visit another friend who just moved across the country and want me to join. girlfriend is now guilt tripping me about going and i feel horrible about leaving for a week, but should i? just looking for some opinions, maybe someone been through the same."
"my dad has dementia and is bedridden. he thinks he can walk and is healthy but he is not. my dad can't sit still and try to get out of the bed about ten times a day. when he gets out of the bed, he falls on the floor and i have to pick him up.  when i ask him ""where is he going?"" and he said he is going home. the thing is that we are at home.  if i say  that we are at home, he asks more questions or gets aggressive. he does not listen to what i am telling him. the only thing i can say is that my mom is going to take him home later. he calms down and then tries to get out of bed 15 minutes later.i am burnt out when dealing with him.  i need tips on how to talk to him."
"i don't know what i'm asking here but maybe just looking for support or advice. my parents are not that old yet but i'm worried about them. my dad [62] has a very poor diet and since retiring a couple of years ago is extremely forgetful and refuses to try new things to keep his brain engaged. he mostly just watches tv. his mom died in her 70s due to dementia and i'm worried it's happening even sooner for him.also, my mom [60] has a poor diet and doesn't exercise. her mom died in her 70s as well, but while her brain was sharp her body was weak. i fear the same thing will happen with my mom soon. when we go on walks on the trail, she gets out of breath before even walking a mile. and she has that old people smell i associate with elderly people but she's only 60 years old.any tips for how to help them improve their health? or has anyone else had similar experiences with their parents even when they're barely 60? i want them to live as long as possible but they don't seem interested in changing their lifestyles to a healthier one."
"i've posted a few times asking for help and wanted to share some good news for once. we had moved my mother to a nursing facility and she went downhill pretty quick. assumed it was the dementia/alzheimer's progressing, she was ornery and never got out of bed or spoke with anyone really. tho she was talking with dead people.after 4 months we moved her to another facility and within 3 days, she's almost back to being my mother again. the previous facility apparently had her on 3 different anti-depressants, so not a good thing. today (4th day), she's actually going to eat lunch in the dining room, sounds simple, but i'm in tears. so happy she's getting out of bed and trying to live again. amazing how a high rated facility can be so bad. just glad we moved her and didn't keep believing the bs we were being told."
myself and my siblings are so frustrated and yes mad. my mother has what seems to be dementia /beginning alzheimer. she knows she has issues. my dad (who isn't in the best of health) does everything for her and the house.she makes him cancel any doctor appointment she has.what have any of you done in this situation? we can't force her to get help as she still has some mental capabilities
"he lives in another state and is showing early signs of dementia, but he refuses to come and live with me and my family. he lives alone in a rather rural setting, so he has to drive to get anywhere. i‚Äôve posited all kinds of solutions (uber, his county‚Äôs council on aging offers transportation, or again, he could come live with me or at least in my city). he refuses all suggestions for one reason or another and after having a very blunt conversation with him, i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to stop driving willingly. how do i take the keys away?"
"i'm ashamed to admit that we've noticed the decline for a few years now.  we only finally addressed it recently because she got lost walking to a hair appointment 2 blocks from her house. (in a very familiar area).i've avoided the conversation for a couple years because its very hard to tell someone you love that they aren't as sharp as they once were.  and when her siblings tried addressing it, she would get defensive.but after the getting lost mishap, i finally talked to her and we had her first docs appt yesterday.  there is bloodwork scheduled to rule out vitamin deficiency or hormone issues , an mri, and an appointment with a neurologist. so at least we finally have the ball rolling.her mental decline has included, inability to balance checkbook, count money, poor perception of time, poor response to texts and calls even though she is always starring at her phone.i'm hopeful that there is some explanation for this that is not early dementia.i know for a fact shes very depressed, doesn't have a purpose now that my brothers and i have moved out and she doesn't eat well or exercise. i'm hopeful it could be depression, or a hormone issue or something. it would break my heart if its dementia but she struggled to repeat a sentence back to the doctor and that scares me."
"you know how some health conditions like dementia, mental illness, etc. makes the person you give care to an unreliable narrator? when someone feels a lot of shame and guilt over it, which frankly is valid if they have ignored doc‚Äôs advice for decades and was determined to use wrong methods to self care.            then view you telling others about their health conditions as bringing shame to the family or personally insulting them, exposing them to public judgment.                                           but if you don‚Äôt explain how serious the issue is, people start to accuse you of failing in your own life when you‚Äôre truly pushed to the brink because they misbehaved to their other kids or relatives for decades so they‚Äôre all reluctant to incur their wrath anymore. what strategies have you implemented to quickly relate the seriousness of an invisible health condition so you‚Äôre not misunderstood? considering that there has been a history of pathological lying and smears behind your back that‚Äôre so persistent and intricate, that you were utterly shell shocked when you found out and had to go for therapy to get to a good place yourself? but now find that your better health is weaponised back to say how you should do even more. it becomes a cruel joke of how your well-being is always secondary and your sacrifices is minimised as if it didn‚Äôt mean anything. thanks"
"guys, i have a chromebook and i was just writing a five page rant on caregiving and it went down. so instead off all the small things that have been adding up and making me go crazy i would like to thank you for all your support. my mom no longer has the bowel issues, and the surgeon approved her sleeping medicine for this month and we are still trying to hurry up her psychiatrist referral but that will take one day at a time. the surgeon also scheduled a date for pre-op and the actual kidney surgery. we have a full day tomorrow. i have a two day vacation with my so to a resort not far from home that my family is not super happy with but i am taking it. on to not so great news, my mom is starting to get really overwhelmed and kinda confused. i am going to ask that she get a neurological evaluation to make sure she doesn't have dementia or that there was any time of brain damage when she fell (concussion, ect). i figure better safe than sorry. i am also going to ask for a hearing test because she is always asking me to repeat things and sometimes that can give the symptoms of confusion. thank you to everyone!"
"i've never made a post on reddit before but i need a place to vent and i want to know if anyone has experienced something similar. i'm a 19 college student and have been a caregiver at a facility for people with dementia for 5 months now. i only work a few days a week. this is my first job and i thought i signed up for handing out bingo cards or something but not at all. this last month 6 residents passed away and so did my dog. my back hurts worse and worse after each shift, i've been thinking too deeply, i'm crying easily, and i can never sleep after work. i love old people and feel good about contributing to society in a meaningful way but this is a really rough job. today i was spending time with a resident who was in a good mood through the day. we danced a little, played with a balloon, and she was giving me these big smiles. i had a few thoughts flash through my mind about how she'll probably pass away soon and how much suffering these residents go through. how can i deal with this?"
"hi. i‚Äôve posted a few times in this forum and appreciate the perspective you‚Äôve shared. my father has a 6-12month prognosis after going through treatment for stage iv cancer. he also is an expatriate with a home in asia. he wants to go there to die. but that means surviving a 22 hour flight. he‚Äôs a diabetic and takes food through a gtube. he also wears diapers. he‚Äôs starting to show signs of dementia and he‚Äôs never been an easy personality even in good health so it‚Äôs guaranteed to be a difficult task.my husband and i are willing to escort him home (to asia), but i‚Äôm not sure how to fly with him. how do you change someone‚Äôs diapers on a plane? will the airline let me bring glucerna onboard? he can‚Äôt walk without a walker, how do you get in and out of a plane?does anyone have any experience  traveling with elderly or disabled individuals that is willing to share how you manage?"

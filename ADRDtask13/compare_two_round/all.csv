"my father's family has early onset - he lost his father and oldest brother, is currently watching two other siblings with symptoms, and his 23andme showed he is heterozygous (predisposed) for one of the key early onset genes. (disclosure, i am a phd geneticist, i know what this means, please don't try to follow up on the genetics diagnosis).what i am worried about is that he is clearly divesting of hobbies - he gave up on buying his dream convertible even when he had one in hand, he is selling his hobby tractor that he only got 5 years ago, he refused meeting me on an international trip because he was specifically worried about his ability to travel on his own. how can i convince my father not to give up on his life just because he thinks he has alzheimers?"
"in one of her moments of clarity (as i call them), she asked, ""what is up next for me?  where am i supposed to go from here?""  i think she meant, ""is the only thing i have to look forward to . . . my own death?""i didn't know what to say.   i see now that i could try to distract her from her depression, but i still feel dishonest.  she sometimes talks about what she'll do ""when she gets better.""    it breaks my heart.  what can i say to her?  "
"my grandma fell a while back and broke her hip and since has had to live in our house and be taken care of full time. she can't stand or walk and she can't really do small things with her hands (but she does do crosswords and scratch tickets). i'm not really close with her and she doesn't really remember who i am so it's a little awkward whenever i try to sit and talk with her. basically because she is in her room all day (she gets a lot of anxiety moving from room to room as she has always been an extreme recluse) she has nothing to do but look through magazines (she doesn't read) and do scratch tickets and cross words. but are there other things that will make her not so lonely? i don't really understand alzhiemer's other than she was diagnosed with it and it affects her memory, but sometimes when i peek in on her to see how she's doing she's just staring off into space, blankly. i just wish i could think of things to keep her occupied and not be so bored and lonely."
"i lived with a sweet old couple for a couple months a little while ago. the husband has dementia and his wife was taking care of him.she used to tell me stories about her husband - his success, intelligence, and general business acumen. i could feel the heart break behind her words as her husband had clearly deteriorated over the years to resemble less and less of the person she described..getting alzheimers/dementia honestly terrifies me. as far as i know, it doesn’t run in my family from my dad’s side.but my mum was estranged from her family at birth, and i don’t know if it runs in her family.i’m 34. is there something i can start doing now to lessen the risks of getting it later?"
"my grandmother has dementia, and she is constantly saying unkind things about herself. she says she is fat, doesn't deserve kindness, is dumb. what can i do about these sorts of comments? if it were only occasional then it would be ok, but she is in a loop here.thank you"
"hi everyone, i just sought out this subreddit tonight for the first time, so please forgive me if i shouldn’t be posting here. this post concerns my mother. she does not have an official diagnosis of dementia or alzheimer’s. i’ve been reading the other threads on here about what some of you are going through as caregivers for your family or loved ones and my heart goes out to you all.my mother (77yo) is currently in the hospital for the past ten days with symptoms related to her heart and a uti. she has been very confused, disoriented and agitated in the hospital. her doctor referred to her behavior as “sundowning,” but i’ve only ever heard this term used to refer to alzheimer’s and dementia. she’s been in the hospital for so long, and medically speaking she could already have been discharged, since she completed a round of antibiotics and her heart is now stable. however, they’re still struggling to stabilize her moods and behavior. i guess i’m wondering: is my mother on her way to being diagnosed with alzheimer’s or dementia?"
"my father has been hiding his dementia until recently- my mother has a sound mind and kept him straight, though she is now in and out of hospitals due to multiple myeloma and is unable to help him.we have realized while he tries to take care of her, that he over does her medication (multiple pain medications) to potentially dangerous levels. they have a live in care taker who cannot help dose medications. we limit the amount of pain medication in the house at one time and we are using pill boxes now. my father is mixing up percocet and oxycontin and then forgetting he has dosed her and goes to dose her again in his lapse. my father is refusing to allow me or my siblings to help more in these situations, is there anything we can do or suggestions for our situation?"
"my husband has been diagnosed with small vessel disease after a lacunar stroke.  he has had uncontrolled high blood pressure for at least 20 years (he's 54), and i can now recognize at least 2 of these strokes that went undiagnosed in the past due to differences between lacunar and other stroke symptoms. also, his personality has gone through an ugly metamorphosis that has alienated him from his children and others.  all were obvious signs if i'd known what to look for, but instead i felt our relationship had evolved into him being mentally and emotionally abusive.   i know his mri shows multiple past lacunar infarcts and hyperintensitites, but the hospital doctors seemed very withholding with any information past acknowledging he'd had a stroke and has small vessel disease.  he was sent on his way with instructions to see his primary care physician to get a neurology referral, as if he is has full cognitive functioning.   now home, my husband is in denial about his diagnosis.  he says things that seem doubtful (his doctor friend told him he has at least another 20 good years?), and exhibits a great many worrisome behaviors.  i feel very afraid, helpless, and frankly, crazy.  i could use advice if you've been in this position or if you have any knowledge/information that can help me through this."
"my dad has always really enjoyed kids and especially babies. from when i was a kid, he's the guy who would make funny faces and wave and interacted with little ones. completely innocent, he's always had a huge heart and babies and toddlers make him happy. but now as the dementia advances, the filters come off and he can't read social cues as well as before. when he's out, if he spots a child, he really wants to interact with them,  just really focuses on them.most of the time, the parent is ok, and if i'm with him i can sort of re-direct him if it looks like the kid or the parent might think it's getting weird. but i worry so much that one day while he's out by himself it's going to be mis-understood and a parent is going to think his attention is inappropriate or creepy. i could totally see how it might look bad, someone will call authorities and it could just be a huge mess.i don't know if this is anything that requires advice, maybe i'm just wondering about ways to deal? talking to him won't work, he won't remember even if he understood what i was asking of him, which he won't.this fucking disease sucks the joy out of everything."
"she lives alone, she's fine physically. our main struggle with with medicine administration since we can't be there all the time. our main concern is leaving the hospital with narcotics.the hosiptal is saying there is nothing we can do unless we wanted to privately pay for assisted living temporarily, which we could in no way afford. and that we would need to go administer them if we were worried, we can't be there for all dosages.&amp;#x200b;does this sound right to anyone with experiece?&amp;#x200b;what  would the hospital do if we weren't in her life, still kick a known dimentia paitent out with a lethal does of narcotics in their hand? if so, that's appaling. if not, what options do we have?"
"i'm having trouble finding words that aren't blunt or harsh to say to my mother when she says she can just go live back in her house.  she's almost 89 and is in the early stages of dementia.  she told me today that she wants to save the money memory care is costing her by moving back to her house.  i want to be kind and not distress her, but seriously this is not an option.  who's got some nice sound bites they use for their parent that they will share?  any favorite distraction tactics to get her off the topic?  thanks in advance :)"
"a moment of peace.my grandma who i call “ita” short for “abuelita”, has had dementia for a while now. over the past few months, her mental capacity and sense of reality has plummeted extremely fast. she lives with me and my parents...she has for years. it’s been extremely hard to watch the once strong, loving, and goofy lady we all know and love quickly diminish into a different and empty person. my grandma has a mountain of health problems and with how vulnerable her health is, i’ve been keeping my distance and not giving her hugs like i used to... i don’t want to get her sick. we’re losing her very quickly and i don’t want to regret not spending time with her in her final days, only giving her waves and loving her from afar. i walked over to her, gave her a big hug, and greeted her. she actually remembered who i was, smiled at me, and told me that i am her healing. i’m what made her feel happy. words cannot describe how i feel right now. it’s nice to cry happy tears for once."
"feeling so overwhelmed caring for my mother. she’s 74 and has vascular dementia. i’m 31, and have given up my entire life to take care of her. constantly worried how ill ever rebuild and can’t sleep at night due to the financial concerns — i literally can’t afford for her to decline and she has no retirement savings. how does anyone afford getting old these days? oh man..."
"so i have been a professional care giver for about five years now.  i have worked with various disabilities both physical and intellectual, terminal diseases, brain injuries, dementia.  i also have worked with people of all ages from children to geriatrics.  i now currently work with three men in their 20s who all have disabilities.after reading about me before you, i'm very uncomfortable about how much people are taking to this story.  i find it very disturbing that any hired caregiver would start a romantic relationship with the individual he/she is working with.  not only does the person she works with have a disability, but also is battling depression and has attempted suicide.  to me, this would be the same as starting a romantic relationship with a person in a psych facility for suicidal ideation.  being a caregiver who mainly works with the male population i pray that the family members do not compare this character to me.  i take my job very seriously and i do care about the guys i work with, however i would never push those boundaries. also for any of those familiar with the story, is lou hired help from a home health care service?  how is she not concerned about losing any licenses or certifications for sexual abuse?  i'm very concerned about the effect a movie like this is going to cause and i am interested to see if anyone else feels the same way."

"why is it so hard for people to just send a quick text asking how you are? i go months without hearing from old friends and in the rare instance they do pop up they quickly go back to ghosting me as soon as they find out that, oh, grandma still has dementia and, no, things have not improved. even family who occasionally visits will tell my husband and i that things are worse than they realized, thank us for our work, and say we need to start a rotation before going awol for another 6 months. my husband and i have no friends and are stuck as caretakers because we can't afford to move, we've just passed the year mark and my mom and uncle have finally stepped in a little bit to at least try to get a diagnosis and talk about long term care solutions but we're so beyond burned out. i would give anything just to hear a friend say they're thinking about me. how do you cope with realizing the people who stood by you at your wedding are only fair weather friends?"

"my dad has dementia, and we are trying to get him placed in nursing home (as advised by doctor and social worker).my dad is living on his own (and has been for years), but he isn’t really safe anymore on his own. also, he will soon be evicted for behavior (trespassing, littering, and disturbing neighbors). i am worried he won’t be accepted, and if he isn’t, what do i do? i am a graduate student with a wife and kid (1 year old). i can’t have him living with us, but i can’t throw him on the streets. what will i do?"

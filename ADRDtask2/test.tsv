My name is Ann.	0
My team and me are working on a 3-headed electric toothbrush which effectively cleans teeth without any complicated movements needed.	0
We plan to adapt it for people with special needs and eldery health issues.	0
It cleans teeth without any efforts and complicated proper movements, because the toothbrush has 3 heads, that cover the tooth from all sides at the right angle and with the right pressure.	0
You just need to move it from tooth to tooth.	0
Since the brush cleans immediately 3 sides of the tooth, it cleans much faster.	0
If you have any info about what should we take into account to make the toothbrush as effective as possible for people with special needs, please, click on the link below to answer some questions.	0
I would highly appreciate if you could help us.	0

I've been living with my grandfather for 4 months as his caregiver.	0
When I moved in he would take 1 or 2 showers per week, but now I'm lucky if I get him to take one once every 2 weeks.	0
I'm sure this is a common problem in this community (I'm very new at this lol), and was wondering if anyone had success with certain strategies.	0

He is extremely bored all the time and I want to find things for him to do.	0
Right now he pretty much just watches tv.	0
The problem is we have gotten him word searches (his favorite pre-alz), easy puzzles, simple games, etc but he refuses to use them.	0

When he called, he was told they upgrade plans.	0
He argued with them and they took off the charges.	0
I followed up to see why they were upgraded to the next package.	0
The cable clerk explained that if you click on a channel not in your plan, the system prop asks if you'd like to upgrade by clicking again.	0
This is what happened and between my mom and my stepfather, who struggles with the tv remote, I'm surprised it hasn't happened before.	0

Please check your tv, this is such an easy mistake for those with Alzheimers (and even without)!	0

Yes, it's a very interesting exhibition, you should go, I know you like that sort of stuff.'	0
My mum on the other hand is like:Remember we went last week?	0
We went together and you said xyz.'	0
Which approach is correct?	0

This is a terrible disease.	0
The only plus side I see is that it's happening so late in life and that she had 86 good years.	0

Either way, are there any locks that you'd recommend?	0
We've decided to lock all of the cupboards and the fridge, leaving her snack cabinet open with her food for the day.	0
She is in the late stages of alzheimers, and every night she asks me Have you ever been here before?	0
And I say of course and explain to her that we are still in the town we have lived in for over half a decade, which just confuses her and then she will ask again in a minute or two.	0
My question is what can I do to make her realize that she is home?	0

I know I am not supposed to argue or disagree, but I can't fathom just saying oh well, when she says stuff like that.	0
Hi,My grandfather has Alzheimers, and lately, he's been overfeeding his dog to an alarming degree.	0
The dog, Princess, is quite old and already very overweight.	0
One single bag of treats is supposed to last at least a month and a half.	0
Last week, he fed her two entire bags.	0
My grandmother has tried telling him that he can't do that, but he's just not understanding (which, of course, is not his fault).	0
Hiding the treat bags won't do any good, as he'll just drive to the store and buy more on his own.	0
Princess isn't in the greatest health and we're all worried about the effects that my grandfather overfeeding her will have, but there isn't much we can do to stop him from doing it.	0
Does anybody have any ideas as to how we should go about handling this?	0
Hi; my dad has early onset Alz (diagnosed at 56, 5 years ago) and is still in the moderate stages.	0
Does anyone have suggestions for a simple toy or activity my family could give him for the holidays?	0
He’s still very aware of/embarrassed by his forgetfulness and challenges so I want to find something that isn’t too obviously designed for children, like some of the Alz “toys” I’ve seen.	0
We have an Alexa system for him to listen to music and podcasts, but he’s had a lot of nervous energy lately and needs something to do with his hands.	0
He was diagnosed a few years ago and has progressively gotten worse, he would always talk about the old days but mix it up with some current events, now it seems he doesn't remember anything but the past.	0
I talk with him daily and he repeats himself a lot, sometimes the same thing every 20 seconds for 5 minutes.	0
When he does this I don't interject, I let him repeat himself.	0
Is this the right thing to do?	0
I feel like it is but I'm not sure.	0
My mother has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's, and I know a lot about the disease, but nothing about how she is able to support herself while living with it in her later stages.	0
If you guys don't mind, I'll list some of my questions below (we are in Ohio for reference).	0
How would she be able to support herself when she is no longer able to work?	0
She has no retirement or savings, and disability will not let you file and make a livable wage at the same time.	0
She didn't recognize me for the first time while visiting.	0
How could I help her from suffering through that scare again?	0
What could I do to help her?	0
The internet hasn't given me many options, if there are any.	0
Three generations of us can’t figure out how to convince my 86 year old great nana (late stage) to take a bath.	0
She needs one in the worse way.	0
She’s lived with us for months and has yet to take one.	0
She’s getting smelly but either can’t smell anything or doesn’t care or doesn’t know that it’s her.	0
She gets SO upset whenever we bring it up.	0
It’s not like we can force her.	0
Please... how can any of us convince her?	0
Any ideas at all?	0
Late last year my boyfriend's mother was diagnosed with dementia.	0
Early onset Alzheimer's runs in her family.	0
She is still relatively with it, as she recognizes most people and can talk about her day.	0
Last week she had a stroke.	0
Her memory took a hit.	0
She's having trouble recalling certain words and her delusions are worse.	0
She still recognizes us, but it frustrates her when she doesn't remember details or who else visited her that day.	0
She's still convinced she'll get better one day.	0
She's retired, but her husband is not, so she spends most days alone with a few people coming to check on her or give her medications.	0
Boyfriend and I visit every other day to make sure she takes her pills and eats.	0
She ideally needs 24/7 care, but it's not financially possible right now.	0
She told us that during the day, she has nothing to think about.	0
She spends most of her time watching TV, and she's starting to have trouble remembering how to make it play what she wants.	0
She used to be interested in arts and crafts, but it was always socially.	0
I don't know if her fine motor skills are intact.	0
I'm worried if she doesn't have anything to do she won't improve at all or she'll decline faster.	0
I plan to cook with her next time we see her.	0
She lit up when I suggested it and went to find some recipes.	0
Otherwise I'm not sure what we could do.	0
I really want something that encourages her mind to work.	0
TDLR: if anyone has advice on activities we can give a woman with early onset Alzheimer's, to do alone or with us, it would be greatly appreciated.	0
Or any advice at all on how to support my boyfriend and his family through this difficult time, resources, ect.	0
Hello all,My father was asked by his neurologist to not drive any more this past August.	0
He disagrees with this and feels his driving is fine.	0
I’m on the fence.	0
He scares me a bit, but I’ve definitely been with worse drivers.	0
The language in my dad’s after visit report says, “Please do not drive.	0
If you’d like a formal drivers test, the DMV is free. I have two questions:- I have heard that because he has this diagnosis and recommendation in his medical record, if he got in an accident, they could be sued and lose everything.	0
It would be a good argument for him to stop driving.	0
How do i get a DMV test scheduled?	0
I’ve called, searched their website, stopped in.	0
No one has any idea what I’m talking about.	0
I want to schedule him for a drivers test to make sure he’s safe.	0
They tell me he isn’t due for a test for a few years.	0
(We live in Wisconsin)Note: he’s willing to take a DMV test.	0
He wants to prove that he’s safe.	0
My MIL went to visit a relative for a few weeks so that partner and I could get respite.	0
Unfortunately, her hair never got combed or brushed and is now matted.	0
It's waist length and there are knots all the way up and at the base of her skull.	0
I'm worried that this may be bad for her health, I don't want her getting a fungus under there.	0
We tried soaking it with coconut oil last night and combing it, but we couldn't get all of the knots out and she refuses to help.	0
She got quite agitated, threatened to hit us, and was yelling about it.	0
I can't think of anything else but to cut the knots out, but I think this may mean using clippers on the back of her head.	0
Her hair has been her pride and joy for her entire life and I don't want to take this from her, but I don't know what else to do, I think it will only get worse from here.	0
Any tips, either on getting tangles out or how to go about cutting it?	0
She's adamant that she won't have her hair cut.	0
my mum, on 8th year of alz, is usually on the bed or wheelchair.she rarely walks and if she does, it requires multiple ppl.	0
Are there any exercises to strengthen her legs or i should just aim to have her walk a little more each day?	0
Basically, my 84 year old grandmother is wearing my mother down.	0
We live in the same house, which is split.	0
My Grandma has a basic apartment to herself as she is still able to manage herself to a degree.	0
Her memory for things has greatly declined, and yesterday she pretty much forgot who her eldest daughter was when my mother (second of 4 siblings) reminded my grandma.	0
She insists that she continues to have a phone.	0
Demands a cell phone or a landline.	0
We have gone through quite a few of each.	0
A flip phone with basic tech to big buttoned land lines.	0
She cannot grasp how technology works anymore.	0
She comes out and gets angry, throws fits saying how she wants a land line you have a land line grandma, how she doesn't understand after we explain it both verbally and in written form.	0
We write extremely legible and simple instructions, that she never follows.	0
After these confrontations my mom is in tears of frustration and sadness.	0
There's more to my grandma's fading world, but right now my focus is on tech.	0
Could anyone who has experienced similar suggest anything with a voice command option?	0
has Alexa or an echo worked, something that requires no pushing of buttons as she has a light touch and claims to press buttons but ends up turning the phone off in the end.	0
Any help would be greatly appreciated.	0

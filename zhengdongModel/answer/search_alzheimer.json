    "question": "Do many in the USA believe that Joe Biden has Alzheimer's? ",
    "link": "https://globalpolitics.quora.com/",
    "answer": "Those who claim Joe Biden has Alzheimer's disease have no idea what it is. There's a saying that Alzheimer's isn't forgetting where you left your keys, it's forgetting what they are for. The many people who claim Joe Biden has Alzheimer's have obviously never lived with an Alzheimer's patient. President Biden may not be at the top of his game, but he outperformed Donald Trump at the debates, has addressed the nation and answered questions from the press. People with Alzheimer's would be unable to do that. Alzheimer's is not a verbal gaffe or slipping on a stairway. Alzheimer's is asking a doctor if people might cure COVID by ingesting disinfectants. You know‚Ä¶.something a three year old can answer. Alzheimer's is sitting in front of the television watching the Capitol being invaded and thinking it's a good thing. Maybe the health of a 78 year old needs to be more closely monitored than a younger person, but I see no sign of Alzheimer's. "

    "answer": "Trump said he took a cognitative test at Walter Reed Medical Centre recently. The last time Trump was at Walter Reed was when he was suddenly rushed there without an appointment last November. Why did they give him a cognitive test at that time? Well, you give cognitive tests to either check on a person‚Äôs mental decline through dementia or Alzheimers, or because they just had a stroke and you want to see what cognitive functions may have been impaired. You don‚Äôt rush to a hospital to check about dementia or Alzheimers. So Trump must have had a stroke in November. He remembered taking the test, so he tells Hannity that he aced it and the doctors were amazed and the Biden should take it and he would never ace it like Trump did.

    "answer": "‚ÄúThis is for you. The Lord told me to bring this to you,‚Äù were her words, as she handed me a tall, brown paper bag; we were still standing in my family's doorway. I asked her in, showed my wife the bag, and its contents, and we both broke down crying. It was a legitimate miracle. Backstory: We had been living in our new home for some few eventful months, stretching to cover the mortgage and new bills as best as we could. Typically, we'd run out of money a day, or two before the next direct deposit, so our strategy was to gather up the last of our coins and purchase a loaf of bread and a pack of ham, enough for us and our 5-year-old to eat sandwiches until the paycheck landed. However, this time, we had gathered our coins, searched the car, the sofa, etc and were only able to gather about $1.75. Enough for either bread or ham, but not both. When I came home from work, late in the evening and we pooled our respective coins, the math was undeniable. We stared at each other blankly. All of us were already hungry, and the store was closing in less than an hour. That's when the wife of one of our down-the-street neighbors knocked on our door. We were nodding acquaintances, at best. If anything, the husband seemed to be in a high-spirited competition over his lush, green lawn, versus the lush green lawn that the city had recently repaired for us ( different story). She explained that her son worked in the bakery at the military base, and brought home left-over loaves each night. She normally took them to the Mission Rescue (homeless shelter) down the road. But, that day, she had received word from God to bring the bakery bag to our home. So, she brought a half dozen breads: sourdough, sweet, French, longs, rounds‚Ä¶..bread for days. When He blesses, God is exceedingly, abundantly, bountiful. We thanked her profusely and rushed down to the store to buy a pack of Oscar Meyers ham to go with it. Best meal in years. We had solid, incontrovertible proof that we were firmly in God's loving hand. We prayed to thank God, no prayer for food was even necessary! Days later, in conversation with her husband, he shared with us that she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. So after this, we kept an eye on her , but her husband was usually around. May they both rest in peace. Best neighbors ever. "

Sugar is 50% fructose, and fructose can't be burned like glucose. It ends up as fat in the liver to be converted into glucose at a later date. Here's what non-alcoholic fatty liver looks like.   Yeah ‚Äî it's not a pretty sight. Table sugar does that, and high fructose corn syrup is even worse. A high sugar diet leads to fatty liver, chronic inflammation which drives heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, and more, and it's a major factor in obesity. But when you give up sugar, remember this: you should also give up ultra-processed food, which is responsible for 90% of the sugar in the American diet.

They say borderlines attempted a narcissistic defence, but were unable to attain it, and thus were stuck in a life of emotional disregulation. Wrong. Borderlines are successful narcissists, narcissists are failed borderlines. Both borderlines and narcissists undergo very similar high levels of oxidative stress, and are the only two personality disorders to do so. Study shows Narcissistic Personality Disorder may have a biological component Due to whatever factors, both borderlines and narcissists experience very high levels of stress. In order to deal with their stress, narcissists self medicate by abusing others. Seeing their power to make others feel small gives narcissists a sense of self worth, it keeps terror, agony, and the Void at bay. Borderlines have chosen to confront the chaos head on. Being somewhat narcissistic and psychopathic, at some point in their life, they were offered the choice to follow the Dark Path, but decided in their heart that this was the wrong thing to do, that it would be better to be engulfed in the agony than seek to farm it out to others. Borderlines suffer greatly in their youth, and are more prone than narcissists to commit suicide and end up in prison. Yet as they age, the condition mellows, and some borderlines even recover. The Lifetime Course of Borderline Personality Disorder While the narcissistic strategy works better while the narcissist is young and strong, in their old age narcissists are less able to find victims to abuse, are often abandoned by everyone, and the evil they work makes them more likely to get alzheimers and dementia.

    "answer": "Well, if you were on a high sugar diet previously, and you completely gave it up, your liver might go from this:  To this:   Table sugar (sucrose) should not be confused with the glucose in yams and broccoli. It's 50% fructose, and fructose in itself isn't a problem if you consume it in fruit, which offers a smaller dose and comes with fiber to slow digestion. But the average American consumes 60 to 75 lbs of refined sugar per year, most of it from processed food. 50% of that refined sugar is fructose, which can't be burned like glucose until the liver converts it to a usable form of energy. When you overwhelm the liver with fructose, as is typical with the standard American diet, the liver can only store that fructose as liver fat in the short term. The result is non-alcoholic fatty liver similar to the liver of an alcoholic, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and eventually type 2 diabetes.

    "answer": "Again its the versatility that defines each actor in this list Raghuvaran is an excellent actor. He plays a concerned and worried father in Anjali, a loving brother in Mugavaree or Nerukku Ner, A worried and sick father in YNM and a suave underworld gangster in Basha. Each role is flawless. Prakash Raj too has delivered superb performances. Be it the 60+ year old with Alzheimers in a recent movie with Vikram Prabhu, a Commercial baddie in Singham or Pokkiri, a Middle aged conossieur in Un Samayil Arayil and a Comical friend in Mozhi. Not to mention his magnum opus in Kanchivaram. Yet for better part of their careers - these two men have delivered caricature performances for a paycheck - Raghuvaran as a don or villian and Prakash Raj also as a villian. Sathyaraj has done some great roles like Periyar but he is a typical commercial actor and makes every role larger than life which is what a cinemagoer wants but which cannot be called great acting. So my ranking Raghuvaran and Prakash Raj - Tied Sathyaraj - Second "

    "link": "https://www.quora.com/What-made-you-hopeful-today",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's is a hell of a disease, we all know that. The susceptibility to the disease increases with an increase in age. After 65 years, the chances of Alzheimer's doubles after every 5 years. My grandfather is also an affected patient, it is very disheartening to see him struggling to remember even my name, which he himself named me. The disease happens due to the degeneration of nerve cells and the neural network in the brain, causing memory loss. The depressing part of it is that it cannot be detected at an early stage and has no direct cure, all the present treatments only provide temporary relief and none of them directly act on the causative mechanism of Alzheimer's disease. It has been more than 100 years since its discovery, but still no significant success.  But this news gave me hope today. A group of scientists in Bangalore led by T Govindaraju, a Professor of Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, found a breakthrough which is maybe the first step to a cure, which could not only hinder the process of degeneration but also reverse it. The breakthrough is a small molecule, named TGR 63 that has shown the ability to disrupt the mechanism through which neurons become dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease `~Deccanherald The degeneration is caused by a certain type of protein called amyloid peptide and these collect between neurons which causes the disruption. But these TGR 63 molecules can decrease the level of amyloid toxicity and has the capability to reverse the cognitive decline. The trials have been done on rats suffering from Alzheimer's and just after 3 days of the introduction of the molecules, the rats were able to perform tasks like navigating mazes, which targets their memory power. Human trials are yet to start and we can only hope that it also goes well. Our memories are our only remaining wealth before we die, so make them more so at least one of them will be with you in the end. ü•≤ "

    "answer": "My parents were both starting to fail. We found them an apartment in an assisted-living facility within walking distance of our house. Mom had medium Alzheimers, Dad was sharp but had end-stage heart disease. For six weeks we chased around, hitting nice restaurants and a museum or two, Dad in his wheelchair. One evening we took them to a very expensive place where Dad ordered the Seafood Masterpiece and ate it all. It was a budget buster, but we didn‚Äôt care. Dad died the next week. Mom couldn‚Äôt stay in the apartment alone. She still looked great and dressed beautifully and looked nothing like a patient. She‚Äôd started to buzz by the front desk and go for long walks, invariably getting lost. I went looking for memory care and zeroed in on a beautiful church-affiliated place with a great reputation. Here comes the mistake. I went to tour the place ‚Äî cottages with private rooms and a gorgeous huge yard, discreetly fenced and with key-code gates for safety. Early in the tour we were joined by an older staff member, who walked with us, greeting residents, and pointing out objects of interest. I was curious. I asked her name (no name tag) and what her job was. She said she was Helen, and with a lovely smile added that she was ‚Äúthe understander.‚Äù I assumed she was some kind of therapist, and had chosen a sweet way to describe her role. Delightful. After the tour, in the director‚Äôs office, I commented on how nice it was to meet Helen, and how pleased I was there was a therapist on staff. The director grinned and said Helen wasn‚Äôt staff, but a patient, a former clinical social worker, and that Helen was having a very good day. Mom moved in, and lived there in dignity and comfort until a brief pneumonia took her four years later. She and Helen had become friends, and I was always glad I‚Äôd mistaken Helen for a care-giver, because in real sense, that‚Äôs exactly what she was. PS: I‚Äôm a little worried I‚Äôve told this story on Quora before, but I blame Quora for not having a better search function rather than my own failing memory.

    "answer": "When I was a teenager, my maternal Grandfather had a stroke that sent him into a nursing home. My Mom took in my Grandmother to live with us, a family of three teenagers, two of them boys. My grandparents had been living a quiet retirement on the west coast in a tiny two bedroom house. They had their routines and my Grandfather waited on his wife hand and foot. The move was a stressful disaster for everyone! My Grandmother could not cope with the noise and activity of a busy household of teens. In hindsight, I feel sorry for her now over how drastically her life changed at a time when she was under the stress of losing her life partner. My Mom tried everything she could to make her mother‚Äôs life comfortable, but it was a lot of stress on her as well. We three teenagers actually hated our Grandmother for getting so much attention from our Mom, so we really weren‚Äôt very nice to her. My brothers would tease her relentlessly. My Dad thought the solution might be some extra space, so he worked very hard evenings and weekends, after a long day at a physical labouring job, to built two extra bedrooms in our basement for my brothers. Our cold prairie climate also meant my Grandmother could spend months shut up inside the house, which was a huge difference to her former life on the milder coast. Eventually my Grandmother developed Alzheimers to the point of calling a cab to take her to the airport. An airline staff member somehow got our home phone number to alert my Mom that Grandma was at the check-in desk with no money, no ticket and no passport looking to fly to England to visit her brother (who had been dead for 20 years). It was then that Mom had Grandma put in a nursing home. I would heartily advise you not to carry out your plan. This will cause nothing but stress for all members of your family and will certainly not be in the best interest of your father.

    "link": "https://www.quora.com/What-disease-would-you-like-to-see-cured-in-your-lifetime",
    "answer": "I would like to see Alzheimers cured. It is the worse (and most prevalent) of all the neurological diseases. Almost half of all deaths from neurological disease are due to Alzheimers. By curing this disease, we would prevent millions of people from losing their brain and independence in their old age. This singlehandedly would reduce the price of healthcare for everybody since demand for healthcare-related services would drop significantly. If we were to find a cure for Alzheimers, this would also cure diabetes. The underlying casual mechanism of Alzheimers is so similar to diabetes, that many specialist are now comfortable referring to Alzheimers as type 3 diabetes. The cure to Alzheimers would be significant because it would simultaneously eliminate the 6th and 7th leading cause of death in the U.S and save over 200,000 lives on an annualized basis. It would also get rid of what is in my opinion the worse way one could possibly die. I would hate to slowly lose my memories and forget everybody that I love. Logically I should choose heart disease or cancer since these are the top two causes of death. The reason why I didn‚Äôt choose either of these illnesses is because A.) Dying from either of these diseases is much preferable to Alzheimer‚Äôs B.) These diseases are largely a result of the choices you make in life. Bad diet leads to heart disease and cancer results from (not always of course) bad life choices like smoking, not putting on sunblock, exposure to cancer inducing chemicals, injury-inducing decisions, etc. Alzheimers on the other hand has a very significant heritability component. In many cases regardless of what you do in life you will get Alzheimers. This lack of choice or control causes me to dislike Alzheimers a lot more. "

A clandestine cabal operating out of the White House secretly sold arms to Iran and used the profits to fund the Contras fighting communism in Nicaragua. President Reagan was already deteriorating from Alzheimers Disease at this point and at various times vacillated between knowing about the plan and not knowing a thing. Most likely Ronnie was told the arms sales to Iran was to help release American hostages. Vice President Bush claimed he was \"out of the loop\" which was clearly not true. He issued pardons for all the principals involved in the scandal including Cap Weinberger and Admiral Poindexter. Guess who was the Attorney General who engineered these disgraceful pardons. Answer at the end. At least the Watergate criminals went to prison. Nobody really paid any kind of price for this egregious scandal. Ollie North would become a hero to the far right showing that treason in the defense of Nicaraguan rebels is no vice. Imagine if President Obama was caught doing anything like this. Impeachment would be the least of his worries. An appointment with a firing squad would be very likely. Just the price he would pay for not being Ronald Reagan.

    "answer": "I asked this question because I‚Äôve been reading a lot lately about people who have had covid-19 and ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù but who have been left with significant damage to their hearts, their lungs, their kidneys ‚Äî and their brains. It‚Äôs worth noting because people shake their heads over the hundreds of thousands of Americans killed by Trump and Trumpy governors, as they should ‚Äî but don‚Äôt talk enough about the seven million plus Americans who have been needlessly sickened, and how the rest of their lives may be crummy, and shorter, as a result. People are getting glaucoma and diabetes suddenly, as a result of covid. Doctors say it ages your body by decades. And as I mentioned, it attacks the brain in many people, and does permanent damage. And this may be especially significant in the case of Donald Trump because he may already be showing signs of cognitive impairment, and because his father had Alzheimers. Three stages to COVID-19 brain damage identified by neurologists Here are a few paragraphs you can find at the above link: \"We are learning that a significant number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have various degrees of brain impairment. As a medical community, we need to monitor these patients over time as some of them may develop cognitive decline, attention deficit, brain fog, or Alzheimer's disease in the future. There is a lot we can do to promote brain healing in COVID-19 patients, but first we must understand the nature and severity of their neurological deficits. At the patient level, getting a baseline MRI before leaving the hospital is imperative so that we have a starting point to evaluate and treat them,\" explained Fotuhi. In the just published paper, Dr. Fotuhi and his colleagues warn about neurological issues in patients who suffer from COVID-19, including stroke, seizures, confusion, dizziness, paralysis, and/or coma. Already, two dozen case reports are revealing the impact of COVID-19 on the brains of patients. In fact, one study from Wuhan, China, showed that 45% of patients with severe COVID-19 illness experience marked neurological deficits. Another study from France showed 84% of ICU patients with COVID-19 have positive abnormalities on their neurological examination, and that 15% of patients who leave the ICU have residual \"dysexecutive function,\" which involves poor attention and difficulty with decision-making and controlling behavior. Those are sobering numbers: 45% of patients with severe covid in Wuhan ‚Äúexperience marked neurological deficits.‚Äù And 84% of ICU patients with it in France have ‚Äúpositive abnormalities on their neurological examination.‚Äù And 15% who leave the ICU wind up with poor attention and difficulty with decision-making and controlling behavior. We cannot afford for Trump to have any increase in his difficulties in these areas. From that weird letter his hippie doctor released during the 2016 campaign, to Ronny Jackson‚Äôs rapturous reports on Trump‚Äôs health, to explanations for why Trump was rushed to Walter Reed and why he was given that basic cognitive test ‚Äî we‚Äôve never had a frank or full accounting of what‚Äôs going on with his health. We need that sort of frank and full accounting. It is simply too important to accept more lies about how Trump‚Äôs brain ‚Äî and the rest of him ‚Äî is working. "

The only thing, and I mean the only thing we do know about Alzheimers, is that there is more aluminium in the blood. It could be the body just makes it due to the Alzheimers, it does not need to come from external sources, or it could be DNA, or it could be just about anything as the whole planet is pretty much made from aluminium. And you have a lot of aluminium in your blood, actually quite a lot, and this keeps you safe. Without it, or if you find an impossible way to remove it, you will die.

    "link": "https://www.quora.com/Was-your-inheritance-snatched-away-from-you-by-dishonest-family-members",
    "answer": "No. Not really. When my father passed his and my Mom‚Äôs money was all in a living trust. He named co trustees with my Mom in order of age. My older sibling had been a CPA. She worked at that job for two years of her 55 year life. The rest of her adult life was non working outside the home. She became co trustee. If my mother became unable to serve, I became co trustee. At that time I had been practicing law for nearly 30 years, owned and operated a business and was married to a CPA. My brother was a missionary in Russia. He had zero interest in running a significant estate. My younger sister was a drug addict. She was bright and beautiful but totally irresponsible. My baby sister spend time everyday with my Mom. She was a good daughter but she denied what was before her eyes. My mother was totally missing in action She had Alzheimers My mothers alzheimers was painfully obvious to everyone. ( except my baby sister). But things were going well, I thought , so I let it be. My sister was doing things like making gifts of 20k or more to my Mom‚Äôs grand children Also great grand children. That sister was the only one who had grandchildren that benefitted from these gifts to great grand kids. I told her to quit it and I let it pass. The trust was clear that all things were to be divided into 5 parts. These gifts cut 4, 3, 3, 2, 1. ( was the 2). I became concerned when I learned she was not using the long term care insurance for my mother in the alzheimers home. It provided 4 years of 48k per year care. That is 196k in benefits. My mother was in her 80s. My sister kept saying that we might need it in the future for my 85 plus year old Mom . With 5 million in the trust the logic escaped me. I started asking questions. The response was that my baby sister took my Mom to a notary she knew and had her sign a power of attorney naming my older sister in charge of her affairs in the event of my mother becoming mentally unable to serve. Frankly, I found it funny. My sister thought that would make her sole Trustee. It didn‚Äôt. The Trust became set in stone on my Dad‚Äôs death. It only put my sister in charge of funds released to my mother which required two trustees I found it so funny, I played along and took my Mom to the DMV to get an ID. She never drove a car. My Mom could not even sign her name so the DMV told me to hold her hand and sign it. So her signature looked a lot like my handwriting. Since my little sister held her hand to sign the POA, no one would take it. There was zero match ( no, I did not find my mother‚Äôs situation to be funny. It was so sad) Finally my sister capitulated and I became co trustee. But before the ink was dry, my sister wrote each of us a personal check of her own money for 10k to cover any mistakes she might have made. What i found was sad. My sister was so overwhelmed by the responsibility, she was just frozen. There were no intentional acts. There was just an inability to act. She had never contacted the insurance company. etc She worried about it day and night. Why didn‚Äôt she tell me? She always felt my Dad was disappointed in her and this was her way of changing the perception. But she could not handle it. My mother passed two years later. Two years of the insurance, about 96k was lost. I felt bad for the mental torture my sister faced. However, I never felt my sister was dishonest with anyone but herself. She is a very kind and generous woman who has certainly given to her family more than was lost. After reviewing the estate, I would have had a hard time fitting it into my busy work and family life. As far as we were all concerned, it was a closed matter. "

Hawk Eye: Why the hell Thor was not invited? Captain: Because he lives on another planet, be patient. (Relieved) Here he comes! Tony: Who is this mister? Captain: Avengers, meet your new colleague, Sherlock Holmes! SH: Hello captain. ( shake his hands) Tony: So are you saying he is the new member of Avengers?

If not‚Ä¶‚Ä¶(Sherlock Intervenes) Sherlock(looking at Bruce): Your left hand is twitching and the veins are unusually sharp than your right hand that means you have injected yourself with some kind of chemical, not sooner than an hour, your tongue is slightly yellowish and your eyes are turning orange means the chemical is barium compound, your forehead is sweating and that's why you are carrying a wet handkerchief, this means you have a fever which suggests that your body is trying to resist the chemical and as I know, your counter-part hero hulk is the result of radiation, and barium has anti-radiation property, I think you are trying to kill the hulk counterpart in your self.

So coming to you Mr. Hawkeye, your bow is replenished with new string, the number of arrows seems surprisingly less than what can be contained in your quiver, your posture of standing is suggesting your both legs are hurt, that means you have jumped from a substantial height, you are wearing black spectacles without any spectacles marks on your nose or ears suggests that you do not use them regularly means you are hiding injury to eyes, and last but not least you didn't even notice even if your hot coffee was spilled completely over you, this means you are on a high dose of painkillers. This all suggests you were on a solo mission in the last few days, am I wrong Mr. Hawkeye? Captain: What he is talking about Hawk? Were you on a mission? Hawk: Yes, but it was a small mission in Belfast, no big deal. Tony: This kid has got some skills,.. Captain: That doesn't matter, you know before you go a mission, however small it is, you should notify Shield. It is made mandatory for all Avengers by UN after we screwed up in Siberia. (Captain is angry as hell). You will give me all records of your solo missi‚Ä¶..(SH intervenes again). SH: Now your turn Mr. Ironman, I have seen you many times on television in last few months, your suit size is reshaped and it is shrinking near your chest, your skin is getting red day by red, your speed of talking has been decreased from 83 words per minute to 78 words per minute, this means new metal you discovered is failing to protect your heart from the reactor, this is causing malfunction of your heart and your brain is getting less blood and your body is getting more blood instead, now your slow speed is directly indicating that your brain has been affected, my guess early stage of Alzheimer's.  Tony: What the fuck? Are you serious? Captain I am leaving. Jarvis notify Doctor Stephenson I am coming right now. ( Tony suits up and flies the hell out). Bruce Banner: You have a gift Mr. Homes, you are certainly worthy of being part of team avengers. Can you please tell by your deduction, how much time before tony starts to lose his edge?  SH: (Starts laughing as hell) He doesn't have Alzheimer's, he was being an ass to me, so I was messing with him, but you gotta admit the look on his face was priceless.. Captain: That is the first time ever I saw Tony‚Äôs face like a chicken‚Ä¶.. (Everyone starts laughing)‚Ä¶..

The one exception is Neuralink because I cannot for the life of me talk about it without seriously wondering if Elon Musk has lost his mind. The company was founded in 2016 and has the goal of fusing together the human brain with artificial intelligence. Mr. Musk has talked about the dangers of artificial intelligence getting out of hand several times, so Neuralink is his response to said threat:  The crazy thing is that this isn‚Äôt a joke. Right now the company is already worth over half a billion dollars and is focusing on designing a wireless implant ‚Äúbrain-computer‚Äù which will act as an interface with the human brain. Our brains are our most complex organ, and the device will help cure neurological conditions like Alzheimer's, depression, insomnia, dementia, spinal cord injuries and other conditions. These serious advancements in technology will eventually lead to a device that will fuse humankind with artificial intelligence. The super long term goal of the company is quite frankly terrifying, but the positive things from the first step of curing several neurological conditions would be an amazing accomplishment. So far they have done tests on pigs, which has been pretty successful. On the other hand they were supposed to begin human testing late last year, although that hasn‚Äôt happened yet.

    "answer": "There is evidence that around 40% of cases of Alzheimers could be prevented through healthy eating and exercise. But that leaves 60% of cases - such as mine - that occur spontaneously. So encouraging a healthy lifestyle makes sense. But it won‚Äôt, by itself, stop Alzheimers occurring. Only a small proportion of Alzheimers cases are hereditary - around 1%. Although popular opinion puts this much higher. So the cause of 59 out of 100 cases of the disease is essentially unknown. Which is why there is an urgent need for further research.

    "link": "https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-dangerous-colour-of-mold",
    "answer": "One of the most harmful types of mold, Stachybotrys chartarum, has a greenish black color. This mold has poisons that can be absorbed through the skin and toxin effects can occur even at low spore concentrations indoors. Dead spores can also be toxic and allergenic. It is noteworthy that Stachybotrys chartarum in the lungs can prevent the synthesis of an enzyme that keeps the alveoli under tension so that they do not collapse. There are four different stages of infection from this mold: In the first stage, ulcers appear in the oral mucosa, associated with increased salivation, inflammation of the nasal mucosa and inflammation of the conjunctiva of the eye.The second stage is characterized by a decrease in white blood cells.In the third stage, blood clotting is blocked. Elevated temperature and diarrhea are further hallmarks of this stage.In the fourth stage, food intake is no longer possible and death is likely.The effects of toxicity by Stachybotrys can also strikingly resemble the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. The loss of logical thinking and memory in people who have been damaged by mold can lead to this being associated with advancing age or with the onset of Alzheimer's disease. People who already have Alzheimer's should take special care that they can live in a mold-free environment. Not only stachybotrys, but also other health-threatening molds are able to drastically worsen the course of the disease. If you have a mold problem in your house or work place it is advisable you get it removed immediately. Source: Mississauga Mold Removal "

    "link": "https://www.quora.com/Can-dementia-be-a-long-term-effect-from-diabetes",
    "answer": "There's a lot of research suggesting a connection between diabetes and Alzheimer's ‚Äî though those connections aren't yet fully understood. Not all studies confirm the connection, but many do suggest that people with diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, are at higher risk of eventually developing Alzheimer's dementia or other dementias. Research is still unclear on whether taking steps to prevent or control diabetes may help reduce your risk of cognitive decline. Understanding the connection Diabetes can cause several complications, such as damage to your blood vessels. Diabetes is considered a risk factor for vascular dementia. This type of dementia occurs due to brain damage that is often caused by reduced or blocked blood flow to your brain. Many people with diabetes have brain changes that are hallmarks of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Some researchers think that each condition fuels the damage caused by the other. Ongoing research is aimed at trying to better understand the link between Alzheimer's and diabetes. That link may occur as a result of the complex ways that type 2 diabetes affects the ability of the brain and other body tissues to use sugar (glucose) and respond to insulin. Diabetes may also increase the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition in which people experience more thinking (cognitive) and memory problems than are usually present in normal aging. Some research indicates that diabetes may increase the risk of MCI worsening to dementia. Mild cognitive impairment may precede or accompany Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. As researchers examine the connections between diabetes and Alzheimer's, they're also studying potential ways to prevent or treat both diseases. But a recent trial of intranasal insulin showed no cognitive benefit. Treatment diabetes - click here to read "

    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age of 65. The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80. Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. On average, a person with Alzheimer's lives four to eight years after diagnosis, but can live as long as 20 years, depending on other factors. Alzheimer's has no current cure, but treatments for symptoms are available and research continues. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Alzheimer's material there... "

    "answer": "Ok‚Ä¶ See if I get it straight: Your parents had been married for 44 years until your father died 18 months ago. Your parents have 4 children, and you‚Äôre the only son. Your mother now decides to remarry. And you want to know what you should say to her. I‚Äôm not sure why being the only son has anything to do with this whole situation so I‚Äôm going to ignore that. If your mom had been married for 44 years, I assume she‚Äôs at least in her late 60s. If your mother is mentally competent, you should say: ‚ÄúCongratulations, mom! I trust and respect your judgment as an adult of the sound of mind. You know what you want with your life, and whatever your decision is, I support it, and I love you very much!‚Äù If you suspect your mother suffers from dementia and can not make decisions for herself, and her potential husband is taking advantage of her, there are several simple tests you can do to evaluate her mental capacity. If it turns out she might have dementia or Alzheimer's, you can petition the court to declare your mother incompetent and appoint you as her legal guardian. "

    "link": "https://www.quora.com/Why-does-President-Donald-Trump-consider-the-cognition-test-to-be-difficult-especially-the-concluding-5-questions",
    "answer": " https://www.parkinsons.va.gov/resources/MOCA-Test-English.pdf So there are two ways to interpret the last five questions of the MOCA, the ungenerous way which makes Trump look like a fool or the generous way which makes Trump look like a fool. The ungenerous way is the last row, Orientation. The last five things asked are what is the month, year, day of the week, place and city you are in right now? Even with COVID-19, knowing what day of the week it is is usually pretty straightforward. If this is what Trump is claiming, he thinks the vast majority of people don‚Äôt know where they are or what day of the week it is most of time. And given his supporters, perhaps that‚Äôs more fair than not. But let‚Äôs look at the generous way of seeing this. That‚Äôs probably the Language, Abstraction, Delayed Recall and Orientation, as there are sufficient questions in there to make up five. We‚Äôve already covered Orientation. What about Delayed Recall, working backward? Well, earlier in the test the person is provided a list of five words that are distinct ‚Äî a feature, a fabric, a building, a flower and a color ‚Äî and asked to repeat them and given two trials. Now, a few minutes later, they are asked to repeat them again. Wow! Five short words that are highly differentiated, remembered a few minutes later! What about Abstraction? Well, that‚Äôs a tough one. Given two clearly similar, short and common words, find a relationship between them. Amazingly tough. And what about Language? He was expected to repeat two short sentences made of simple words. That‚Äôs it. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. In other words, passing with flying colors is the expected result for 80% of the populace. It‚Äôs people with dementia, brain damage, Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimers who don‚Äôt pass with flying colors. The last five questions are ‚Äòvery hard‚Äô. Regardless of how you count them, they are fucking easy to pass if you have two working brain cells and a minimum amount of concentration. Stupid teenagers playing with phones could pass this test with ease. The village idiot could pass this test. You could easily design a version of this test that crows and octopuses would pass. And Trump is bragging about it like it‚Äôs the Mensa entry exam. What an idiot. And what idiots his followers be. "

    "answer": "Short answer: they aren't valid at all. Not even a little bit. Slightly longer answer: There is a lot to unpack here, even though this ‚Äúpaper\" referred to in the article barely qualifies as a scientific article. The journal it is published in is known as ‚Äòopen source‚Äô. This means that, for a fee, anyone can have something published in it. There's little to no peer review. Classen chose this route because there's no way he would have gotten published in a reputable journal. One way to evaluate the reputation of a journal is to look at the impact factor. This is a measure of the importance of a journal's published works to the relevant field, and looks at how often on average an article from that journal is cited. New England Journal of medicine has an impact factor of 74. The journal that published Classen's paper doesn't even have an impact factor that I can find, and it's not even indexed in PubMed. That makes the paper suspect right from the beginning. Now, what about the paper itself? First, he claims that mRNA vaccines can trigger the misfolding of other proteins in the body, including those associated with Alzheimer's disease and ALS. Additionally, he claims that the vaccine can trigger prion diseases (like Mad Cow), which are similarly caused by misfolded proteins. However, he provides zero evidence for these claims. His entire methods section is 3 sentences and refers to an unspecified ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù of the vaccine. For contrast, the methods section on the last paper I wrote included detailed descriptions of how I collected my data, how I analyzed it, and exactly how the stats were carried out. This is required, because your paper is useless if other scientists cannot replicate the results. When asked, Classen only said ‚Äúmy research speaks for itself\". This is a ridiculous statement from a scientist. This guy has a long history of publishing this kind of stuff. His website states outright that he believes covid is a bioweapon, and he's been publishing antivaccine stuff for years. There have been no reports of prion diseases or sudden onset of Alzheimer's disease in any vaccinated person. The American Council on Science and Health, a reputable nonprofit advocacy group, has published an article debunking his claims. Instead of rehashing the article, which includes a good summary of what prions are, I've linked it below. No, COVID mRNA Vaccine Won't Cause Alzheimer's or Prion DiseaseThe coronavirus pandemic has spawned an equally concerning mis- and disinformation pandemic. The latest myth is that mRNA vaccines may trigger prion diseases like Alzheimer's.https://www.acsh.org/news/2021/02/19/no-covid-mrna-vaccine-wont-cause-alzheimers-or-prion-disease-15357 "

    "link": "https://www.quora.com/Are-iron-skillets-safe-to-use-or-do-they-leech-iron-into-the-food",
    "answer": "Before I go any further into the question, I‚Äôm simply going to say this‚Ä¶. You actually WANT that iron to spread into your food. Having iron in your body for the most part is almost universally considered to be a good thing. People with anemia (iron deficiency) often purposely cook with iron skillets in order to get that iron boost in their diet. This is especially beneficial also for vegans and vegetarians, who tend to also get anemic if they don‚Äôt plan their diet well.  (from examine[1] ) Now there are certain exceptions though. There are people who are naturally given to high iron intakes, and can actually get an iron overdose. That‚Äôs a risk factor in Alzheimer's and Colon cancer. Also, a lot of the foods that we eat in everyday life can often be iron-fortified, not to mention multi-vitamin pills. So it‚Äôs possible to push that iron count too high simply by accident. BUT there‚Äôs 2 great fixes (well 2.5 ways) for that as well if you‚Äôre one of those who happen to have iron-rich blood. One of them is a simple daily joy of life, which has its own benefits‚Ä¶..  (from TimHortons) Coffee actually INHIBITS iron absorption. My wife is anemic, and she‚Äôs been banned from drinking coffee for months now. For me, it‚Äôs a blessing since with the amount of beef I eat each month‚Ä¶ plus that she drinks that horrible Folger‚Äôs stuff‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs a god-send. And as for the other 1 and a 1/2 ways‚Ä¶..  (from UCI Health) Giving blood actually flushes out that excess iron and drops that level down. In fact, most blood donation groups prefer that you have a high iron count in your blood since you would be less likely to feel faint, feel ill or worse. And most importantly of all, you‚Äôre doing a great thing for the community, get a few bucks (if you‚Äôre American), and‚Ä¶.  (from Don‚Äôt Get Bored in Calgary[2] ) ‚Ä¶. you get a snack right after. Not bad for doing the right thing. Oh, and for the other 0.5 way of getting the iron count down. The reason why it‚Äôs 0.5 and not a full way, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs another way of blood donation.  (from the Daily Mail[3] ) Enough said. EDIT: I‚Äôve since been informed that Americans are no longer paid for purely blood donations, especially as it was found that there was a rise in hepatitis in paid donors. However, the sale of blood PLASMA of $25‚Äì50 does occur, which also has to be done through a similar method as blood donation, up to twice a seven day period. So really, you still can get paid to donate and earn up to $300‚Äì400 a month, BUT that won‚Äôt do much to get rid of the excess iron.

    "answer": "That my father was passing. My father suffered from Alzheimers and I was his primary caregiver. Shortly after moving back home to care for him, I adopted Josie, a beautiful Norwegian Forest Cat, from our local shelter. From the day she stepped out of her crate and into our kitchen, she was incredibly protective of my father. She trusted me to care for dad but it took her a few months to trust dad's aide. At first she would not even trust Sylvia to help dad shave or brush his teeth. Josie would jump on the bathroom counter and position herself between them. When I would travel back home to Chicago, Josie would sleep by dad's bed. At first, Sylvia's feelings were hurt, but over time Josie realized that Sylvia was a safe person and relaxed. For a period of time, dad would wake up at night and want to wander. Josie, and our new cat MJ, started sleeping with him. Josie would stretch out along dad's left leg and MJ would mimic her against dad's right leg. I realized that they were trying to block my father from getting up at night. After dad's last hospital stay, he returned home under hospice care. At a certain point, he was under 24 hour care - an CNA during the day and a nurse at night. Early one morning, I had walked into his bedroom to check on him and give the nurse coffee. Then Josie walked in. Until that point, she had avoided dad's room while the hospice employees were caring for him. She jumped onto the bed and began trying to find a place to stretch out next to my father. Now the hospice nurses had pillows situated under and around dad to keep him comfortable. Josie tried her best to find a spot where she could position herself and I could tell she was becoming agitated. The nurse was watching and asked me, ‚ÄúWhat is she trying to do?‚Äù. I told her that Josie wanted to be next to dad and the pillows were blocking her. Just as I began to move to the bed to remove a pillow, Josie walked to the foot of the bed. She placed her front paws on the footboard, lifted her head, and let out the most distressing, mournful howling sound. She then jumped off the bed and left the room. Two hours later, my father died. Josie rarely vocalized and when she did it sounded like a bird cooing. When I watched her that morning and heard her cry, she knew, and she let me know, that my father was passing. "

    "question": "Can untreated diabetes cause dementia? ",
    "link": "https://www.quora.com/Can-untreated-diabetes-cause-dementia",
    "answer": "Diabetes is considered a risk factor for vascular dementia. This type of dementia occurs due to brain damage that is often caused by reduced or blocked blood flow to your brain. Many people with diabetes have brain changes that are hallmarks of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Some researchers think that each condition fuels the damage caused by the other. Ongoing research is aimed at trying to better understand the link between Alzheimer's and diabetes. That link may occur as a result of the complex ways that type 2 diabetes affects the ability of the brain and other body tissues to use sugar (glucose) and respond to insulin. Diabetes may also increase the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition in which people experience more thinking (cognitive) and memory problems than are usually present in normal aging. Some research indicates that diabetes may increase the risk of MCI worsening to dementia. Mild cognitive impairment may precede or accompany Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. As researchers examine the connections between diabetes and Alzheimer's, they're also studying potential ways to prevent or treat both diseases.

No one I know has mentioned it, but those folks with the early stages of Alzheimer's disease have difficulty controlling their emotions, especially their anger. If DJT can antogonize Biden to a point where he loses his temper, Joe will lash out and feel the pressure. At that point, DJT will be able to exploit Joe's weakness, and he'll just keep picking away at Biden until the pressure is so heavy on him that he's going to make some serious mistakes. Let's remember that Joe has a long record to criticize, and if DJT is smart, he'll bring up every mistake, misjudgement and gaffe that Joe has made, which is a long list, and answered every charge that Biden has made with a recitation of Joe's mistakes, plagerism, legislative mistakes, like his vote for the Clinton Crime Bill and sanctioning of the Iraq war, and DJT should make pretty quick of Joe.

    "answer": "My grandmother was probably the sweetest, gentle and loving person I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure to have met. She would never say a bad thing about anyone and she would always say ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have anything nice to say, then don‚Äôt say anything at all.‚Äù I was about 13 when her memory started to falter; it started with things like forgetting to fill the kettle before turning it on or forgetting to peel the carrots before cutting them up. But over the next year or so, she succumbed to Alzheimer‚Äôs and she needed ongoing care. She lost her independence and had to move into a care facility. After some time, she slipped and fell leaving her with a broken hip. While recovering, she was placed in a ward with a few other elderly patients. With a broken hip and Alzheimers at some point, She soiled herself, it‚Äôs not as though she could get to a bathroom. From what we were told from the other patients, the nurse got her out of bed and made her stand while they cleaned up. It was during that time she fell backwards‚Ä¶ the other patients said the sound of her head hitting the ground was like nothing they‚Äôd ever heard. Worst of all, she was just picked her up and put back into bed. My Aunt came later that day to see her but at that point, my grandma wasn‚Äôt able to speak and could only make sounds of distress. She died soon after from a brain haemorrhage. Even though the other patients witnessed what occurred, the Hospital denied everything. For a while, my aunt tried to fight the system - not for compensation, we had already lost my grandmother and nothing could really compensate for that loss, but to try and implement something that could prevent this from happening to someone else. As wrong as it was to make an elderly person stand with a broken hip, my aunt wanted the hospital to at least identify patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs/dementia; something like a wristband or something so they weren‚Äôt left unattended in such a vulnerable position. After a while, it was clear that the hospital wasn‚Äôt going to make any changes, I guess it was because if they had, it may have appeared as though they admitted fault and that was never going to happen.

    "answer": "I have been in a nursing home for for about a year and a half. Today is my 63rd Birthday, and in this joint I am a spring chicken, many residents being in their 90s or beyond. We have been in a lockdown because of COVID19 for the last 7 months, and there is no end in sight. We cannot leave the facility or receive visitors. I can no longer go to the dollar store or roll 3 blocks down to the river and watch the water flow or the beavers swim. My granddaughter can no longer bring my great grandson to hang out with papa. Nevertheless, life in here has been rich and rewarding for me. I still keep in touch with my family and friends online, I can facetime them, call them on the phone, skype them or message them on Facebook. I can send and receive mail. Online shopping gets you anything you could have gotten at Walmart and it is so easy. That stuff comes straight to my room. The Wi-Fi here rocks, it is blazingly fast. We also have cable. People can bring me food or items. Today I had someone bring me produce from the grocery store, and an employee brought me a sausage McMuffin for breakfast. Now, my experience may differ from yours. I see people come in bitter and angry that they are here. They go weeks or months, thinking about nothing but going back home, but sadly, most probably never will. There are others that suffer from Alzheimer's or dementia or have had strokes and are paralyzed and are unable to do much other than watch some tv. I was paralyzed when I first got here, but thankfully I have regained a lot of my mobility. I know that I am most likely going to be here for the rest of my life, so rather than wait to go back home, I am home. Also the nurses and doctors work with me every day to keep me healthy and happy. It is such a relief not to have to remember if I took my meds or had that shot of insulin. I brought all of the things I had at home, that made home what it was, here. I have computers, books, art, chess sets, microscope, cameras, everything. I even have the walls covered with my Grateful Dead and festival art I gathered over a 30 year span of being on Dead tour. With the exception of cooking (government rules), I can pretty much do anything here I could do at home. Before the pandemic, I could go to the library for a book or DVD, roll to the post office to check my mail or Sonic for a milkshake, go to the river and fish, or have a group of folks come spend the night. When I first got here, I went to the activity room one morning and they were making tie dyes. I have been tie-dyeing for over 30 years. Man, did I have some stuff to share. I now have my own cabinet in the activity, filled with dye and supplies. If I want to paint something, they have the stuff. if I want to sculpt some clay, I bet they have that. We also play games, have devotionals, fancy hair and nails gatherings, celebrations, and if I just want to chill I roll outside and just sit under the willow and chill with the critters and birds. I have made many new friends here. I consider almost every employee, from the owner and the administrator, to the nurses and CNAs even the housekeeping folks, good personal friends at this point. I have met their spouses and children. I have also made friends with the other residents. I have even found love here. My girlfriend lives right around the hall. I never expected to find that here. Life is good here except the food. The food is bland and soft, but I keep some produce and spices handy, and can transform gruel into a beautiful meal. As far as growing old goes, it sure beats the alternative, When you are old, you will have learned a lot more about life, hopefully good things, because it is all perspective and the choice of whether you see this place as a prison or a fancy hotel or just home, it is your choice. BTW, the universe looks the same from 63 year old eyes as it did from 6 year old eyes. Here I have learned to see wonder in the smallest of things, just like when I was a child.  "

    "answer": "I think this image says more than I can:  Photo credit: National Institute of Health. Imagine trying to navigate the world with the brain on the right. My mother had an MRI when we saw she was acting inappropriately. The right hand image could have been hers. I am not a doctor or neurologist or even at all formally educated in dementia. My only qualification is that I took care of my mother with frontotemporal dementia and a friend‚Äôs mom, who had AD until both had to move to dementia facilities. Anything I say should be verified by a doctor. (Although I saw NO doctors in training, observing the disease as it actually plays out, as I expected.) Dementia, including Alzheimer‚Äôs, involves the destruction of brain cells. These cells do not ‚Äúgrow back‚Äù or get better; they are gone. In fact, medical science doesn‚Äôt understand all of the reasoning either. From Wikipedia: ‚ÄúThe part of the brain most affected by Alzheimer's is the hippocampus. Other parts that show atrophy (shrinking) include the temporal and parietal lobes. Although this pattern suggests Alzheimer's, the brain shrinkage in Alzheimer's disease is variable, and a brain scan is not sufficient for diagnosis.‚Äù This Wikipedia entry describes my mother‚Äôs affliction to a T: ‚ÄúThere are six main types of FTD. The first has major symptoms in personality and behavior. This is called behavioral variant FTD (bv-FTD) and is the most common. In bv-FTD, the person shows a change in personal hygiene, becomes rigid in their thinking, and rarely acknowledges problems; they are socially withdrawn, and often have a drastic increase in appetite. They may become socially inappropriate. For example, they may make inappropriate sexual comments, or may begin using pornography openly. One of the most common signs is apathy, or not caring about anything. Apathy, however, is a common symptom in many dementias.‚Äù Oh, I could write a book about how mom checked every box in this list of symptoms. To be completely honest, there is no way to positively diagnose what particular dementia is unless a post-mortem. Any ‚Äúconclusion‚Äù as to what form of dementia a person has is determined by observed behavior and an MRI. Back to your question: the simple tasks a person has performed for many years are often the last to be lost. My mother (and my AD patient) would call friends and chat on the phone every day. They‚Äôd watch their favorite TV shows, knowing what buttons to press on the remote. My mom, who was in great shape physically, could manage to heat some soup on the stove or make toast. She alarmed me when her Keurig coffee maker ‚Äúbroke‚Äù then her flip phone ‚Äúbroke.‚Äù The coffee maker and her cell phone were the most recent skills she mastered, and they were the first to go. When my mother was hospitalized after an apparent stroke (her explanation as to what happened didn‚Äôt make sense) she had no concept of the new TV/emergency call button was. She‚Äôd ask me what it was when I visited. When mom was moved to an ‚ÄúAdult Care Unit‚Äù (designed to determine her level of care needed on release) she would throw away the emergency call button she wore; she didn‚Äôt know what it was. When she returned home with a (24/7 aide) she lost the ability to do anything. She had been away from her TV, coffee maker, phone- every gadget in the house. She also forgot how to dress (i.e., putting pants on her head). One day, her aide and I returned from an errand and found her in the kitchen crying, because she wanted a sandwich, but did not know the order: bread, meat, cheese, mayo, bread. She got the ingredients out of the fridge, but then she was stumped. However, both my mom and my friend with AD could carry on gossipy stories (in person and if we gave them a phone) that would never lead anyone to believe they were affected with dementia in the slightest! In fact, some of my mother‚Äôs friends actively ganged up on me to deny what her doctors had diagnosed: frontotemporal dementia. (Yeah, bad guy that I am, they still won‚Äôt speak to me, even at her Memorial.) I hope I‚Äôve not gone too far off track from your original question. Even dementia sites don‚Äôt hold an answer. There is a hereditary factor in some cases, but I have found zero consensus on how the brain deteriorates. Lots of guesses; but the fact remains that we just don‚Äôt know. Sorry! "

    "answer": "Alzheimer's disrupts processes vital to neurons and their networks, including communication, metabolism, and repair. At first, Alzheimer's disease typically destroys neurons and their connections in parts of the brain involved in memory, including the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. However, experts agree that Alzheimer's stems from the abnormal buildup of plaques (beta-amyloid protein fragments) between nerve cells in the brain. Through each Alzheimer's stage, tangled pieces of these plaques destroy more brain cells, eventually causing fatal damage. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Alzheimer's material there... "

    "answer": "This happened to my mother. She was a Social Services case worker. As my Dad put it, her job was to see to it that the right people received the taxes he paid. Many decades ago, a young single mother came into the office and basically was turned away by all the other case workers because she did not quite meet guidelines for help. She was stuck in the cracks of redtape, unemployed, with hungry children in a town with few prospects. My mother listened to her, and asked her to step outside for a minute while she made some phone calls. A few minutes later, she handed the woman a phone number and told her that the man who would be answering needed some help and would give her a chance. And then she told her, ‚Äòafter you get working, would you consider some classes to get your GED and go to the community college? It would really help you.‚Äô Fast forward. My father was visiting the nursing home where my mother was suffering from Alzheimers. She was in the last stages, had lost her sweet demeanor and had adopted a completely different aggressive personality, as is common with many forms of dementia. The nursing staff was frustrated with her and my father had to sometimes beg to get them to keep her there and take good care of her. One day he showed up at a different time, different shift. As he got to the room, he could hear a sweet voice talking to my mother very calmly, soothing her, and being very helpful. My father stood at the door for a moment and as the woman was leaving the room said, ‚ÄòI am sorry you have to see her like this, but thank you for treating her so kindly‚Äô. She then said with a bit of a twinkle. No thanks needed. Its the least I can do. Your wife saved me three decades ago from a very desperate situation when I had no money and no job. "

    "link": "https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-that-natural-selection-has-changed-drastically-or-completely-got-rid-of-in-humans",
    "answer": "About 2 million years ago, our ancestors lost a gene that allows us to produce a substance called Neu5Gc. Other apes retained this gene.[1]  The mutation eliminated the CMAH enzyme which creates a substance that coats many of our cells.  That mutation provided a selective advantage at the time but it was harmful in the long run. On account of it, modern people suffer from or are more susceptible to the following conditions.  Why did we lose that gene? The mutation probably helped our ancestors resist some disease. We don‚Äôt know the exact details but scientists think that hominids having the mutation were partly immune to some disease common at the time. The substance that this gene produces (Neu5Gc) coats our cells helping our immune system recognize our own cells and discouraging some viruses from attaching themselves to our cells. Some diseases, though, take advantage of these substances on our cells and use them to get inside and harm our cells. Men with the normal version of the gene had trouble having children. For a time, some people had the mutation while others lacked it. That created a problem because women with the mutation could develop an immune response to sperm having the gene. That meant that males having the normal version of the gene couldn‚Äôt always fertilize women with the mutated version.[2]  So, natural selection acted against anyone having the unmutated version of the gene. That evolutionary step was unfortunate. That mutation compromised our overall health. Scientists have reproduced the mutation in lab animals and found that the animals' health was impaired in various ways, including: Enhancement of cancer inflammation and progression of Neu5Gc containing tumors.Delayed skin wound healing,Enhanced age-related hearing loss.Altered susceptibility to metabolic disorders.Altered susceptibility to muscular dystrophy.We can‚Äôt easily resist some infectious diseases. Several modern diseases, like Streptococcus pneumonia, typhoid, cholera, and others infect people but not apes. Apes don‚Äôt suffer from these diseases because they still have the original version of the gene.[3]  All humans have anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. Although we can‚Äôt produce Neu5Gc, we get it in our diet and our cells use it. That leads to slight but chronic inflammation. This is probably the reason humans, but not animals, are prone to atherosclerosis.[4] Chronic inflammation also contributes to tumor inflammation and cancer progression.[5]  We aren‚Äôt 100% unique New World primates, Mustelidae, pinnipeds, Procyonidae, hedgehogs, bats from at least two different lineages, sperm whales, and white-tailed deer have also lost that function.[6] But we are the only land carnivore lacking that ability and eating meat seems to make that mutation harmful. Conclusion Natural selection operates on what is best for the given moment. It can‚Äôt plan for the future. Occasionally, it favors a mutation that provides a short-term advantage but a long-term disadvantage. That‚Äôs what seems to have happened with the CMAH mutation we all have. New Information Recent articles describe evidence that our ancestors evolved in response to this gene loss. These changes affect many other disease conditions including Alzheimer's, Preeclampsia, Diabetes, etc. Ancient microbial arms race sharpened our immune system‚Äîbut also left us vulnerable Multiple Genomic Events Altering Hominin SIGLEC Biology and Innate Immunity Predated the Common Ancestor of Humans and Archaic Hominins More to read These articles are informative but technical: Biochemical, Cellular, Physiological, and Pathological Consequences of Human Loss of N‚ÄêGlycolylneuraminic Acid Absence of Neu5Gc and Presence of Anti-Neu5Gc Antibodies in Humans‚ÄîAn Evolutionary Perspective From ‚ÄúSerum Sickness‚Äù to ‚ÄúXenosialitis‚Äù: Past, Present, and Future Significance of the Non-human Sialic Acid Neu5Gc Uniquely human evolution of sialic acid genetics and biology Human species-specific loss of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase enhances atherosclerosis via intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms Footnotes[1] Absence of Neu5Gc and Presence of Anti-Neu5Gc Antibodies in Humans‚ÄîAn Evolutionary Perspective[2] From ‚ÄúSerum Sickness‚Äù to ‚ÄúXenosialitis‚Äù: Past, Present, and Future Significance of the Non-human Sialic Acid Neu5Gc[3] Typhoid Mary, Not Typhoid Mouse - Healthcanal.com[4] Human species-specific loss of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase enhances atherosclerosis via intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms[5] From ‚ÄúSerum Sickness‚Äù to ‚ÄúXenosialitis‚Äù: Past, Present, and Future Significance of the Non-human Sialic Acid Neu5Gc[6] Absence of Neu5Gc and Presence of Anti-Neu5Gc Antibodies in Humans‚ÄîAn Evolutionary Perspective"

    "answer": "Korsakoff's syndrome, also known as 'Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome', is a non-progressive type of dementia which is most commonly caused by chronic alcohol abuse. For this reason, Korsakoff's syndrome is also widely regarded as being a form of alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD). Korsakoff syndrome is a chronic memory disorder caused by severe deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B-1). Korsakoff syndrome is most commonly caused by alcohol misuse, but certain other conditions also can cause the syndrome. Diagnosis.

    "question": "What is one picture that gave you chills? ",
    "link": "https://www.quora.com/What-is-one-picture-that-gave-you-chills",
    "answer": " What do you think this is? An artist‚Äôs slow progression to abstract art? Various depictions of the same man? No, these are the several self portraits drawn by an artist, William Utermohlen, who starts struggling with Alzheimer‚Äôs up until he finally dies with dementia. Is this immediately bone chilling? Perhaps not as much as looking into the steely eyes of a cold-blooded murderer or looking at pictures of people in concentration camps during the holocaust. No, this one is more about dread than it is about fear. Think about it. Every 4 seconds, a person somewhere in the world is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. By the time you‚Äôre done reading this answer, at least 20 more people will be given the news that they‚Äôre going to have to live with this for the rest of their lives. There is no cure for the disease, only treatments that can help stop its progression.  Imagine this. You wake up on a seemingly perfect day, unusually tired. Your husband comes in with a tray full of breakfast, beaming up at you. His little eye dimples crinkle against his smooth tan skin. This is the man I love, you think to yourself. You smile and think about how you‚Äôre so lucky to have the life that you have. ‚ÄúDo you think we‚Äôll go around to Daisy‚Äôs office today?‚Äù, he asks brushing the stray strands of hair on your face away. Who the hell is Daisy? you think to yourself. The name rings a bell in your heart while your brain is foggy, but you know that you know someone like that. So you simply smile and nod.   Months pass and by now, you keep forgetting little things; your phone number, your address, people‚Äôs names. They seem like isolated mishaps to you. Missing puzzle pieces. But it‚Äôs not uncommon. It‚Äôs probably the fact that you‚Äôll be 54 this year. So you simply continue.   One day, you wander into the living room in the middle of the night and don‚Äôt recognize where you are. The place feels cold and isolated and lonely. Its crevices hide secrets that scream at you but you can‚Äôt hear any of them. Your brain feels like it‚Äôs stuck amidst rising fog. The walls seem to least confuse you. So you stare at them instead. They stare back at you, but they don‚Äôt speak. They don‚Äôt ask you to remember. You start to feel thirsty so you move unsteadily through the place you once called home hoping to stumble into the kitchen. You search for glasses in every cabinet. You seem to have forgotten, so you pick up the wine glass at the edge of the kitchen top. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt sleep?‚Äù, your husband asks you from behind. You flinch and throw the wine glass reflexively. Who is this man? You don‚Äôt know this man. So you scream.   You don‚Äôt know, but your Hippocampus slowly wastes away and the memories you keep close feel threatening, almost. Lies, threats and confabulation become a daily part of your life. What is even really real, anymore? You don‚Äôt know who anyone is. Your supposed daughter, your supposed grandson, your supposed husband. Who are these people and why do they look at you with concern? You ask the same questions every single day, digging for answers, trying to clasp fleeting memories with your feeble, wrinkled hands. The line between reality and confabulation blurs. One day you‚Äôre Samantha, who has a beautiful grandson named Milo. Another day, you wake up to a room full of strangers.  You get seemingly angry over nothing. You have fits and rages. It‚Äôs better than just silence , they tell you. Some days, you hold onto the warmth that your home brings you, sitting by the fireplace looking at the strings of photographs that fill the walls. These days you‚Äôre sure that this is the family that truly loves you. You try to hold on to the feeling. Other days, you rock back and forth in the middle of the night, lost in one of the bathrooms, unable to find your way back. Lost in this maze of a house.  You look into the mirror but you don‚Äôt know the woman staring back at you. There are pictures and memories, but they‚Äôre not yours. Slowly, though, you learn to trust. You can‚Äôt hold conversations but you try. You smile occasionally and say things that make no sense. But instead of hostility, you are welcomed with fond chuckles and a little boy‚Äôs shout of ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre funny, Nana.‚Äù At this, you beam radiantly. Strangers could never love and love so much. So you trust. You allow them to hold your hand, although sometimes it feels cold and clammy and foreign. Sometimes, they feel repulsive and invading. Other times, they are reminders to remember. Or rather, to try to remember. They feel warm and welcoming and convivial and familiar. Tiny hands grasp your wrinkled ones and shake with mirth as they say, ‚ÄùGranny‚Äôs back!‚Äù Maybe, not forever, you think. But for now. Just for now. So you smile and squeeze back with the little strength you have. And that‚Äôs enough. For now.  "

    "answer": "Early-onset cases of Alzheimer's often progress more quickly than other forms. ... That's because the genetic mutations than can cause early-onset Alzheimer's lead to a greater production of amyloid-beta, the protein fragments that build up into plaques and are associated with Alzheimer's disease. This is the most common form of the disease, which happens to people age 65 and older. It may or may not run in families. So far, researchers haven't found a particular gene that causes it.

    "answer": "While Alzheimer's disease is not spread through contact with others, some research with mice seems to indicate that it could have some type of an infectious component, possibly related to prions (proteins that brain cells need to function).

    "question": "Why do so many people dislike George Clooney? ",
    "link": "https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-people-dislike-George-Clooney",
    "answer": " Mr. and Mrs. Clooney. What‚Äôs not to dislike? George is handsome. He has a full head of hair. He‚Äôs got a beautiful, brainy, high-achieving wife and two healthy kids. He owns a house in the Hollywood Hills, an estate on the River Thames, and a sun-splashed abode on the shores of Lake Como. And he‚Äôs entertained the rich and the famous in all three. He's also headlined some profitable, well-received films, starred in one of the breakout television series of the 1990s, and written and directed A-list movie projects whenever the mood has struck him. Plus he and the missus have a net worth that hovers somewhere north of half a billion dollars. But let‚Äôs be honest: here‚Äôs what gets most of the hate hackles up. Mr. Clooney wears his politics on his sleeve, and his politics are Liberal and Democratic which, in the current age, means half the population regards you as ‚Äúthe enemy.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs his barbed, unkind joke about Charlton Heston from 2003:\"Charlton Heston announced 'again' today that he is suffering from Alzheimer's.\" Clooney subsequently wrote a letter of apology to Heston and his wife. Still, the remark was repugnant and counterproductive, though our current President has shown that repugnant comments are no hindrance to getting ahead. (And thus, not necessarily counterproductive?) Here, in the 21st century, many entertainers stake out their political positions, attend rallies, make endorsements, and let the brickbats bounce where they may. Seventy-five years ago, personalities like Bob Hope and Bing Crosby kept their politics out of the public square. Their reasoning: Why alienate a large segment of the movie-going, radio-listening, record-buying public if you don‚Äôt have to? Obviously things have changed a bit. The Dixie Chicks lost half their fan base when they said, on a London stage, they were ‚Äúashamed‚Äù of George Bush. Country singer Shania Twain said nice things about Donald Trump, retracted a lot of them, and managed to alienate fans on both sides of the political spectrum. This only goes to prove that people with too much time on their hands take the trivial spewings of film and recording stars way more seriously than they should. Me, I don‚Äôt give three figs about other people‚Äôs politics. George C. can have as many causes as he likes; I‚Äôll still enjoy his movies. (I watch John Wayne and Jane Fonda films with equal pleasure. And why not? The Duke is long dead; the dustup in Vietnam was a long time ago, and Jane‚Äôs made apologies for sitting on that gun mount. Shall we move on?) People want to dislike an actor or singer. It's better to dislike them for work badly done and leave it at that. When individuals work themselves into high dudgeon over a public personality‚Äôs statements, politics, or beliefs it can lead to bad things. "

    "answer": " This is Harley. Harley belonged to a co-worker of my son‚Äôs best friend and room mate back in 2007. He was seven months old and chained up outside all the time. He was a Dobie/brown Lab mix so full of energy that he‚Äôd knock you down with his exuberance. He had no manners what so ever but full of love. My son‚Äôs room mate took him in when his co-worker could no longer keep him. The boys were hard workers and their place was not fenced in so Harley had to stay inside when they were at work. After he ate their couch I offered to dog sit during the day when they were at work and try to teach him a little manners also. Then my other son came home from Afghanistan and he took Harley with him when he set up his household. A year latter he came down on orders again for Afghanistan again and Harley was back with me again and this time to stay. He hadn‚Äôt suffered any for his travels. My son had even taken him to some additional training and he was still the same affable loving dog. He just had some more manners then he used to. In 2007 my husband was diagnosed with early onset of Alzheimer or Dementia. When Harley came home at first he was just another pet. My husbands disease progressed at a fast pace. Walking the dog served a duel purpose for the dog and the husband. Later it occurred to me that with a little more training Harley could be more of a service dog and be even more helpful. As the years passed Harley helped me by laying on my husband while he sat in his easy chair. This would calm him, make him smile and he would pet Harley and it would keep him from wondering off. On our walks Harley would walk my husband keeping him on path and from walking into a street without me if he managed to walk a head of me. One time my husband managed to wonder off from me when we were outside in the front yard but I had Harley on a leash and my husband was holding it. I couldn‚Äôt find them. I had to call the police to help me find them. To say I was beside my self was putting it lightly. Harley‚Äôs collar had a tag on it that said, ‚ÄúIf I get lost please call this number‚Äù. Someone found my husband and Harley and called me. Towards the end, 2016 the doctor told me my husband wouldn‚Äôt last more then six months. Harley started having problems too and I took him to the vet and he was diagnosed with cancer and he received the same diagnosis of six months. My husband died five days latter. Harley stayed with me for seven months. I needed to get away for awhile. I went to see my mother and I took Harley with me. We did a bucket list trip stopping on the way to see things I‚Äôd never been able to see. I stopped to visit with a friend. I went to the badlands and Mount Rushmore and a few other places along the way and Harley came with me. He was a good dog, a good friend. He was helpful, loving and he helped me endure when I needed to. A month after we got home Harley joined my husband. I really wish they both could have stayed longer. I miss them. "

    "answer": "I will answer two ways: 1) clinical experience as a neurologist, 2) watching what happened to my dad. The patient who begins to deteriorate from Alzheimer type dementia typically denies it. The patient doesn‚Äôt see it (generally). The patient will commonly use excuses like ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt paying attention‚Äù or ‚Äúthat didn‚Äôt really happen‚Äù. Another common early sign is relative anomia - the patient looses the names of common objects. (Don‚Äôt go overboard with this. We all forget things at times. It has to be more than normal, and in age some of this is normal.) Another common sign is behavioral change, such as long-standing interests becoming dropped. (Again, we do evolve changing interests over time; so, don‚Äôt go overboard with this.)The first thing I saw in my dad was after he had a surgery. He was looking out the window of his hospital room, at a sloping hill in the distance, and he thought it was a ski run (a belief that was not appropriate for the visual elements or the circumstance). Within a few months he began to have the above.If the person being considered is elderly remember that the brain is not protected from aging. It gets old like the rest of us does. In neurology we used to talk about ‚Äúsenile dementia‚Äù - meaning the dementia of aging. However, that doesn‚Äôt sell drugs.

She had a cat and I had two dogs, one of which was in love with her cat Kitty. This arrangement continued for several years. After her husband passed away, we sold her house and she moved into senior apartments and I moved back to my house with my two dogs. The senior apartments she picked allowed you to have a small pet if you have one when you move in but you are not allowed a replacement. I thought she would keep Kitty but she said that she didn't feel capable to properly care for Kitty and would like for me to keep him (yes, Kitty was actually a male). When I lived with my aunt, I was the one who cleaned the litterbox and took him to the vet when needed but he always spent his nights with my aunt. Deep down, I figured that my aunt was right, Kitty would be better off with me so i accepted. Kitty changed when he moved in with me. When we were all living at my aunt‚Äôs house, he rebuffed my dog Natasha‚Äôs affections and his focus was only aunt. When he lived with me and my two dogs, he fell head over heals in love with my dog Natasha. The same dog he rebuffed for years. A few months later, I was offered a job sever states away. I knew moving with two dogs and a cat would be difficult so I bought a RV to live in while I found a house. My senior dog, Calico, is on the floor. While we lived in the RV, the attraction between Kitty (whom I renamed Little Guy) and Natasha blossomed. Here is a photo of them on the RV‚Äôs bed. My aunt was right. Passing Kitty on to me was the right thing to do and my two dogs and I loved having him in our family.  "

    "question": "Why would readers of Trump's niece Mary's family tell-all be blown away by what she has to share about POTUS before he became the president? What could be shocking about Donald Trump that is not already known? ",
    "link": "https://www.quora.com/Why-would-readers-of-Trumps-niece-Marys-family-tell-all-be-blown-away-by-what-she-has-to-share-about-POTUS-before-he-became-the-president-What-could-be-shocking-about-Donald-Trump-that-is-not-already-known",
    "answer": "Okay, so here‚Äôs what we know Let‚Äôs start with Donald‚Äôs father Fred Trump, who, although maybe not a billionaire, was very wealthy and as far as we can tell, was a competent businessman if a bit of an a-hole. Fred had five children - Donald, Fred Jr., Maryanne, Elizabeth and Robert. Donald and Robert both went into real estate and Robert still runs the family trust, which manages Fred‚Äôs properties. Maryanne went into law, Elizabeth went into banking. And here‚Äôs where our story starts, with Fred Jr. Fred didn‚Äôt fit into the real estate business so he trained to be a pilot, and he was a good one, flying for Pan-Am. However, he died of alcoholism in 1981 at the age of 42. Mary is his daughter. During the 18 years between Fred Jr.‚Äôs death in 1981 and his own death in 1999, it becomes clear that Fred is worried about Donald‚Äôs business acumen. During this time, Fred often has to bail out his son when he gets into financial trouble. In one case, he broke the law to do so - he bought chips at a Trump casino (which, under New Jersey law, have priority status in an insolvency) with no intention of using them. It appears Fred didn‚Äôt want Donald running any part of his real estate holdings for fear that Donald would use them to secure Donald‚Äôs debts. That‚Äôs why Robert runs those holdings now. By 1993, Fred was suffering from Alzheimers and was unable to run any portion of his business. At some point in those 18 years, Fred also cuts Fred Jr.‚Äôs family out of the will and the family trust set up for the benefit of his descendants. That set up the legal dispute which was settled and led to the non-disclosure agreement. Mary was in her early 30s at the time, and needed help for her brother, Fred III, whose son, William, had cerebral palsy. So, being the lead plaintiff, Mary would have had access to all the necessary financial disclosure. The most likely embarrasing disclosure is that Trump actually has very few assets, and what assets he has are saddled by more debt than what the properties are actually worth. Far from being a ‚Äúbillionaire‚Äù, he‚Äôs actually under water. Second, Donald survives from squeezing his assets for cash to finance his lifestyle. In other words, there is only enough money coming out of the properties to cover debt payments and nothing to actually pay down the debts. It‚Äôs possible that his loans are ‚Äúinterest only‚Äù and that he‚Äôs expected to pay the entire amount upon maturity, most of which we know will happen over the next five years. It could be that the sale of Donald‚Äôs interest in the properties won‚Äôt even come close to paying the debt (Trump has a habit of borrowing more than the buildings are actually worth). Trump could also be involved in an elaborate Ponzi scheme - he uses financing from a large project to keep making payments on loans on smaller projects. As long as he can convince investors to give him new and bigger loans, he can keep up the facade. Or it could be that Donald doesn‚Äôt actually own anything. Donald‚Äôs sole source of income could be from management contracts on buildings that have his name on them. That was the case for the Trump International Tower in Toronto which he managed, but had no financial interest in. It‚Äôs since been sold for the value of its debts, wiping out all equity in the project, and Trump‚Äôs name has been removed. So, this book could do to Donald Trump what ‚ÄúThe Big Short‚Äù did to collateralized debt obligations - show that they‚Äôre always on the brink of collapse - a giant jenga tower built on top of other jenga towers  "

    "link": "https://www.quora.com/Why-havent-we-figured-out-what-causes-Alzheimers-yet",
    "answer": "Alzheimer's is likely not simply the result of one cause, but rather a combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors, Patira told Live Science. For example, a mutation in a gene called ApoE is thought to increase a person's risk for developing late-onset Alzheimer's, but it does not cause it, Patira said. Alzheimer's disease is thought to be caused by the abnormal build-up of proteins in and around brain cells. One of the proteins involved is called amyloid, deposits of which form plaques around brain cells. The other protein is called tau, deposits of which form tangles within brain cells.

    "answer": "No. Microwaves just heat food. This is simply another one of those absurd scare stories/rumours that malicious people like to spread. Dementia has several causes but Alzheimer's, the best known form of dementia to laymen and laywomen, is caused by the build up of certain proteins in brain cells that lead to the formation of plaques. The cause is not known but the disease existed well before the development of microwave ovens. Alzheimer's is an age-related disease and the increase in the incidence of it has been directly linked to longer life expectancy. The other form of dementia that many people have heard of is vascular dementia. As I understand it, this is caused by the partial blockage of arterial blood vessels of all sizes serving the brain. "

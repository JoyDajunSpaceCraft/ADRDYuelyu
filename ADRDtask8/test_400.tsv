Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes Hi! My niece took our car, and it had Mom’s lift belt in it. I cannot get it back. I used the belt to help my Mom in and out of cars (from a car seat to her walker or chair). Can anyone recommend a replacement that I can order from Amazon? I have the chair at it’s maximum height setting, so I’m wondering how to get better traction for her feet. We have a walk-in shower but I’m starting to wonder how many more weeks it will be practical for her. I've found that the fancy ones with the hand grips and different features are too slippery and open up making it a fall risk.My dad uses this shower chair which sits much farther out so that he can sit while outside the shower, spin his legs around, and scoot over.Also early on in his recovery my dad had issues lifting his legs and walking. It does need someone to assist. They can be fairly easy to get on and off, and pairs I've used in the past are pretty grippy. Crocs. They make slippers that work well for my dad as shower shoes. My preference for a gait belt is the one with various handles as it gives me more options by which to grip a patient without hurting them.As for showers, look into getting a transfer bench. I have one elderly, below the knee amputee and that is how I get her in and out of the shower. The shower has a handheld so she can essentially rinse herself off, after I soap her up.	0
Caregiving with Technology Hello AllI am a 27 year old caregiver to two elederly grandparents and two aunts with Parkinson’s. Me and my wife take turns feeding and helping around the house, I’ve noticed that Alexa has a lot of skills that could be useful for elderly folks. Asking for weather, time, calling family etc etc. My boyfriend (30m) became quadriplegic a few years ago, and we’ve really embraced the Echo in our house.We use Eufy lightbulbs from Amazon with yellow-to-white options. We had the standard one at first, but the ability to have white light during the day and yellow light at night really made a difference We also have some compatible plugs for small appliances like the humidifier. And a fire tv for the bedroom, fire cube for the tv in the living room. That way both can turn on the tv and control volume through Alexa. Your idea sounds great, but be prepared to be met with blank stares. But please give it a try, and keep us informed!	0
Plz help,from 3rd world, neurologists and psychiatrists unable to give proper time and treatment due to covid Im in the most painful and complex situation of my life, father dementia worsened after couple of years and seems mother also apparently has some sort of dementia but so far no neurologist or psychiatrist have been able to properly diagnose.Im only child and barely able to care for both due to fatigue and own mental health issues. Not much help from others as its chaos here due to covid and du to fear cant hire nurse and tbh cant afford it  Im in a 3rd world country, Pakistan and due to covid, treatment and diagnosis almost impossible, dilemma is most experts advice antipsychotics for her extreme anxiety and agitation but im afraid as fda warnimg says it can be fatal if she actually has dementia. I have videos of her that i can share in pm to respect our privacy, hope to find proper treatment, memantine gives me hope but must check from a neurologist as mother also has comorbids  like hypertension and copd diabetes and donepezil an rivistagine patch is contraindicated etcUnable to get MRI after repeated tries as she becomes agitated and sedation ia contraindicated due to copd. COULD NOT TEST OR REMEMBER HOW HER MEMORY WAS. **MOBILITY WAS ACTUALLY NOT VERY MUCH SINCE 2 YEARS+, ESPECIALLY AFTER FATHER HAD TO BE ADMITTED IN HOSPITAL FOR 50 DAYS WHEN HE HAD MULTI STROKES AND DEMENTIA AND CPM CENTRAL PONTINE MYLOSIS AND RECOVERED FROM RECORD LOW SODIUM 101 COUPLE OF YEARS AGO--++++++++++MAIN REASON FOR LESS MOBILITY, SINCE 2 YEARS ESPECIALLY WAS EXTREME BACK PAIN AND BREATHLESSNESS, WEAKNESS.	0
I think I just need to know I'm not alone Sorry if the format is weird. In fact my sister is here already to help out....but she's working from home and now I am our Dad's full time caregiver. We also didn't really have a choice because no care facility in my state would take him. I'm stretched so thin I don't have the emotional capacity to deal with anything else. I don't know what to do anymore. His care and therapy are my priority. To ask for advice? I don't know what to do anymore. Even if it's only on her off days. Even if it's only 2-3 days of you not being responsible for everything. You need off time. You need time to do literally whatever you want. Worse driving while you're burnt out and you may literally not see the cars on side streets because you're so tired and stressed out. I've done the double take and been unable to tell if it was my turn or they came up after I checked both ways. You don't know how it is going to affect you exactly. It's not even your fault as you're doing your best with the resources you have. But I think sometimes I need to be told things many times by many people, even strangers on the internet. I'm lucky to have people willing to help if I ask for it. Sincerely, thank you. So even if I can't say anything that will truly help, I can guarantee you that your are not alone. Can you find an at-home caregiver service that could come part of the time to relieve you? I know that can be pricey, though, and especially without long-term care insurance. Thanks! I think we can look into it. Even if it's not on a regular basis, any reprieve would probably help at this point. We're working on upgrading his insurance and getting him social security benefits to help pay for stuff like an at home nurse. We're not struggling financially just yet, but we're not at great place. Hopefully SS and his insurance will be able to help. We cried, we hugged, and she's looking into all kinds of stuff for me, like respite care--where his insurance covers someone to come over for a day.	0
THANK GOD before things got bad I had her sign a POA and started diving into her finances when she was officially diagnosed with dementia because it occurred to me she maybe wasn’t paying her bills. I found huge credit card debits, HELOCs, loans, no savings etc etc. I also found she stashed her bills into a drawer and was on the verge of having all her services cut off because she simply forgot to pay her bills. I caught her up to date on everything and consolidated her high interest credit card debt and quickly paid it off. I decided to sell her home of 30 years, the house I sort of grew up in, and most of her possessions because I realized, I could not live in and take care of her daily needs full time. My student loans prevent me from not working too. The other stressor was that her home sold in 11 DAYS, and I had one weekend to sell EVERYTHING. My grandma couldn’t afford an estate sale company, so i spent a solid 72 hours on pure adrenaline selling furniture and all the crap she was semi-hoarding. Her extra clothes, photo albums, family docs, and a few China sets are currently piled in my closet. I have now set up her nursing home to be paid for the next three years on private pay thanks to the sale of her home and estate and then she will be on government assistance. Why am I here? It is too late. Caring for our loved ones with dementia is so hard, and their lives are so complicated. It sounds like you have taken marvelous care of her and done all the right things. At this point, I'd be focused on using as much of her money as possible to make her comfortable and happy. This is a good group to hear similar stories and get support. You’ve done a remarkable job so far despite the obstacles! The best thing to do is find a community that understands what you (all of us) are going through and offer support, you came to the right place. Virtual hugs! !	0
Need help with things I can do to make this easier Hi all. If I could find something that would help her stand and to help hold her up, then it wouldn't be such a major hassle to get her pants on. They aren't too expensive and they have lots of handles on them to help steady someone and help them transfer. There are some YouTube videos. We went through this a few years back with my father, who now has managed to rehab up enough that on good days he can walk around the house without his walker even. At this point, the best option would be to get her back into some PT. You may be able to do this with just a phone call to her doctor to see if you can get physical therapy to come to her at home. That way, PT can also assess her other needs and get her strengthened up a bit more too to hopefully prolong these things from happening, rather than making her adapt. I'd recommend a gait belt if you don't already have one. If she cannot do that, you can do the upper half of the body still on the commode, and the lower half you may have to do while she lays on the bed, with her laying on one side while you pull up the other side that you can access, and have her roll then to the other side and repeat. There may be some lower cost ones available, but even the ones used professionally are used between multiple people.As for the incontinence, if you can get her to the commode on a schedule, it can start to help too, even if she says she doesn't need to go right then, the body learns. They are all over.the bathroom, by the bed, they are more than just handy in the usual spots. They give something to hold onto by the portable comode. These ones are similar to the ones we use: https://www.silverts.com/short-sleeve-hospital-gowns-for-women?___store=english&size=7120&color=5935&cur=usd&gclid=CjwKCAiAhbeCBhBcEiwAkv2cY-Jor3cK_PsLN5gNNya0ZzXptg_N7pJV8V1g_wYuP87c7TlcskiUhBoCUmYQAvD_BwE Have you tried any of the suggestions in the comments? We have floor to ceiling grab bars beside the bed and toilet.	0
Did someone noticed a decline in cognitive functions after covid vaccine? !I'm not anti vax! Is it just a coincidence?Does someone have experience with people with dementia/alzheimer that received the vaccine? Did you notice the symptoms getting worse? He said No, but added that his residents got the Pfizer shot.I will ask another facility of their experience.My parents have dementia and are set to get the 2nd dose in less than two weeks. Yesterday she had big problems with making her dinner whereas it was not a problem before, it's like during the past too weeks it's getting worse rapidly and we're very worried I heard back from another facility with 20 memory care residents. They noticed fatigue, weakness, and sore arms.They did, however, notice cognitive decline in those who caught the virus, which makes sense.I noticed my mother with Alzheimer's can decline very rapidly from any sort of stress, whether mental or physical (or a bad night's sleep, for example).Hope your loved one bounces back and has some better days! Pregnancy hormones soften your ligaments and increase the risk of strain in your body.The position of your baby in labour putting pressure on your pelvis (FYI more people who have ‘back labour’ have epidurals.Not being careful when you pick up and carry stuff after the birth, those car seats people carry about don’t exactly scream good for your back when you are trying to cart them around. She has not had any decline since the vaccinations. I really feel like the pandemic itself and her not getting out of the house at all really, especially in the winter,  was possibly contributory to her decline. She has good days and bad but isn't anywhere near where she used to be even on her best days. Shes only 65. She also randomly fell in the middle of the night the same night she got her 2nd dose.	0
"What tech should I get to keep dad safe? Granny cam? Alexa/Google device?? He is going against everyone's advice and not moving into the main building where there is ample care, so what tech should I be looking for? I am going to have to hire psw care for him, and I'm a little concerned about strangers in his unit when I am not able to be there. I've got my eye on a ""seniors"" clock that displays the time, date  and what part of the day it is (morning/afternoon/evening), and I intend to set up medical alert system with a necklace and call button, but I'm thinking about a video camera of some sort. Do I just get a video baby monitor? I remember seeing old posts over a year ago about doing this, wondering how those systems are working for others. Thanks everyone.I got a couple Echo's for my parents' apartment and set up the emergency calling. I'm using a couple of Blink mini cams now for more than six months. They can be set to motion trigger if armed, which I use at night to monitor for intrusion and also to make sure that my dad is getting up every day, or you can just use the phone app to pop in and view as needed. They also support 2 way audio which I was thinking could be helpful in the event of a fall -- I'd be able to announce that I'm calling for help, for example. This might or might not work ok for monitoring of a busier residence where you want to have video of what helpers are doing because it's not a continuous video monitoring solution -- it's better for more of a burst of activity solution. We have ring cameras set up for my 94yo mom and they're working pretty well - they detect motion. Mom likes to put a cloth over the camera in her room for when she changes. We have 4 cameras set up plus the ring doorbell (3bdrm, 3 level home). Get a few wyze cameras (you can talk through them also, they allow memory cards so you can scrub the video ). Get a ring peep hole camera or door bell camera so you are alerted if he comes or goes. clock and he loves it. I'm a former executive director for assisted living. I've used my Google Home cameras and can broadcast/view my folks' house in Florida from anywhere. :) Some of the personal emergency companies have devices which will detect a fall and can alert EMS. GreatCall comes to mind, but I'm sure LifeAlert and others have options. Fairly inexpensive (in the $50/mo range). Artificial intelligence can learn his routine, recognize unusual sounds (including noticing that his voice seems distressed/happy, or there's an unknown person in the unit), and can alert the family. Not sure if they're marketing to the public yet, but a particular product comes to mind. I know they're available through a home care company. If you're interested, I'll reach out and get more info for you."	0
"What is the most important information to tell the geriatric psychiatrist about my mother? After years and years and YEARS of literally thinking this would never happen. The head nurse of home care was concerned about my mother's mental health and submitted a referral to Senior's Mental Health services. The mental health nurse she's met with told me they are concerned about her mood/depression and memory issues.She has an appointment coming up in 2 weeks. I'm going to highlight: her initial diagnosis 20 years ago (but I'm not the best witness because I was 12 when this all started 20 years ago), her poor hygiene, lack of concern about her physical well being (I had to take her to the hospital for her foot injury, she let it sit for a week and did nothing, it got so bad she had to be admitted for an infection), self medicating with alcohol for a number of years... She absolutely REFUSES because she thinks it is beyond rude of them to ask! I know for a fact she does telephone banking, she takes care of her ""investments"" (not much, but still), she has a good idea of how much money she HAS. That way if the question, ""Do you have any further questions"" comes up, you are still clear and concise with more info to flesh out the situation..  Best wishes to you. Every concern of yours, the nurse’s, etc. Then copy that document & start editing it down. The doctor needs to know why you’re sending it in advance. The doctor isn’t allowed to share your mom’s medical info with you (until she’s given them written permission or you have POA) BUT you sure as heck can give the doctor all of the information that you want to about her. Take a copy of your email to the appointment. The doctor may or may not want them. I put my questions on paper. What's important for the Doctor to know and what's something only you can really understand are both important things. Some of the information may be more useful to you than it is to the Doctor."	0
He has issues with the phone (they just got a landline with pictures of family on the buttons) and even with Alexa reminders every hour of where my mom went tonight, he had the neighbors call the police. My mom is determined to avoid memory care and keep him at home, but if these instances continue I’m afraid she’ll isolate.Alzheimer's patients should never be left alone. My dad was the worst about wondering off when we was just diagnosed and in early stages. Between my brother, husband and myself we've been able to work it out. I dont know what stage of illness OP's dad is in but it sounds like he is at the stage that leaving him alone places him at risk. Agree.	0
"Instructions idea needed dad has come to the point where he will think his phone runs the TV and sometimes that the remote is his phone. I can really tape or attach anything to the devices themselves. Only idea I have is to take a pic of each and make a how-to poster of what it is and how to use it. I can make signs and such but he will forget to look. Although the remote is simple to use he would navigate the apps differently. Anyone faced this and found something to work? No idea if hes just vegging or he forgot how to turn it on. Will drop in in a few and get it going.thanksDoes he consistently use all three of those apps? if not Id consider getting the ""flipper"" or other dementia-friendly remote-- they are much larger than other remotes and only have a few buttons. There are some remotes that have pictures of  the app names (nexflix, hulu, prime are on mine) but you might have better luck just switching over to a basic cable that's always on and getting a simple remote. Our cable company had a senior-friendly remote included when we switched. Now we rarely have problems, though she does sometimes point the remote the wrong way (a red arrow taped to the control may be a good solution if that becomes an issue)As far as the phone, I found a flip phone is much less likely to be confused for a remote (or sat down and lost because it just looks like a shiny black box). Thank you   he had a flip phone but he said it was difficult to open in time. no lockscreen. he used to have basic cable but was more expensive. he has a smart TV and Hulu, Prime and the Youtube app, along with the other lesser apps. What I considered is taking a pic of his devices and doing a poster and labeling one phone and one remote. I dont think it will help to write directions on how to get to the different channels. part of his issue is he just clicks buttons without knowing where his thumb is at. There is a voice search on Youtube but it isnt very good and he doesnt speak clearly. If I could get one with a button to get each app then maybe. he likes to search around all of em. Thank you I labeled the remotes and phone last night and he was watching TV when i got up. bad days are going to be a challenege no matter what. Or you have some monitoring abilities it sounds like? If you have smart home stuff (like google home/chromecast devices) you may be able to set it up so you can turn the tv on yourself, remotely, if you see he is struggling. he doesnt use the search function he just browses around til he finds something. Ive tried doing a favorites on each service but Youtube always signs him out and he doesnt understand what to do. I generally check on him about once an hour and if I see he's on a weird place I go help. :/"	0
My husband, 16 month old daughter, and I moved in with them last October for various reasons. Other than that though, he’s surprisingly healthy considering how poorly he takes care of himself. My husband works full time, doesn’t get home until 10 or 11pm. I am a full time stay at home mom with our daughter. The original arrangement was to be a mutually beneficial living situation. My dad though, is going to make me lose it. In my 25 years of life I have never seen him wash a single dish, he couldn’t even make ice if he tried, and he has straight up told me that he has no interest in learning how to do anything. I buy sandwich stuff, microwave meals, and I always make enough food that there’s always left overs for him to warm up. (Side note: they were the ones that wanted us to move in with them. They begged for months before we finally did.) They even had my aunt come and deep clean everything before we moved in. I can smell it when I walk out of our room. I don’t know how to get through to them. When we move, I worry my dad will go days without eating or only eating chips and snacks when mom has bad days and can’t cook for him. Any kind words, ideas, or just support is greatly appreciated. /:Most towns and cities have senior's centers. Contact them and as for resources on setting boundaries and increasing independence. Those centers also have social workers who can help with accessing services. You can't do it all on your own. And set it up. Caregiver burnout is a real thing, and you have said yourself that you are struggling. It sounds like your mother needs a thorough check up from a specialist for older people. But mostly you need to get services in and get support to set boundaries. When my mother had her mastectomy, I was 21 and working 6-7 days a week running an animal clinic. I’m definitely going to try to get in touch with our local senior center. Feels my only options are to stay here and be miserable or abandon them. Senior's centers deal every day with situations like yours. Thank you so much for taking the time to think and type all of this out for me. You’ve helped a lot and I really appreciate it. They're supposed to be really nutrious, high in calories, and he seems to enjoy drinking it.If you leave the house, you can at least call them and tell them to each drink a bottle. Maybe some pre-made fruit plates that can be stored in the fridge and taken out whenever can come in handy? (although they might not want fruit, which is a different issue)I recommend ensures wholeheartedly though.Good luck to you and your family <3 I’m seeing a lot of “battles” in your post. Some are worth fighting IMO, and some aren’t. The latter list is already a massive undertaking. I feel like I’m just so fed up I’ve lost sight of what’s really important and what isn’t. What I’ve learned is that one can suggest, help in some situations, try to hire outside help, but if the elderly do not want to change their habits, if it counterproductive to continue to bang your head against the wall. It's time to set some hard boundaries. Look into elder services in your area, try to organize help. Being a caretaker for a child is a full time job that I still haven’t figured out how anyone can do and have a job at the same time. Having to also deal with aging parents and their medical challenges and mental states on top of that isn’t sustainable. I’ve found the hero Medicine machine to be useful for my family about giving out meds on time - although I hate the monthly price it’s been a life saver. :( I will definitely look into the medicine machine, thank you! !I know, I really don’t know what to do. Of course we need your help. Hey an elder care attorney!!!! He needs to know how his lack of taking any action or trying to help at all is causing you so much stress that you’re seriously considering on moving out. That yeah, you know the situation sucks and it’s not fair, but mom isn’t well and she needs him to step up too!He’s needs to know that he’s showing through his actions that he doesn’t care about you and the unnecessary stress he’s adding to your plate through making you into a slave when he’s a very capable man, nor does he care about your daughter and his wife by continuing to smoke in the house!Tell him that if he can’t chip in and stop smoking, you’re leaving. Maybe hearing some tough love and realizing that he might have to get separated from his wife, daughter, and grandchild might motivate him to help get up and do something! Is he afraid that he will leave burners on? If you can find that out, that’s at least somewhere you can start, be it in getting him into therapy, purchasing gadgets specific for seniors living at home (special can/jar openers, timers, alert systems, etc. ), or giving him some basic lessons in how to operate the microwave and stovetop, and leaving brightly colored index cards with instructions posted on the kitchen cabinet doors.I’m so sorry, OP, that you’re parents are being so stubborn and hope that you will stick up for yourself and your family!	0
Also I prob taken a few good knocks in that time but did not put my lights out.I perused running and ran track and field logging in about 60 miles a week from ages 18-23. Yet this fog came in abruptly on Aug 18. I always tend to think the worst however this fog has been over me since Aug 18 and has not let up. Brain fog is now a well documented long term side effect of COVID, unfortunately. I had these symptoms prior to Covid so I don’t think it’s Covid. Haven’t expressed my concerns yet to my neurologist in terms of CTE bc I thought it was dementia but I def will next time I see them. I was lucky I had a baseline done after a major head injury so comparing later to cognitive issues was easy.Post-concussion recovery and CTE/Dementia Pugilistica are two very different things. Unfortunately neurologists are not omni-scient (knowing EVERYTHING). That brain fog can be brought on by many other things, and (other than dementia symptoms) i have personally experienced brain fog from FibroMyalgia (abbreviated FMS) and from Celiac Disease (which causes problems from eating Gluten -- as in products with wheat, rye, or barley).i have a friend with dementia whose TBI injuries were due to martial arts. if you are on FaceBook i could probably connect you.	0
I used to come twice a year but because of covid, its been over a year since I last saw her. Any tips I should know? not sure if I should keep track of the times she goes so I don't forget, or even how much water I should give her. Pretty much any advice would be greatly appreciated.We are not at this stage but I always thought a bidet would help. I'm unfortunately needed to look into long term care for mine and it's been very hard to come to terms with this decision. Wishing you much luck. I know I don't know you but you can always talk to me thru here. It helps a bit having a community of people going thru the same. In regards to your question about water, it varies but its close to 2 liters of water a day is the recommended value for a woman.My dads insurance covered getting a nutritionist for my dad so long as his primary care doctor referred him to one. It only took one $15 copay to get the advice I needed to make sure he ate and drank enough. Id recommend it if you could afford it. i suggest connecting with those of us living with the symptoms; we often have great insight into the symptoms, which help YOU find more successful strategies. i try to write every week in my blog, but have collected Links for symptoms and strategies at this page >>  https://truthfulkindness.com/about/d-info/links-sx-strategies/	0
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone? I'm looking to get a fitness tracker (or something like it) for my aunt. I want to keep track of her heart rate and sleeping when I'm not there. She doesn't have a smart phone but does have wifi. I would need something that I could look at the stats when I'm not there. We also set up Alexa Dots in each room. We could drop in on her. She's having a hard time remembering that she can get them to do things even with the signs, but she enjoys the old pictures and we can still drop in. What kind of cameras did you use? We have the issue that she's in an apartment so it's hard to wire anything in, and there aren't a lot of plugs/she tends to unplug things of she doesn't know what it is. Plus she would flip if she knew we had cameras. We used the Alexa to set reminders to drink and take her medicine. We have Wyze cams. They are inexpensive plug and plays. She didn’t really know they were cameras. They have little door alarms and motion detectors as well. I now have two cameras and bed alarms in her room. Great info, thank you so much! We use a bed alarm as well. It works when WiFi and electric is down. We try and have layers of protection. Thanks, yeah we had looked into that too but he's all better on that medical issue fortunately. The Samsung galaxy watch 3 can operate without a cell phone nearby if you get a data plan and the lte model. Apple watch is another alternative though you need an iPhone to set it up. Samsung watch can monitor sleeping habits and it can measure heart rate. She still needs to wear it tho.Theres also subscription emergency services which offer fall detection and if she pushes a button, a private company will speak with her and manage all emergency response. Been having a hard time finding one that would work. She has a life alert type thing and has fallen or had issues but WILL NOT press it. I've heard about the fall detection in smart watches and it seems great, but I don't have an iPhone and we are trying to avoid another monthly fee, but I appreciate the suggestions! I cant trigger routines with the cameras when they detect motion. I tried the blink mini too because I need routines but I had troubles getting the routines to work with those too even though they should have been seamless as they are amazon brand.I don't have a particular brand suggestion, but I do suggest you look for cameras that specifically can trigger routines if you think there might even be a slim chance you need routines triggered in the future. Also, if you think allowing multiple users to have different levels and times of access is important, id make sure the camera can do that as well. I want to higher a caregiver and give them camera access during certain hours of the day only. But blink minis don't allow for different users and eufy cams allow different users but don't allow restrictions based on time of day. Although, I'm just getting an extra eufy came and then putting a smart plug in that turns the cam off during certain hours a day as a work around. Miss cheaper than the more expensive cameras that can do all the stuff I want.Fyi, ou can get samsung smart watch 3 and not get a data plan if you wanted. I only suggested the data plan because if she left an area with wifi, then some of the watch functions wouldn't work but i think it should still work within wifi. That doesn't require an iPhone and you could just get the wifi version if you dont want a monthly fee. Do a little research on the watch if you choose to buy tho cause I haven't actually gotten it yet.Just an FYI, The fee is just $10 a month typically  for data with most plans. Though like i said, if you're in wifi you don't need it. $5 per month if you are on magenta or above plan on tmobile. I'm going to get the lte version tho just in case I change my mind. Good to know, I will definitely look into the samsung smart watch. I think what I can do is get a smart phone without a sim card and hook it up to the WiFi at her place. I'll have to do a little testing and some more research for which trackers upload to apps that are accessible remotely but I have some faith this will work I use my brain and a notebook. We've made sure her environment is safe for her and I'm just looking for something to give me peace of mind when I'm not there. Well, why do you need (want) to keep track of it? I think I've taken a fairly hand off approach. That may not be the actuality of it, but I'm going to do what I can to make that happen. Knowing how much she's actually slept and what her heart rate is can help us guide her to get what she needs to feel better. She has blood pressure issues so being able to track it will let us know if bringing her to the doctor is necessary. We are lucky enough to have technology that can help us monitor her, thus keeping her in her own home for as long as possible. If the latter you could pair an iWatch with your phone for remote access. The issue with that is it won't give the data real time because it needs the phone there in order to access the data on the watch. The issue we wanted to avoid was another monthly fee for a cellphone she won't use, burI think I figured out a work around, I posted it below	0
Best GPS tracker I'm looking around for a GPS tracker for my elderly mother who adimently insists she wants to stay in her own house regardless of what it means for her and her health, but at night goes wandering becuase she dosen't know where she is.I want her to still have her own independence and go out in her own garden, but any further I'd like to be notified on my phone, as she's wandered off for miles before.Which GPS trackers have people on here had experience with. Preferably a one I can put my own SIM card intoHi /u/William444555, I'm sorry to hear about your mother. That balance between independence and security is really tricky.I know a bit about these things as I work for a company which makes GPS trackers. Maybe I can contribute to the discussion. *Here's an overview of the different types of trackers on the market today. *Bluetooth trackers: There are lots out there but the best known are Tile and Samsung's Tag. They great for finding your keys when you've misplaced them at home. Within a range of 30 or so yards, they can be incredibly accurate. As more and more people use them, you will also be able to locate your Tile/Tag remotely using data collected from passers-by. Real time GPS Trackers: There is a pretty wide range of trackers in this category and most are focused on vehicle tracking. A large number of the cheaper options are the same 2 or 3 models rebranded and resold by different companies under different names.These trackers ether use 2G/3G (or rarely, 4G) networks to constantly update their location. These sort of trackers are great for keeping an eye on your fleet of delivery vehicles to know where they are at every second, or for tracking your bike route across town. There are some wearable trackers (watches, etc.) which are mostly marketed for use with children that function in a similar way. Many companies selling this type of tracker are looking to make a profit off the monthly subscription, and not the sale of the hardware. In the U.S. these subscription costs can range anywhere from $15 - $30 per month. If purchasing this type of tracker, be wary of the low upfront prices. These trackers are designed to work practically anywhere and are a great lifeline for hikers and outdoors enthusiasts. They can also send prerecorded messages. Great for outdoor sports, not great for elderly parents who will forget to press the SOS button. Expensive, but worth their weight in gold if you're hiking solo. These trackers are great for theft prevention and recovery, as well as tracking people. You won't get the picture perfect map of every step your mother's taken throughout her day, but you'll get a ping every few minutes. The biggest advantage here is that battery life can be extremely good. There are a handful of companies out there which make trackers like this, (disclaimer: my own included) and some are the right size/shape to be tied into clothing, slipped into a pocket or handbag. I think this is the category where you should be looking. Are you based in the U.S. or U.K.?Some of our customers are definitely using our trackers to keep an eye on their elderly parents/grandparents and, from what we've seen, they're working well. We didn't design specifically for this use, but I'm glad our products are helping families like this. As I don't know this subreddit's rules, I'm going to avoid linking to anywhere, but feel free to DM me or google my company. Matt from Invoxia I came here to ask this. I want to help my step father.	0
We aren’t allowed inside and it’s very hard to get the staff to make sure her phone is plugged in and on the hook. She has an echo show but sometimes unplugs it or turns off the camera/mic when trying to move it. Her corded phone is the only other way to talk to her aside from shouting through the window, and she frequently forgets to put the phone back on the receiver. Are there electronics like phones or other devices specifically designed for people with dementia or Alzheimer’s?I’m in Texas, we have a essential caregiver plan in place that allows me access to my father. Please contact “Mary” with Texas Caregivers for Compromise on Facebook. Mary can guide you snd there is a wealth of information compiled by the group. I wish I could suggest electronics  ,as my dad tinkers with clocks and phones . She can’t use a cell phone and doesn’t remember to put the phone back on the cradle. Also can’t use a computer. Wish I had an answer but I don’t. Best wishes to you Set up a fire cube to her tv with a web camera mounted on top without her knowing and put either a Logitech harmony hub or broadlink rm mini 3 or 4 cant remember which number so that you can change the channel. I haven't used the Logitech hub but in theory you should be able to say on your own phone, drop in grandma and everything will pull together for you to skype your grandma if you set it up to work that way. The rm mini is way cheaper and can let you control her tv too however alexa integration while there isn't as good.The fire cube can be hidden away so she won't touch it with just a tiny ir sensor sticking out which she can't see easily. It needs to be plugged in but if you put the tv stand against where the outlet is, maybe she won't be able to touch it since heavy movement of the stand is required.I haven't tried this combo myself but the firecube is supposed to be able to allow drop in calls with skype. I do have the broadlink mini and it works great but I wish I had a harmony instead of being cheap now for the better alexa integration. I actually hook up a desktop pc so I can do way more things than skype with my dad but that takes effort so not for everyone.Or just move the echo to the tv stand that blocks the outlet?Note, some assist ed living don't allow cameras but you'd be using a Webcam so maybe that would be alliwed. It's what an echo show has too really.Esit:  the harmony hub/broadlink mini is used so you can switch the tv on and to the correct hdmi. The firecube might be able to do this for you by itself but for some reason it doesn't work right for me and it won't switch back to the antenna inp u t after you turn it off.	0
Any suggestions or types or service plans to consider? Thanks.I have https://www.bayalarmmedical.com/ for my dad. He used to have that but cancelled his plan when he went to Assisted living for some time but they doubled their price so it's real expensive. The cheapest might be to get a Wyze camera. Ask her not if she minds being spied on but if she would like a security camera, “for the living room”. $25 for the camera, plus any internet connection, no month to month fees. or if she’s really into privacy you could put it by the front door and just use it as a security camera but still have the audio enabled in case she needs to yell for help. Only you and someone with an administrator password can login and view the video, it’s reasonably private, but of course do your own research. My MIL has a Lifeline. Touchy little bugger but at least we know it works. It is less than $100 a month. Insurance covered one for my Dad. I am a retired paramedic. I am now at the age that I am looking for one for me. I am still active so I need one with GPS. Don't have an answer for what is best, but I will say I have had lots of first-hand knowledge with life alert. She may be more comfortable with a watch. I went with Great Call mobility device. It's Verizon service. If it's lost or broken, it's the cost of the device (under 100) and sign back up for the service. Some companies don't tell you it could be hundreds of dollars to replace the device. It's easy to charge by laying it inside a charging untit. You can set it up on the computer with lots of details. I put a lockbox on the front gate with the hopse key in it. The service has the pin number for it and instructrions about the dog. We've stationed Ring cameras around my mom's place. They have motion sensors and we can look in on her from anywhere. Just FYI, my mother-in-law bought an Apple Watch just for this feature. She doesn't trust it now anymore. There are other smartwatches out there that have an SOS call function built-in, alongside fall detection. I've not used any but have been researching it myself and seen a few interesting options out there. So maybe worth still looking down this route, OP. MIL used the Phillips alert service for many years before she passed. It worked very well in her rural area and was a reasonably priced monthly subscription. In this months issue of Consumer Reports, that I read last night, they have reviewed and rated many of the health alert services, I'm at work so don't have the issue with me, but you may be able to see the report on line.	0
My dad has very recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Any solutions?We have a monthly pill box (I can't get home weekly so this is the best solution). Also are there any groups or places you go to chat about your situation? I think I would like someone to chat to about it all as its happened all of a sudden and it's a lot to take in.Thanks for any replied and apologies for the long post.We bought a round medelert off Amazon. When it moves to the section, an alarm goes off (it's loud) and it continues to go off until the unit is picked up and turned over or for 30 min. This looks exactly what we need. Thank you so much! There are several options including the one just mentioned. He's not good at using his phone and sometimes it's not even switched on. I think the one mentioned above will be perfect. Many are part of insurance companies, so you might start there with a call to see if they offer the service. If your dad is able to use computer or iPad, i am very partial to www.dementiamentors.org , for us as Persons Living with Dementia .	0
Caring for Father Post-Stroke Hi AllI am writing to ask for ideas/advice about my father's situation. Falls are my biggest concern - he has spells of vertigo and needs to catch ahold of something to stop from falling over. This in turn has him afraid to drink water - at one stage my sister admitted him to hospital for dehydration.A recent symptom is urinary incontinence. I'm not sure how anyone can take a crap at that angle - yet the place is disgusting. I personally think he should be checked out for Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (I have the high pressure version myself) - but it is extremely difficult for me to drive 2 hrs each way to go to these appointments.I feel that I have no choice but to take a more active role in his life. I found a place that would give him a 1 bedroom apartment with ensuite - with 24 hour staff on site. Perhaps the most important thing for me is they have caterers on site - so while they might not serve the nicest food, it would likely be better prepared and better for him (especially given his diabetes). I can't force him to sell his 5 acres and downside to 500 sq ft! Anyone who falls and cannot get back up, is incontinent, has trouble swallowing, isn’t able to cook or do his washing needs a full time aide or a appropriate facility. Take a virtual tour (or live if you don’t have COVID restrictions.) Ask for sample menus to share with him. Thanks. I came up with a plan to show him both places I visited yesterday in a very specific order. In America (I can tell OP is not in America) there is an app called Nesterly that matches students with older people for no or low rent. If he accepted help you could contact the Area Agency on Aging to find out how to apply for services like home health aid, physical therapy, wheels on meals, etc. Since he doesn't care if he has a valid driver's license I've read where many adult children resort to disabling the car. Can you arrange for alternative transportation? Thanks. Short of a chauffeur service he is really stuck. It's not his life, sorry to tell you that, but either you assume the responsibility or they die in filth or kill someone (driving). Right now you need to do three things: 1) Get a durable power of attorney 2) liquidate your fathers assets 3) Admit him ASAP to a proper nursing facility and setup his social security and medicare so they are at least safe and direct deposited to the right place so if you become incapacitated his income isn't stolen. You will do everything short of Tasing them to get them to comply, it can be hard, but they won't even know it happened in a year. Wishing you the best of luck. Focusing on making the best of his time is the angle I'm going to take. Assisted living sounds like a great option. Not sure where you are and how it will be paid for. If private funds its expensive but easy. We live in Australia - so we're relatively fortunate to have subsidised medical care. We WILL need to sell his house to buy in to the facility. It's time. Wish me luck.	0
GPS tracker recommendations Hi all.My father-in-law has been diagnosed, it’s not too bad yet, but it’s progressing. My mother-in-law has tasked me with finding a GPS tag type of thing just in case he goes for a wander. I’m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for a service or product that could work. Ideally, it’d be something with multiple tags, like it’d work on his phone and on some sort of pendant/keychain? It also has to be fairly easy to use, she’s not great with tech or English and they're in Hawaii and we're in the mainland US so I can't help with the setup.I’ve done some looking but there are so damned many things and services that just look like scams or a way to separate desperate people from their money I’m at a loss.And just randomly anything else we can get or set up to help them?Any help would be appreciated.They have them for dogs, but I have not found them for people yet. My brother in law makes GPS trackers for wild animals, maybe he could hook you up. Contact your areas Alzheimers .org or dementia .org, they know all the great info & resources & tips. Often have 24/7 helplines, although I'm in Australia so I don't know about your place. It made it really hard as we couldn't find it and are pretty sure it went into the curbside bin, and returning it with that missing wristband was costly. I think if we had to do it again, I'd just get Tile trackers and sew them into her shoes, pants, and jacket. I was looking into Tile for the same thing a little while ago and they track location based on the phones location, so they just give the last location it was able to sync with the phone. Unless they have new products now? My dad was never able to get the hang of smart phones and now he won't take his normal phone with him even most of the time so the Tile didn't work out. No, but what Tile support suggested is that we could install the app on our phone and see last known location. In the end, we didn't bother. When I was looking these up I was told by a couple of professionals that these give a false sense of safety. We also did preventative measures like put those basic slide locks at the base of the doors that we nudged open with our foot but dad never noticed them.But! For backup I heard placing the tracker in or on the shoe is the best. My dad took off/broke anything extra on him and lost his shoes when he went off wandering. Edit: in the off chance hes used to carrying a smart phone on him all the time you could turn on the google maps gps feature in the phone. Also, am from hawaii, so i will share this additional info with you in case you find it useful: Alz assoc.https://www.alz.org/hawaii - free support groups, education, also trying to pass legislation to create more support for Alzheimer's ppl, such as requiring dementia sensitive training to people like first responders, in situations where folks wander off.Actually id call them and ask for recommendations or see if you could join one or all the support groups (all online in covid times) to ask for recommendations. This is because theres a chance that services that work in places elsewhere dont work as well in hawaii, especially if they live in a rural area. You might luck out and find someone that knows her area and knows of something that will def work. Gov help. https://health.hawaii.gov/eoa/https://www.hawaiiadrc.org/site/459/hadssp.aspxAlso check out offices on aging by county. Available help varies by county.. Stuff like free adult daycare 1 or 2 days a week, or assistance one day a week for example but its different by county. This is an example for honolulu county: https://www.elderlyaffairs.com/Legal help:https://www.hawaii.edu/uhelp/publications.htmhttps://www.hawaii.edu/uhelp/handbook.htmSenior information anf assistance handbook for hawaii: https://www.elderlyaffairs.com/site/449/publications.aspxLists services including nonprofit and volunteer orgs. Im no pro but if you have any questions for dementia in hawaii feel free to ask. While I'm late to the discussion but maybe I can help. I work for a company which makes these sort of trackers. GPS tracking is definitely not a perfect solution, but it can be helpful as things progress. The one we make in the US might be a good fit for your family. The app is pretty straightforward and you can set up geofencing alerts (so if he wanders off, your mother-in-law will know)I shared this already on another thread but I thought it fit here too. A few weeks back a customer sent us this story about finding her mom. Our (my sisters and I) original intent in purchasing the gps device was for peace of mind for us. She is becoming a bit more forgetful than we are comfortable with and is not a cellphone user. My older sister linked it to her phone. My sister, out of state, looked on the GPS app and saw that she was not just far from home, but heading towards the neighboring state! With the help of your device my sister was able to give the troopers specific enough information that the vehicle was found within a half hour! She was absolutely stunned, surprised and grateful we found her. We hate to even think how our story would have ended had we not purchased your GPS. 🙏😃”-Matt from Invoxia	0
"That is why I often operate behind the scenes, and put my energy into creating lasting improvements in your life... Much of it is research! - activities you'd enjoy, safety/accessibility devices, communication aids, meal recipes. Even when you see me on my phone, it is often on your behalf. Please. Stop unplugging kitchen appliances while they are in use. Please please please stop unplugging the nightlights. It's motion-activated. It will turn off on its own. Or the remote. Bahahaha yours too? I thought unplugging every damn thing was just one of my person's idiosyncracies, I didn't realize it was a 'THING'. There's this aftermarket remote operated light switch that has 3 sets of buttons on it, in order to correspond to 3 different plugs. We only use one set, so I put tape over the other ones with 'ON' and 'OFF' written on them, an arrow pointing toward the one remaining exposed button, thinking it couldn't get any simpler? But no, just now she came up to me with three different remotes (God knows where she even found the other 2) saying it was defective, furiously pressing the taped-over buttons. We had to get rid of it because as convenient as it was to use Voice Commands, Grandma would read ALL of the suggestions aloud, like ""Try Alexa, Download <whatever stupid thing>"" or ""Try Alexa, take a picture,"" or ""Set a timer,"" or ""add dog food to the grocery list,"" (we don't have a dog), or or ""Open Daily Quiz"" or whatever that skill was. Now we're using a TV with some sort of media stick that connects to a few different services. We've been through a lot of shows, and lately have been having moderate success with Father Knows Best. I'm also absorbing all these details like they're water and I'm a wilted plant. Mine does not refill the toilet paper, alas. Thanks for your help, my brother in arms. My Grandma has had a series of minor incidents lately. Sundowning has gotten more and more of a problem for us as time passes. So we ended up with a whiteboard with a permanent little message that we update daily:  > Today is [month]/[day]> [weekday]> Nothing is happening today!> Love, [Grandson's Name]  And we moved a clock that shows the day/date in addition to the time to be directly beside this little board (so she doesn't get up to make sure the information on the board means today, because it can't mean today because isn't something happening today?). We have an Echo Show sitting on the dining room table. My dad would call me every day to say the TV was broken, when actually he'd unplugged it and the Sky box and couldn't get it back on the right channel. That’d be great, thanks. The mop will never be the same again. His caregiver took him but forgot to tell me. Insisting she doesn't need any of them, even though she's very unsteady on her feet and has had too many falls lately.Stubbornly refusing help when clearly she needs help at times with walking, standing, dressing, getting lost in the house, turning the volume/speakerphone on her cell phone so she can hear the caller.Not wanting to go to bed because she isn't home, but she will go through drawers and mail of this house that she thinks isn't hers.Trying to feed everything to the cats irregardless if it's something they would or should eat. Why do you insist on opening the blinds for light, even when it’s dark outside, letting the neighbors look in on us?Why do you refuse to change out of your dirty clothes? Why do you blame us for everything you don’t understand? We live with my husband’s grandmother (with dementia) and disabled and deaf aunt, and I have 20 month old and a 2 month old-so it’s a lot of people to care for!-my baby is a boy. My MIL thought my home is a hotel at the beach. We live in the middle of a forest. Maybe I am just the bell hop in the Arboreal ocean hotel, and I've stolen this poor sweet cougar's luggage so that she can check in any time she like...but she can never leave...?! Why must you be obsessed with picking up things on the floor, yet you have a nest of crap around you that you are extremely possessive of and I'm not allowed to touch?Why do you insist that you are ""fine"" and that ""you can take care of yourself"" but you haven't made a formal dinner in years, eat very late at night (if I don't provide dinner), only do laundry if I say something negative, (ie gripe and complain) and spend your days being in front of the TV, reading a book or doing your dot to dot books?Why must you mess with my head and go through moments of ""normalcy"" followed by long stretches of being blissfully unaware of everything going on? Mom, your stories and memories from the 40's through the 60's are repetitive. Always hidden somewhere, but WHY! ?I didn't realize the unplugging thing was common with others too.We just got an Echo show and are trying to work it into use. If I picked up the phone to tell them the truth I'd get judged badly for ""eavesdropping"" ...ugh Haha 'WHY??' They're not restricted by our earthly 'trash bins' or 'lids' (shout-out to u/boethius70 hahaha)! - PLEASE FEED YOUR CAT. The bowl is always empty every time I visit. I ask and get 'the cat has lots of food' yes but you don't give it to it.I don't want to take your cat but im going to have to take your cat.I do have a billion vents but that's one I think about at home Gosh, I have the opposite problem, mum keeps feeding the cat all day, and way too much. Great post, good idea, thanks!! does . outside . Don't cut off all the geranium & daisy flowerBUDS saying you're ""deadheading the old dead ones"", ""isn't that what you're supposed to do so they bloom better?"".. They are not new. Please stop commenting every single time we go out about all the new construction please stop reading aloud EVERY SINGLE SIGN, bumper sticker, license plate etc . We have toilet paper and wet wipes. You can’t live alone. Please stop telling me how you can. You have no cognitive ability left to understand all I do for you. why do you hoard? Why keep dirty tissues? Why insist on keeping all junk mail from 1980? Why do you keep old boxes, wrappers, etc? She can no longer go in her daylight basement. There were rooms in the basement that had so much junk you couldn’t walk through the room. Since she can’t go down there anymore due to the stairs, I’ve emptied 70% of the junk into 3 dumpsters. One of my daughters and one of my sons (I have 4 kids) stayed with her for a week each last year and it was a disaster. the all night screaming! When I was caring for my mom this was probably my biggest gripe - my mom had a whistle that she wore around her neck to call for help, and she would use it ALL THE TIME, for the smallest request, with no discretion and no regard for the time of day."	0
Checklist for Caregivers I consider myself to be on the spectrum of what is considered a distance caregiver. I live ~35 mins away from my mom and see her at least weekly. Using everyone's words of encouragement and advice, I ultimately created a list of things to check for her and added a few more things so that we all can have a mega list. I also work in health care and did a mini list for that as well. Feel free to help expand this list.Lint catcher in dryerDryer ventCheck mold prone areas for moldCheck bathroom and bathroom supplies for mold (rags, wash cloths, loofahs)Check for leaks especially under sinks and around water heaterSpongesBug or rodent droppingsPests like termitesLight bulbsAir/furnace filter/ventsNearest street lights work at nightSmoke/CO detectorsUnopened mail / unpaid billsKitchen appliances workingSteadiness of step stoolsSlipperiness of rugs/matsBuild up in shower headDrain emptying speed (gradual clog? )Garbage disposalSlipperiness of bathtub/showerWires or cords in walking pathCondition of wires/cordsExtension cord appropriate useEven stairs/no holes or deformities in carpeted stepsNeed for night lightChimney/fireplace is clearGutters are clearSliding doors sliding wellDoors opening and closing wellFreezer frost build upTest drive sprinklersSeptic tank inspectionMedication organization and expirationRefrigerator temperatureRemove old food in fridge/pantryCheck food in pantry for bugs/ants (especially pasta/flour)Dust on ceiling fansEmergency phone numbers listed somewhereSpace heaters properly used/maintainedFew days supply of food during hurricane seasonNeed for medical alert devicesHealthwiseHA1c levelHemoglobin and hematocrit levelsVitamin D levelsCholesterol levelsKidney function levels (BUN, Creatinine, GFR)Blood pressure trendsUrine analysisFoot ulcersBed sores on back, buttocks, or hipWeight loss/gainChewing/swallowing difficultyALWAYS ask for a copy of labsSide effects and potential side effects of medicationThis is amazing! It actually looks like a list we should all have to check on in our own homes, as well. i would add checking expirations on medications, i cleaned out a box full of it from under dads sink bc he was “saving it” This is great. Thank you This is overwhelming, I’m doing what I can but the non critical stuff is going to fall by the wayside I think this list could also be organized by frequency, which might make it more manageable. Sone of these may only need to be done once a year, so split it into two lists and tackle it that way.	0
"Any recommendations ? Even if I tell her no she will come back and ask again. I was just wondering if theirs any devices that allow me to change her channel from down stairs or have her like notify me that she wants something and I control it from my phone ?Apple TV can be controlled from a smart phone. But your phone must remain open and on. If that's inconvenient, any old iPad or iPhone on the house's wifi would work. you can also cast media from your phone/laptop to her TV (assuming it's a smart TV), so you could set up a playlist and just hit ""next"" whenever she wants. Install an app on your phone that is compatible with the Tv so you can change channels wirelessly."	0
"GPS Tracking recommendations Dad got lost for the first time today. I need a discreet tracker that isnt bulky. He insists he is fine(he is not) so preferably something he cannot leave at home or forget. At first i thought to attach it to his key chain, but he will be losing his license in 2 weeks most likely.Any ideas?If he's got an iPhone and you do as well, you can turn on ""Find My Friend"" on his phone, and then locate it with your phone. Otherwise, there are a bunch of GPS/parental supervision apps you could download and install to keep tabs on his physical location. They charge by leaving the shoes on a charging mat every 2-3 days.The first time a loved one wanders is so scary. Check out Tile trackers. Tile and other Bluetooth trackers only work with a mobile phone. Go out w/o the phone, no tracking. The Tiles I bought for my mom were synced to my phone, not hers. But if you are able to walk out after them, it can help to locate them in scenarios where they are at a neighbors house or in the woods behind your home, etc. My Dad wears a Care Smart watch from Verizon. We are all able to track his location via their app on our cell phones. It works great, and he puts it on every day. We have a daily checklist for him which includes taking it off to charge at night and putting it on first time in the morning. Some of my friends are researching a GPS in the shoe. After waking up and noticing he was gone , 4 hours later we get a call from the state police in Nevada, we live in calli. We bought a car tracker from www.trackmytruck.us . They are cheap and units are tiny plugs right into the car."	0
My dad is loosing a lot of his dexterity in his fingers and strength in his arm to even hold up his phone and use it. Is there something I can get him to not have to work so hard to use his devices? Its worth a look, my kids use them a lot. )There are also adjustable grips that attach to a firm surface and hold the phone, but they wiggle a LOT when touched and really arent stable. It may be of use if he uses it to watch movies or other non-interactive media. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ZT4VA0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_3PTcGbXBKDBTZThis stand has been great for my mom for her phone and tablet. It can also hold up flashcards for therapy  and collapses to a really convenient to store/carry. It's not the same as holding the phone, but can be a good option if there is an over the bed table that he uses. I got this one for my mom: https://www.amazon.com/Avantree-Gooseneck-Universal-Flexible-Bracket/dp/B01M1JXNTT	0
(I think it might because I only care about what happens to me and not others). Also, yeah I talked to my therapist and he told me its 100% OCD, but I seem to doubt it. I changed my diet because of a gastrointestinal problem (IBS) and noticed a change with my foggy brain symptoms. There’s a lot of information on YouTube when you type in “Diet and Brain Fog.”  The diet I follow is the autoimmune protocol paleo diet (AIP). See a doctor, explain what's going on and I'm willing to bet it's something else. This doesn't sound like dementia, it sounds like anxiety, obsessive compulsive, and probably some kind of ADD/ADHD. i suggest you get to the doctor and get it checked out because quite a few of them can be TEMPORARY if you get it addressed quickly. -- But if possible this may qualify you to get a NeuroPsych test.	0
I have been taking care of all of her life stuff that she let fall at the wayside, including figuring out her finances. I have known that she was involved with an internet scammer for a couple of years, but honestly could not stop her. I have access to her phone, and they are in constant contact and have recently been asking for more money. I have not been able to track down exactly where the money went, but it's definitely possible that it went to these scammers. It is time for this to end. We are planning on reporting the scammer to the FBI. I various details to share with them. I am just not sure what to do regarding my mother. She had a fairly loveless marriage and has been pretty lonely since my father died a couple of decades ago. She is only so good at being sneaky, but I am still worried. I am worried that if we tell her we need to block them that I'll send her into an even deeper depression. I have been putting off this task, but I could really use some advice.Id report that guy right away. He may be scamming others as well.I wonder if there is a social worker or some other professional the cops could refer you to.I'm not sure what the best thing to do would be. I have the EXACT SAME PROBLEM. Its been going on for years. She has lost over $150,000 CAD to this guy. This is not the first time he has attempted to come visit and doesn't show up. We have reported it to the police, but ultimately there is nothing more we can do. > She has lost over $150,000 CADjesus christ, those can easily be the savings of a whole life... My parents sold their house a few years ago during their divorce so most of that was from the house sale and then her inheritance from her mother passing. The scammer, and the disease have both stolen that possibility from her. I don't want to depress you but there is not much any law enforcement agency is going to do. are you sure they don't use proxies, fake numbers or reroute calls?Anyhow good luck. U probably will be ok to let her still speak to them, as long as they are not getting her money, she can just say she no longer has access to her money andsee how long they will linger then!	0
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior? She is not home-bound, she drives well, and is very intelligent. She reaches out to my brother a lot for tech help (and to me occasionally on it). She reaches out to me on financial questions fairly regularly and sometimes on medical. She was able to get a Zoom appointment with her family doctor, who seemed excellent. He would like to hire someone overseas (inexpensive).My mother is not eager to have a remote assistant. She has a lot of trouble scanning documents or emailing photos of things.I asked my brother if the reason he wants a remote assistant is because her questions are becoming burdensome to him. My husband, who works in IT and is super patient, has offered to help her with computer issues. She is happy to have that resource and thinks the world of my husband, but she hasn't reached out to him yet. I think she is used to contacting my brother and I don't think he has discouraged her from doing so. Here's why I'm posting: I am concerned about the safety of a stranger knowing that she lives alone and has memory issues. (At this point, my mother controls her own finances, though she is gradually bringing me in to help. I also suggested that if we do hire someone, we should set the cost aside. We both know that she is well off and cost is not an issue for her--she is happy to pay well for work for her. I have said we should put safety first and hire someone one of us knows and trusts (I gave him 3 names of underemployed friends who might be interested) or perhaps a friend of a friend who is well-vetted. I subsequently also offered to help more (which I am doing) and I have offered my husband's help with the technology issues (which my brother has not responded to--instead he's emailing me things like medical releases we should give a  remote assistant). I would love any advice on any of the following: whether I'm being overly concerned about my mother's safety, approaches to dealing with my brother on this assuming that I'm not being overly concerned, possible alternative ways to address my mother's issues, any stories of success or failure using remote assistants, and anything I might be missing. I cannot take my grandmother anywhere without some stranger offering to come to the house and do work, or being overly nice and insert themselves into her life, or some other weird shit that they would never say or do to me (39/F). Both have been working for us for years and came highly recommended. It's SO much harder in the pandemic.I guess at some point you could try to get some kind of access to her accounts--at least emailed statements from the bank--so you know if she's giving away money that you don't know about.I totally get trusting longtime workers not to steal from her. I take care of peoples parents or grandparents and not all of us are looking for something to gain. I work in peoples homes and nursing homes. They handle the finances and i do everything their family member cannot. Are the timely? This is what my brother is suggesting. Money can be a motivator for many and honestly, I would advise all families to keep finances personal - and even then it can be sticky but at least its much less torrential than a stranger. Honestly i feel that once it is an established understanding the kind of appts and groceries and such needed that may not be a bad idea. Thank you very much! Also, I think you may be better off getting her a simpler phone or launcher on her phone. Other people have posted about them here where the buttons are peoples faces essentially.The hard thing is if people are helping her with electronic devices, sooner or later, they can probably gIn access to her devices so if they are the slightest bit tech savvy, can figure out all passwords to her bank accounts, etc.So yes, you definitely want someone you trust. Thank you very much! Your brother is suggesting basically giving this “remote assistant” POA for financial matters (along with tech and other practical help). No one outside the family should, in my opinion.You yourself could take the financial stuff on, your husband could help with tech (maybe find some more intuitive/easy/senior-oriented solutions). You could hire a personal support worker  (who is bonded, through an agency) to help with managing meals, medication, and personal care. Maybe a third party could mediate this. In my area, seniors are referred (by anyone but often through a hospital or doctor) to a government agency that manages care in the community. There is a coordinator to speak to. Someone like that might be able to help with this conversation with your brother and come up with other solutions as well. Your responses are super helpful. It has made me realize that maybe I should ask my brother again if her question are just too much right now. That in itself is a responsibility. I can tell him in more detail what I can take on besides financial and medical issues, including that I can be her iPhone tech help. We can try to shift to my husband being her primary help for computer and TV tech issues. The other things I can think of are recordkeeping issues--which if someone remote can handle them, I can--and household repair issues, which are more complicated. Once my husband and I are both vaccinated (and she is), we plan to drive up there. The main issue until then is shoveling snow, which a neighbor helps with. Have queried EKG results and labs and caught errors... For the place - One of you is going to have to physically go and check on things. For her appointments- that’s easy enough, Google Calendar is fine.Medical - no chance would i offload this to anyone else. I don't know if Google calendar will work for my mom.	0
I'm definitely here to help my grandmother, but the main caregiving I'm doing is for my uncle. And when he isn't happy or doesn't get his way, he beats his own head. Where do I find the middle-ground? What battles are worth fighting? How do I keep my grandmother safe?Wow, you careload is way over my experience and pay grade. Eliminate the obvious dangers and don't sweat the details Thanks. 🤢😂 Condom catheters are a saver	0

Monitoring bracelet Hi everyone,I'm interested in your recommendations for wearable tracking/monitoring devices for my father, who has Parkinson's Plus and Dementia with Lewey Bodies. My main wishes for features of the device are:GPS / cell service tracking (covering a large service area, just in case he gets far)relatively user-friendly app for caregiver (my step-mom wouldn't be inclined to use anything too complicated)fall alertssome kind of lock feature to prevent him from removing it independentlyan idea of initial investment and then monthly costs for monitoring/service (but we are pretty  flexible)This is intended to be one of a series of safety stop-gaps so that he can continue to live at home, at least until the pandemic gets under control and we can look at more long-term care options. I realize a device with everything on my wishlist might be hard to come by, but I'd like to hit as many targets as possible altogether.If this has already been discussed recently in a post with up-to-date products, I'd appreciate a link. Stay safe and best wishes to you all and your families.My brother got my parents each an Apple watch. He can see where they are at all times. The watches have  fall monitors and also monitor heart rate and I think blood pressure. They're well worth the whatever per month. Just note Apple watches typically need charging daily. I hope you find something that works. Is there a monitoring-specific app you installed on the watch or is it a setting that the watch comes with? My step-mom uses an iPhone so I could see her being able to work with this. Sorry for the delay. I too would like just a basic live gps/watch style thats all i would need, mom loves going for walk but never owned a cell phone most watches require a phone to be close or a sim. Shes always had a watch so it would be like second nature	0

Many places are big enough that they provide multiple services, From Respite to simple Assisted Living to locked wards, often via different wings.

There are placement services which will take your elder's requirements (ostomy care, diabetes, hoyer lifts, meds, etc), distance from your home, and prices into consideration and get you a list of facilities. They're very helpful and usually take recompense from the homes themselves so they don't cost you anything. Save what you can. Talk to your mom and get recordings of her voice.

We are at the point now where we realize our LO's primary caregiver was never really told exactly what Alzheimer's Disease is, what it looks like and what to expect, and he's struggling to understand why her behavior is changing. Thank you so much! I'm trying my best to prepare for the inevitable and this is extremely helpful. Now we know that they decline MUCH faster when institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home, where they get better care.This is bullshit, and induces guilt in caregivers who are already burned out and beginning to develop their own health problems related to long term stress.Many people thrive when put into a care facility. Even a nice facility is cheaper than in-home care, which is often unreliable. Unlike other organs, one cannot do exploratory surgery on the brain. I wish to his they really did revoke the driver’s license at time of diagnosis. I hear that This is a great post. Our elders forget they didn't pay a bill, and think they are being stolen from when the company asks again to be paid. They become much more susceptible to scammers and fraud. Unfortunately your bank cannot share details of their financial accounts with you unless you are a signatory on their account. Before the dementia is too far along, try to persuade them to make someone else a signatory on their account - basically, you just go to the bank and they sign paperwork to allow you to access the accounts. This will allow you to monitor what is happening, pay their bills, and take care of them. In addition, call the 3 credit monitoring agencies and have their accounts locked. It can still be done, if the scammer gets the elder to approve it over the phone or in writing, but will help prevent casual loans from scammers. Not having an account has become a common way to steal tax refunds and identities. This was brilliant info and I incorporated as much of it as I could.

And that hospice coming in to ease the transition to death is also a possibility. I wish I had this resource at the beginning of this journey. This is invaluable information, and helps me realize how very far along we are, and the steps we need to take from here on out. I wish I had found this last year. What would you suggest for those that will eventually run out of money for a memory care facility?? The local ALG.org chapter told us to call Agency on Aging, who told us to call the local ALZ chapter. That endless circle became too frustrating to deal with so we called the ombudsman who couldn't really help and told us to get a lawyer.My mom qualified for VA Aid and Attendance to help lower the cost, but we applied in November 2019 and are still waiting. We were told she would see her first payments in April-ish, but as of March when COVID hit, we've been passed from one person to the next and now they're ghosting us completely. We escalated it to our senators to try to get help.Medicaid is next. We were told to get into the system ASAP. I highly recommend that you choose a memory care facility that takes Medicaid from the start. No one told us that, so we put our mom in a great community that she loves, but money is almost out and we have no choice but to move her. We've waited six months and finally have a room in a place that's an hour away, but they first want to examine her records and see if she's a good fit. If they end up turning her down, we're down to two places left that would even put her on a waitlist."	0
We knew it was coming. Mom showed up shortly afterward, and helped look through stuff. I still haven’t heard from my brother, who is the attorney in fact. One of those cheap coloring books from the nineties.It reminded me of the ones she always used to bring over for me. She’s been a fixture in my life ever since her son married my mom when I was three, and long after they divorced. It's sad how families turn when the matriarch passes. Be strong for yourself and your kids! Ignore your family, I know it hurts but my family did exactly the same. I'm sending you a warm hug and I'll keep you in my thoughts. After my Dad passes the rest is out. I find this site a great helphttps://www.griefhealingdiscussiongroups.com/Celebrate her life and her love, hold on to the memories and share that with your kids. Blessing for you and your family during your grief. Sorry to hear about death of your Granny. Dont let your family drown out the feelings you and the kids are experiencing now. Which is why I'm telling you. So so sorry. I have had two uncles pass from Alzheimer's. Another part says brace for the inevitable. RIP, my condolences sending 🧡 You showed such love and kindness in her final hours.	0
Please help, I don't know what to do.For as long as I can remember, my mother has been verbally abusive and she is a big time narcissist. She definitely needs help but she refuses any suggestion of help, whether it be a cleaning lady or even a local kid to mow the grass. To stop being berated and belittled. I feel so alone in this. Agreed, but I’d gather evidence first: start a log of your visits (dates, any neglect you witness), take photos (especially of any bruising), record her screaming & conversations of her refusing to care for him. Then contact Adult Protective Services. Absolutely report her. Call your country’s dementia advisory service and see what they suggest too. Just hit them all up on reporting your mother to anyone and everyone that will listenI hope you get somewhere soon	0
Should she get long-term care insurance right now? Any good book/resource recommendations? My questions are:   1 - Does this sound like it could be beginning dementia or something else? 2 - Do you have any advice about or experience with long-term care insurance? 3 - Do you have any good resources or book recommendations for people suffering from cognitive difficulty, or for their families/caregivers?Any input or links/resources will be appreciated!My mom has been having some cognitive issues for several years. My (F, 31) brother (24) and dad (57) live with her. They are in denial and try to claim it's just ADD/ADHD and that her brain doesn't pay attention even when it seems like she is, so I went to the doctor with my mom in October and she tried an ADD drug that did not help her at all. When we went to the doctor for ADD/ADHD in October, the doctor didn't seem to think advised her to get a neuro-psychiatric evaluation but I told him not to order it yet and not put it in the notes because she might want to get some type of long-term care insurance and doesn't want to disqualify herself from that. It's expensive though, so it's a major decision, and I know my dad is doing research and trying to make the best choice. My dad swears she always had this, but she definitely didn't. So we drove to that hospital but my mom couldn't figure out how to get to the front parking lot. When we went to check in and gave the doctor's name, they said he didn't have an office there. Eventually we got the office address and went there, and my mom confirmed she has been there before but just couldn't remember where it was. I feel like we are good at answering repeated questions until about the 4th or 5th time and we all start to lose our cool. Even after playing several rounds she was unable to remember how to play or what the objective was, yet the kids picked it up quickly. When I tried to throw out some of my old stuff I found, I later found that she had gone through the papers I had recycled and items I planned to donate and kept them. We had to drive to 4 stores so she could settle on 5-pack of Venus razors (3-pack was too few, 8-pack was too many -- even though she'd use them eventually and buying in bulk is a better value). Hugs to you! Sounds like a good plan to get info on LTC insurance prior to adding to her diagnosis. Sorry, I have no experience with that, but I’m paying loads of money for my grandma’s memory care, so I’d say it’s worth a discussion with a good agent. Best of luck in getting the answers you need. The longer you wait for diagnosis the longer you will wonder. While I appreciate the need to get long term care insurance in place she needs to get the neuro-psychological eval done ASAP. At this time her safety (and the safety of others) is the number one concern. I know that may sound extreme but, it’s much better than having something occur and wishing you had done something to prevent it. Monday, call a few places to see if they would insure her for long-term care insurance. I did that, and the first office I called was honest and told me she didn’t think she’d be able to get him insurance just based on the medicine he takes. She called me back the next day to tell me she checked with several insurance companies and none would insure him. The sooner the better. You all need answers and to be able to prepare for future needs. Having a diagnosis has helped me understand how to handle what’s going on and has allowed me to better support my husband as he struggles to deal with it.Let me know if I can help you as you work through all this. I haven't heard of FTD but I will definitely read up on it. I truly wish you the best. I am no expert at all, but I strongly suggest asking about long-term care insurance at r/insurance. Thank you I understand your concern about insurance, and my heart goes out to your family, but you need to take her to the neurologist to get her the help she needs asap. Long term care insurance is pretty much a thing of the past. You are holding on to a dream of hacking the system & getting discount long term care. Even if it was still available, you have to sign up when you are youngish & healthy. As for resources - get a diagnosis first, then research. Best wishes. Out of curiosity what makes you say LTC insurance is a thing of the past? I'm only asking because based on the public information available, insurance companies paid out $11B of claims in 2019. It's my understanding that LTC insurance proved to be unexpectedly expensive for insurance companies. Companies rely on a certain amount of their customers stopping paying their bills and therefore not getting their benefits, like how gyms calculate a certain amount of their members never going to the gym. So they are still paying out existing policies but good luck finding a company willing to sell you a new LTC insurance policy. They aren't profitable. Is what I've been told. From my understanding, the older insurance polices were not priced accurately enough, which was the proximate cause of the constant increase and fluctuations in premiums. By any chance do you recall what the annual premiums were that they were initially paying, and what they got adjusted to? Also, do you know if they had inflation protection in any of their policies? Even if Medicaid does pay for LTC there is no guarantee that someone in need would receive it due to the qualification requirement. And Medicaid requires you to liquidate most of your assets to qualify. In your case, as a consumer, how do you think you would cover any of the home or facility based care you would need possibly in 20 years? From my homework In home care, home health aid is the cheapest option of care for people that want to have some kind of independence. The national rates for a home health aide are hovering at $20-$25 per hour. In a best case scenario of needed a home health aide only for 40 hours a week, the cost would be at a minimum $3,200 a month on top of standard living expenses. Once again I'm more curious, and am looking for personal experiences. Thank you and you are probably right about the insurance. That is very helpful.On the policy – It's very likely that they would want to perform a physical exam before issuing a policy. If she has any trusted doctors, including ones she hasn't seen in a while, you can just send them a short summary of this information by email or fax and ask for their help encouraging her to come in for a visit. I live 4 hours away from my parents and started keeping track about a year ago when I really started noticing some concerning things last Christmas. When COVID hit and I had the ability to work remotely was when I pushed for them to pursue getting a diagnosis because I would be able to go to appointments with her. I was scared to bring it up but my mom was receptive and she wants help. We're headed in the right direction and the comments on this post help me feel validated that there is definitely an issue, so I will be pushing them to figure out the LTC so we can move forward. They have tests that they can perform, on top of what you have experienced with her, to determine what is going on. Some policies make you see a doctor to find out which ADLs (activities of daily living) the person is in need of, as well as how many of them, before the policy is active. You can start looking into different companies to see who does and doesn't take LTC. (You can also ask the LTC company for a list of care companies they work with. )Scheduling the doctor appointment and getting more information from the LTC policy mom has is step one. She actually doesn't have a LTC policy right now, but my parents have met with an agent and think they will be able to get one. I appreciate the information you provided about waiting periods and care companies. As far as for ltc different companies and different products have different solutions. It is hard to say which one fits you the best or if she is issuable. Even for the waiting period different products have different definitions and some don't have waiting period. You should find an agent who knows a wide range of product to find the best one. It is also important to know which state you are in. It might be too late to buy the ltci for your mom but you should consider it yourself when you are younger and healthier. Heavy metal toxicity.Look into getting a hair test.Look up Andy cutler protocol.If that doesn’t work, look into the Bredesen protocol Did you end up having your mom evaluated? It may be expensive, but it will be less expensive than paying out of pocket. Even if they can't find a diagnosis, they can still help more with the symptoms than her regular doctors can, so she definitely needs to see them soon.	0

Anyone have any small trackers, for my mom For my mom, shes always had a watch so that would be pefered. Shes mild case (idk what kind if there is diffrent ones) atm but the issue is she loves walking with covid we are scared to put her in a home (possible 2 year wait/line) so we try to keep her as long as possible. Not every moment of the day we can watch her. Any type of tracker would be great, she obv not tech smart n never had a cell phone but a watch shes had everyday so she would wear it and not think twice about itApple Watch requires an iPhone. Fitbit Surge w/GPS and Bluetooth trackers require a smartphone. Then there are GPS devices, many with monthly subscription services- check pros/cons carefully & see if they require a minimum time contract. (Some are 3-yr prepaid minimum contract where the cancellation fee equals the prepaid amount! )https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/safety/technology-101 has the questions to consider before you choose your tracking method.https://www.caringvillage.com/product-review/top-10-products-track-elderly-location/ has pros/cons of remote monitoring/tracking plus reviews 10 specific devices. https://www.seniorlink.com/blog/the-50-best-gps-trackers-for-seniors. None of these will work for us because our LO with dementia lives alone, can’t keep a device charged, and won’t wear any device because she sees no need for one. Hope you can find a solution that works for you. I purchased a T-Mobile Timex Family Connect watch for my mom, who would say she's going for a walk and you couldn't stop her. I purchased the watch from T-Mobile for $125 - and with a monthly line fee of $15 a month, that is if you currently have a T-Mobile account.It's designed for kids, so it's perfect. However, it has, like all the phones do, apps that they can play with. Here are the features:GPS tracking, setup a Geofence for safe areas and when they exit that safe area you get a text message;SOS button, which when pressed, calls the main guardians that have been setup in the deviceIT'S A PHONE - so they can call whoever they want and you can call them (My mom never answered as she just did not recognize the phone was ringing and thought it was music)GPS is really good. When she's walked away, it guided me directly to her (once she was two miles away) You can set lock out modes during designated times you configure on the watch, however, as I discovered this prevented the person from making and receiving calls and that's not good. I thought this would allow me to lock out tinkering with the phone while still be GPS and phone functional.Cons:It behaves funny on WIFI networks and will provide some false positives when on the wifi network - you might get alerts that the watch has left the area because it connected to a cellular tower 1 mile away.Games - allows them to be distracted, but also can cause mishaps as they get focused only on the watch, even when walking.Configuration - you cannot lock out configuration settings on the device - so it can easily be changed. I've asked Timex if they can put in a control that assigns an administrator so that only designated people can make changes.	0
I dont live with my parents anymore and every time I go and visit it seems to get worse. My dad also declined after lacking social interaction from quarantine but we recently started sending him to an adult activity center during the day so he stays engaged and has made new friends. Look about aging and disability agencies in your area - they might be able to help you find resources for your mum Same.	0
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad? My Dad has recently become more technologically challenged as he has aged. I am trying to find over the ear headphones that will be very easy and simple for him to use on his iPad and MacBook Pro over Bluetooth primarily for FaceTime/Zoom.He struggles with switching the Bluetooth connection between devices with other headphones that he owns, so I am trying to find something that would be very easy for him to use. Or what suggestions do you all have that will let him easily communicate with his family and friends?Btw, he prefers headphones to using the speakers on his devicesThanks!Bose Quiet Comfort headphones remember devices and can have active connections to two devices. They will try to connect first to the last connected device and if not found move down the list automatically to try other remembered devices. So these may be worth trying. I use mine regularly with a macbook, ipad and iphone. Nothing to charge, no Bluetooth to connect, and it is super simple to know which device the headphones are connected to. Unless he has the very newest iPad Pro or Air, he should have a 3.5 headphone port on each.I would recommend spending $20 on a simple wired set, and perhaps get something else done the line if those really don’t suit him. I am referring to the new AirPods Max which are an over the ear style headphone. I’d imagine you want something that is easy to use but don’t want him too insulated where he can’t hear the “outside” around him. Imo AirPodsPro might be the best thing. I am going to look into this! We went with Starkey livio edge ones. I will say though, it is a big investment. I have the airpod pros and it automatically connects to your closest apple device. If you want to switch to a different device, it’s a fairly simple process. Can the AirPods Max automatically connect between MacBook and iPad like they do on iPhone and iPad? Connects to my phone and MacBook automatically. He just needs to put them in his ears and it automatically connects to the closest apple device. I'm considering getting setting up a separate phone docking station for my dad because currently the phone is right next to the Mac and at 82 years old the pairing anxiety continues to be an issue even 6 months out. They love niche requests like this. I tried to post there, but my question was removed as I was looking for purchasing advice. I love these headphones -- they are a wire cutter pick for sound control, and work great when listening to music (or anything else). They are comfy and easy to bluetooth.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NM3RSRQ/?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=xm2&ascsubtag=AwEAAAAAAAAAAcX5	0
"Aging live-in FIL is beginning to refuse water / other beverages... TLDR: 70/yo male, widowed since 2005, hoarder, does not take care of himself well normally. Recovered mostly after 6 months. Currently living with his daughter and myself. Doing well under the circumstances currently. Hasn't seen a bill or anything financial for a year now. We used to live an hour away. 7 hours later (3AM) I get a call from him ""I'm still in your wonderful state!"" 13 hours later calls us that he’s home and going to an auction later in the day…Fast forward to 18 hours later... get a call from a sheriff in a county 2 hours south west of his home. (found out about this 2 months later).Nov. 30th 2019 - found in his home conscious but barely alive. After a long recovery process on June 29 2020... he's recovered well enough to leave the long term care facility draining him of 6 grand a month... to live with us, like he said he wanted to do while he was in the home and in the hospital. We also got hooked up after 2 ER visits for catheter issues with in home Nursing on demand. He's lived by himself for over 15 years, and he's gone a little... feral to put it nicely.I have a POA drawn up, but with COVID my bank stopped their notary service, and I'm thinking he might not be inclined to sign, even though I have been handling every part of his life for over a year now. Personally, I did what I had to do to keep him afloat during uncertainty.I am unsure if he knows the in home care people actually cost money... I took him off flowmax which he was on but might give him too many urges... he was peeing generally well when his catheter was in.He's said well I'll just piss in my (adult) diaper... dude... that's literally not taking care of yourself and grounds to move you somewhere else!I'm monitoring him now and he did drink 10oz of Pepsi last night, and always drinks his morning milk of 16oz. Try Notarize or NotaryCam if you can get him to agree to the POA. Good appetite as well and I'm home with him the next few days along with my wife so we can hawk him.We got apple sauce, jello, apples and sometimes grapes in our repertoire. He's not much of a salad type of guy."	0
In some cultures perhaps you'd make a handsome man, who knows?Tell him you're just trying to find a rich Sugardaddy to pay your expenses. We have hit a wall after having my father in our house for the last 2 months. We offered our home to him instead of going to assisted living/memory care. Wanting to keep it all for him. My father has been studying a driver's pamphlet thinking he will get his license back. Talking to the home, they had no record of her leaving.Once, she didn't recognise me.	0
We live in two different states, about 10 hours apart by car. She has countless pieces of paper, sticky notes, and calendars in multiple locations. She doesn’t really use Facebook to keep up with loved ones since she never posts or comments and rarely messages with people. It’s beautiful, but it’s huge and requires lots of upkeep and at 20 years old, it’s quickly becoming a money pit. Mom is a dog lover and has two small dogs who are 15 and 16 and in very declining health. It’s not just a puddle that needs to be cleaned and sanitized (we both have tile flooring). Leaving them can be a nightmare. The dogs require a lot of proactive action in order to reduce some of the workload, and my OCD mind is always looking to the next step to try to avoid a problem. Sometimes not a lot else gets accomplished. She isn’t a hoarder, but the house is full of lots of furniture and things, some of which she never should have bought, most of which she doesn’t use, and she admits that she wants to downsize and doesn’t want a lot of it. She had food in her pantry that expired years ago, cleaning supplies she hadn’t used in years, etc. She can’t find certain things, including a picture of my late father I have wanted for years, because this house is so full of stuff. One older person does not need well over 4000 square feet of large furniture and belongings! The work that needs to be done to get her into a smaller house is something I don’t know how to accomplish.Today was the one year anniversary of a traumatic and life altering event for me. I spent Christmas Day bathing her dogs, cleaning poop, washing their bedding, washing her bedding, and making her bed. I really didn’t want to clean anything dog related today after all I did yesterday. It’s hard not to get mad and resentful when some of the work I end up doing could be avoided if Mom would be proactive or pay better attention. Her somewhat overbearing presence was an issue in one relationship I had a couple years ago, and it also prevented me from spending some time with the person I dated most recently. That seems like a lot to ask of me. I don’t want to move around and don’t necessarily want to live in her current location or with her. I am concerned about how she will fare emotionally, and I’m also concerned about the workload since I won’t be here to do the nitty gritty work with the dogs, wake up with them at night since she doesn’t seem to hear them, or do the planning ahead to avoid a problem. I hate to think of the what ifs, but if something happens to her, I’ll be so screwed with the amount of work in her house, not to mention the associated costs while I try to sell it, which can take time in her area. I am at a loss on so many levels. I guess what prompted me to finally post was the issue today that was so completely avoidable because Mom could have just walked the dog prior to leaving him alone, and he would have been fine. They have disposable ones or reusable ones you just chuck in the washing machine. They're super helpful for older, disabled, and young/small dogs recovering from surgery. If the dogs won't leave them alone (which tends to be more of a young dog issue), my vet recommends dog pajamas or straight up baby onesies if your dog is small enough (carefully cut a hole for the tail). The dog diapers are a great idea, and I have discussed that with my mom because she used them in the past with another dog who passed away at an old age. The problem with her two is the dog who would need the diaper the most has some skin issues, and my mom really doesn’t want her to sit in a dirty diaper or need additional bathing because she already gets bathed enough. The other dog was a rescue and has misshapen back legs, we believe due to abuse in a previous home, and it’d be pretty hard to get a diaper on him. So it just boils down to lots of supervision, and of course the dogs have impeccable timing and always need something when you’re in the middle of a task!I think one of those places you’re describing sounds great in many ways, however I’m not sure my mom is quite ready for that. Downsizing and moving seems like an insurmountable task at this point, especially with me not being close by to help her. Is she open to having someone come by and help with the dogs? Might also help to have the doggos reevaluated by a vet if you haven't already, to make sure you're doing all that you can for them. Other than her yard man (who hasn’t shown up in weeks, so I’ve been doing yard work), she has no help here. In many ways, my mom is in a hell of her own making, and she doesn’t take suggestions well. The older dog can no longer seem to control her bowels, and my biggest fear came true last night when she had an accident in my mom’s bed. She is the person who spends money on things she never uses, and they sit around in bags or boxes forgotten about.	0
"Doesn't have to be fancy, but something that makes it private as far as walking past and looking in. Another option is splitting the curtain in several spots (maybe like 4 big parts) and attaching magnets that will ""let go"" when he pushes against them. Or small garment/fishing weights. For washing hands, maybe a dispenser - automatic. Maybe a foam dispenser that can absorb into his skin. If you have the money/space for a remodel of the doorway, you can look into a bathroom remodel for him. Most people in the home health sector just give these inexpensive solutions because they don't cost much and are easy to implement. Look online. You can get a cheap wire basket to hang on his Walker and put antibacterial hand wipes or gel in it. Just a wild guess, but I know in the US, local government can be picky about these changes inside a home That's a good idea. I wonder if a simple piece of cord could be tied around the door knob ... long enough the he can get where he needs to be then pull the cord to at least semi-close the door. Or a cane or yardstick to gently push the door closed.Sanitary hand wipe cloths can be put into his walker bag so he can clean his hands when he gets back to the bed.I also wonder if part of his not closing the door is fear that if he needs help you won't hear him or won't come right away. In my house we got a pair of CallToU buttons that hang around the neck and buzz where every you put the receiver. You can set the bells to different ring tones so we always knew who pressed the bell by what it chimed. The door closing is easy enough, there are door closers that are pretty inexpensive and install with a couple of screws. An even cheaper alternative is to just get a long spring and screw it to the door and frame on the hinge side. Not a lot of closing power so it probably wouldnt latch, but it could maintain his privacy. Portable handwashing stations are big and intended for festivals and jobsites (at least the ones I could find). There isnt a convenient option, but perhaps a pitcher of warm water poured over a basin or bucket so he can wash his hands when he can sit may be an option? Hand sanitizer could work in a pinch, but isnt as effective. Sounds like somebody needs to be on stand by for when he is finished to insist and assist those hands being washed vs feces on hands, to walker and to anything else he touches. I would sanitize his walker too esp where he grabs it, once in awhile wipe it down."	0
I don't really know what I can do at this point, I have moved to the UK from Aus 10 years ago and have slowly watched my grandmother deteriorate every time I go back to see them.She completely lost grip on reality when my grandfather passed 3 years ago, in the last 2 years since my last visit she has gone from someone who couldn't cook but would remember to eat snacks, remember who we are, walk around the shops - to someone who refuses food, is physically violent, and spends most of her time rewashing the same pile of laundry.This side of my family have never gotten along well but they have spent the last 5 years yelling at each other, winding my grandmother up to see who's side she will take and basically acting like children - and doing the worst things you can do around someone suffering from the disease. I am really worried but no one will listen to me when I say they need more professional support.They have now decided to put my nan in a home but one of the siblings is telling her that the other two are out to get her and don't care about her so they're putting her in a home. I feel like there is nothing I can do..Your grandmother needs a medical evaluation and a guardian or someone to act as her power of attorney. If grandmother doesn’t then see a lawyer specializing in family or estate law to get you on track with information and legal steps. You may be the voice your grandmother needs. A plan from a neutral party will bring clarity. I think standing her ground will be the only way but it's hard with her mental state as I know she feels a lot of guilt that things have gotten so bad. You are right that a neutral party will help ease the tension, a lawyer is a good idea I will look into that - thank you very much You can support your mother to be strong. She emailed them to contact her with questions. Their dissatisfied  calls and texts would bring me to tears. Until then I will continue to call her regularly and try to organise a lawyer or mediator to speak with the family. You may want to consider virtual appointments and zoom calls where you are present. So sorry to hear that, sounds awful! Alzheimers.org & / dementia.org UK have loads of resources, info, tips, & telephone helpline. You can also check out Dementia.org.au. Do some research, talk to alzhms / dementia, then you'll likely at least have a list of questions or concerns / considerations ready to ask lawyer. Thanks very much that is all very useful and reassuring to hear. I think I should give them a call for sure. Yre welcome, it's a really tough situation! I hope you prevail upon your mum to get it done - and NOT appoint her other family members there, sounds disastrousIt's a nightmare, this situation of can't get back to / into Australia. I have friends from Melbourne were visiting India for a month in Feb, they couldn't bring forward their flight before the plague hit, they're STILL stuck in India. It's quite a process & a wait-list, but sooner get on it the better. Dementia.org.au can tell you info all about that. Merry crappest festive season ever!! :) Haha thanks so much, Merry crap-mas to you too. My cousins tell me there wouldn't have been much I could do from here as no one listens to reason any way but the guilt will probably never go. She has taken a 180 turn with the proper environmental changes and medicine/vitamins/nutrition. Try conference calling one with her so you are on the phone too. Empower your mom and gatekeep talking to her siblings for her if you can - that something you can do from where you are. She doesn't live with her, at the moment all siblings are struggling to manage to care for her between the 3 of them and carers now refuse to deal with her because of the violence. It's just a really bad situation from many angles.I have been doing my best but it's easy to start feeling helpless when you're so far away, I think you are right about the help line and something I hadn't considered to bring up again.	0
"MIL is retired and even before COVID had limited activity. My MIL has basically stopped helping out around the house leaving me to do it in my spare time. My husband tries to help but his course load is very difficult especially with distance learning. We started to keep a calendar in the fridge so that's subsided but now she has begun to interrupt conversations, begin talking to my husband when he is taking a test in zoom even after he informs her he is starting. A few weeks ago I had some really exciting news so I went to tell her. Every day I come home to the counters cluttered,  food stuck on ""clean"" dishes,  packaged food in the fridge needing to be cleaned up, and food and spills running down the appliances and lower cabinets. I have tried to keep up the common areas in my spare time but it got so consuming I would feel like crying whenever she went into the kitchen to make food. I want to get a cleaner for the kitchen twice as month but there is no way we can afford it. In my job I work with senior services and her they refuse in home assistance unless the senior is unable to wash on their own. We have talked with her many times about being more mindful as well as wearing her glasses when cooking but she doesn't seem to care about her impact on us. Along with that thought, she has recently been causing me to feel very guilty about spending time with my husband. She has begun talking more and more about dying alone or how she doesn't have anyone to emotionally bond to. We have suggested on multiple occasions setting up socially distant meet ups with friends but she shoots us down. Even after explaining that there is virtually no risk she refuses, however still insists on going to the grocery store. We have offered to go with her or to set up a virtual meeting but again she doesn't seem interested in wanting to change anything. She has also developed some really irritating compulsions that continue even after speaking to her about them. We feel that she is holding us responsible for not only ensuring she is physically taken care of but emotionally as well. In the next two years my husband and I plan to start the adoption process through the foster care system and there is absolutely no way we would be approved with her in the home. At this point she has me feeling like I am the asshole in the home by not constantly providing all her needs. I don't know what to do. This sub has been helpful to see in not alone but I don't know what to do here. Is a senior living community an option? It has saved us alot of time and drama. My mom has since passed on her terms and my dad is in a senior home. I would definitely look into senior housing of some sort. And if you want a child, the sooner you take steps toward finding her a place, the better. Take a list of the things she used to be able to do and now has difficulty plus all the personality changes that have occurred in the last couple of years. There is also something called a Care Manager who does an assessment for services for people. We just went through this with my MIL and I have to tell you it's one of the hardest things we had to go through. She is now living in memory care but its still hard. I know right now it may be overwhelming but in order for you not to get burned out, you and your husband need to think about changing things because it's probably not something that will improve that much. The first consult is free.Have a pad and pencil ready; be prepared to get her out of your house and on her own (with carers)!Good luck!"	0
4 wonderful years we shared together. 4 short years when we planned on having forever. When Dave and I met things were very casual and fun. We instantly hit it off. Every second I spent with him the more I realized that what we had would be special.Dave was a type 1 diabetic for over 10years when we first met. They had a kidney and pancreas for him. The pancreas was able to be saved but the kidney was stubborn and would not wake back up. We planned on buying a home together this summer. My sweet Dave. My heart hurts for you. Be good to yourself right now in the midst of all this grief. This subreddit helped me a lot. Sorry to hear that.	0
I suspect my grandmother is developing dementia and need to know how to go about it A few years ago my grandmother was in hospital (aged 88) and because of the medication she was under, she kept showing common tropes of that of a person with dementia (delusion, forgetting peoples names, etc.) Last time I was down at her house with my brother she was convinced it was my brother that had altered the picture and even gave him money for it.I want to try and visit her as often as I can and I want to know what I can do to when I visit her (how to stay patient when she gets confused, how to keep her on track with the conversation, etc.).	0
So I (26F) am in the process of selling my father (with dementia)'s house, we have showings scheduled all weekend and are staying in an Airbnb. My fiance (27M) and I were waiting like there was a ticking time bomb about to go off, knowing SOMETHING would go wrong. Lo and behold, it happened. He gets antsy easily and usually at home, is able to spend time outdoors/work in the garden. Since I was so frustrated, I forgot to make sure he had a mask and the address of the Airbnb. Immediately I realized this, wrote down the address, and had my fiance bring it to him. :( :( (side note - we live in the Bay Area, where we've had a mask mandate since March, this has been an ongoing source of difficulty for him to remember and comply with consistently)My dad came back in better spirits not long after, but felt insulted that I needed to make sure he had the address. He accepted and we talked for a few minutes, somehow the subject of me singing came up. At the time he was never impressed and would talk about other singers he liked more. I really have been wanting to get back into singing/playing guitar, I stopped due to lack of confidence in myself, I really don't need my art to be insulted by anyone right now, especially not my dad.I know his distorted perception of reality could very well apply to my singing, and that he never got to be around when I was a child to understand that's not something you ever say to your child, no matter how old they are, when they show you their art. The whole reason I'm selling the house is to be able to pay for his care; he definitely needs in-home help, or to be put in a facility (which is our long term goal). I also am going to be stuck financially relying on him as we move to a lower cost of living area; I have PoA so logistically I can handle it, but I am so not looking forward to him dangling that over my head and saying that means he can say or do whatever he wants with no repurcussions. It sounds like you have an amazing partner which will help tremendously. I think you’d benefit quite a bit from reading more deeply about his diagnosis - where I am it’s the alzheimers society that’s the best resource. Please don’t take it personally :) This. You have been asking! All this would do is set OP up for more pain and disappointment. That is not to suggest staff need to stay and passively accept that kind of behaviour directed towards them.	0
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond? early in 2019. Whatever's on, pretty much from morning to night. is gone. If there are resources you've found helpful or terms I should research I would really appreciate that. Any kind of response is welcome as this is a new and pretty painful dimension of my life right now. You can suggest, but if they say no, just drop it and let them be. Arguing will get you nowhere. It's a world of his memories, and we don't know, maybe they make him happy? What makes us happy may not be what they need.Good luck! So hopefully there is time to meet him where he's at. I've found that my dad will reflexively respond ""no"" to some questions but when I rephrase or change the subject and come back to the original question he will agree. Talk to his doctor about all of this because it sounds well beyond MCI. I am so sorry to be the bearer of potential bad news - I hope you are like I was and just wanted straightforward information from others. Talk to his doctor. Maybe go to a driving range? No math and keeping score - just a basket of balls he can practice his stroke on.We do board games around the holidays and we had to do a complete overhaul away from strategy games to stuff he would enjoy. Fun for all ages and all based in the moment, no or limited strategy. He also keeps spreading hand towels out on top of bathroom counters to dry, not sure where that came from. He is very firmly reiterating his independence and it is not going particularly well.Food - put out snacks and ready to eat foods front and center. Bowl on counter. That needs to be in transparent packaging at eye level when he opens the fridge. For when the first one's safety mechanism forcibly shuts it down for half an hour (due to overheating). Which is great, I have a dishwasher but what the heck, one less thing. I just re-wash the stuff. You've hit some of his favorites that I hadn't considered: driving range was on my list, but an overhaul of games and an exploration of hobbies would be awesome. He still has a lot of his book smarts so trivia is absolutely in. Wishing the best for your guy (and your mail) over the holidays! She isn’t socially active and won’t help herself with any anxiety cognitive therapies or activities, no matter how much we or experts try.We do short activities and games and try to coerce her into simple chores. Your description speaks volumes. Unfortunately that dimension seems the least readily addressed--I'm not in touch with many of the people he used to know, and if I were I may not be the person to rekindle those relationships.I'll be thinking of your mom through this, wishing you luck. If you want to talk feel free to PM. When visits or consultations become available this will definitely be part of the conversation--thanks. We have changed meds but he has stayed the same and has rapidly declined. All you can do gently encourage and talk to the Dr. It is absolutely helpful. Best of luck to you and your dad in this. The most difficult part is convincing them that they will like it. I will test the water temperature right before that so it’s at a comfortable range when it hits her skin."	0
I purchased my mom a flip phone to replace her 2nd broken smartphone. She wrecks charge ports and this new phone has a charge base.The problem is, this phone has an emergency services button on the bottom for...you guessed it, emergency situations.Today was moms first full day with the phone and in 4 hours she has called the line at least 11 times. They are fast and friendly. I'm at work right now and do not have access to the device. So I have. No idea if I can just disable it yet or just cancel the service.ThanksGet her a landline. Be careful and make sure that the number is unlisted and has scam alerts activated. My grandmother gets 10x’s the amount of scammer and political calls on the landline than she does on her cell phone. Also, if she’s having problems with the phone, you need to get control over her bank account. You wouldn’t believe how easy it is for scammers to talk the elderly into giving them their banking information and social security number. We’ve had to completely close my grandmother’s accounts and just this week we are looking at whether she’s compromised her account again. My mom literally called this on hers and somehow the number put her call through to 911. Meanwhile—-she was at a rehab after coming out of the hospital so the police showed up at her apartment. The super called me asking what was happening and I told him to tell the police she was not there and was in rehab, and they were like “we have to answer the call; we have to go in”, so they crowbarred their way into her apartment with me on the phone and the super asking “who’s going to pay for this?” Why didnt the landlord go let them in? Said landlord when I meant super. I don’t think he has the keys. I finally put a bandaid over the buttons. My mom was giving $20 tips to grocery cashiers... it is very difficult to get them to relinquish control so would seek help in getting that started. Offices for the Aging usually have some resources to help.	0

I need help, what are my rights as someone who is on ECMO and intubated, but able to communicate during the pandemic. My accessible phone was taken away, my healthcare proxies can't help my communicate my needs now my daughter provided me with an accessible phone, I can answer calls using my face, handsfree. i can also decline calls using my face. The phone is on a gooseneck stand, attached to the hospital bed. I need the phone to face me, so I facial recognition can recognize me I don't require ANY help to use this phone, my family has been clear that folks can end calls and move it out of the way IF and WHEN it is in the way. IT HAS NOT BEEN IN THE WAY What's happening now: The staff kept sedating me and restraining me because they couldn't understand me and thought I was agitated, so my daughters (who are also my healthcare proxies) started jumping on a video call with me, and helped out with communication. They don't stay on the calls because I end calls and indicate when I need to rest and when I don't need them Now I am scared, because they have taken my accessible phone away from me, even though I require no help to use it. All I need is for my phone to be at face/eye level, so I can accept and reject calls and communicate by nodding, shaking head and blinking. THE NURSES KEEP TAKING MY DEVICE OFF THE STAND AND HIDING IT IN TOWELS. I am now left without damage to me Liver, Kidneys, Lungs, Heart. I don't want to be sedated all the time, I am scared without my family. I have not been allowed to speak to them, I tried to tell the nurses I want my phone and they won't let me have it What are my rights? I want my daughters to help me communicate, the hospital has banned in person visits, but now they are trying to ban my phone communication with my daughters who are my caregivers and healthcare proxies. Note: My daughter has typed out this message, I have approved every word.I would check with the Disabilities Dept (DDA or MOD) in your state. Country/state/city? I am in the USA, Boston, MA Find out if the hospital has a patient advocate. They can be your first step in addressing these kinds of issues. The next step would be filing grievance, there should be something about this process on patient rights and responsibilities paperwork, or possibly on a sign in the room (behind the door perhaps). Consults are usually free, so take that into consideration. Daughter here; for my father, who passed away just a few months ago, because he was without us (his caregivers and healthcare proxies), I tried every route, including the patient advocate, but the pandemic is a weird place to be, because not only the patient advocate, but the chaplain, the nursing director, and ethics would not help or advocate for us. Often smaller but affiliated hospitals seem to have much more compassion and empathy. Daughter here, its hard to find folks that understood and know this situation, appreciate you sharing. Daughter here, I wish lawyers were able to help, but they can't, its the pandemic and they usually help when things have already gone bad and you've lost something, and I don't want to lose my mother. Hospital where my mom was (we have her home now) in FL was good and respectful that way. Also have your daughters (whoever is POA) go directly to the CEO and General Counsel with a list of what you want, why and staff responses. Know what you're willing to give into and what is a must before going to them. Lawyers are no help at the moment. I don't know how to get my state rep involved in an immediate way. I would start calling risk management. We had a meeting, where risk management basically told us not to ask questions...	0

"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System? He is okay as far as long term memories, and still knows me, my brother and my mom, who all live with him. We aren't necessarily worried about him getting lost as of now, however, the issue is he never lets us know that he is going for a walk. We know as his condition worsens, this will be more of an issue. Locking all the doors or constant monitoring will likely be what we need to do down the line.. But for now, we just want a way to be notified when he leaves the house so we can know when he left and stop him if needed, accompany him, etc. He has a Verizon Care Smart watchhttps://www.verizon.com/connected-smartwatches/verizon-care-smart/?cmp=KNC-C-HQ-PRO-R-BP-NONE-NONE-2K0PX0-PX-GAW-71700000073797633&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2af-BRDzARIsAIVQUOeGEAjXP4WZpkNzzOSvHv7Zbi9Yy6y8NiuCMC8Q-tVrCtcENIU00HcaAtKwEALw_wcBBut it really doesn't do a good job of sending notices. More over, even though Verizon is by far the best cellular network for where we live, on a device this small the signal is very weak and drops out often. Anyone have any suggestions or thoughts on these products?https://projectlifesaver.org/locating-technology/pli-pr1-perimeter/https://www.alzstore.com/gps-tracker-watch-elderly-p/0950.htmOne more note: I realize there a some tracking devices that are not watches but still wearable. Unfortunately, anything that isn't wristband or watch is unlikely to stay on him. I do know that my local police dept. Ours asks for photos, description of identifying marks, descriptions/licenses of car/bikes/motorcycles, and any local past workplaces or favorite haunts. If your Dad goes missing one day, and you call the police letting them know he is missing - you cut out at least an hour of delay of sending photos and possible routes to the people who will be searching for him. You can also list yourself and your cell as family so if the cops independently find a confused senior before you guys even know he is missing - they know who to call.If you younger folk move out - call the police dept and see they have the ""are you okay"" program. If no one picks up, it notifies the cops who drop by to see what is up. And if grandma falls and grandpa is not with it enough to call 911, it can save a life.When it comes to tech I find it's a mixed bag. Mine carries a cell but he can't figure out how to answer calls, only place them. I usually just leave a message as it is non urgent. He's okay with a fitbit. Is it likely yours would wear it? If no one picks up, it notifies the cops who drop by to see what is up. And if grandma falls and grandpa is not with it enough to call 911, it can save a life.Thanks for advice. As far as wearing new tech: If we remind him to put it on, yes, he will keep it on. Not a risk I'm willing to take. At some point it may be 24 hour care, locking doors, etc. But until we get to that point, just wanted a way to be aware when he leaves the house without getting into alarm systems and locks (yet). Some sort of perimeter alert would help but systems I've seen haven't been ideal. Thanks"	0
inpatient care housing coverage Hello! I've tried reading through insurance handbooks and coverage plans but are having a hard time understanding it, and I've also chatted with my aunt who was a nurse for 40-odd years and worked in hospices a lot and the things she tells me about insurance are things you can't find unless you find out through first-hand experience. I do not know all of her exact diagnoses, but I believe she has (on paper) cerebral palsy, and epilepsy. I'm sure more that I'm unaware of. I do not have the time or money to care for her myself, so I wanted to look into sueing for custody of her and then putting her into a home until I finish college, and have a good job to take proper care of her with an in-home nurse. Though, I am open to avoiding the sueing and talking with my mother about other options and keeping my sister nearby her, and custody in the hands of my mother, as they are close, and it would just be easier on me. The only way I can go a more cival route with my mother though is if I have everything worked out and squared away myself, and with the people I'd need to talk to before going to her, so, I'd still need to figure all this out myself.Inpatient care though, as I'm sure you're all aware, is horribly expensive. And has a track record of being atrocious to patients, especially those who can't stand up for themselves like my sister. My aunt told me that she needs 3 dianoses (unsure which, she didn't elaborate), and then approval to be taken in by a home where they will take her diability check (which is around $800, I believe), besides $30 that the family will get to cover general expenses for my sister.I basically wanted to just ask how true that is, if anyone here knows any more information about it, how to find a good home, any cheats to get better coverage, or better insurances for this type of situation that she would qualify for, and if there is a state that would be better for her. She could stay in AL, CO, or OR (as I'm moving there for my masters). Or just anything you think would be helpful or important to know. Honestly if you even just have a story of you dealing with a simular situation just so I feel less alone in it that'd be welcome too, haha.I strongly recommend you ask in /r/legaladvice you are traversing law, welfare and multiple state lines. Are you dead set on this course of action, or still in the research and development stage? Sorry I'm all questions and no answers, just wanted to give my two cents and let you know you are heard Youre very sweet, thank you. I am pretty dead set, but i dont want to do anything until I know I can keep her safe and continue to pay for everything she needs, not to mention know where I'm going to live as my education is going to require me to move to Oregon in about 4 years. I think this has a pretty slim chance of happening, though. Even moreso if i could keep my sister in alabama. Its fine when its me, not so much when its my sister, for obvious reasons. she also has a tendancy to neglect my sisters personal hygiene (bathing, brushing teeth, ect) a lot more, and now that shes working my sister can go upwards of 9ish hours without having her diaper changed (my moms now boyfriend cares for her, and is very sweet with her but my mother wont let him change her. Hes not like that and my sisters in no position to consent nor be looked at in that light) Its moreso a case of will my mothers actions get her killed or jailed for an extended amount of time / get my sister taken from her in general, and can i avoid that before it happens because waiting till it does will be more difficult to fix. I know though that my sister is in greater spirits since getting out of school / since i moved, and i dont think she really notices the neglect. If i had my way id just buy my mom house and a personal nurse for my sister, then i wouldnt have to worry about what things my mom does in her free time affecting my sister while not having to split them up as im sure my sisters the last thing keeping her from going completely off the rails. Shes just a bit difficult, and doesnt have the resources that would help both her and my sister. Also!	0
Even checking off the boxes is too big of a task. This may need to have two versions. My solution was eliminate multiple choices and make them 2 part. We feel entirely alone in this and even others talking about their story and not offering advice helps immensely.	0
Do any of you use and recommend an at-home fall detection/medical alert device? Apologies if this has been posted, I am having a hard time finding any real person reviews on these devices :(I am comparing brands such as Bay Alarm Medical, Medical Guardian, and MobileHelp. They all basically charge $20-30 for basic at home services where the user can press a button on her bracelet or necklace to call for help. I am unable to really understand if these companies are reputable. They seem more interested in making sales. I am looking to make my grandma safer. Thanks in advance for your adviceI did similar research a couple of years ago and ended up with a company called “Great Call.”  I went with them because their device has fall protection and I can track her on my phone. We know the fall alert works because the device got caught in her sweater and went flying as she was changing her clothes. They have great customer service, her old device wasn’t holding a charge anymore so they shipped out a new device free of charge. I think I pay about $35 for the monitoring and I feel that it is money well spent for peace of mind. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions. My mother had the one made by Phillip's. It works great, both when detecting a fall or just pressing the button. It was out of range and didnr detect. I would say it works like a charm but you have to teat it for range, and there seems to be some kind of dongle nor attachment you can purchase sep as rarely to enhance range if you need it and I wish I had done it, however I am here with her now and she only needs to use it if I go grocery shopping. Liberty is the one we use, but that is because my husband is a vet and we get it free. They have been fantastic, and I don't think they charge much. I do know that when I press the button to test it, they immediately come on and call me by name (I am on the account) and make sure everything is okay.They also sent out a replacement free of charge, and we have it set up so that they call me first, if they can't reach me they call my son, and then the police thank you!	0
I actually had to use the phone tracking app we have to find him the last time. Are there baby-proof systems you can put on the doors to notify you when they door gets opened? I don't know specific names but I have seen people talk about that here. I can definitely look in to those.And yes I was happy he had his phone with him. You seem to be doing a great job so far... This community is great for resources. Look into Project Lifesaver. It’s often free because police/sheriff departments find it cheaper to find a person this way than do a full search and rescue.I also have an alarm system on my exterior doors. I turn it on overnight, but I can also have it chime or announce when any door is opened.Definitely hide car keys. Sometimes simple slide- or hook & eye locks can make a difference. The person might not be looking for those and simply turn around when the door doesn’t open the normal way.Good luck! !	0
Tracking device Canada I’m sorry if this has already been asked a bunch but I couldn’t find anything helpful. I need some way of tracking her so if she does I can find her, for example a device that I can put in her purse or something. It can be costly but worth it! Check with a local search and rescue team, they might have sponsorship to set her up for free on Project Lifesaver. Tiles? Look on Amazon. I’m getting my mom some for Christmas for her keys, wallet, phone, iPad. Also if she carries any devices around you can do find my friends and track her. I’ll look into it. Thanks! Trackers like Tile, Chipolo, Cube, TrackR, etc, work while connected to a mobile phone or tablet. I can track my mom’s car keys, but only if her phone is charged and Bluetooth connected. They can track continuously (typically more expensive) or set intervals every so many minutes. Righto yeah at the moment she always has her purse with her and we are looking into getting some sort of care for her if things progress to worsen but just looking for something in the meantime.	0
Caring for my mother with dementia. What it truly feels like to be loved by your mother, is the love you can see on her eyes the second you walk into the room. Picked up a giant diner statue at a swap meet and tons of Vinyl records. Elvis was playing regularly around the house this year. Her insurance was still a California HMO plan the and was nothing but thorn in my side. Every doctor had a different opinion and they all seemed scared of their own shadows. They were all unwilling to try alternative medications or treatments I found in Europe. After countless visits in multiple practices we found a young doctor willing to try something new. The appointment a the dental office went very well. After a panoramic X-ray, the doctor had a ton of questions. With the connections to Benadryl and dementia, I found during a previous hunt. When that hope was crushed, I just started to blame. Sometimes life beats me down and I loose site of who I am. It took a couple weeks to figure it out. It’s very hard to keep track of the clean clothes vs the dirty ones. We usually head out to lunch around 2. There’s a local bar/restaurant that know us well. We hang out for about 45min while I control the music form an app in my phone. It’s one of her Favorites and will keep her calm if she has a beer in her hand. I kept reassuring her they were dry, to no avail. Please! There’s a Facebook page called Mending the broken pieces where I was originally documenting stuff. Maybe you can find some helpful stuff on there. She said ‘yes’ so I asked if I could speak to that person. I’m losing my mother to this disease currently, and this speaks to me so deeply. I definitely will! You’re fighting the good fight. Please, continue writing & I'll gratefully keep reading! Xo Many thanks! Around 5pm every night, she paces the house yelling and screaming for about an hour until she finally makes way to her room. This very heart breaking to experience. Being completely helpless is one of the worst feelings ever. Work out gloves are the norm, she wears them everywhere. I grabbed 10 pairs of soft sweat pants and 10 hooded sweatshirts in the smallest size they had. Knowing small wasn’t going to be small enough, we went directly to the seamstress down the street. That lady was awesome! I paid a little extra, she had them sized perfectly and ready for pick up in a couple hours. The clothes she has now, all look the same and are the colors she likes. Hopefully here soon. I ended up letting the nanny go, mom was getting very aggressive with her. I watch to see if she’s  confused or scared, it’s easy to spot, her walking pattern will appear more erratic instead of purposeful. Fortunately I passed out flyers explaining her condition a month before. I received a call from the local PD as I was walking around the block looking for her. I put cameras inside main living areas, one in her room and a couple outside. The new system notified me when the cameras saw motion, and had a mobile app so I could look in when I was away. This was extremely helpful to have. Its a nice escape to have a place where you know everyone, and everyone knows you. A call to the hospital on the drive and they got her in right away. I changed them frequently and always made sure she had enough fluids.At this point some people called me Stoic. Thank you	0
"The company I work for is pitching an app idea to help people that are suffering from Alzheimer's.We are pitching a memorization app - an app that can help people remember who they are by using their device’s data - photos, memories, messages or even music - either the family provides the music that the patient used to enjoy or maybe just the music that was very popular doing some important phases of his life. Just remind the person to take a short quiz, ask them basic stuff and correlate the data to watch for any progress, notify them from time to time to go through some of the quizes. We were thinking about splitting it into three phases - if the patient is at an earlier phase he gets notified to do them at himself, after the results are not as good, he can do it together with the family or nurse and in the end only someone else can do it for him.We are still at the phase of evaluating the idea but we would love to hear any feedback - would it be useful, would it feel too intrusive, is there something out there already that serves the same purpose, even furhter reading might be more than useful.Thank you and take care!Sounds too complicated. My spouse can't handle much tech any more. So I get stuck with all the troubleshooting, reading fine-print manuals, etc. She didn't even want one in the home. Google Home was far to foreign to her, even though the ease of just saying ""Hey, Google play X"" would have made it so easy for her to listen to music. We ended up putting in an old-fashioned radio and she was much happier with that. We will try and make some inquiries to the alzheimer's association, check out if any of this makes sense .I don't know anyone with Alzheimer's personally but my father suffers from mental illness and during the stints he had in an institute he was heavily sedated and sometimes used to phone me asking me if I will be visiting him that day only minutes after getting home from the visit. I really like the idea; my question is what is the app ultimately for? Is it to create an enjoyable experience for someone with AD, to reminisce about things they used to like? The idea is not fully fleshed out, at this stage it's just a proposal."	0
Evluate idea Hello everyone!Looking for some directly related opinion for something. The company I work for is pitching an app idea to help people that are suffering from Alzheimer's. We are pitching a memorization app - an app that can help people remember who they are by using their device’s data - photos, memories, messages or even music - either the family provides the music that the patient used to enjoy or maybe just the music that was very popular doing some important phases of his life. Just remind the person to take a short quiz, ask them basic stuff and correlate the data to watch for any progress, notify them from time to time to go through some of the quizes. We were thinking about splitting it into three phases - if the patient is at an earlier phase he gets notified to do them at himself, after the results are not as good, he can do it together with the family or nurse and in the end only someone else can do it for him.We are still at the phase of evaluating the idea but we would love to hear any feedback - would it be useful, would it feel too intrusive, is there something out there already that serves the same purpose, even furhter reading might be more than useful. I would consider not making it like a quiz, but simply an easy to use app for someone with dementia to experience memorable photos, videos, messages, and music. Family members and approved friends can add to the data. My nonprofit currently has users load photos with descriptions onto our web apps. We then create Memory Books or Cards and send to their loved one with dementia free of charge.	0
I was looking for a gps tracker and most of them are watch based or a beacon that he has to have with him all the time. The problem is he is really clumsy and probably throw them away or hide it when nobody is around. I wanted to know know if anyone has faced similar situation or knows about a product that will be hard for him to get rid off. There are moments when he does not even recognize familiar faces.Door locks with a key required for both sides at night.An alarm for the door that goes off when door is opened during the day and Hire a caregiver. I don’t know if it’s available in your city but something worth campaigning for if it isn’t. There’s also shoe inserts with gps from several companies. Hey drunkguy, I'm including a link to a page where I listed all the things we've used to put the house on lockdown in case any of these tricks will work for you. Doh!https://www.stumpedtowndementia.com/products Contact your local Aging and Disability Resource Center (if in US) or aging agency. The monitoring was free but you had to buy about $350 of equipment.Then my husband stopped wandering. I am keeping that equipment in case he starts up again.	0
I had hit my side of my head on the metal bar ladder on my swing set, but I think my bike, and/or my hands helped not make the accident as painful.I didn't really think much of it, due to the accident not really being painful, but I think after the accident, after 2 weeks, I had started getting cognitive impairment, my memory loss was almost instant, but my typing and speech were declining slowly. Before that, there are several posts along the lines of computer simulations and games. That's The harsh reality of my situation. There is a possibility that I can keep this at bay for many years to come... we'll see what the specialists say. You're not bothering me by posting what you post-it seems you do want answers. Research can be procrastination in disguise... go see a doctor Time is my biggest enemy right now. I believe you could be on the right track with this. The doctor will help you learn the facts, but you MUST provide the doc with the right information---only the facts. There’s actually 5 main predispositions to the disease. Not looking to get into a dispute. I'm 49 and have my own concerns/issues, and I wish more people would try and soak in as much knowledge as they could. I've done tons of research because this is subjective for me. He gave me to another doctor who is a phycologist. They never say what I have, besides anxiety, which I only had gotten from realizing I had gotten my symptms.My diet consists of junk food as snack. The symptoms after 2 weeks appeared, and no matter how much I sleep, it doesn't go away, and it's been 3 months, so I believe it could be a concussion.Wouldn't concussion be a form of dementia if it affected your cognitive skills? What about this post here?https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jqpaqu/dementia_can_be_caused_by_head_injury_and_isnt/ There is a big difference between a concussion and a traumatic brain injury. I realize this is a personal mission of yours to spread info about dementia from sudden brain trauma. Also, almost every single thing I look up keeps bringing me back to dementia or relates to dementia is also confusing me. I could be me being a cyberchondria, due to me always researching every single thing I have.	0
"Advice on dealing with my ornery FIL who's living with us indefinitely TLDR: 70/yo male, widowed since 2005, hoarder, does not take care of himself well normally. Currently living with his daughter and myself. Doing well under the circumstances currently is (probably) dehydrated and losing appetite. We used to live an hour away. 7 hours later (3AM) I get a call from him ""I'm still in your wonderful state!"" 13 hours later calls us that he’s home and going to an auction later in the day…Fast forward to 18 hours later... get a call from a sheriff in a county 2 hours south west of his home. After a long recovery process on June 29 2020... he's recovered well enough to leave the long term care facility draining him of 6 grand a month... to live with us, like he said he wanted to do while he was in the home and in the hospital. We also got hooked up after 2 ER visits for catheter issues with in home Nursing on demand. We switched him to a Tuesday, Thursday Friday plan on the home care help (4 hrs a day) because he is doing better. Make sure you also take care of yourself and don't burn yourselves out. He's doing well eating his pizza at lunch today and he went through 18oz of Milk with his oatmeal this morning. You and your wife have taken on a huge thankless responsiblity which I'm sure will continue to become more challenging. It sounds like you have been able to do quite well for him and that's amazing but it at what cost to you and your wife? I would at least start researching and home nursing companies and talk with them about what your FIL needs. They will be able to tell you if you need to add nursing care. If you live in the states I would contact your local Area Agency on Aging to see if they can offer any suggestions. Remember you can't keep someone else warm by setting yourself on fire. Change your name, burn your phones, purchase fake death certificates, and then move across country. It is utterly frustrating not knowing exactly whats going on and how to help. If he can get around ok and has been just sitting all day see if you can get him up and moving. Those can help the appetite as well as other things. My advice would be to get FIL settled back into a care home as long as he can afford it, or find out what he needs to do to qualify for Medicaid to pay for it. It's actually nicer for them if they can get get situated in a long term care facility while they can still have conversations and walk around and participate in activities. My mom wouldn't put my dad into a facility until he was pretty bad off, and he spent his last years scared all the time. We got him hydrated and he's eating better I did have him on a mild stool softener but took him off thinking it would take away liquid from him. He will need more liquid with a stool softener, but without it he might not be eliminating properly. Crappy shituation all around."	0
"This is the hardest thing I have ever done as he is verbally and psychologically abusive.Today, the pharmacy delayed a prescription that my Dad started in my absence. He stated that he had gone to the doctor and spoke with a PA, who switched him back to one of his former heart medications. My father has stopped and started medications randomly as well as created scenarios around why he started/stopped the meds in the past. He said he must have thrown it away. I abruptly ended the conversation, as I felt like I was falling into the ""reasoning"" trap that caregivers are told to avoid so that the patient doesn't get agitated.I thought about it alone some more, and suddenly remembered that I DID see the new medication 30 days ago. (He has, and it scared me. It was so hard to even get him to stick to a medication schedule, use his pill box, and not take whichever meds he feels like.Sorry for the length. I don't even know what I am asking for here. Be kinder to you.I don’t know if this could help, but I believe there are pill dispensers that only open various sections at specific times. Be sure to take care of yourself too. It’s all you can do. Just focus on keeping the two of you safe and happy. I could tell ya stories but will save it. they dont have compassion and understanding. they see it as weakness and a way to hook into you. Act like its no big deal. And the slope is slippery and dark and murky. | info | More Books"	0
Apple - you really suck! She does not have the capability to do anything more than play a few games and follow her grandkids on Facebook. If its still locked, my dad had an Iphone several years back, same issue. I was able to unlock thru Itunes app. I’m actually in the process of a restore right now. If we go back into a shelter in place, that is when we will have some serious issues. She uses her iPad for hours at a time with a paint by number & other apps. Thanks! Can you setup facetime for her and someone at the facility start it for her?. Might be really cool. Thank you!! Wife with dementia uses an iPad which works great. This isn't an Apple issue. Apples' security features are the only ones I'd trust in this kind of situation. If I could have her living with us to provide more hands on care I would, you must be fortunate in that respect.Her user ID and password are on a post-it taped to her devices so device security is not my first concern for her to play paint by number. She is unable to maintain a booklet with passwords as in one day she ends up changing her password several times. One day 32 password alerts came to my email in three hours.The few apps she uses for entertainment don’t concern me as far as security goes, she has never set up personal financial info on any of her devices and I am her POA so her bank account flags me for all transactions & her two financial advisors have to run any transactions through me. If she didn’t do it then someone helping her with IT at her facility did. TeamViewer support will let you see her screen but not control it. You can do more with android and,way more with windows. Thanks! Viewing her screen would be helpful at times, no doubt. That may become her next option as she is at a stage of dementia where she can get enjoyment from simple apps.	0
My father is noticeably declining, getting increasingly more lonely because me and my mom are always working. The house isn’t clean and whenever we touch surfaces they’re sticky. I feel like if I give up this lab job and I don’t make it into PA school I risk losing out on being able to support them but lose the time with them because of the drive. Lab= potential of 30$/hr(salary) currently $18 & benefits . Schedule is flexible 12-8. (1hr commute) MMJ Product specialist= $15/hr, no benefits but retirement plan. (15 min commute) I was hoping to be offered a spot in a program so my friend who wants to work in a lab (who has a medical condition that hinders her capability to walk) could take my place. Too add to everything mention above, I lose my insurance in a month, happy 26th birthday to me.I take care of my elderly parents, I know how confusing and difficult it is. It's also good your eyes are open to this kind of thing right now so you can prepare yourself for the future. Talk to other people that have been through it, find some good online forums for research or support and know that there are no easy answers for any of this. I’m trying to get to a point where I can take care of them by being able to offer resources. Is there any kind of elderly day care available? I got a decent insurance plan at very little cost that will carry me over until I get a job that will come with insurance. Open enrollment starts November 1st but I think you can apply anytime.	0

"GPS device for senior Hi,&#x200B;My dad is in his late 80s and should not be out by himself with his high blood pressure and a history of stroke which has lead to a couple of black outs / falls injuring himself. We're trying to put a GPS device on him so we can at least track his whereabouts without to be with him all the time which is impossible due to logistics. I was recommended the Apple Watch but before we go that route, is there anything less tech and simple? We don't mind paying a monthly service fee. There are family tracking apps you can install that will give you all of that info without the need to purchase another device. On Amazon they have these:  https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=gps+device+for+seniors+star&ref=nb_sb_noss&#x200B;I'm just not confident their tracking software is as intuitive as Apple's ""Where's my device"" trackers are which is pretty robust. I’m not sure about the devices on amazon, and I would personally be hesitant to try a cheap knockoff for a device you really want to be fail-safe. I have looked into this company a bit: The Light Bug. I like how long their battery lasts, and the fact that they have been around for many years. The screenshots of their app/interface also look pretty intuitive. That said, I haven’t gotten to the point of needing a GPS tracker for my parents, so I haven’t tried any out yet. The device you linked looks very robust and industrial however they seem to be out of stock at the moment. I'll see what they say about replenishment but at this point my fall back is the Apple Watch since it has fall detection. There are several devices that might work depending on the individual:  https://www.seniorlink.com/blog/the-50-best-gps-trackers-for-seniors THanks for that site. Looks to be chalk full of useful info."	0
"Does anyone have experience using a bidet/handheld bidet to clean an elderly women who has frequent accidents and can not clean herself? Recommendations? Is using a bidet/handheld bidet to clean my grandma who does not have control of bowel movements and can not clean herself safe? I'm interested in hearing other peoples experience using one. What type do you use? What should I look for when getting one? Is getting one that hooks up to warm water recommended? Thank you!Get one that you can attach to her regular toilet. Amazon has them. I think we are going to give the shower head extender a try. You need to connect it to the hot water line of your sink and to the cold water line that goes to the toilet tank. They are not that expensive. My roommate had one installed in the last place I lived and I did use it a few times just to try it. I guess it would be helpful if someone has trouble cleaning themselves. I have and use one every day. From just my perspective as an owner of one, not as someone who's used one to clean someone else, I can see where it would come in handy. I would suggest getting one that has the ability to warm water because cold water there is quite a shock if you're not expecting it. Therefore you're going to want to get one with a self-cleaning feature (most have this) and let it run for a few seconds before turning it on to spray her posterior to allow the time to warm up.Second, warm water bidets have a knob to adjust the temperature. They can be bumped fairly easily on some models. I would suggest using it yourself and adjusting it to a comfortable temperature, letting it run for a minute or so to be sure it's not going to get hotter, then put a piece of packing tape over the knob to stop it from being changed. A scalded bottom if it gets set to straight hot water by accident, especially if the person has trouble communicating that it hurts, is not good.I've heard that using a bidet can be good for hemorrhoids if you're not blasting the water pressure. I've read that gentle water pressure is much like a sitz bath and cleaning without rubbing with toilet paper to irritate things and leave behind ""lint"" can help alleviate itching. As for cleaning the more frontal area, most have a setting for front and back to redirect the spray. I'm a bigger woman and to be sure everything's getting cleaned, I lean forward a bit to help the spray hit the target better. We have one for my gran, she loves it, she has limited dexterity so we worried about her being able to use it, but she is able to turn the nob. I am strongly leaning to moving it to another toilet and getting a spray one for the main bathroom Thanks that is really helpful? I bought one for my disabled (and overweight) friend. She said it works great, but the water's cold. I tested it when I installed it, and YES IT'S COLD but it works great."	0
I'm at a loss, what do I do? Serious advice/recommendation needed! I (34f, not living with, but visiting daily during the week) need some advice to help my mom. My dad has been very forgetful, he's happy one minute, pissed the next. He has never asked. When he came back he was really tired, but he told my best friend (who lives there to help out) that the third house he walked into, the guy told him to get the eff out of his house or he was calling the police. It's not physical that I've ever seen. I'm hoping that someone else has some helpful information about what to do next. org / alzheimers .org for info & tips how to navigate this part of the journey, and lot of other info regarding all facets of living with memory loss, for the person and family & friends. To get the conversation moving with his PCP, I called and spoke to him privately about my and my mother's concerns prior to my dad's appointment. Then not to long after he had a period of clarity and realized that he did have a problem. It's been about 3 years from diagnosis to now. Thanks! When my mum got diagnosis, I did some free short courses / workshops with Alzheimers Australia (now DementiaAus) for carers / family / friends of memory lossed person. Here in Aust we have govt services (free, if on govt seniors pension) to support folk at home, oldies facility respite, etc. There are some oldies groups for social support, activities, mens craftworking sheds, so they can have social interaction, & carers / family get time-off. There's no GPS, its just a metal bracelet such as diabetics / epileptics have - bought from & registered with alzhms org, cost like $60, its engraved the persons unique ID number, that ambulance / police can access the private contact details. It's impossible to get them to not go out for walks if they want - just have to let them go, trust it'll be ok. My mum is very mobile, I got her high-vis vest to wear when she's out walking alone up & down our street. This 2020 with so many places on lockdowns & so on, it's tough. Most of the time he won't even take his phone with him. I have joked about a tracking chip, mom didn't think it was funny 🙄 She will not leave him alone because she's afraid he'll get hurt, and he doesn't ever want to go anywhere with her. Very frustrating, trying to help folk who claim they don't want or need it. I will look at their calendar and see if he has an appointment coming up, and I'll call to have them put a note in. Thank you for the websites I will definitely check them out! Nothing productive can happen until then. This is seriously something you need to consider if your mom won’t even discuss a home Would they consider an assisted living situation together? My best friend lives with them, but she's never worked with the disease before so she doesn't know what to do. My friend and I have tried talking to my mom about it and she just gets upset. She’s pretty awful to deal with on a good day let alone a bad one. You need help and for your mum too. There will be options so just breath and remain hopeful. Seek advice from any government or organisation that specifically deals with aged care issues - start googling and get yourself a notebook. Start with calling someone on Monday Not sure about a support line, but I was given a couple of websites to look into, and plan on doing that tomorrow. If possible, seek out a geriatric neurologist, especially at a research/university hospital, where they are better trained on dealing with the diagnosis period.	0
"What options are there for care of disabled person who needs 24/7 care and you can’t afford a paid caregiver? I am at the brink. Has urinary incontinence so wears pull-ups. He needs 24/7 monitoring/assist which I provide, and have every monitoring device imaginable to try to keep him safe (baby video/audio monitor, bedrail, clip-on alarm, bed alarm, etc). I don’t know what to do. We can’t afford a caregiver and he refuses to be safe (thinks he’s strong/overestimates his current capabilities). I’m not working right now but his decisions to be unsafe are driving me over the edge. We can’t afford for me not to work much longer. Our only income is his social security and it is just enough to make us ineligible for Medicaid. I am seriously about to lose my mind. He needs 24/7 care right now and I cannot sustain this level of effort by myself, but we are broke. Are there resources I’m not aware of?You will need to have a 30 minute consult with an Elder Care Attorney. The answer is not one you are going to want to hear but better that is comes from them. You're California residents now? Has your husband been declared disabled by Social Security? Have you contacted Medical to see if you qualify due to his disability (and not your income)?I only ask because it really seems like he would qualify solely based on his disability. What type of healthcare do you use for PCP visits, therapy, etc? I think it's worth a try as some websites mention a ""share of cost"" option that you might qualify for even with the social security income. You can use a baby monitor for elderly care as well. The monitor provides a way for the elder to call for assistance when needed.I use the Bebcare Hear digital audio baby monitor to help take care of my 90 year old mom at home. I can only answer for Ca because that’s where I live, but has he been declared disabled, is that what his SSI is for?He would need to be a resident, but If he is disabled, he qualifies for Medi-cal and you can be paid though IHSS (in home supportive services) or someone can be hired to care for him in the home. Are you sure it’s not SSDI. Social security the elderly kind would be unusually before 62 [deleted] Did you try the medi-cal working disabled program. https://ca.db101.org/ca/programs/health_coverage/medi_cal/faqs.htm#_q651. Seems like maybe the medically needs program might work"	0
Use active listening, take everything they say into consideration, and act on their requests as long as they do not compromise care. It eventually blew over but it serves to tell me that as a caregiver this entire disease process is a long and difficult road and we need to constantly keep learning. Caregiver burnout due to personal issues is very common and it can affect how you give care which eventually affects your dad. Patience and compassion will keep you going, love on them and give them your best as they did  🧡	0

I've been caregiving for her for over a year and I've setup cameras 2 years ago (I have 1.5 years of video of me caregiving for her). I've been trying to track and chart her care and my care as well. So come talk to me, share your griefs and your joys. I drove specifically 45 minutes away so I can talk to some people in the same situation. I think that's what good Moms do I do have a forest that's sort of near here, but I don't know if I'll be able to take her. It's getting quite cold. But that's a bit difficult, finding the time to research the technology and the finances (the government is really annoying with their beaurocracy).I don't know if this is a problem for you but: sleep, exercise, nutrition, and don't isolate! VR makes me dizzy and nauseous. People with stokes and brain damage can easily feel dizzy. Nature shows on TV are a lot more comforting. Thanks, yeh, sister doesn't tolerate cameras. At least I've made the home & property safer, removed sharp gardening & other tools, mats & sharp-edged furniture, take the dials off the stove when I'm not there, etc.. I'm usually around anyways. We take photies / selfies out, I print them out & make collages, go colour photocopy them A3 size, to put on the wall or fridge our adventures...	0
Has anyone bought or used an anti-choking device? I’m looking at these two as an emergency option. I'm a caregiver to someone with a feeding tube now and these devices were never options that came up when she was having trouble swallowing, which included two Heimlich maneuvers.Edited: she may not be able to do a swallow test with dementia because you need to follow instructions. No one ever mentioned these products to us either. I will have to find out about the swallow test, so we will know when a feeding tube might be appropriate. If a feeding tube is an option for her medically, I wish we had done ours earlier. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing - she could get 90% of her food and fluids through the feeding tube and still eat 10% for pleasure, which will be great for you as the caregiver. Sometimes I use protein shakes or smoothies as a meal replacement when I really need the break. Using your breast bone as a support for their head while you get a suction around their mouth is super helpful. Thank you so much! I hope I never need it, but I feel better having more options available. Wow what great devices! I didn’t even know they existed! Wish I had known about this sooner. I hope you can gain some insight on  if these products can help your dear grandmother. They sound promising. it has sugar, which they like, lots of water, is fun, familiar and comes in colors. And love Ahh good idea! Altering her diet will prevent choking and make mealtimes much safer. (I am an occupational therapy student so please let me know if you have any other questions). As others have mentioned, there definitely is the swallowing test with an ultrasound that can be utilized.	0
I wish Apple would let caregivers install a senior package for an iPad that allowed caregivers to operate their care receiver devices remotely. I wouldn’t care if I had to travel to an authorized Apple store to verify with my POA that remote access is for my mom’s devices. Yes I have auto updates enabled which works consistently for apps but not software updates.SNL was spot on with their Amazon Echo Silver skit! I also want an iOS-Senior. They can do this!! One of the Residents at the nursing home where I work has a PC laptop that sits on her desk. Her grandson has remote access to it. Yeah, remote access to my mom's desktop is fantastic. I’m using Splashtop and it’s been invaluable. My mother was very disappointed to discover that I do not have remote access to her phone. [deleted] This would be awesome! No one could reach my mom for several days, because she had turned her phone to vibrate and no matter what I told her to do to fix it, by the time we finished our call, she forgot. Meanwhile, her VM is completely full and she has no clue how to listen to them or clear them out. I’ve had to buy (and learn how to use) and Android for just this purpose. Confused about the updates part. Can’t you just turn off auto updates?I feel you tho. I so wish my dad used android phones but he can’t handle the change. I haven’t looked for that tho.	0
At first we thought it was the pain meds, but now he is off of them and he is still having a lot of confusion.He has a hard time learning the exercises he needs to do. We are all hoping he will regain some once he is walking again, but he is just struggling so much. And I think when he sees it getting to me it makes him more confused and starts blaming himself.I’m open to advice, but mostly just wanted to get this out there and share.One simple but overlooked thing to check would be if he has a UTI. Came here to say this! Came to say it too! In fact 6 months ago was living independently & driving! UTI's at that age really do a number on them. [deleted] Have you heard of Jelly Drops?I don’t have any personal experience yet, but it seems like a brilliant idea, and a great way to keep someone hydrated. All I know is that falls often proceed cognitive decline (when the caregiver looks back on the pattern. Falls for the elderly are usually the beginning of the end. If they have ANY assets, talk to a local elder care attorney. Local government should be able to find one. Try the Bar association.	0
Scam? Anyone know if   transcranial photobiomodulation    works? This company Vielight keeps posting how wonderful and proven their $1700 device is. I can not find any information on the internet that this is a proven method for anything. This has been around for years as either a laser or red light and other various treatments. Medicines like memac can help marginally but not much at all anyway. I tend to lean toward scam but I'd discuss it with my loved one's neurologist. It looks like it's in clinical trials but then I question why it's already available for purchase.	0
I want to get her another gift that will make her life better (without blatantly being labelled as 'gifts for people with memory issues') as I passed the day time clock off as just a snazzy digital clock, 'just like my Alexa nan! I'm looking for large print books but am struggling to find anything I'm confident she'd like. Do you have any recommendations for useful gifts for the people in your life suffering with memory loss? A good place to find large print books?Any help will be greatly appreciated!If she loves reading, maybe she'd be receptive to audio books? Could you get her a few large print books from the library to see what she likes? We are trying some youth books like Little House in the Prairie but she says she has a hard time following the story. Garfield and calvin and hobbes omnibuses maybe, so the pictures can help jog comprehension or be enjoyable by themselves? I got my dad some jigsaws. We tried that last year, but my grandmother says her hands shake too much so wouldn't really try to help. Harlequin books Large print Thank you! at the bottom.http://blog.waysandwane.com/2020/09/23/hello-world/ When they are further gone with dementia, don't be afraid to give women with Alzheimer's (and sometimes men) a lifelike baby doll. For Christmas a couple years ago, we got my grandmother a stuffed raccoon (on my mother's suggestion). https://montessori-images.com/shop/stories-for-older-adults/stories/day-wind-seeker/https://montessori-images.com/shop/stories-for-older-adults/stories/a-sidewalk-garden/ This is great, thank you so much! If you search Amazon there are specific books for persons with Alzheimer’s & Dementia. Yeah I've looked at them but they all seem a bit... Was hoping to get something more on the DL! I bought a couple of youth books, including the Little House on the Prairie series and said I was loaning them to her so I can read them when she is done. It looks like an old fashion radio and has just two controls - one to turn it on and one to skip tracks. It fits loads of music so I filled it with the stuff he loves like Leonard Cohen, Simon and Garfunkle, Seasick Steve and its been great. You set the volume on the bottom with a tiny dial so its set and can't accidentally be turned down. This is an awesome idea! I'm on my laptop now so can give the link to it.Heres what I got. Both my parents love it and it fits loads of music on it and is so simple to use. This is fab! Thank you so much the libraries are open in my area for sidewalk pickup so I've been ordering large print books on the library app and then going to pick them up. If you have a library in her/your area, maybe check out what their covid precautions and pick up options are.	0
Taking care of my dad after a fall which resulted in brain bleed. Hi, My dad fell down a couple weeks back and was diagnosed with brain bleed. I'm looking for a fall sensor that he can wear that also has a button that he can press that will activate a couple alarms around the house. I don't need this to be connected to a cellular network or call out to an ambulance. I just need something dependable that works locally in the house. I'm a bit overwhelmed with all the different devices online and I'm wondering what you guys would recommend. Thanks.No advice on the monitor but I'm sorry you are going through this.My dad fell on the ice 3yrs ago and cracked his head open. Close 3-6mths I think. Fall sensor not offhand. Alarm yes. Amazon sells a wireless doorbell that has a bell unit and a push unit for the door. Or any number of sounds as well as flashes a light. You can affix the door unit to a necklace or such for around the neck and place some of the base units around the house. if you carry your cell with you see if theres a unit that will send an alert to your phone. Or if you can setup something to alert a Alexa like device.	0
Following this subreddit as a hopeful psychiatric nurse. This might be a bit of a confusing post, but I’m just looking for answers. I don’t have anyone in my family currently diagnosed with dementia, but I am very interested in helping those with cognitive disorders and following this subreddit helps me understand who I may need to help in the future. He lives halfway across the country from me and there’s not much I can do for him. At 60, I know this is something that isn’t going to get better. Is there any advice on what I should do or talk to his girlfriend about? This is really a shot in the dark but if anyone has anything to give I would really appreciate it.I’d just send her a bunch of Teepa Snow YouTube videos. Sounds like the brain damage is catching up. Here is the timeline I've found best for preparing for Dementia, I hope some of it is doable for you. https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hwntds/it_begins/fz0s4ig?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 Oyyy were at #7 it seems like. With all of our loved ones we could see an undeniable uptick in their functions after exercise and if we could control their diet. I honestly can't keep him to sit still for very long. 72 and diagnosed with mild to moderate. I have see men in their 50's who are cognitively very poor and unable to care for themselves. Teepa has good videos to help deal with the memory issues in a non confrontational way. I wish you the best, He should see a Dr and get a referral to a Geri pychiatrist who specializes with these diseases.	0
Due to some health complications, my dad cannot look after himself due to health issues, primary of which is mobility at the moment, but there are some other things as well. Thankfully, I’ve got a well paying, white collar job that’s allowed me to cover for their financial needs while saving for my own future (401K + IRA and savings for a downpayment for a home). Unfortunately due to my parents’ situation, I can’t really do that, and our current situation is only making my work even more stressful as I have to take time off and fall behind to look after them.In addition to my dad’s health issues, the other big problem are my parents’ finances and their housing situation. The home they currently live in is incredibly rundown and unmaintained (broken/leaky toilets, broken garage door, no washer dryer, etc), is a hoarder nest (mostly due to my dad but actually in small part due to my mom as well), and is owned 4 ways between them and 3 other relatives of my mom, one of whom is now pressuring her for their cut of the house so that they can buy a different home where they actually live.On top of that, they have one house which has a half million dollar reverse mortgage (due to my dad first losing his job back in 2008, but then also due to the gambling and not making payments on it) which we are now trying to sell. They can’t really live in this home either because it too is rundown and now well maintained, but also because my mom is unable to drive and would not be able to get around in this particular location. My ideal situation is just not to have to worry about their financial and housing situation, and just enjoy time with them without the other worries. Besides just paying for so many of their bills, I’m constantly commuting to and from my parents’ home to help look after my dad (get him food, help him up and down the stairs if he can’t make it, organize his medicine, take him to appointments, buying my parents additional household items like toilet paper, etc). We can’t exactly get a home nurse or other assisted living professional to the house given the hoarding situation. I’m also coordinating the sale of the home which is an hour away from where we live. I feel like I’m at the end of my rope and don’t know what to do anymore. I think deep down, part of me is looking for validation that walking away is morally and socially acceptable, but at the same time, even if it is, I know I wouldn’t be able to stop worrying about them and their well being if I did just walk away. Be sure to keep your health and happiness a priority. Help where you can, when you can, but keep in mind, they're adults. You can't solve all their problems and trying will only bring you misery. My father didn’t want to leave his hoarder house, and now I’m taking care of his alcoholic mess. And super resentful about it!What happened to him: he had a seizure and the hospital forced him to go live somewhere he doesn’t want to live.If you want them to leave, you can try calling adult protective services to get them to see that your parents situation is unsafe and they can’t live there. The only peace I’ve found is knowing I couldn’t have done a better job. KrishnaChick has some great suggestions. Make sure you do things that replace all personal energy that you put out. Also, considering buying them a condo and having them pay you rent (if you think they wouldn't play stupid games). I haven't tried one out yet, but I've been curious. If youve got the money, it might be a really good trade off re: stress. https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-geriatric-care-manager Sorry man. I worry about dirty ducts, and foreclosure for them bc finances are an issue. You need to have one more firm talk with them. This is what I am able to do to help you. I will always love you, but I cannot be a part of this any longer.” I think you have a good plan. You can get power of attorney over their finances as well as medical power of attorney if they consent. Basically they're incapable of taking care of themselves so you get control of their finances and make decisions for them that are in their best interest. You could move your parents into an independent living facility if they can afford it. They often require a few hundred thousand dollars down, but once you're in it, you're set to transition in place from independent living to assisted living to nursing home without an increase in fees. I'm not sure what the value of their homes would net you, but if it's enough, that could be a permanent solution that would give you peace of mind. This does require monthly fees of several thousand dollars, but if you have conservatorship, you can control their finances to make sure these are properly paid by autopay each month. It really depends on what their financial situation looks like and if they have the money to afford this (aka, if you were in charge of how their money was spent, would they have enough?) All you can do is offer to help and propose your solutions; if they say no, you have to just accept it and enjoy what you can with them. Its killing him and putting him at risk everytime he tries to stand up and move anywhere.It isnt fair to you to have you pay for their bills etc just because they dont take care of things. At this point im going to suggest that you do whats best for them and not what they may want. Living in a rundown cluttered home is a recipe for disaster. best solution would probably be the house get sold, cleaned out and they live in a nice assisted living. yes you need to find a solution where you can advance your life and career. You will need to have a very honest conversation with them and explain how you feel and that for your own sanity and future you cant go on this way.Do whats right and find some peace. If they don’t cooperate by going to a lawyer to do this with you, then ask the courts for it. It might be an idea to come up with a deadline - real, fake or exaggerated - after which you say you’ll have to walk away if they won’t let you help them now.You could tie this in with looking for another job. Say you’ve found one or there are more opportunities in X area and you need to help them now before you move. Or maybe they could move with you as long as the city can be navigated easily by your mom.I’ve also struggled with the social and moral ethics of just walking away. That’s a last resort, but if you ever decide to, anyone worth their salt would understand and want the best for you. Where do you live? They can also probably point you toward whatever county services there might be that could help you with the hoarding situation, if it's actually hazardous to their health. You might also find some information from the Department of Health and Human Services:  https://www.hhs.gov/aging/index.html The AARP also has online advice for caregivers as well as an advice line:  https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/basics/info-2018/support-line.html You're obviously a good, dependable, loving, and frustrated (rightly so) son, but you don't owe them your life--especially because they're in the situation they're in because of their own choices, for goodness' sake. Don't let their money problems become your money problems; get legal advice before doing this, but you can help them negotiate the process of going bankrupt (if you're in the United States; don't know whether this is an option anywhere else) so you are no longer pouring your money into their hole of debt. I like your #5 plan, you can't make people change unless you have legal control over their affairs. Live your life and find a less stressful job. She can't make decisions on getting rid of stuff. Your Mom is working 12 hours a day, but doesn’t pay any bills or buy any groceries? File bankruptcy. Whatever it takes.You. Stop giving them your hard earned cash. Period. On the hoarding: just start throwing shit away. Think about what will fit into a one bedroom apartment and get rid of everything else. Reduce it to what you could easily throw away when they die and what you would want to keep to remember them. Most of The things probably never used, too old to be useful or they have too many copies of. Take someone else along who isn’t related to help say to you: that’s junk, toss it. If there is some question, put it in a box in the garage, labeled, and if it hasn’t been opened in 6 months, toss it. If you don’t want it in your house, there is no reason to store it in your parents house. You don’t need all of that old stuff. Buy one if those cheap ikea expedit huge shelves and get the rest of the stuff off the floor. The smell may not be in the vents at all.	0

Full time caregiving for my grandma (83) with dementia after the suicide of her husband. Feel like I'm struggling as a caregiver, it's such a hard situation to walk into. So hard seeing my grandma, who used to be my emotional rock, declining mentally while feeling so much emotional pain.Im trying my best to understand what care she needs. Its exhausting, I have to follow her around and watch everything she does in order to keep her on track or prevent her from messing something up. She has been thriving since I've been here, and says that she appreciates my help. And I am not giving enough time to myself and my college work. Feeling stressed and overwhelmed. We have to learn to balance our own needs with the needs of our loved ones. And we have to learn what help is available and how to access it. Ask who could best help you, perhaps a social worker? You may be able to get in home assistance if you're interested. You need down time. I hope you find what you need. Thank you so much for reaching out with advice. Much love your way 💟 I'm so glad 💜 I hope things go as well as they can. The group is always here if you need it. It's a good place. There may come a point where it may become too much for you, especially if you are the only caregiver.Often, the death of one spouse can accelerate cognitive  decline in the other. Ive had a lot of legal council over the last 5 years and although it varies by state, I could give you some guidance. I have been a caregiver for my 76 year old grandmother for a little over 5 years and she is now going to in home hospice today. If you aren't able to care for her long-term and she needs to go to a facility do your best to keep up visits. Im dealing with end of life so I don't have a lot of time or emotional capacity at the moment, but i wanted to let you know I've been there and you can message me....it just might take me a bit to reply.	0
"energy kick in even more.I have a mother with brain cancer who doesn't need all this stress and it sucks because he responds best to her.Anyways this Risperdal by the 4th day when he took 2, one in AM one in early PM, he was falling all over the floor and I had to pick him up several times. He has been coming out of his room naked with his soiled diaper around his ankles, I guide him back to his bathroom every morning to find that he has pissed or pooped all over the floor as well. I clean his entire bottom half of his outfit and his bathroom 4 times a day now.Two nights ago he got a flashlight while we thought he was in bed sleeping and started doing all sorts of weird things, he pulled the closet doors off the track and the doors fell into the wall creating a big hole. Garbage can, towels, diapers, denture cleaner, plunger, and he must've taken them all back out everything was soaking wet again.I hate that the lack of help from his doctor is causing everyone in my house ten times more stress than needed.1) Find a geriatrician2) Ask about Seroquel with loading dose at night. Some agencies provide relief. Maybe a night light to help, or illuminate the bathroom at night. Have a urinal handy for him to use if he keep standing up and peeing.11) Put notes such as ""Put your Underwear in the green bin"" .Visual cues are wonderful !&#x200B;Hope this helps. However one doctor left a voicemail saying he may have something and I can't remember the name exactly. First off the dosage was so incorrect, the pens say 30 units 3 times a day before meals and his vial says max 10 u it's 3 times a day when it's the same concentration of insulin. The doctor has yet to fix that issue she knows I'm paying out of pocket too for the vial insulin since the dosage is wrong I'm picking it up too soon so insurance won't cover it. Finally dad had an appointment, a follow up with her on 9/1 and he was able to shower with minimal help after the pill she gave him by 9/10/20 he was freaking out screaming he didn't understand in the shower and was hitting mom and I.  I called about it she just said she won't do anything else and passed me onto psych services for him. Bed alarms wouldn't work due to our dogs would be freaking out and all four of us try to sleep whenever we can. Yes there's lights and clearly marked paths to things, I write notes but he just throws them away without doing what it says to do on there.I've just gotta get him into a new doctor, but there's a 3 month wait to get into a new one here. The Seroquel came from a doctor he saw in the ER so was a limited supply. We are going to try and bring up the Haldol suggestion today mom called and left a message. Waiting to hear back, I sincerely hope and pray. 50mg of seroquel is still a mid/low dosage, if he his healthy you can go up."	0
Medication Devices Does anyone use automated pill reminders? I’ve see a bunch out there but I wasn’t sure how well they work. It has a clear lid so you can see when they have missed a pill time. I even used it when his dementia progressed beyond the point of being able to medicate himself to make sure I remembered to give him meds at the proper times. LiveFine Automatic Pill Dispenser, 28-Day Electronic Medication Organizer with Alarm Reminders, Flashing Light and Safety Lock - Dispenses Prescriptions Up to 6 Times Per Day - Clear Lid https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FL620B0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_EFLvFb33AGEJR We used a similar model (might even be the same one but I can't remember) for mom up until she needed to go to Assisted Living. It was well worth the money. I'm not sure how tricky it was setting it up because the home health care nurse did the set up for us and continued to refill the pills. I think the one I bought had a second tray so you could fill it ahead of time and swap them out but we never used it. Don't get the version with the opaque lid - it's harder to tell when it's time to refill. I had a spare tray as well to make refilling it easy. https://herohealth.comIt comes with an app so you can see when they dispense the pills. It holds up to ten meds and can also do a reminder for meds not in the Hero - like an aspirin. She lives alone so the Med dispense notification is like another check in for me. Or does the machine come as a lease as part of it? The machine is a lease. It’s 99 dollars down and then 30 dollars a month for the service and app. Stopped using it when she didn’t seem to notice the flashing light and loud alarm anymore. Think they also did a SIM card one that would let you know if it had been tipped up to remove the pills, but it was quite pricey. We got one for my mom. Pills released AM PM.	0
"He was looking into housecleaners, but that was scrapped too. My father no longer exercises, he resorts to quick frozen meals because he's short on time. My sister also lives too far away to help and has small children of her own who keep her busy.My mother literally an't function without him. I know it's time to sit down with my dad and have a serious conversation about getting help. How should I approach this? Thank you in advance.>\> I know it's time to sit down with my dad and have a serious conversation about getting helpThis will almost certainly be heard as ""You're not doing enough"". This community is rife with stories of ""my fucking family has no idea what I do for my loved one, but they're telling me all the time to do more, and of course they're not going to help! I have never heard of a good way anyone has brought up ""you need to be doing more"" without it going completely down the shitter.On the other hand, you could do it right: let them know that you'll be dropping by at x time, and leave early. Thank you very much for your insight here. I don't know if its a thing were you are but look into any companion services, the one my mum uses is a guy with extensive adult care experience who takes his clients out for lunch, the weekly shop, doctor appointments etc. He spends most weeks with my dad in the garage sorting it out and this week they power washed the drive. I speak it, but my father does not so I also worry that he might not always be able to understand when she expresses her needs, and I'd really like to find someone who can communicate with her. Perhaps go online and set up a repeat grocery delivery order or pizza every other Friday night. Sometimes adult services can talk to people better than their own families. You can call them. If your mom had a best friend see if she is willing to take your mom for a meal or to bring a meal. He refused help from my sister, my older brother and myself for many years. He would not budge to help himself or my mom. I approached my sister to contact Adult protective services three years ago. She was near end stage and still no help of any sort. I contacted my sister again to push for Adult protective services with anonymity. We called and got the ball rolling. Adult protective services visited my parents house to my fathers surprise. Adult Protective Services determined that she was neglected. Act as soon as you can to give your them the care they deserve. Call adult protective services if you have any doubt that your relative is being neglected or not being cared for properly.Edited I'm so sorry this happened to you and I'm sorry for your loss."	0
PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety My 80 year old dad wanted a way to listen his CDs. And I was thinking of ways to set up something like Life Alert. One device covers 90% of his house but I will probably get him one for the bathroom as well. And best of all, no monthly monitoring fee.Our house is blanketed with them for a similar reason, but for my wife. At this point our problem is the wrong Echo answers sometimes, not that we can't be heard.If you get the night-light add on for the Flex, you can put it in place of a night light and not lose any plugs, or if you don't, there's a USB port on the bottom you can use for charging a device.They're on sale for $17.49 right now, $32.48 with the night light. Looks perfect for the bathroom for an emergency! Thanks! Omg this is amazing to know!!! I got my 85 year old mom an Alexa for these reasons as well a few years ago. I can also drop in on her, meaning if she's not answering her phone or she mistakenly left it off the hook,  I can talk to her through Alexa using the Alexa app. I truly don't know what we would do without it. Oh yeah, the drop in feature could be really useful! I’m late to the thread, but my mom is a fall risk so she has an Apple Watch that detects if she falls and sends a message to pre-selected contacts. Ring also works with Alexa.	0
The border is still not open to American tourists and we held him off of selling his house as long as we could but suddenly it was on the market and sold almost immediately (closing is next week..). My wife and I do not think he is in good enough health to live on his own without support/help. He doesn't think it is a big deal at all.Examples of his memory problems:He loses his cell phone dailyHe has missed countless appointments due to forgetting he had them (even when reminded an hour before)He spends hours a day setting and resetting passwords he has forgottenHe is convinced the buyers of his house offered a ridiculous amount of money over asking price (they didn't - not even close)My wife had to correct every answer he gave to the doctor when explaining his day to day life.He forgets the house closing date multiple times a day.He has given away many of his personal itemsWhen questioned about some event, he will not remember and will completely make something up, even if it is a ludicrous answer.He is convinced his memory issues are minor and that they were caused by a sickness he had years ago - again, not accurate.I could go on and on, but I'm sure you get the picture.Some things we are trying:He was diagnosed with sleep apnea and we have been trying to get him to wear a device to helpWe got him a calendar notebook to write passwords/notes/etc. in. He won't use it.Until the border opens he will be moving in to our spare room.We are really concerned and convinced he is in bad enough health that he will not be successful if he is on his own in a foreign country. )Denial is a common response in the beginning, but checklists and whiteboards can be helpful for reminders; appointments can be entered into his phone and yours; frozen meals or meal services could be helpful. But to be honest, what I have found is that whatever I try with my Mom, she finds a way to stymie it. Best wishes. Thanks, is really helpful. He has an oral appliance but it is like pulling teeth (no pun intended) to get him to wear it consistently. I don't know for sure, but a reliable American friend of mine said few weeks ago that her passport had expired, she tried to renew but as the passport offices there had closed down for a while during Covid, now they are backed up a few months in processing applications. Idk, I feel for you... We had similar problem with my father, 88yrs old, who lived overseas for 35 years now retired in home country - he kept booking flights to go back to 2nd country for a visit - did it 3 yrs in a row us tearing our hair out - we are grateful for this Covid this year. :(   best of luck! To preserve his life at that age you would actually want him to live somewhere else. The challenge we are finding ourselves in is getting him to stay here without throwing a fit everytime we attempt to suggest a different plan.	0
Incompetent Nurse Let me start by saying I have huge respect for the nursing profession. She interacts well with the woman she supports in our group home and manages our delegation for this person’s diabetes management. I felt like if I’d called the nursing director in the first place I would have for the information I needed and that would have been the end. Why is my on call nurse not knowledgeable enough to handle this issue?Then there is her track record of answering and responding to phone calls. Pretty often I’ve called her with urgent issues and not gotten an answer or call back. She called me the day after this happened once and didn’t even acknowledge my voicemail and asked me for different information. Okay, but aren’t you my on call nurse?Generally I really enjoy working with this nurse but her shortcomings cause me a lot of stress and problems sometimes.I would let your DON know the problems you’re having, but come from a point of concern about the patients rather than frustrations in your dealings with her. An on-call nurse not answering her phone could be deadly in the wrong situation, and there is no point to a calling chain if one link does not answer reliably. You really should look at getting this addressed. She's the only nurse I complained about in 3 months!!	0
Unfortunately it's not only downloading an app. I setup my dad with a raspberry pi media center. Cost like 40 bucks. I haven't evaluated a raspberry pi media center solution closely yet but sounds cool. The Alexa skill is a great idea, too. Currently I'm collecting emails. Feel free to send me yours as a PM.Once I collected enough, I start building this out into a proper product.If you want to you can also let me know about what your situation looks like. I would be very interested about the following:- TV model- Interested more in an app solution or alexa skill or both? Is the person who will control the TV remotely tech savvy or not?- Is Wifi available at the place where the TV is?	0
Doctor said the solution is to simply stimulate him during the daytime to correct his reverse cycling. Anyone have advice? All we do now is just sit with him and watch tv, sometimes we'll walk him around the park when no one else is out there (we live within eyesight of it). We can't leave a puzzle or something out for him to work on by himself because he gets distracted and will just start wandering around the kitchen in his wheelchair or will simply fall asleep. He doesn't understand technology too well so laptops and game devices are out the window, too. Puzzles and other crafts don’t keep him interested. Seeing me able to do things easily depresses him and he gives up on craft time. There are cordless vacuums. Even those small, portable ones. My Nanny loves to go on car rides. I have her doing the 500 pieces right now and it takes her a little while. It's so hard, but there are lots of things you can try. I hear ya... maybe- kinetic sand, watercolors, Magnetics, or maybe set him down with a little job he can do that's easy. You can just mix up the cards and unfold the cloths and they are ready for next time. I’m not sure where you’re located but I would reach out to your local Alzheimer’s Association and ask about day programs? Is hiring a private duty PSW an option? I know it’s expensive but being a caregiver is tough on your mental and physical health as well! We’ve already got a sitter for two days a week and it’s all we can afford. Very expensive.	0
"I live next door to her, so I'm able to get to her within a minute if there's an emergency. She had a minor fall last night, just a couple of bruises, but it made me think that she needs some kind of medical alert device.Is there anything we could buy that would allow her to have a pendant around her neck that would dial my number if she needed help? I don't know that she needs a service, just a device that would plug into her landline and dial me with some kind of message. Is anything like that available?The lift alert pendants that are available do not automatically dial 911, they can call you if she presses it unless she asks otherwise.VTech does have a phone system for seniors that has a pendant that will dial a series of preprogrammed numbers, if you don’t want a service. The issue is the “pendant” is very large and heavy and really not designed to be worn around the neck. It can be attached to a walker, or if she can remember to always keep it in her pocket so she has it. The model of phone is SN5147 I believe, and you need to buy the pendant separate. Unfortunately the total cost with tax was over $130 for us.Another option: you could possibly buy one or more Echo or Google Home devices for throughout the home, which she could tell to call you as long as you’ve programmed your number in as a contact. The issue is you have to rely on the voice processing for it to understand her correctly, and if she were significant distress, she may not be loud enough or speak clearly enough for it to execute what she wants them to do.Another edit: I should clarify that at least the life alert pendant that we have does not automatically dial 911. Some services may. Some of the medical alert systems will call a dispatcher for that particular system. I'm not familiar with product brands. You might look some up online that are available in your area. Next door means next house, maybe 50 feet from her house to mine. Get a tile attached to your phone small enough to be a necklace I am a retired paramedic, have dealt with Life Alert ALOT! We got those often too :) I've been thinking of one of the newer smart watches with fall detection for my mom.Right now she has a simple cell phone ( https://www.wish.com/product/5cc8074dc36c9137ef09ece4?hide_login_modal=true&from_ad=goog_shopping&_display_country_code=CA&_force_currency_code=CAD&pid=googleadwords_int&c=6493229759&ad_cid=5cc8074dc36c9137ef09ece4&ad_cc=CA&ad_lang=EN&ad_curr=CAD&ad_price=34.00&campaign_id=6493229759&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhIP6BRCMARIsALu9Lfk2lB6HNZwyex96-FiCBk2-KyoWYdixQAW7WCz8uvNZoqtYbihOl7AaAoTxEALw_wcB&share=web )and I've put a lanyard on it. I've got it programmed to phone family, who can then decide what to do next. I bought a visonic alarm system years ago.One option was a pendant alarm you could give seniors. Also had an option for motion detectors to set up if no motion was detected in an often used room like a bathroom or kitchen in a set number of hours. Could program to call a number and leave a message.Didn’t require a subscription.No idea if they’re still around but I’m sure it’s not a hard option to find. I recently got the Bay Alarm Medical system for my mother in law. Initial fees were about $100 for the necklace, bracelet, alarm speaker that connects to her landline, and even a lockbox for the back door that holds a key so first responders can enter easily. Bay Alarm gives the code to first responders so there’s no guessing. It’s a $20 a month service. That and a WiFi camera looking at her front walk ($20 and I can listen to the audio at her place if I felt like i needed to) and most recently an echo dot. She’s losing eyesight so I’m really hoping to keep her independent as long as possible. Two other things I happened upon were the Flipper remote for TVs- it only has 5 buttons. And a phone with giant numbers. It has two preset buttons (my husband & I are programmed) and a big orange 911 button on it. My next purchase will be a smart watch so I can track her. My mother in law has a good community and the little old ladies still snap peas together on their front porches. You can get an Echo Show in both houses and set it to ""drop in"" if she's ok being on video you can see from your house.If you had multiple cameras you could literally look in on her from home.There's an article Senior Home Central. Let me know if you can't find it. Take a look at the amazon alexa dot. My mom can call me by telling alexa to call me. They can be adjusted for either sound or alarm so you're notified any movement. Medical Alert Devices Hi all,I am a caregiver to my parents who are both fall risks among other issues. I am looking into medical alert devices for them and I was curious what others have used. My hope is that this will give me piece of mind when I step out of the house for an hour or two. I  was looking into Mobile Help. Seemed good but who knows. All of those companies seem a bit shady in my opinion. TIA!Are you dealing with just fall risks? Where are you located? Maybe there's a service like this nearby where you could get someone to come by and spend time with your parents when you need to go out. Kind of new to this, but would a smart watch that can make calls be an option? Apple watches detect hard falls but I have no idea if it would pick up on a home fall. In my experience, at least, I'd keep track of the line where they can't be left alone."	0
She has difficulty organizing her medications and since she started dialysis in February has been reluctant to attend regularly. Doctors gave us 2 options:  24 hr care at home or short term stay at a nursing home. Because of my parents finances, they can’t afford additional nursing help at home and it’s not covered under her current insurance. My sister and I think the nursing home is the best option because the 24 hr care would fall solely on my father. He’s had years to step up and be an adequate caregiver to her but he hasn’t quite done it. With dialysis he hasn’t been able to get her to go, not really his fault but the facts still stand. He doesn’t even know who her doctors are as he’s been peripherally involved. He does bare minimum at best. That’s why I have gotten involved but I can only do so much because I don’t live in the same city. I can think of two medical professionals that have documented requests of asking him to help but he just hasn’t. I don’t have legal rights to do anything but I want the best for my mom and I want to convince my dad that he’s in over his head. What can I do?TLDR:  my dad is insisting that he can offer rehabilitative care to my mom when he has a track record of doing the opposite. You also need to speak to your local Medicaid office not Medicare but Medicaid as well. I love my dad but his lackadaisical attitude towards her care thus far is something we just can’t have at this moment. I’m worried sick about this. The social worker is going to help us apply for Medicaid but I think my parents combined income might be too high for them to qualify. We’re going to try it anyways because I know they have a waiver we could use for care. You can also speak to an Elder Care attorney. Late night applications for Medicaid are difficult to pull off but he/she may have some ideas. A 30 minute consultation shouldn't be that much. You definitely need to seek help from local Medicaid.	0
An awesome helpful device to keep track of your loved one from afar Get your loved one the device from angel sense.com (no spaces) I’m not being sponsored or paid for this, I just want to share this with this community because I know I would be happy if someone told me about it. That day made us realize the absolute necessity of him having ID on him and a way for us to keep an eye on him.We got the Angel sense device two days ago and it’s been a god send. The device was free but there’s a monthly charge if you want the walkie talkie portion of it. It attaches to any clothing (the only downside here is if your loved one lives alone this might be more difficult if they don’t know how to put it on or take it odd) and only a special key can remove it. It’s small (like a security tag youd find on your clothes when buying them) and is super light weight. It needs to charge and also needs to be put near a window for a couple hours so the GPS can get its bearings. It gives us so much more peace of mind and I hope it’ll help anyone of you too.Website https://www.angelsense.com/It is about $40 per month depending on the plan you pick.Where do you attach it to him? Is it light/small enough to not bother him? We figure it’s the same as having a phone line for him, since he doesn’t know how to use his phone we cancelled that and have this in place, it comes out to $40/month if you pay a year up front, if you do it actual monthly it’s like $56/month. We paid the year up front but you still get to try it out for 30 days so that’s what we’re doing.We attach it to the lower part of his shirt and it’s really light, my brother tried it on and he said you can’t even notice it’s there. It has an SOS button on the front so if they need to call you they can, but it’s sensitive so sometimes it accidentally calls my mom but it’s no big deal, she can just hang up.	0
Missing persons with dementia-ways to avoid? I have seen SO many post lately locally and globally about silver alerts with dementia. What are home safety devices/prevention to help with this? My current arsenal is several wifi cameras setup watching the internal  doors and exterior with motion detection alerts. I aim to intercept by this pointThen she's got a GPS tracker on a lanyard if the main plan fails.Cameras were my idea, the tracker is provided through local social services.	0
Does anyone have experience with the purewick system at home or any of the other devices for urinary diversion?Hi! We purchased the Purewick system about a month ago, and I can confidently say it was worth every penny. The Purewick is a bit awkward to put in, but it's very easy to use and keeps the wearer dry all night (if put in correctly. I still make sure she has a pad or brief on at night, just in case, but most mornings she's dry.If you're looking to try it, I definitely recommend.	0
Look for oven knob covers for baby proofing. Turn off the fuse that controls the oven/stove. We did this for my grandmother and she will complain but it took care of the problem. I’m planning on changing my Mum’s gas hob to an electric one and having a switch put in the cupboard where she won’t see it so she won’t be able to turn it on. I don’t think there’s anything you can do with gas though you could maybe ask a plumber. Thank you for this I’ll look into to this and see if I can manage to do this It’s possible to turn the gas off to most gas appliances. Depending on your gas company, you may be able to call them, explain the situation and get a tech to come out and turn it off for you, or get a plumber. (In the United States) Get an induction stove and put the pots/pans that work on it in a locked cabinet.	0
I'm afraid my mom might have early onset dementia but she refuses to get checked I'm in bed crying, shaking. Six years ago she forgot the water boiler running over night and the thing almost exploded. I live in a different town. She always forgets where she puts things and has started to lose some of them. She's also had changes in demeanor and is acting very negativistic all the time, and screams at the cats for nonsense all the time. She's all I have left of my family. What can I do?Get her to see a doctor asap. Or post here ofyen if it helps. Sorry to hear you're in such a challenging situation. She would need a physical to make sure there is something out of sorts with her bloods etc before concluding. Do not try to self-diagnose. Seeing a loved one forgetting more an more and there behavior changing for the worse is devastating. Before any cognitive assessment are done a full physical is complete to rule out any other causes. When resolved the individual cognition improved. That doenst mean that dementia patients are not treatable, because there are a lot of different treatment options. Is there some way to get someone from social services or another doctor to come to your house to just chat? I know that seems a little out of bounds during Covid, but it’s worth a shot.I would also encourage support groups, as well as reaching out here. I am available if you would like to DM me, going at it alone just isn’t an option. X You've already taken the first step, reaching out for help. If you know who her doctor is, contact them and tell them what you think is happening. As we age we may be less reactive to the environment if we are disconnected from fresh air, sunlight, water and regular walks. Make sure she signs over HIPAA to you so that the doctor can talk to you about her, otherwise he or she is not allowed to do so. Bad, like looking for assisted living bad.	0

Discreet GPS trackers? I would love to have something like a Tile sticker, that I could just stick on the hat he wears daily, or his shoe or keys, but they only range 400 feet. Has anyone dealt with this or have a more discreet solution?If he has an iPhone you can turn on “find my iPhone” and sync to yours. You can see where the phone at all times.Edit: omg actually I remember I saw on Keeping Up With The Kardashians there was an episode where Kris got MJ some shoes or an insole or something that was a GPS tracker. I’ll try to find it.Edit 2: here it is!! Cellular connected watch, if you could somehow get him to wear it? Look into cat / dog gps trackers they are small and lightweight as they are designed to attach to the collar. It's a pretty unobtrusive/obvious looking device and is very affordable. I wish I'd had alarms for my mom. What about having a front doorbell cam that connects to your iPhone and alerts you to motion at his home. I just installed two Blink cameras at my dad's house. One on the front door and one on the back. They're motion cams and also provide a great view of the bedroom hall and the office. I sold the story about how they're great intruder cams. If there's wifi at his house, I highly recommend.	0
"Elderly Tracker Good afternoon! I am writing to see if anyone has advice on a tracker or something that I can make sure my grandfather has on him at all times so he can feel safe. He says that he’s worried his caretaker will forget him on a walk (this would never happen either) I printed multiple business cards with emergency phone numbers and our home address for him to carry. He also has an iPhone and he can tell Siri to call people but he doesn’t think he’ll have his phone on him for whatever reason since it’s basically just to yell at Siri and ask her questions😋 Thanks in advance!The problem isn't preparing for him getting ""lost"" (which will never happen), the problem is his anxiety. Does he want you to be able to track him down, or just someone able to call his contacts? If it's about just having phone numbers, an emergency bracelet would work well and be very visible/reassuring to him. If it's more about being found by you--this is going to sound weird, but they make dog tags with GPS. You could put it on his keychain? You could get a GPS tracker/logger like trucking companies use to make sure their drivers aren't at the strip club during their shift. I don't have time to find the best option right now, but ideally you'd be able to find one that doesn't require the use of a manufacturer's tracking website subscription and you can just pop a 3G simcard in and call it, or configure it to check in to your own website, or something. It'd probably be worth seeing if there's a subreddit that knows more about these kinds of devices (r/spygear or r/stalker etc. :) Furthermore to his anxiety about being left somewhere, you could tell him that the tracker is on the wheelchair and that you'll always know where he is as long as he's in the wheelchair could do double-duty in motivating him not to wander off without the chair (memory issues aside). Look up the phone # for the office in your county—- ours offers a free tracking bracelet. You have to inquire and qualify and get approved for this. (it’s connected to the sheriff’s office— if and when they go wander off, and it’s serious, you can call 911 and police who are trained in the program know how to locate the person)I doubt every county has this, but it’s worth asking! I haven’t used this but it looks great to me, I believe another redditor posted this recently - it’s an in-home monitor for folks who don’t want to wear one. I bought my grandma a Relay Go. Red Cross have a teleassistance service in my country. It is basically a red button he can press at home and contacts directly with their call center for any emergency. Ask me what was on the Patty Winters Show this morning. |) ^(Opt out) Bad bot."	0
How to get grandmother with alzheimer's up to eat She wants to do nothing but lay in bed and sleep. One track mind on it. Even if I just try to have her sit up in bed to eat, she refuses and lays back down.How do I get her up to eat?My dad's appetite is almost non existent as well, and he fights us when we push him to eat. We keep his meals small and simple; half a sandwich, piece of toast with peanut butter and/or jam. Excellent advice from u/plushygood, but additionally you may want to look at her bed. She may even need a purée or “mechanical” diet. My mom is late stage. We feed her sitting up in bed, mostly homemade cream soups, smoothies, and food put through a chopper. This is nature taking its course. It's a tough decision to make, but prolonging their life rarely brings any good. She can get in and out of it fine, she just refuses to sit up and eat in it Ater getting my father on a Meyers cocktail, he ate everything in site. Lasted about 1 month. There are companies that will send a nurse to the house for Ivdrip. In addition to Ensure, it's worth talking about depression to her doctor if you haven't already.	0
"Guys, my mom is in such a horrible situation and I’m at a total loss... Has anyone had any experience talking to the Alzheimer’s Association? Hey y’all. My mom always struggled with money. Worked 3 jobs, a total hustler, but always in debt because she wanted to give all us kids everything. Once at the doctors office he & I were talking to a nurse and a social worker in a room away from my mom and he went into this thing about how he worked for Lockheed his whole life and how he is a “problem-solver” — and he just can’t get my mom to realize what is happening; how much he has to repeat things and how frustrating all her “crazy” behaviors are; and wanted them to tell him “how to make her understand what’s going on with her”.... the nurses and I looked at each other curiously and we all essentially told him “you can’t do anything. Recently, a friend of my moms was on the phone (mom must’ve called or picked up & not realize someone was there, put the phone down without hanging it up) and this woman heard my mom’s husband YELLING at her. After an hour he finally went to look for her and found her talking to the valet trying to find her car. He only started having someone come like a month ago, after my sisters found out about him yelling at her while the family friend heard. I got him a $100 auto pill box thing, did everything I could to get him started with it. I found it in its original box, in the garage with other crap they don’t use.Here’s a quick list of all the things I’ve tried to implement to make my mom as healthy as possible AND to make his life easier, all of which he has either stopped after I leave or never started in the first place:-auto pill box-cod liver oil capsules -eating mushrooms, drinking green tea, taking tumeric w/black pepper in a capsule (all just good for general brain health)-daily walks with her dog, they live super close to a few parks too.-getting a sleep apnea machine so she sleeps better, which is REALLY important for brain health... sleep is like the brains way to flush out all the garbage that builds up everyday. -having a white board by her bed where she looks everyday to remind her of things.-an Apple Watch to keep track of her, alert if she falls, etc. or any life alert type device.-simplifying their home which is WAY too cluttered, simplifying the phones and TV setup so she can easily use. -having a good pharmacologist managing her medications, since no one seems to be doing it regularly enough — she needs to be getting meds on time yes, but she also needs to be on the right combination of meds and have them monitored more regularly so at least THAT part isn’t hurting more than helping... There is an amazing doc that could do this about 4 minutes from their house. He feeds it cheese, leftover steak or chicken from whatever restaurant they went to the night before, and most recently I observed him feeding the dog a Twinkie. I know HHC people are not gonna let stuff like that interfere with the care they give but jfc.... I want the people who are taking care of my mom to be treated with respect too. I really don’t think a real divorce is necessary or even a good idea at all — I’d be happy to help take care of her as much as I can, but I can’t afford all that I’d need to do it all. My best ideas right now are just to go home and get her, bring her to my house to stay for a bit and see what happens. :/ I live 4.5 hours from her, but my living situation is ideal I think. 35 acres, beautiful outdoors and lots of animals, healthy fresh food, and no children of my own. I don’t know what the right thing to do is. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Who do I call and talk to? I don’t want them to take my mom or anything. I guess I just need to know what my options are; what are the resources I can use that I’m not aware of; has anyone else heard of a situation like this? Thanks so much for any advice y’all can offer. I can’t imagine a worse time (in my life) for this Covid stuff: it was so bad at first when everyone had to stay away. This was so hard already — we really didn’t need or deserve to have this virus totally screw this situation up any more than it already is. And thanks again.> has anyone else heard of a situation like this? Let me be the bearer of bad news. What you may be able to do is (maybe after a vaccine is available) help to pay for a companion. This would also take stress off your local siblings, so they can talk to the companion and not feel like they need to ""spy"" on the household. It’s nuts. But when I look at all the options, I know I could do the best job I am capable of if I was getting to take care of her on my farm. It all seems like a temporary fix and any progress at getting her into an actual healthy day-to-day lifestyle is impossible. We have been here since the diagnosis five years ago. He’s had a few other issues which have also helped expedite his journey. Go to court, get guardianship rights and figure out a care plan. Being the primary care provider is hands down the most difficult job on the planet. We don’t get vacations, we don’t get date nights and we sure as hell don’t get to leave the house together (pre-covid looks no different for us than current covid). We have zero help. Before you pick her up you need to think about what being a caregiver will be like. Are you ready to change her clothes? Are you ready to change her diapers? Are you ready to feed her? Are you ready to change everything about your life to care for her?I wish someone would have more honest with us when we started this journey. We don’t. They were always going to see what their schedule looked like and call us back. It’s been five years, we’re still waiting to her back from my husband’s brother. Luckily with this becoming a common situation throughout our country there are now tons of great resources, websites, authors and groups that have done great work on this topic. I know it won’t be easy in the slightest but I’m willing to see if it can work. I don’t want it for myself and I don’t want it for her.The only reason I haven’t already gone and picked her up is because my house is in NO shape for an elderly person with dementia. Like most, we don’t have the money to do everything we need to do in a short time. So I gotta figure out how to make my home comfortable and safe enough for me wanna bring her here and get her outta that situation.Thanks for the kind words and advice. I would like to echo the above response about people not showing up. When is the last time someone came by to get Mom out of her bed, took her anywhere, listened to her, brightened her, or my, day, helped me cook, do the never ending cleaning, anything. My mom hates her morning aide and loves her afternoon one. Why? She thinks the afternoon one is her friend that visits and the other is basically showing she can’t do things. My advice is to help the HHC folks blend in a little better. I would call DHHS elder services. They are great for networking all the services available. In the meantime, he probably needs help too. Lab values, mri/CT scan imaging), but not only does the brain do millions of jobs - not 1 case is the same, not one person shares the personality traits identical to another & results are subjective. A huge concern from reading this was about the pill dispenser - not only does it show pure ignorance & blatant disrespt on his part - but youre not even sure she's taking the meds? With most of these meds (aricept & namenda are what I see most) they take weeks to start working & showing any affect. The very little hes done so far, has caused extreme burn out. Leaving the house and wandering away (even in fridged cold weather depending where u live) & starting a house fire are things that can easily happen if left alone. Absolutely 1 million % With my grandmother- she lived in a little community for seniors in a modular home development after my grandfather died & met this neighbor, Fran, who also binge watched same news as your story, always angry yelling at the TV , also you had to scream to talk to him lol, but to save $ she sold her place & lived with him. Long story short- she was hardly bathing or changing her clothes, wouldn't answer the phone if we called, was forging her ssn checks, & took out credit cards in her name. You asked who you can contact for advice - the office of againg! No, they will not take your mother, theyre full of resources & are specifically trained for issues identical to yours. Sorry i drug this out so long! It’s always nice when someone seems to “get” my family’s specific situation. I was just with her last week for a few days, and learned from her husband that he’s started the process of selling their house and has signed them up for a new facility being built nearby. It should be done in 2021, but I supposed it could end up stretching to 2022. It’s good, but it’s still a long way off and I’m hoping they’ll be able to stick it out till it’s built. :/ It’s just bad. And it boggles the mind as to WHY he won’t just LISTEN to us and do what we say. He has the money to pay for the extra expense of having them come in the AM and PM, but it’s a 3 hour minimum. It could be sooooo much better for everyone if the paid help was taking care of all the “official” stuff so her kids could just BE with her and try to create moments of joy while we still can. :) 32 here, dealing with an uncooperative parent when you need help from them for dealing with the one with dementia is the absolute worst. I hate widowed predatory older guys only seeking a servant later in life, that really needs to end but it seems to be a non-generational thing. Omg! For realsies?? In her case, the lady who spent every morning with her was her granddaughter's mother-in-law, so she peripherally knew her and she just decided she needed to stop in and see Mom every day, or that was what Mom was told. this sounds awful for everyone. 1) call your state’s equivalent of Agency on Ageing2) Alzheimers association is a good info clearinghouse, but they also frustrate me because they recommend recourses unavailable in my area. Adult daycare? They recommend resources but don’t actually provide anything.3) adult protective services.4) find about Medicaid waver in your state. If its meds, load the med box yourself, put it in the place and call her at med time every day until its a routine. If its meds management, take her yourself. Looking at that time horizon may make it easier to see if any social services can help. : /."	0
Tech to help with dementia Hey guys just found this sub, my grandfather has had dementia for a while and is deteriorating.In a recent bus ride into the city with my gran he missed his stop as my gran got off and has now been lost for about 36 hours in the city, the police are on it and there have been some sightings on cctv and such, while we await his hopefully safe return we have all been thinking about things that can help prevent this in the future.So to my question: We we’re looking to get gps trackers potentially for both my gran and grandpa to prevent this kind of thing happening again, does anyone have any recommendations for reliable easy to use and convenient ones? We want to get my gran a phone that she can use in emergency’s, she’s 80+ and not very tech savvy but knows how to use a tablet, any recommendations on something with a long battery life and easy to use, I don’t know if there’s anything aimed at the elderly here.Not exactly a tech question but if anyone else has any advice on how to help prevent any situations like this without moving him to a home I’d be really appreciative, just trying to stay productive and not worry.Thanks for any help! This doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to find a solution, but I guess I'm here to urge a little caution unless you have very deep pockets... Here's why:GPS trackers are amazing. The trick is getting your loved one with dementia to consistently wear/carry the tracker. My mum started disappearing before I moved in to be her caregiver, so I moved to GPS trackers to try and keep tabs on her. I tried adding a tracker to her fancy cigarette case, but she recognized the square fob-like device as foreign to the case (without remembering that it was important or its purpose) and so would diligently pick at it until her case was restored to her memory of what it was meant to look like. I got her a new wallet (she was in the habit of carrying a wallet) with a tracker, but she never recognized the new wallet as hers and wouldn't carry it. A long list of examples to say: if you're going to find a GPS tracker for your grandfather, think carefully about what he's likely to actually carry/wear with him every day. You're going to have more luck, at least based on my experience, if you can find a way to add a tracker to something he already knows and carries in a way that he won't know it is there. Unless he has many, that might be a good thing to explore? Here's an example of a simple phone that they sell:https://www.alzstore.com/RAZ-Memory-Cell-Phone-for-Seniors-p/0039.htmI know that your grandmother doesn't have dementia, but if you're looking for easy to use devices... They have some really great options. You'll find some other good simple cell phones on Amazon. I'm in Canada so the options you have available to you may be different, but I've heard good things about the jitterbug flip phone. Best wishes. My dad had it. It has big buttons and very simple directions.If you get one get a Tile for it. Tiles are little squares you stick to thinks that you can track from a computer if lost.	0

"More than 1 in 4 people age 65 and older fall each year, according to the CDC, and falling once doubles the chances of falling again. After an older adult falls, lying on the floor for a long time or getting up incorrectly could cause additional injury – even if they weren’t seriously injured from the fall itself. To combat this, seniors can proactively learn safe techniques for how to get up from a fall. Here is a 5-minute video demonstration of safe techniques for getting up after a fall and outline the key steps to take to get up or to call for help.Step-by-step guide for how to get up from a fall safely: Stay calm and still. Figure out what parts of your body are injured.If you have one, use an emergency medical alert device or mobile phone to call 911 or a family member for help. If there’s a blanket or some clothing nearby, use it to keep yourself warm while you wait for help.If you don’t have a medical alert device or a phone nearby, start yelling for help. If you find that your older adult has been injured in a fall, don’t move them – that could make their injuries worse. I and My wife, mother in laws youngest child, and another sibling have been personally caring for her for several years now. In a nursing home is out of the question for the family's 4 siblings. It just stresses my wife out to see her mom ""so much out of it""."	0
😭 This post is just going to be sheer venting and I am so thankful I found a place like this. I am going to try find a group or create one after COVID passes. I don't exercise, eat horrible and am so depressed. I am trying to work on all of this. Taking care of him all the time is zapping me if energy. I desperately crave dates, going on walks, all the things we dreamed about. I exercised yesterday, way too hot outside 109°!! I made a doctor appt to see about depression and anxiety. I want to get this 50 pounds off too. He can hardly get out of bed without serious exhaustion and isn't going for long walks along the beach with neuropathy. 🤦‍♀️ I have one friend inviting us to do things and then upset when we don't come. I don't want to watch her kissing and hugging (new relationship) on her new man. 💔Thanks everyone. 💛❤💛 Hold on. Keep trying. I've likened it to a secret society. I only half jokingly put forth the idea of a dating/friend service JUST for we caregivers. ❤️ Stay strong ❤️ don’t let anyone bring you down, reach out if you ever need someone Hi. Plus, you'll have the occasion to have time for yourself, and not always being a caregiver.Try to reach out to a local caregiver support group. You might find some support, and maybe some friend to have a walk? One thing I wish that I'd known about is the availability of respite care. You could check into the availability of that in your area.Soon after my mom died, I started getting sick. You took the best first step. There are resources available for caretakers. Thank you for this information. I live in a somewhat remote area with a lack of support especially now with the COVID but I did look up caregiver burnout and at least I know where to start. It's even worse when you are the only person who is helping out.	0
"Online shopping and mystery order fun. My elderly family members, with various degree of cognitive issues, have discovered online shopping, and in the past few weeks I have disputed hundreds of dollars in charges and spent hours returning they insisted they did not order but only ""looked at"". Most of these orders were through the Amazon app so things were pretty straight forward, but some of the other items only show up as debits from their bank accounts with cryptic identifiers from distant lands, and they can never remember where they actually ordered the items from.Today I spent the morning trying to track down a charge on my mom's boyfriend's bank statement for which he has an e-mail receipt that only indicates being from some non company in China. He does not recall placing the order, only looking at the item, but does not recall from which website and has mild paranoia. I know this is actually not the case because I recall him talking about having ordered this thing a month ago.Unfortunately the item hasn't arrived yet and I have no way of determining if the website was legit because it is not showing up on or around the order date in his browsing history and it has proved difficult to file a claim on the charge because the banks and paypal are short staffed due to the virus.Fun times.Do they have one click ordering turned on for amazon? That would probably be the easiest way to stop the ordering since it would require them to input the info to continue to check out. Wish is the new go to for chinese knock off drop shippers. They don't have one click ordering turned on. I hope you can get things figured out with the bank. It took me 30min to finally unlock it. Did you know that Apple permanently locks you out of your iPhone if you guess the passcode wrong 10 times and to gain access again you have to do a factory reset from an iCloud compatible device? My mother discovered this the hard way and before I could even do the reset I had to update Windows. It took 8 hours to regain access to the phone."	0
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives? My grandpa (93) is hoping to continue living in his house as long as possible, and I'm helping my family brainstorm things that could help keep him as safe as possible there. To help with the broader job of making sure he's safe at night, I was thinking about getting him a fitness tracker that would give him alerts for early signs of sickness, like a higher than normal resting heart rate. Has anyone tried anything like this? When I googled it, it seems like most fitness trackers are geared towards people who are very comfortable using touchscreens, but I was thinking he could maybe use Siri to sync the data and then a family member (either in person or remotely) could keep an eye on the numbers to know if he might need an extra check-in. Any advice would be great!We’ve had great results using the Apple Watch. The series 4 & 5 version has fall detection & will alert the house and call us if my dad is down for more than a few minutes. Thanks so much! My mom was saying if there's any tracker he'd prefer, it would likely be one that looks and feels a lot like a watch. Is there a specific app you like to use? And it depends what safety issues you are worried about. For tripping and falling: night lights everywhere—some are LED and motion activated, grab bars in bathrooms and handrails for steps. Various grab bars for couches and beds. No throw rugs and a cleared floor. For monitoring: cameras to send images to your cell phone. Seems invasive but if you see him on the floor you can get to him. Got it! )Re: tech: he could probably manage, but after talking to family who interact with him on a daily basis, it would likely be a pain for him to have to sync a tracker.The camera idea seems like a great alternative--do you know/prefer of a specific app? We got something called d-link a few years ago to monitor our cat while on vacation. Maybe new products out there now. Some of these monitors have motion sensors that will alert you when there is movement or noise. I can keep an eye on her without getting up or disturbing her. That's exactly what we're afraid of, and I'm glad you have a good solution for your mom!	0
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia? The ideal solution would be to get a GPS tracker to slip in his clothes or something he takes with him at all times, but he's not even taking his phone or face mask with him anyway.How would you manage this situation? Do you know any good quality GPS tracker we can use? Thanks to everyone in advance!We’ve found the best option for my mum is the GPS insoles that slip into shoes, which is fairly foolproof. The only problem is that they are V expensive in terms of trackers- around gbp 250-300, so it does depend on your budget. Do you also have the lo tech option in place: A not-easily-removable bracelet with contact info on it. https://www.medicalidfashions.com/beginners-guide-alzheimer-s-awareness-medical-id-braceletshttps://www.medicalert.org/products/everybody/classic-medical-id-bracelet My dad was obsessed with his wallet and always had it on him, so we bought a Tile and put it inside wallet. You can buy them at Target, etc. https://www.thetileapp.com We use Tracki. The issue with trackers is the battery capacity. Which is related to 1) size (bigger = longer charge but harder to hide on someone’s person,clothes, etc) and 2) the refresh rate (how often it pings the satellite) - more frequent pings = faster battery drain, less frequent pings = less good idea of where people get up to. That said, if your person doesn’t walk around all day (like my dad) you could set it to refresh every 30 minutes and then refresh within the app to see where he is just at that moment. We have it set for a refresh every 10 minutes, usually get 10-13 hours that way. The tracki is about 2x2”. Tracki supposedly “learns” location with use but it might be off by a building or too. Being in a rural vs urban area might make a difference one way or another too.You can set a geofence too to let you know when they leave.I think ours works on a 3G network btw. Have seen some products that operate on 2G, I believe that’s going to be phased out where it isn’t already. Overall This is better than the last tracker we had Thank you! That may be helpful as an alternative for your grandma that doesn’t require technical upkeep.	0
"Life Alert or ?? My father is in his mid 80s and he is alone for some time at home, but we are worried about him falling while he’s alone. Any device works and price is not an issue at the moment. My grandmother often times can't hear te alarm go off and has alot of trouble communicating the code to the operator leading to more false alarms than appropriate use. On top of that a landline is required , so if you have one great, if you don't I dont think it's worth another bill (on top of the LA service). A landline is not required. There are ways around the issue you're experiencing. Pretty sure some smart watches can have apps that detect falls. Might be worth looking into, as they can also be used to call for help Seconding this. They have watches specifically for elderly people. They have a lot of different options depending on what your priorities are.There's heart rate, fall detection, auto call answering, geo fence (for wandering) and other options. https://www.wearable-technologies.com/2019/07/the-5-best-fall-detection-wearables-in-2019/ hope you'll find a good one My mom is limited to her room and bathroom 90% of the time so Amazon Alexa works well. I also have devices placed around the house when she does move around. She can intercom, call and play her favorite songs by using her voice.Helps both of us by tracking her meds and diet too. I actually just joined to ask for advice on this matter, but maybe I can help you with what I've found so far.One thing to note, for those not aware, I purchased a life alert for my mother a few years ago,  without discussing this with her (life alert specifically asked/recommended if I had discussed this with her), and when it came in the mail, my mother was upset, and felt I was spending too much money, also felt as though she didn't need it. She demanded I ship it back. Life alert will ship the unit, then schedule an appointment to get it set up. Because it wasn't set up, (3 year contract fulfilled), they allowed me to ship it back and only pay the nominal fee you agree to when it gets set up, as any company typically does.Discuss this with your loved one before proceeding.I went down the rabbit hole of trying to find a solution, and they all seem to offer 8 out of 10 options, with it staggered between some offering some solutions, and others offering other solutions, but no-one offering and all-in-one solution.Some offer bulky watches that are not water proof, some offer lanyards that don't have a microphone, some offer all of the above, be require a specific carrier.The big deal is the middle man. You may pay 40 dollars a month for a lanyard connected to your home wi-fi. They will initiate a call back, and further contact emergency medical if there is no response. The apple watch has the capability of initiating a 911 call during a fall detection. It will then also alert contacts that you have set up. I wish it would contact the contacts prior to the 911. I'm still trying to get it set up. Maybe others could help?She happened to get a bit wavy with the hands the other day, and I heard it go off, on her wrist, and she ignored it until I grabbed her wrist and said ""It's asking if there is an emergency,"" so take that with some salt and tequila.User needs to be within range of the iPhone, through local wi-fi connection, unless you get a stand-alone network on the watch, which is extra phone service (30 dollars a month roughly).Because my mother lives with me, I have also bought a bunch of local CallToYou bell chimes that are placed around the home, that she can use to alert me if there are any issues. They are just some remote buttons that sound a chime. Easy to set up, probably many others on the market that do the same thing, not trying to push them specifically.The apple watch allows medical information to also be included with the 911 alert, I've got some of that set up, such as medications, but I can't link to her medical group.I've also heard of options/apps that you can put on the iPhone, that will contact third party before calling 911. This might be an option, but I haven't investigated too much yet.A combination of the above, and a consistent check in time might be best.Thanks for listening.If anyone would like to add to this, please do! I could use the assistance. I have cameras in the house, set up in places that my mom is most likely to fall. I can check on the live feed via an app whenever I want. You can buy cameras individually online for about $40 each, and the livestream via app is free. I have one under my Mom's bed so she can't see it (she hates the cameras) but it's great because I just need the floor view to see if she fell, so I can rush over."	0
Advice on getting my mom help? She has stormed out of family gatherings for no known reason, had screaming fits where she has rolled on the front lawn because my sister didn’t appreciate her babysitting my nephew enough and had multiple episodes of that nature. Mom, who has essentially lived alone on a mountain for the better part of a decade, hasn’t worked, had hobbies or done much of anything for almost all of that time because she got a good deal when my parents divorced and hasn’t had to worry about money. On that call with my sister and aunt, I found out that she’d gotten lost multiple times on familiar drives, gotten in major fights with each of them multiple times after seemingly small memory lapses were acknowledged, had major mood swings and even made half-hearted suicide threats with them.Cut to a few months ago. I had a contract job come to an end and managed to arrange some things so I could come live here in NC with my mom in her house for the time being and hopefully get some treatment figured out. It hasn’t been easy and I’m met with constant resistance, but I’ve managed to get her to see her primary care doc, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, have a neuropsychological exam (as referred by her primary doc), got her a CT scan and, as of late week, finally got her to a neurologist. The CT scan was clean but the neurologist ordered an MRI which will happen Monday. The psychiatric nurse practitioner, her primary doc and neuropsych tester all also brought up mood lability and histrionics, so much so that the tester put “suspected bipolar disorder” in his written test report.So far, everyone thinks we are probably dealing with a mood disorder and some form of dementia, both of which are feeding each other. Right now it feels like I’m fighting against my mom to try to get her help and, really, without getting her declared incompetent (which I really don’t want to do unless I absolutely have to) I am powerless to actually mandate anything. I know it doesn't mean much, but e-high-fives from an internet stranger. At the end of the day, if her care is your biggest priority, well ... You may wish to contact the local Alzheimer's Society for guidance on this. I'm sure that it's different everywhere, but for us the process included several in person visits and written reports from people who knew my mum. Out of curiosity, are you in the UK? If you are here, NVM. And thanks again! I'm in Canada. She has tried many things including Zyprexa for the mood disorder which helped but had too many side effects. We’ve tried so many meds.	0
"My mom needs a medical alert “something” Looking for insight or experience with any device for essentially summoning  911 or, if we’re getting fancy, a family member. Is willing to get something but everything about it needs to be as easy as possible otherwise she won’t do it, understand it, charge it, etc. She doesn’t have a cell phone...I wondered if an Alexa or google home might work? I know zero about these systems ... or is “life alert” the answer? Many thanks, and good luck out there!My dad has a watch, which dependent on how much battery you're willing to use daily, can tell you lots of different things.It has fall detection - you set the sensitivity. Emergency calls are made by holding a button, and you can opt for it to cycle through a few set personal contacts or straight to emergency if you pay more, but we don't use that as I get the calls.You can also set it up to auto answer certain phone numbers in case you're worried about them.There's lots of different watches I'm sure but they're pretty simple. The chargers are just magnetic and you place the watch on top (this is good as long as they don't move the charger or turn it off!) We used to use a life alert like system supplied by a local ambulance company. The necklace uses a battery that's good for 10 ish years.We stopped using it because my mom would never wear the necklace. My Mother in Law passed away this past January and was not wearing her alert necklace so no help came. I like the watch idea better. We set up an Alexa system at my parent’s house last year to run off of their land line with the Echo Connect. It was pretty easy, the hardest part was setting up the contact list on their iPad. I have this in my house for my mother. I also have a couple WYZE cameras in primary areas so I can check in on her while I'm at work (and they allow me to speak to her as well). After researching for a time this seemed to be a great option. I’ll keep looking! The calls are placed via a cellular/mobile phone network the user doesn't need a cellphone.There are a few scammy companies that do not have medically trained staff answering the phone. You'll know they are poor quality because they are the ones who advertise the cheapest price.Health insurance may cover the cost of an alert system.In the end we didn't get one but of the ones I saw I think any with fall detection are the best option. I'm using the Lively medical device through Great Call. I don't think any system has everything I want, but this hit most of my check boxes and we have been happy with the service so far. It's not terribly expensive and they are very responsive when it detects falls. We had a couple of false alarms and a couple of misfires when we first got it and their response time was fantastic. I've been looking at getting a fall detection watch for my dad. I got my dad an ""elder phone"", the brand is Doro. It's a basic flip phone, and he carries it in a little pouch that he wears on a lanyard around his neck. He has got almost everyone to call him on his cell now, so it's always easy to reach, but the best part is the emergency button on the back of the phone. If he falls (he has, a week after I got it for him) he can just long press a physical button on the back of the phone and it is set to call me. This what I want to get for my mother. I cannot verify how objective this site is, but it seems like a good place to start. Consumer Reports also has a guide, but it's a little overwhelming. https://www.medicalalertbuyersguide.org/best-medical-alert-systems/ please look at this article and we can discuss.This is by far one of the most difficult problems, and is easy now that we have voice command devices.My mother used to keep her alert on the toilet, because if she fell, in her logic, that'd be where she fell.It was infuriating.Definitely use a voice controlled smart device , I know some people who could help you more than I can if that interests you, i'll email them.https://seniorhomecentral.com/four-outstanding-ways-to-use-alexa-for-the-elderly/ I have Ask My Buddy set up on Alexa for my mom. Here's the info:  https://www.askmybuddy.net/ Hi. I’ve been researching all of these answers and I believe smart tech is the way to go. I am having trouble getting a straight answer about whether a cell phone is needed for this to be operational and make phone calls with a voice command. I thought I had a handle on this with the help of “echo connect” which makes landline a viable option but apparently they no longer make them. If you have a minute ... what’s your situation/set up? We have an Echo Dot and added the Ask My Buddy skill and then added the contact names and phone #'s of people my mom would need to call. The program will call cell phones and/or landlines. I can't remember all the steps I took to set it up but I do know it was pretty easy. This should tell you all you need to know about that and they do have Support also:  https://www.askmybuddy.net/quick_start.php Once its all set up all she had to do was say ""Alexa ask My Buddy to alert (name of person) "" It can also send text messages and emails. I am a retired paramedic. Life alert stays on the line with the person until someone shows up and then they verify we are there and ask us to reset the system. When it is time for me to get a system, I will be getting them. >Looking for insight or experience with any device for essentially summoning  911 or, if we’re getting fancy, a family member.

I know zero about these systems ... or is “life alert” the answer? >Many thanks, and good luck out there!I'm not sure if this will work for her, but I have an Alcatel GO FLIP. I have Alexa set up, but parents tend to forget it's there or how to use it to contact me. I can check in on them with the Echo Show devices in a couple places though. There's a company called Senior Safety Alert, that's what we used for my grandmother. It has a base with a big red button, that needs to sit in a central location in the house. It plugs into an outlet, and also into the phone line. If they can hear you, you say what's wrong, they send help. they send help anyway. It's all very easy, there's nothing to charge. I am in a similar boat I have narrowed my search down to 1) Medical Guardian or 2) Bay Alarm Medical. I have combed hundreds of sites and reviews and these are consistently at the top but I am astounded at the lack of in depth fair comparisons out there... The trailing third place would likely be Phillips HomeSafe with AutoAlert and very last of the top 4 would be LifeAlert because I have seen many post from EMT related people saying they get calls from it all the time. I worked for Philips Lifeline for 13 years. It’s a great service. I’m happy to answer any questions about the service that you have!"	0
Need Advice: Super Obese Sister can't live in the home anymore! No one in our area who has a care home wants to take a super obese person because of the risks to staff. Does anyone know of any facilities that might take her for TREATMENT? We can plug her into a senior care home, but she's 50, has a healthy mind, and she can get better if someone gives her an eating disorder treatment and the medical care she needs to lose enough weight to be mobile. I know she's in pain and her legs alone (massive cellulitis) give her infections due to not moving.Can you contact social services in you area and see if they have any advice or options? The situation has changed.I also think it's important to include her in everything possible about this planning. I would also reach out to as many bariatric specialists as you can find and ask about resources in your area.I hope this transition goes as smoothly as possible for everyone > Does anyone know of any facilities that might take her for TREATMENT? This all depends on what treatment is appropriate, and probably only a doctor can tell you what that is. The seperation from her enablers is going to be dramatic so I have this high hope there is an ED facility out there that will take an immobile, obese person to start. That means psychological care and medical. Two years ago I went to one of these places after I had weight loss surgery because I wasn't coping well and hurting myself due to ED and the surgery. Its the only guarantee in life. Contact the bariatric unit of the hospital in the area, they might have a list of such centers, or at the very least, tell you the search terms to find them online.	0
I also work at a res. school for kids with severe trauma and behavioral needs. We get her out of the rehab and finally home but are told she has cancer in her breast and lymphnodes. They tell her (rightfully so) she is too old for chemo and needs to have a mastectomy. As much as I love her, she is unbelievably ungrateful for all we do for her. She doesn’t even like the fact I go to school because she would rather I stay home to care for her.Due to COVID, she has spent the last four months inside the house. She told me she clearly “thinks too much of me” and will “never ask a single thing of me again” and that she would go sit in her chair and “shut up like the useless old lady she is”. I don’t know if it is because of the job I work that I am burning out so easy. My Uncle is going down the same path, I see it coming. Message me if you need to. We talk regularly. It helps. I haven't the courage to go to a caregiver group meeting, but they do exist. Unfortunately I don’t have any advice but I want you to know that you aren’t alone and I’m sure the other folks on here can give you some.	0
My grandpas dementia is getting bad. I don't know how to help? To sign his rights away it'll cost $10,000 plus, I just have a question of is there anything else I can do? Or devices I can ask for?I recommend finding a social worker I did and spoke to DCF this was the information I was given.	0
App for remote health monitoring of seniors I lost my grandmother to Alzheimer's a few years ago. I remember it was very eye opening at the time to see the incredible burden on the caregiver- physically, mentally, and emotionally. Since I am a mobile developer my trade, I spent the last year and a half working on an app to help remotely care for an elderly individual- especially one with cognitive impairment. Not sure if this is of use or interest to anyone here, but I sure hope so! I realize this is a Dementia subreddit, not Alzheimer's, and I did share my app in the Alzheimer's subreddit as well- but I was hoping this would be of some use or interest to the community here. I hope its something a bit different that makes the caregiver experience simpler and easier.https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burlymarmot.peaceofmind.caregiver_v2Please feel free to respond with any feedback you may have, or message me directly. While there are premium (paid) features, the goal here is not to make any money- just hoping not to lose too much on server related expenses, which are quite high for this app. Sincerely,CareerMammal89At least in the case of my loved one with dementia, when an app like this became useful was about the same time she would constantly lose the phone and have difficulty using it. In my case, we tried various ways to keep the phone on my sister (I had a tracking app installed), but they all failed. Unless they can understand that they need to have the phone with them, then it's not going to work. I am considering a smartwatch port for android os. Obviously you would have a tracker of some type on the patient, what exactly is it? Demetia patients lose everything, phones watches, glasses. Right now its just a mobile phone app. The mobile phone could be worn in a variety of nonstandard ways, such as around the neck or on the waist, that I hope could help. The app was not necessarily designed solely for alzheimer's or dementia- but my hope is that it can serve some purpose. Where does that data get stored during app usage, when it's closed and after it's deleted??? It is stored in a fully encrypted database, with no personally identifiable information: totally anonymized. It will work for some people and is a great idea. Thanks a lot!	0

If you need help on the (iOS) design side, let me know. I am looking into an iOS port. You can request background location services; if the user allows, the system will give you location in the background. Otherwise, most processes are permitted in the background, assuming you follow guidelines and get user permission for the private items that require permission. Is the Alz patient supposed to have a smartphone and enter in all that info constantly? I'm not sure how this app would help me? Those who could, would rather not. Its quite possible with today's wearable sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS. - Secondly, this app is not just for making you aware of emergencies: its also tailored to allowing you to check in periodically and confirm that everything is OK. To your point about carrying a smartphone at all times, I believe there are a couple form factors that might work. I have a gps tracker that I put in his car, and even though the battery is not great, at least it helps me be assured he is not lost. It requires a pricey yearly subscription, so if it was already built into another app that would definitely be a plus.I would definitely be interested in giving it a try. He's gotten lost a few times and I know it kind of scared him so this would give us some peace of mind. Does the app have a way to set medication reminders? That would be super useful.Another would be to have a way for me to set a calendar with automatic reminders of upcoming medical appointments. With additional reminders closer to the time, say 30 minutes prior, or something.How does the app measure stress levels? The app is very simple in its interface and really just runs in the background.> I would definitely be interested in giving it a try. He's gotten lost a few times and I know it kind of scared him so this would give us some peace of mind.That's great to hear! Hearing about someone interested in this (after all the world involved) is a huge morale boost for me. I'd love to keep in touch with you through the process to learn more about how your experience is going. When selecting an Android phone, please make sure it runs at least Android 7.0 or higher (almost all new phones do, but just double check). Also, Huawei on some occasions does not play well with background processes to save battery, which can be annoying. I believe Motorola phones are a good choice for this app, though it should work on almost everything.> Does the app have a way to set medication reminders? That would be super useful.As far as medication reminders and appointments, unfortunately, no such functionality yet. I decided for this app to go with all automatic behavior monitoring, to distinguish myself from the other apps on the market (lots of them do alarms, reminders, medication, but very few are holistic behavior monitoring solutions). However, I am definitely open to expanding the app functionality in the future. > How does the app measure stress levels? Since Peace of Mind is an app for phones rather than watches, in this case I do neither. Of course this is by no means perfect, but my hope is that it adds another layer of actionable information into the app dashboard.Thank you for your interest! Alexa also has reminder & video capabilities. Alexa also has the capability to turn on and check/in remotely. It records the voice & questions asked Alexa.	0
"??? She is now on her 12th trip out to the flowerbeds because she refuses to use the hose even after I unspooled it for her and she won't accept help carrying the heavy dishpans full of water. When will I know to take more serious action to protect her from herself with her short term memory slipping? (There are other work from home adults in the household to keep an eye on her, but she's my mom not theirs, you know?) I checked the trash and saw she put on 3 new pain patches today (I track this everyday) but she told me she didn't put on any, even though I can see one peeking out from under her shirt when she bends down. It is hard for her to not be in control as often now. When I moved her in with us, we both knew she was deteriorating, but it was more physical issues with a little bad money decision issues. It breaks my heart to see that look on her face when she asks me to take care of something she just did an hour ago and she makes me prove it by walking her over to show her I can't do it because she already did it. hydration is an issue too with older women.The talk older women don't like to share: incontinence. This is a shot in the dark. Providers frequently jump on a UTI as a cause of non specific symptoms based on results of a urinalysis or a positive urine culture, neither of which are tools that can really identify a UTi, rather they should be used to support a diagnosis of a UTI based on symptoms. -Infectious Disease pharmacist My friend who is a nurse in a retirement home heavily relies on the clock drawing test. It doesn’t hurt to give it a shot [https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-clock-drawing-test-98619] The link didn't work for me, but I will look into that. If after ruling out (or discovering and treating) UTI (or any other physical cause), you still see things that give you concern, one thing that others have suggested as a way to get their elder who is in denial about memory loss to the doctor is not to try to convince them that they are having problems, but rather to frame it as a normal check-up; that the doctor is going to give them some baseline tests now while the elder is “well”, so that they can tell later if there are any changes. The hose is new, maybe she is set in her ways. Sometimes they just want what they think works and shy from new things.Talk to her doc about the medication. If she is forgettingthen you may need to manage them for awhile.My dad always insisted he do his own and was having issues.

Anyone with memory issues cannot be responsible for their own medication needs. Our pharmacies here can dose your meds into blister packs, easily labelled as which pill to take on which day and at which time. I'm not sure of this costs extra, but it would make your - and her - life easier if you just put a quick call into the pharmacy and asked them to do this, then you could probably slip it by her quite easily under the guise of ""this is how they do everyone's meds over x age now"" or some other silly explanation. The only downside is that I believe they can only do this for meds for 1 week at a time, or so I remember hearing from a friend. You need to talk with her doctor and let them know your concerns and let them rule out several things.

I’m looking for a medical alert bracelet/necklace/watch that looks like jewelry, not a medical device. I’m not sure if she wants monitored or unmonitored. Google hasn’t shown anything. Anyone know of anything? I’m thinking of the Apple Watch, but my mom is pretty scared of tech, so I’m reluctant. She does have an iPhone tho. TIA!What do you want it to do? Just have her medical info on it? I want it to call 911 or a family member at the press of a button or using a voice command. Thanks! Oh dear, so sorry to hear of the loss of your dad. For full disclosure, I am a founder of a comprehensive global medical alert and emergency ID system called iCE Angel - ID. From an aesthetic point of view, our panic button is an app on the phone or watch; while the QR code is given to you in two downloadable template formats (a) as an emergency ID card on a wallet-sized template that you can self-print and laminate as many as you want (I leave them in my wallet, on the back of my phone cover, on my bike, and in each of my backpacks) and (b) as emergency ID photo image to place on your phone’s lockscreen. FYI, all medics worldwide are trained to look for medical alerts in wallets, wristband, necklace, and phones. The two aforementioned trigger options – panic button and QR code - are independent of each other, meaning you can use either or both, but in all cases, phone numbers will automatically be exchanged between the person initiating the trigger (in this case - your mum, or her rescuer) and the emergency contact persons (in this case - you) so that a call can be initiated by either party. Once you open the alert you can also see the pinned location point of where the alert was triggered. All the above is free forever for a single user (one account, one user). We have a premium upgrade option that enables the account holder (for example you) to add an administer up to four additional “dependent” members via your account (for example mum, grandpa, and two young kids) who are not tech-savvy enough or too young to administer their own accounts. And you are able to upload and securely store a very comprehensive “Rescue wallet” for every member that includes insurance details, medical history, living wills, organ donor status, and other emergency records. For security and privacy, the Rescue Wallet is only ever shared with the member’s nominated emergency contact person(s), and only when an alert has been triggered. It is up to the emergency contact person to then use their discretion and to when to on-share the Rescue wallet and with whom. The premium upgrade is only USD 15 per YEAR – and right now we’re in the midst of a 3-month #TWOL campaign where we’re giving away 100% of our revenue to several amazing organisations around the world that leverage the funds to sustain starving daily wage workers. Thanks— this sounds like a great product but not what I’m looking for. I need something independent of a phone or watch as she doesn’t always walk around with her phone and an Apple Watch is too complex for her. Just looking for a simple, good looking device with a button or speech recognition for calling 911/ a series of emergency contacts.	0
"Feel like I'm losing it. So this a first for me but I'm desperate to get this off my chest or at least vent a bit. When I turned 18, my mothers sisters daughter (think my cousin?) His skin was also paper thin and he would fall attempting things he knew he shouldn't leaving me to try to bandage what looked like someone took a cheese grater to his arm or w/e he fell onto and sloughed off a massive chunk. (this happened monthly with me eventually learning how to treat it myself without the ever fun trips to the ER). And so 3-4 days after he initially couldn't swallow he passed on. It was like something grabbing hold of my chest and just wouldn't let go, each time I tried to calm myself a new horrifying revelation would strike. All the while non stop back to back all I can think of is that I have nothing at all. I have absolutely insane social anxiety to the point where it's crippling and just the idea of trying to go out and apply to jobs / meet new people physically makes me ill. I tell all this to my grandmother and she tells me that she also worried what I would do when she passes, however she ""wants me to understand I need to make my own money so she won't be paying me for taking care of her"" I brought up some of the programs to get state aid and possibly be paid through them however she flat out refused. My anxiety would selfdestruct any chance of employment(interviewers dislike panic attacks), I have no idea how to be an adult, I can't leave the house to work, I can't leave the house without her going into a meltdown(before covid and especially after), I'm not intelligent enough to go for any of the STEM jobs that would let me work from home, I've turned into a fat wet noodle, I used to be fairly active and loved swimming now I can't even walk up two flights of stairs without going out of breath and sweating. I don't have any real work nor world experience, and it's unending. So here I am just kind of putting some of it into writing. honestly any advice would be truly appreciated I'm just in such a bad place right now that my entire mind feels like an exposed nerve, errant thoughts twinge like biting foil and I can't seem to sleep well or calm down. There's honestly so much that it's daunting to write it all out and I'm giving the barest of overviews there's just so much that trying to write it down would be an exercise in futility. So do I. You need to talk to someone who will listen. Your GM is wrapped up in herself and honestly doesn’t “see” you. One of my children has a Masters and no job- actually hates what he got degree in. It can just pay the bills so you can afford to do what you want outside of work. Bake, garden, hike, whatever!Decide what you actually want to do- set goals. You are worth so much more than being an unpaid caregiver. I'll give looking up online therapy a shot however I'm not too confident I'll find something workable. (I messed up last year and ended up losing my insurance + I have no income so can't really pay). I do need to be my grandmothers live in caretaker, there's so much I left out of the main post but she is fully blind in one eye and losing her sight and I'm expecting her to be fully blind in the next year or so, she was injured when she was younger and has two herniated discs + horrible arthur so she can't move her head and is in constant debilitating pain but refuses to take any kind of pain medication. I found I love riding. I am making huge strides in my personal journey to not keeping myself a caregiver-doormat. As for the daytime caregiver, We initially had one come in but that ended after my grandfather died and my family decided that because I was only taking care of my grandmother now we no longer needed the help, they were also reluctant to have her spending so much money on help when free labor was here. it's not something that's pleasant to bring up and because of my fears and insecurities not something I would willingly bring up myself :/. The pure feeling of relief that I've gotten today from all of you, of learning that I'm not alone that there are and will be more in the same place as me even if we're different our core responsibility is the same it's made me feel like I might be able to get through this. She is also eligible for paid aides to come in, through her insurance or Medicare or Medicaid. It may not be what she wants, but she doesn’t get full control of this situation, or of you. Start by talking to your Mom about it all. Generally if I do bring it up I'm told I don't have to pay rent so it's not in her benefit it's in mine. It's happened before but never to this extent. but I have a little light in the dark now so I can at least pretend to be alright even if I feel like I'm dying on the inside and maybe I might make it to the light and find out it isn't a cliff. Maybe you could find a little side-hustle like that?...not a full time job but something that will boost your confidence. It's something that could build-up your resume also. I know it's expensive but the doctor could prescribe you an effective, generic anti-depressant. There's so many helpful anti-Ds now that have lost their patents and so are cheap now. A good anti-depressant and appropriate dose can help both your depression and anxiety. At the moment I might have to decide between going to a therapist or a doc at least until Jan. most therapist can't prescribe meds unless they're a therapist/medical doctor. Caring for someone is inarticulably exhausting, yet its not always visible and easily acknowledged  (like your relatives).Unfortunately other stuff is out of my depths but if i had one advice, it would be to leave yourself a nugget of time everyday or even every week. Its what she needs in life - shes swimming with no direction after the passing of your grandpa. Dont give up on pursueijg your own worthwhilenessSorry its late and ive been rambling a bit."	0
"Controlling TV Remotely? I'm interested in getting this done for my Grandma who can no longer figure out how to operate hers by herself (we have a remote with large buttons, she's constantly dropping it where she can't reach, trying to operate it backwards, pointing it at the ceiling, etc...).She doesn't have WiFi currently as she's never needed it, but I'd have it set up if it could solve this problem. That said, I've never used one so maybe it's an option.I feel like there has to be a way if I got her internet access and a Roku or Amazon Fire to turn her TV into a ""smart"" one, but I don't know if that would allow me to actually see the TV to know what I'm doing? Also, only vaguely related, does anyone have a Portal type device set up so that they can easily video chat with their parent/loved one without them having to do anything to answer? I'm looking into ViewClix, which seems to be the only option. Seems incredibly overpriced but other than that, exactly what I need.Any advice would be welcomed! !I saw a comment a while ago about how to use the Alexa Drop In feature for parents in nursing homes that I thought was super helpful: https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fv3one/mom_locked_down_in_nursing_home_gift_ideas/fmgpg7n/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf If you have Comcast, you can download a remote app on your phone to change channels I bought the Flipper remote for my moms TVs. Her bedroom TV is on an antenna. They are both older TVs so I had to try remote codes till I found ones that worked. https://flipperremote.comIt’s a 5 button remote (power, channel up, channel down, volume up, volume down). There is a panel you can open (not easily, so mom doesn’t try - in fact she doesn’t realize it’s there) and you can set it up, program which channels to cycle thru, program what devices to turn on/off, etc.I also put in Internet at $60 a month, 50 Mbps download, 3Mbps upload and installed 2 Amazon Shows so we can drop in. I turned off all the options I could on the Show and in standby mode it runs thru photo albums. None point into bathrooms but do point down hallways, etc. All the cameras have helped my anxiety over her being OK. It’s also nice to see if she is awake before I drive over."	0
She is in very good shape, but she has been forgetting her medications lately. Were trying to think of solutions to keep her independence as long as possible as she is not ready to move in with a family member quite yet. I have been looking on Amazon and there seems to be mixed reviews for alot of the devices. Thanks!> She is in very good shape, but she has been forgetting her medications lately. I use one call My Therapy. We use an Echo device to set medication reminders. I have several extra echos so this is perfect. Thanks!	0
This is a big shift and concerning. All the tracking devices I’ve come across seem to have terrible reviews and also short battery lives. Thanks in advance. 🙏🏻I bought something called iTrack on Amazon. It's a little tracker that can be clipped to a belt or attached to a lanyard around the neck. The device itself is inexpensive but you pay for a subscription, it can track worldwide (which I'll need in a couple months so it's worth it to me). It's got a way to set a perimeter around your home and it'll send an alarm when it goes through it. They make bracelets you can order that you can customize with her name, address, medical info, etc. Will check it out. Thanks! Check with your local law enforcement. There’s something called Project Lifesaver in my area that provides a tracking bracelet or anklet. In conjunction with the devices the others have suggested would some kind of daily/ every other day in home support be an option for you? There are also locks that can be operated remotely so that way she has to notify you of her intentions when leaving. Lastly, even in the absence of a special program, you can contact her local police station, make them aware of the situation and provide them with her information, possibly including taking her for a livescan for ID purposes, so that if they find her without ID lost, they can identify her easily, return her home and notify you. Unobtrusive ones that could fit on a keychain do need to be charged every 1-2 days. We’re using Tracki right now and it’s decent. Costs 20 or so a month (you need to subscribe to get wifi access to do the tracking). The other issue for me with these was getting my mom to wear it, and charge it. Hope you find an answer. Much appreciated! We've put up notices around the home with directions to things like the toilet, and she kept ripping them off. We kept putting them up and eventually she stopped ripping them off, and now only rarely asks about the whereabouts of things.	0
Is there any smart wristband out there in the market? I am looking for a smart wrist band with good battery life that comes with vital tracking, fall detection and SOS alert for my grandparents. Any recommendations?I actually just got my mom an Apple Watch series 5 with GPS & cellular for this reason, after researching a lot of less pricey options. I work 12 hour days an hour from home, so this is essential. Plus I got her a red band and case, her absolute favorite color, so she is happy to wear it.The only vital it monitors is heart rate I think, but you can manually enter others on your phone to track. However, and this is US/state of FL, but I would guess would work elsewhere, you can call non-emergency dispatch and leave instructions on where to find a key, so they can get inside faster and with less property damage. (We ordered a cast iron hedgehog hide a key for the flower bed from Amazon.) Also if you are an Apple user they are more than happy to chat online with you about the safety features, I talked to them for about 20 min to make sure if had everything I needed. This is the exact problem... my grandparents don’t own iPhone and there isn’t exactly a wearable out there yet that has the Apple Watch Safety Features I know that with LifeAlert devices, they can direct law enforcement/EMTs to lock boxes that are discreetly hidden on the property. You can give these services the combination to the lock box.I had one patient who fell, broke her femur, couldn't get up or get to the door, called me and long story short, the fire department used a ladder to enter an upstairs balcony.	0
"Staff has replaced the key twice already, and she lost it again today. The facility is secure so there is no problem with leaving her room unlocked, but I don't know how I can help her keep track of it. Any suggestions?Can you attach a Tile to it so it can be located with a phone?Also, a lanyard that goes around her neck might be less likely to get mislaid. The one on the keychain didn’t work for my dad because he kept removing it. It's bigger than a wrist coil, and a really loud color like hot pink would be very conspicuous if she leaves it lying around.I wasn't familiar with the Tile so I googled it. Unfortunately Mom does not have a smartphone so I don't think a Tile would work for her, but it looks like a really cool device! Or in her bra if she is able to um ... still carry things that way? She has very nice neighbors, but the residents are elderly and many have memory issues themselves. So, I could see the same thing happening if she pins it to her bra or anywhere else. Have you asked the employees? They may have a solution. Thanks. That would be the simplest solution, but I think Mom just wants to have a key because she thinks she lives in a hotel and ""I'm paying for my hotel room so the hotel should give me a room key."" Is the place safe enough to keep it under a welcome mat, or on the back of her front door decoration? If I don't get her a big lanyard to wear around her neck, another possibility might be to hang it on the back of her door. The doors have dead bolts only, so she can't lock herself out. I will check with staff - they have probably dealt with this before. My apartment has deadbolts, that helps me, too. I like the idea others have had about a lanyard, but Mom would rebel at that because it looks ""tacky."" Last week her purse went missing. It's a huge bag - think Mary Poppins! LOL to the hidden purse! Mom does this too with anything she deems important - from throat lozenges to her wallet. In the bottom of her closet, in an old handbag, zipped and wrapped in a blanket.We've always found the keys before they had to be replaced, thank goodness."	0

Since then my memory is shot, ive been manic, angry,etcIts impossibe to go to the doc due corona, otherwise I'd cured already and found my condition. Please see a medical professional as soon as possible. No im dead srs, my vocabulary now is so offAll those symptoms are no bullshit.Might be sugar,food,lactose,idkMight be vitamin d defiency, I believe ritalin might causes defiencies as well.	0
I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment. I've got one shot to keep this ball rolling to get a diagnosis and get some help. What do I tell the doctor? What will be kind of helpful? What's not helpful at all?Dad can come off as a normal, sweet but quirky old guy. During the funeral planning, he told the funeral directory he wanted a second autopsy done because my mom was in perfect health when she went into the hospital and he didn't agree with the first autopsy's findings. In the next few minutes, the funeral home is calling medical examiners from across the state. Three bedroom house with narrow walk ways cutting through all the stuff. This window washer acted as an agent to purchase US$300 worth of Iraqi dinar. During a call a few days later, he mentioned he brought his heater inside to prepare it for winter. The smell was overwhelming and management at his retirement center approached me. They are common in my area and are used to warm a bed during cold winter nights or as a heating pad for pain relief. He burnt a hole through the fleece sweater he was wearing and a hole through the blanket he'd covered himself with. Fill them out, and take them with you. It will give the doctor a ballpark of where your dad is at. The tests that will be done, neurologically, SHOULD reveal enough to the physician, but I would also make a list with approximate dates with the type of things you've mentioned here, & give that to the Dr. (out of view if this will upset Dad) to give them a much more well rounded history of what's been going on & for how long. You could also call in advance & ask to speak to the Neurologist yourself, to give them a heads up. Not sure what the POA situation is with your Dad, but in my personal experience, it doesn't get better than it is currently, so if he's struggling with knowing if a bill is indeed a bill, it's time to look at ways protect him, & his finances, so that you know that his needs will be met, safely & it removes the responsibility & worry from him. Xo Maybe show the neurologist what you have summarized here as well. Mail this description ahead of time.	0

"I have some experience in this area, which is why I'm concerned.First signs were years ago, related to a statin. I cannot tie his current status specifically to that. At this point, it's a long and fairly slow decline. Recently I ran across a photo from about 20 years ago and emotionally was slammed with the realization that the guy in it bears no resemblance to who he is now. and if I don't know (because I'm off in another room) he'll get furious and demand to know why I don't come look. I'll find dishes & glasses shoved together so tightly that it's a miracle nothing shattered. Or, he'll empty it half way, then start adding dirty dishes in with clean. I never know what I'll find.Also, and this one really troubles me, he ""remembers"" things that I did, but thinks he did them. Where can I turn for recognition & intervention? And if you've been through this, what timeline & prognosis & outcome have you experienced?I'm replying to myself - just so I have the details recorded. The second neurologist brought him in for a PET scan (insurance agencies want every single test done before this, because it's pricey) and we finally received the diagnosis the week that our state went into shut down. It will make all of the difference. It's a very challenging job, although with you being his wife, you don't have to jump through as many hoops as I have had to in order to even begin aiding with his medical journey. I chose to share this info with you because I desperately needed an outline of what to expect. I strongly recommend you find a support group near you. If not, groups on Facebook and Reddit have been extremely helpful answering questions, sharing information and giving me a place to connect and not feel alone. The neurologist sent me this book that was helpful understanding the best way to communicate with some with alzheimers: Learning to Speak Alzheimer's: A Groundbreaking Approach for Everyone Dealing with the Disease&#x200B;Good luck with you journey, and again, don't let anyone doubt yourself! And to clarify timing, I noticed things in 2014. Thank you so very much. Thanks. Because: Nobody does anything for me. They just want my money. Which is even worse than anyone can imagine. At this point, I'm nearly depleted emotionally. The things he does are so bizarre, so being told ""everything is normal"" when clearly it is NOT is just devastating."	0
Is there a drive device that automatically shuts off if left on for too long? My Dad is a senior and doesn't know how to use a smart phone so if we could find some heat sensor device that automatically shuts off the stove without needing wi fi, that may keep him out of assisted living.MindCare has a stove shut off. You have the option of connecting it to your smartphone so you can track how many times he forgets to turn off the stove. I don't think having wifi is mandatory. It might be worth investing in simple wifi though - since it's much cheaper than than AL. Have you considered shutting the gas of to the stove and using a induction stove top in it's place? I think you can find one at costco or amazon for less than 80$ . Ill have to googke that lol no idea what that is but thanks for the idea! Oh its a special type of cook top that only puts energy into the pan that's on it. Also has the benefit of things like timers and being able to dial in the exact temperature.	0
Been in the healthcare industry for about two years. They may not be who they were. That’s all I personally know really. Lately, I have had to fill in for transportation and do pick ups for new admins as I have a clean driving record and am responsible. Using a Bluetooth auxiliary input device, and Spotify premium, I ask each and every resident what musical artist is their favorite. They all have an answer. Styx. And to know that music is the secret key! Thank you!! Thank you for what you do!	0
Recommendations, new diagnosis. So one of my future in laws parents was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's  his wife is fine and in decent health but she us caring for him. They live in the middle of no where with no phone service, I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a tracking app for him that he might not notice? I feel really bad about it because the closest relatives (us and we are 3 + hours away) is there anything that would work for them, they do have a land line but no internet service. I'm not a doctor and I know she is scared and wants to be informed. Thanks in advance !Rural services can be few and far between, but still, the first stop would be an agency for aging. There might be resources they can hook the wife up with. How tight is money? Can you tell us an approximate location? (at least country) United states, money is tight older couple in thier late 80's I will have to look up an agency like that for sure. Not sure the exact money situation but I know they don't have a lot of it. Satellite internet would be useful and is available everywhere. I've taken care of my grandmother that had cancer, and I've taken care of alzheimers patients at care facilities but taking care of a family member who has alzheimers is a little different I appreciate it :) Each county in each state has their own office, which is good. > They live in the middle of no where with no phone service,  >>they do have a land  line but no internet service. It might be possible to get the house a router and him a fitbit-like watch to get health recordings and track him if he wanders. Sorry I should've been more clear, theres no cell phone service but theres a land line. Thanks! Thanks! Their social worker contacts me by phone monthly just to check in with me, and that's very nice (and free). They also provide free or low-cost respite care, which can be either at home (someone comes in) or at a facility (overnight or day treatment). That would help out a lot!	0
I feel like I'm in way over my head. He's been bothering the neighbors about it too, who saw nothing. We took him to a psych facility the following day, and they told us they weren't going to admit him because he wasn't a danger to himself and he was getting belligerent about not being allowed to smoke, and with the virus they thought he'd be better off at home, and the symptoms were mostly gone by then anyway. He can't really work the TV (he could if it was just turn it on and change channels, but the whole smart TV thing and multiple remotes has him stumped constantly, even with a regular cable box and two remotes). He has a whole three bedroom two bath house filled with 40 years of stuff. He has two cars and a truck, a rental house, and two empty parcels of land, all 3 hours away from us. AND, I found out after going up there and going through all of his stuff, that he got depressed after my step mother died and hadn't dealt with any bills in almost a year, and his taxes and god knows what else were all kinds of screwed. I have YEARS worth of paperwork to go through and I'm trying to sort through it a little at a time.We went up this past weekend and I had him label everything he wanted to bring down, and everything he wanted to keep or put in storage.I put one car in the shop because he just left it in the garage for a year, and we got a new battery in the truck, and drove it back down to our house. He owes $100k on it, but maybe we could sell it as a fixer upper regardless. I don't know.I've gotten a family friend who is a lawyer to send me information on wills and power of attorney, but dad doesn't want to sign anything and doesn't have any active paperwork, and I'd really rather have him sign willingly than have him declared incompetent, if I'm going to survive living with him for the next however long.I let Dad manage his own meds (and double checked him) for about two weeks, and he just couldn't do it himself, so now I'm managing them for him.The whole time this is going on, all I can think is am I doing the right thing? And I'm constantly second guessing myself and my actions and whether I'm doing the right thing at the right time.I have no resources. I'm managing his meds for him, and making sure he gets food, of course, but I'm at a complete loss for how to occupy his time, and help his life be worth living, especially in the midst of this virus stuff.And, selfishly, I need to figure out how I make sure that my dad's life doesn't consume my own? I know my life is derailed currently, and there is now a new normal, but what's on track for me going to look like going forward, etc.ANY advice, or resources, or ANYTHING at all is helpful at this point.First, take a deep breath. It's worked for centuries and so it will work for you if you are willing to put in the effort and it seems you are. Now you MUST involve a lawyer. I'm not at this point with my parents yet so others could point you in a better direction as to which type but with all the legal odds and ends you'll have to bite the bullet and get one involved. The very worst for older adults is losing freedom and autonomy. Sitting on the porch and watching the world go by isn't going to be enough. I also suggest getting maybe a laptop specifically for him and programming it in a such a way he can re-learn or familiarize himself again with technology. Going from being connected to totally unplugged doesn't feel good for anyone, older folks included. Sorry I haven't been able to respond. First of all you have done GREAT so far! A few things I've learned:Get a durable power of attorney in place NOW. If that sounds harsh, I don't mean for it to sound that way, but if you don't get some control of the situation now and getting that DPOA it will be MUCH harder down the road. My advice is to talk to your father now about what he both wants and expects for HIS elder care needs. My FIL who had dementia lived with us as well, so I understand how overwhelmed you feel. It is best to see a certified Elder Law attorney if possible because they are the most knowledgeable in this area. They can likely connect you to a good real estate attorney for the sale of properties as well. Consider looking for a certified move manager. They also specialize in working with older adults in these situations. If you google certified move manager you can find one in your area. Explore selling the home as-is. Hopefully the proceeds from the sale of assets will give you a little bit to work with for his care.Contact your local area agency on aging. They can connect you to any assistance and programs that may be available and are usually a wealth of information. Find your agency here:  https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/About/Aging_Network/AAA.aspx Contact the Alzheimer's Association for caregiver support. Programs vary by location, but they have SO MUCH available. Find your local chapter here:  https://www.alz.org/local_resources/find_your_local_chapter Check with your local pharmacy about the packaging of Dad's meds. It will make meds management much easier for you and will be good if you are able to have help once at some point.Connect with a certified home care agency to see what might be available. Even if you can't afford much, a couple hours a week will allow for you to get a bit of time away. Here is a questions to ask worksheet you can use:  https://polkeldercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Form-Home-Care-Questions.pdf Check with your local police department to see if they have any programs related to dementia response. Some communities have registries that you can participate in and do well checks or can more easily locate family when someone wanders.Most communities have so many hidden resources. The Chamber of Commerce & City Hall are good places to gather resources and programs like Meals on Wheels will also be able to clue you in about what else might be available in your community. Some communities even have adult day care programs that would be helpful when you return to work.I hope some of this information is helpful. I'm happy to help if I can. This is a great and helpful list and deserves more upvotes. Glad the info has been helpful. - Get power of attorney so you can deal with his finances, his property and other matters. - Put his name in for an Assisted Living residence close by - you do not have to take the placement if his name comes up quickly, but some places have long waiting lists. My mother's place has Assisted Living and Memory Care in the same residence, just different floors. It seemed to be a humane set up, so they don't have to move to a whole new place if they need more services. - If he is still driving, it might be time to check out alternatives. - Check to see if he is getting all the financial aid and services he is allowed. Many places have Senior's Social Workers that can help with that - your town/city likely has a Seniors' Center that can point you in the right direction for many things - including caregiver supports and day programs. - It sounds like you are doing all you can so far. It will be challenging but the hardest part  is now when things are in such a mess.	0
2yrs in the nursing home during this pandemic they refused food or water. The facility has a 50+% infection rate of covid, and my other parent has significant risk factors that an exposure would likely kill. Sunday they told us 24 hours, Monday the nurse told us they wouldn’t make it through the night. The stress and anxiety of this is killing me.I am so sorry that this is happening to your parent and that you have to experience this. All I can do is offer my empathy and my sympathy and tell you that with time and grief the pain will start to heal. It can take a month or more or it could be tomorrow. My heart hurts for you.	0
Resources for long-term care Hello friends, my dad has Alzheimer's and seems to be advancing pretty rapidly. A couple things I'm looking for help on; we need some kind of tracking device for my dad for when/if he wanders away. I've seen plenty of watches but my biggest concern with any kind of wearable is getting him to wear it. I've seen the tracking soles for shoes but it needs charging almost everyday. Thoughts on what works well and how to get them to wear it?The other thing I'm looking for guidance on is how to find out what kind of assistance my parents qualify for. My dad was a 9/11 first responder and is part of the long-term study so I've asked my mom to mention it at his next check-up. But I'm curious about who I should contact to get more info on financial assistance for long-term care. Elder Care attorney. A good one can help you draw up a map, so to speak, on how to effectively get your dad, the care and help he needs. I just read about elder care managers and now I know what to ask for! This is exactly what I need; someone who can help us navigate all this. There's a lot of great info online but it's tough to sift through it all to find what's relevant. In my county we have this thing called project lifesaver. It’s a wristband that’s somehow linked to a radio frequency. It’s waterproof and the band is made of something similar to seat belt material, but a little smaller/thinner. 😳Also, the local senior center or area agency on aging should be able to assist with resources. There may also be local geriatric care managers/management companies that can help as well. Look online for these, they have a lot of information about benefits. Also health and human service centers will have information available about area specific resources you can use. A lot of churches have information about community options available. There is more than you think out there that have information available to help your mom out with burn out. I'm going to reach out to my employee assistance program. I'm just not sure what to ask for from them but I'm hoping they can guide me.Unfortunately I'm the only family nearby so I help my mom as often as a I can but with coronavirus, I haven't been able to help. Adult day care is a great idea! The interaction and care at some places are wonderful. When there are some open and available please take tours of a couple and talk to as many of the care workers as you can. The one we took my grandma to also had a childcare that had activities planned with both the kids and the elderly together. There is also a program where I am located that has volunteers drive people in need to appointments, I believe called caring angels? There is also a Medicare-based transport for people. I really commend you for your concern for both of them!I think with your employee assistance program just being frank with the situation and asking for any available resources and information to get you started. Thanks!	0
Remotely controlled electronics Hi everyone!! Cross my fingers this gets seen 🤞🏽🤞🏽 Just a little bit of info about me: my mom was diagnosed with early-onset dementia -  she’s 58. I’ve been searching but haven’t really found much, but I was wondering if there are any electronic devices out there that can be remotely controlled on my end even when I’m in my own place. Any suggestions and alternate solutions are appreciated! ☺️Hi hi!So, I don't know about devices that are intrinsically built for remote access, but there are certainly loads of programs out there that allow you to control one computing device with another. (This is to say: you can work with computers, phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) Non-computer devices (like radios) are trickier. I'm not aware of any way to operate these remotely. This isn't to say that options don't exist, but just that I've not seen them. Something you may want to look into are devices custom-built for folks with dementia. I've seen one-button radios and simplified tv remotes, for instance. You'll have to do a bit of digging around because they have so much on offer, but check out the Alzheimer's society store: https://www.alzstore.com/And ... If you're able, loop your grandma and godmother into how to use these tech. Thanks so much!! Thanks! What kind of TV does she have? There are apps that you can use to control the tv remotely. Any recommendations are welcome I’m not buying my dad a new tv so I’m just attaching a windows pc to it (a cheap raspberry pi or android tablet could work too). I could also get one of those smart plugs to turn off and on the tv but he seems to be able to handle that p.  I’m also going to buy him an android tablet to play with and control it using the same apps which may be helpful for you since you are already getting a new tv. Could you post which tv you choose if you find one that can do remote stuff?I’m using the programs parsec and teamviewer. Both free. You can control android tablets, raspberry pis, Mac and Windows PCs with these apps. The only thing you can’t control is an iPad though you can still see the screen with teamviewer. You can use teamviewer on your own iPad though to control her windows pc.I like teamviewer in that it’s easier to transfer files from my pc to hers with it. So the things I do with the tv now that I have a pc connected to it are that I can start up Netflix and watch something with him. The last page is to my Flickr album so I can share photos and videos with him to talk about what I’ve been doing. I guess I could give him a Bluetooth gamepad and play games with him too but that might be too complicated for him. Maybe I’ll do a playlist of music videos for him too for YouTube.I’ve got Skype setup on the pc so that it automatically answers when someone calls him so I can Skype with him so he sees me on the big screen tv. I gave him an old junky desktop though so am going to buy a webcam for the tv or take an old cell phone and use that as a webcam.The android tablet will let me play touch screen games with him. Not sure yet as I haven’t tested this out. Without it, since it’s all playing on her devices, she can still get great visuals but I’m not sure if you will have problems seeing a movie or something streaming off her pc. Also, streaming uses a lot of data FYI though unless you are already using tons, I don’t think it’ll be too bad if you have a decent amount of data.Another option if this is too tech for you is Amazon echo show or google nest hub. Those can allow automatic video call pickups. I prefer Facebook portal for its big screen or tv setup but it doesn’t have automatic call answer so that’s a fatal flaw for me. These devices can’t do nearly as much as my pc with teamviewer and parsec setup can do but it’s simpler (I find teamviewer and parsec to be easy too but it does require some work).As far as her chores..  there are a ton of smart household devices out there. It’s just a matter of how much control you want to take and how much money you want to spend.Edit:  here’s a smart remote too that sound like it can control anything that uses ir input. Not sure how well it works though as I haven’t tried it. https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-915-000194-Harmony-Control-Smartphone/dp/B00ZYIFXSM/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=Smart+remote+control&qid=1588425806&sr=8-8 Wow thanks so much! You really provided a wealth of information for me. I ended up getting her just a regular Insignia tv with a roku device. As far as the smart plug goes, can you control turning the tv on and off from your phone even if you’re not at your father’s home?I actually tried playing around with teamviewer last week on her Samsung tablet and my iPhone but I noticed I could only screen record. Would I be able to control it via my iPad or would I have to purchase an android tablet for myself?I also downloaded Skype for both of us last week as well and set it up to automatically answer my calls.	0

He talks to his own reflection in the mirror or doors, has become very paranoid, he keeps hiding his things and thinks that someone will steal them. Your GP should be able to get you a test so you can do a home collection of urine. Call his doctor and ask.	0
She used to be rich but lost multiple properties over time including her home to foreclosure. She is in debt to family members to the tune of over $30,000. She has more than enough to live on, but purchases unnecessary items on QVC and Amazon etc, then can’t remember making the purchase, and has accrued around $1700 in overdraft fees alone in 2020. She mentioned being extremely stressed and sleepless about this to me in late March. This proved a problem as she kept forgetting about our agreement and spending money anyway.Kind commenters suggested in a previous post ways to gain control of her finances, such as taking over her bank account and giving her a monthly allowance on a gift card. Everything I have done with her finances I did with her in the room to give consent and passwords (when she remembered them). He and my husband do not always get along well, especially when it comes to who knows best about their mom. Last week was pretty rocky. MIL herself couldn’t access it because she kept forgetting the password. I’m disputing the charge and having the bank send you a new debit card. We got access to her bank account again, which is essential if we are to help her stay on budget and make sure she doesn’t fall below 0 again. Both households are monitoring her account regularly. BIL is willing to take control of the account and put her on an allowance if needed. She gets around 20 magazines a month, which adds up to $100 a month. We asked her if she was willing to whittle these down to maybe 2 or 3 a month, at least until her debt is paid off. OR even just let us temporarily suspend delivery. When libraries open back up, I can check many of these out for her for free. I reminded her that although her bank account is above 0 now, she has bills due of over $2600 in the next couple weeks, so we have to still be very careful. When we mentioned we had discussed her finances with BIL (we’d told her multiple times the conversation would happen), she felt we were ganging up on her and being tyrants. She forgot she herself had asked BIL and us to be involved and had given us access to her various accounts.Things got worse when we took her to the bank to get her new debit card. I feel like this week we made the relationship between my husband and BIL a lot better regarding this issue, but took a step backward with my MIL’s feelings. I know she will get upset at us again sometime in the near future, when we remind her about the budget again, and tell her she can’t spend something. Wine for us both.	0
Otherwise, we have no choice but to take him to the hospital until a home is found, and I desperately don’t want to give him away yet. Install locks that need to a key inside as well as out. I fully understand that the restrictions presented by this covid outbreak have to be taken into account; however, the safety of your LO and yourself have to also be taken into consideration.	0
More time working  out. I could get a Hoyer Lift, but I don’t  want one. That’s worth  risking a little back pain, isn’t it?At least get a good back brace. Thanks! I ordered one two days ago. Definitely get a brace, but be open to doing the things you're not wanting to, like redoing the bathroom and getting a Hoyer. My brother has ALS and he didn't (well we didn't) want a lift, but once his condition changed and our backs were literally hurting, we knew it would be safe for everyone if we had mechanical help... and btw we did have to redo our bathroom! We got a reliable contractor who simply widened the door entrance and got a small ramp leading up into it. Ah sorry, but same thing still applies, gotta take care of you! A back brace and starting to work on your core muscles to support your back.	0
Support Services won't pay for things you actually need. Why? But apparently what I say my mom needs is irrelevant .Hey I really could use an alarmed Pulse Ox so I don't have to get up every 20 minutes all night long to check and make sure she didn't take her oxygen tube off in her sleep again... Nope, sorry we can't pay for something like that. Ah, no thanks, there's no room for it and both me and my mom prefer just getting her into the bathroom. We insist. we insist that you take this thing and stick it in a corner were it will become an $800 clothes rack!So... since you wouldn't cover the diabetic shoes, because technically they're not a 'medical device' how about a pair of 'medical' compression stockings to try and reduce the swelling in her legs?No.But we can save you time by having your moms medications prepackaged in these little daily blister packs.No thank you, I've been setting up her pill box for 10 years, it only takes a few minutes and that way I know its done right.But we'll pay to have them prepackaged. And ten years is a long time. Which city/country? Also refused to pay for my mom's wheelchair but would pay for splints. I will say she has a wheelchair and they did eventually pay for it but took several appeals. We have an nice motorized wheelchair, that we told them my Dad wouldn’t be able to use. It’s sitting in the middle of the floor in their tiny second bedroom. He has Parkinson’s and his hands shake too much for the fine control of the joystick. When they delivered it, they had him try and he put it into the wall every time. I’ve tried to give it away, but it needs a new battery and no one wants to pay the $100 for it to get the free chair. My state medicaid won't pay for diapers or bed pads either. Keep fighting. Call and hang up until you either get someone in the phone who actually cares or who gives zero f*cks and will do whatever you want no questions asked. Its kind of terrifying to know that people like the latter exist in any work place but sometimes it's what you need to get the job done.5. Research the corporate/head office of whatever company is giving you trouble. Get to that corporate headquarters and leverage that contact to get what you want. I recently did this with a NYC agency. I went to the state department who superceeds them and after 2 months of getting nowhere with the city I sent 1 email to the state department, my phone was ringing off the hook the next morning with people suddenly BEGGING to help me!! Worst case scenario there is the tride and truest tactic of all: unleash the media on those mofos. Caregivers for life!!! 🤘	0
How to control grandparent's TV for them My grandmother is in an assisted living facility. She has an echo show and we just ordered a fire TV cube. It doesn't have to be an Alexa product - willing to buy whatever. Would really appreciate any tips, suggestions or advice that anyone has.I don't know of any products like you're looking for, I'm sorry. For my mom, I access her Netflix and make sure that what she wants to use is the first suggestion on the main page, but I'm guessing that would not work for you. Totally different direction, but have you looked into low vision remotes? They usually have extra big buttons and fewer options (usually 4 or 6 max on the remote) It turns out we might be able to control her tv if we buy a fire TV cube. It isnt foolproof, but my mom can sync her phone to it before delivering it, and then she can talk into the app on her phone to change the channel. One option is to get her a basic desktop pc. You can set up a pc where you can remote in and control hers. Its the RDP function I believe. You also might ask over in the IT reddit and se if theres any devices or services that would allow this. There is alot of home devices that you can remotely command so maybe that can be used for a tv. Ah cool. Yeah, I used to have remote access set up on her computer at home. setup skype too or something similar and ya all can do a video call.	0
Ideally this would be a button she could press that would just ring my cell phone. Does anything know about any device that does this? The simpler the better. Doesn’t need to have a microphone or anything, just a way for her to make my phone ring at the press of a button.Thanks!So this is a fairly common question. You're looking for a medical alert system. Here's a writeup I did a while ago on theseThere are also ways to setup a cell phone to do this, you can directly place a contact on the home screen and it will dial that person. Thank you so much! Sorry for the redundant post! I should really get a FAQ going once I have some time. It wasn't as expensive, I got it for about $80 on sale. It plugs into a landline and can call out when a button is pressed. It worked fine, but was one of the only ones that didn't have a monthly fee.	0
Mom woke me up today to call her an Uber for... She wanted me to send an Uber to her house in a small town 1.5 hours away from me so she can get here to drop off some candy she doesn't want to mail and some other stuff for my kids.I have a family tracking app on our phones and she and her husband have joined in, so I see them out at the shops every 2-4 days.Well, apparently her husband finally said no to SOMETHING and refused to drive down here with her to drop off Easter candy so she wanted me to call an Uber for her.I gently reminded her that we are staying home except for essentials.	0
technology Hi there! We are about a 3 years into my father in law's diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer's. While we absolutely love the time we spend with him, things are extremely difficult. Currently, we are struggling with electronics. He very much enjoys having his phone and apple watch, and is able to understand facebook, etc. The problem is he is continually changing his passwords. We very much cherish our time with him and we 100% want to maintain his independence as long as possible. Do your loved ones have phones and internet? We spend hours on the phone with him trying to walk him through steps of how to change things back. Apple is also frustrating because once he changes his apple account, it logs him out of all of his other devices- so he has to repeat the process with everything. He is under my brother in law's plan right now so we could have access if we needed. We are just unsure of the right move! We are frustrated and could really use any words of wisdom and guidance. Then the password can't be changed without talking to me. Man that sounds frustrating. You could try contacting apple or facebook but I'm not sure they're able to lock in a password or something. Wish I could help more. We got my mom a very bright password book and have been able to reinforce that she always write down any password in it. I had to make a specific page for each account like apple or her bank because she kept just writing down random passwords. It doesn’t always work but it sometimes it does. We went through similar with my husband. He is almost at the end of his journey now, but we downgraded him from an android phone to an iPhone because it was easy-to-use. Keep that in mind.Setting up two-factor is a great idea for now. Change the settings so that you receive the email for password confirmations and such.	0
What tech are you using to keep track of your aging loved ones during COVID-19? Hey team,I hope everyone is safe and well in this challenging time. I want to know what kinds of technology you are using to be there for your loved ones while keeping them safe by staying physically away from them. I've been building https://sailor.app as a side project and want more to gauge what is broken and what people need badly so I can build it in this time of crisis.Stay safe everybody.The same kind of tracking collars they use on wolves, paired to a canine shock collar. She has a basic flip phone where she can receive calls and she can call out to my brother and I. She also has her radio set to CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corp) which offers news, current affairs, and entertainment. The biggest connection is her phone. She is very worried about later this week when everyone in her residence will be kept to their rooms, even having meals brought up. I am assembling a care package for her that my son is taking over. He can leave it at the front desk and they will sanitize it and take it up to her. Her residence is using ipads and Facetime for a lot of the residents, but you have to make an appointment and we figure it would be better used by people who can see and may not have as good hearing or who have slight cognitive delay. Thanks for trying to help others through this. High tech - mostly connecting by phone and email. I did guide my mom through how to activate Google Duo so we can video chat. We've done that a couple times, but she prefers just talking on the phone a couple times a day. My mom lives alone has no interest in video chat. We talk on the phone several times a week. She needs the house clean because she has asthma and allergies, and this is a commercial company that does a great job. We gave Mum a Fire tablet and since her cataract surgery her eyesight is tons better, so the small screen isn't such an issue. She explored the free books and now I'm getting a notification a day about a book she's downloaded. She's also exploring Hulu and Netflix (got her hooked up to our accts) and on the internet more since I spent a few hours with her on the phone. He can't figure out how to use Facebook. He has trouble with his basic cell phone often. He can't hear me very well if I call him. He does not shop online much. He does not have equipment to do a video call.We exchange e-mails daily. He says thanks for the tip and ignores me. How would tracking help? So mostly it’s old school phone. My dad was so excited to show me the bathroom he remodeled!	0
Something doesn’t add up with my mom For a few years my sister and I...and then more and more family...have noticed my mom showing signs of dementia.stopped calling. Doesn’t like to talk on the phone more than a few mins. He just emailed us:“ Good news. UTI’s can alsoMimic the symptoms of dementia in older adults I had no idea. They have only been speaking to her family doctor and I have a feeling my dad isn’t giving all the info and/or might be downplaying symptoms. There are simple screening tests but also more comprehensive evaluations, generally performed by specialists. I don't know how it works in Canada, but my sister (who is 66 and has FTD), was initially screened by her primary care physician. See other reply. Those were almost the exact same symptoms my dad first showed. I'm not sure as I'm in the US, but here's a good resource to figure out your next steps in Canada for cognitive testing and screening for dementia. Thanks! Where in Canada are you? Often there's a senior's program or assessments running out of a clinic, usually in a hospital. Often calling the health line will get you further info. Nonetheless, if you want to learn more about FTD for educations sake, here is an amazing resource: https://www.theaftd.org/Good luck. Message me if you would like more info/help/anything!!!! Im glad that my mom’s story can help others ❤️ I am worried about mine as well. She is constantly forgetting what I tell her....other people aren’t worried but I suspect something is wrong...she refuses to see a Dr and does spend no more than 10 minutes via phone call....	0
My older brother has ALS and has been declining in the past few years. single. hour.Taking care of him has been terrible on me and my mom. Of course money is an issue with my mom cashing in some of her retirement to help pay for expenses that insurance doesn’t (which isn’t like we’ll be homeless, but she won’t have the “golden” part of her golden years anymore). He thinks he will beat this - we just had his doc’s appointment recently, and I pulled the doc aside to ask about his prognosis. My mom’s life is destroyed, and I don’t want to be bitter and care for him as a vegetable. If anyone has any advice, that would be appreciated. Hard talks are needed. What happens if you get sick or injured while you are unemployed and helping family? My mother has MS and she is near the end stages at this point but 10 years ago I just could not do it anymore. I am her legal guardian, so I do a lot of communicating with the care facility, her dr and deal with her finances as well as visit her regularly. We both know that if it ever comes to it, he will go into a home as well but I don’t foresee that need for a long time. The economic and mental toll on you and your mom is huge, see what caregiving options might be available through the state (depending where you live of course). Or even more! In case you have not checked out this possible resource for volunteer in-home help and apply for grants to assist your mom financially while you are in school.I do not envy you and I'm so sorry you and your mom and brother find yourselves in this position. I didn't look hard enough.Your brother and mother will call on you so long as you respond. If you don't, you will become what you fear. Choose a career that will allow you to make decent money and help them both long term. And then do it! But it will be worth it in the end. Wishing you peace and strength. Why have you been there for weeks or months when there’s your mom and a caregiver? I also didn’t expect them to drop everything to help unless they wanted to or I was desperate, and even now his care falls on me. They mostly help by keeping an eye on our son. Help is good when you can, but live your life.	0
He’d say “There’s got to be an app for this.” What if you could bring your friends and family together into a private app and use it to share important updates, messages, or requests for a helping hand? He even came up with a name for the app: Friends Indeed.Unfortunately, Sal lost his fight to GBM, but his passion for Friends Indeed was not forgotten. I truly believe Friends Indeed will make life easier for family caregivers and give them some well deserved relief. Having been a secondary caregiver, I would have lived to have had this app to help coordinate care. This is a great idea!	0
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services? Lately we've run into some problems (too complicated to get into, but he isn't getting lost) and the home wants me to get him a GPS tracker so we can know where he's going.I looked it up on Google and it looks like there are lots of services that you can buy a wearable GPS tracker that uses mobile data and pay a monthly fee and you can track people no problem! Unfortunately my father will not wear any of these items (necklace, bracelet, he won't even wear his medic alert bracelet, I've literally put it on him, begging him to keep it for his own safety and he just gives me a dirty look and removes it) and even the sneaky shoe sole trackers are a no go because he wears flip flops anytime the weather allows it. Yay, I was hoping that since he already has a device that can be tracked that the phone company would offer a service for GPS tracking, but apparently they dont (why not? Other companies are using the exact same tech and charging $60/month, why wouldn't the phone company want to get in on that? ).So I suppose I'm stuck using a GPS tracking app installed on the phone, so I figured I'd see if anyone else here has anything to say (good or bad) about apps or services that they've used. I'm happy to pay as long as it's going to get the job done.Checkout life360. It looks like you can location share recent and current location as well as receive alerts about low battery. Thanks looks like it has a trial so I'll give that a shot.	0
I now suspect that he may have vascular dementia as he recently (in the past 3 weeks or so) has been very confused and paranoid with intense delusions and visual/auditory hallucinations. He believes he is being recorded or being listened to through all of his smart devices. In the middle of the night last night he sent me about 50 texts in total in a span of 2 hours (I didn't respond to any of them as I was sleeping). I live about 2 hours drive away from him, so I can't visit as often as I'd like. Although doctors won't be able to give you info about your dad without his explicit consent, you can certainly give info to his doctors.On the journey to my mum's diagnosis, and also in seeking help for care after she was diagnosed, having really detailed accounts of her symptoms was helpful. If he doesn't have a POA set up, look into your legal options ASAP. If she doesn't have close friends or family she can talk to, see if you can help connect her with a support group. Worrying and feeling alone sucks. We can all listen and offer ideas when possible. Just know that we're here....if you need anything. 💕	0
"My husband and teen daughter’s (and MY) concerns. In the meantime, I’m getting some real anxiety about this. I’m very eager to learn all I can about this and would be so grateful to hear what those who are familiar with it all to share their ideas and experiences!Husband and 17yo daughter's notes, I told them to be brutally honest, that it would not hurt my feeliings. 9) Loses things several times a day, even things she was just handling a few minutes before she loses it. 12) At the grocery store recently, she kept losing track of what she was doing, where she was, very confused. Later couldn’t find her keys. A few hours later we discovered she had left the car on, engine running for several hours. 16) Neurologist told us that it is not safe for my wife to drive for the time being/foreseeable future. She understands but that seems to be a huge red flag to us. (F51 and on medical leave from grad school bc my brain quit working.) If you want to talk to someone in a similar situation, please do get in touch. I'd be more than happy to lend an ear. I'm so very sorry to hear you are having the same problems, and how it's affecting your life! from earlier tests was fine, but they're diving deeper into that with the new labs anyway, just to be sure. Thank you for the idea.I sadly relate to the feeling of ""not being me"" anymore, I sure don't feel like me. Also, thanks for the offer of getting in touch, and that offer extends to you as well. We aren't alone! Search up the Bredesen Protocol! He also promotes ideas that have been discredited (such as claiming most people are gluten intolerant).It's incredibly tempting to believe in miracle cures and there are plenty of people out there willing to take your money. Some of them may even believe what they're selling. They've posted their experiences... I've messaged, and have been contacted. This isn't a money-grab. You may find this of interest:/r/earlyonsetdementiaI recommend you check the sidebar there for a link to the Bredersen Research, Findings and suggested Regime. I will go check it out right now! YES YES YES, so glad you mentioned Dr. Dale Bredesen. Thank you so much for the information. I fear the search for causes of what's going on is going to be an uphill battle, and I can use all the info I can get. Big hugs from me xx YES it sure would. I'm trying to research all the ways this could be happening to me, and it's absolutely overwhelming. :(Some of my labs are back, but they are being held until tomorrow in my patient portal. It's at the doctor's discretion I believe. My other doctors I see don't put a hold on me seeing labs but I'm not upset, just really really want to see if anything at all came back abnormal so it's something fixable. I'm terribly anxious. :) First off, I have great news for you and your family. Look up the doctor, ""Dr. Dale E Bredesen"" He has literally reversed cognitive decline in 100 clinical patients diagnosed, truly -- with Early Stage AD, MCI, etc. (I would strongly suggest buying this book)He has found the root cause of cognitive decline is lack of vitamins/minerals, healthy fats, hormone imbalances, heavy metals (if you have amalgam fillings, replace them ASAP with a   S.M.A.R.T dentist. S.M.A.R.T dentists use the right protocol to safely remove those fillings. Join the Unaffilated facebook page. Looking through it, these folks are on the right track. You have to see what th root cause is... Whether or not you are APOE4 (which definetly contributes to early onset. If you are APOE4, going on a keto diet will be extremely beneficial) Fat is key. Especially if you're APOE4. Even if you find you're not APOE4 on 23andme, you can grab it's raw file, and upload it to a site called Promethus - there it'll show if you're APOE3, APOE2, etc. Finding out your APOE is an important step. Different diet perhaps.&#x200B;Asking questions on the Bredesen Protocol Unaffiliated will clarify any questions you have.Start small. I have a family member I've been concerned about, and have been really taking the time to look further.) Thank you so much for the detailed information, I really do appreciate it! I will keep updating here. Not until we know exactly what's happening. :("	0
Help her watch tv My mother has dementia and can’t work the television. My husband is incredibly patient and has created a very detailed sheet of instructions for her. At this point she should be able to turn it off and on, check specific channels that he wrote down the number for, and sometimes channel surf. She can’t use the guide. I can’t believe there is nothing to help with this. Is there any way to set it up to just play a list of shows we program in for her? Or get an Alexa or something to help her find something to watch? I just feel like there has to be a way to do this.TLDR: Is there any program that can be used to help a senior with pretty severe dementia watch tv?I'd burn a few DVDs with a series of her favorite shows, connect it to the tv, and set it to repeat play. She really wants to be able to do it herself, but it sounds like that won’t be possible. I just wish that Alexa or something could do this for her, so she could feel like she was in control without having to navigate to the right menu, etc. A simplified tv-only remote might be called for. My dad has a universal remote called Flipper (available on Amazon). It's very easy to use and only has six buttons (on/off, mute, volume up, volume down, channel up, channel down). I also made a guide and printed it in colour with an image of the remote and arrows and text pointing to each button to describe what each button does. She’s good with this remote currently, although I will keep that in mind for sure. She can’t track time anymore, so even though we’ve written down “Dr. She can get to that channel (using the guide like you describe), but she can’t understand why it won’t be playing the show she wants. When I came back to read through the suggestions again I realized that I never thanked you. There's also a clock that might help her with time: https://www.alzstore.com/day-clock-with-reminders-p/0045.htm. You can probably find it on Amazon for less. This website has lots of products that look like they could be really helpful! My husband could no longer handle a remote or navigating menus. Even though he had never used an iPad touching what you want became very easy for him in about a week. Unfortunately I live five hours away. I have a Google Home Mini and it's connected to a Chromecast on the living room TV. I can tell Google to play something on YouTube or Netflix (though I don't usually do this option) on the living room TV. She knows the Google Home Mini can tell the weather, so she'll ask me to ask Google the weather etc.Looks like for Netflix, I had to specify what show exactly for Google to start on the TV. At Christmas time, Walmart had a $35 set of Google Home Mini and Chromecast together. I know I paid more for that for the original 2 I had. She doesn’t have a phone, but I will look more into this. Thanks so much. My husband has Remote Desktop set up on their computer so he can help fix any issues, so I think we are basically all set up for this.	0
Every soccer, basketball, track and field event, band event, you name it they were there. Comprised of me, my dad, my mom, my younger brother, and now my grandpa. VTA offers rides to and from usually. My dad isn’t very supportive of my mom, and does the bare minimum in relation to help around the house, helping my grandpa, or helping my mom with emotional support. My mom does most of the care now, and his care is getting harder by the day. I’m at my wits end and so is my mom. We’re not ready, emotionally, to put him in a home, but we also don’t want to throw his behavior onto someone else. At this point I just don’t know where to turn. I just don’t know what to do, or what to suggest, or how to help myself through any of this. I know therapy is an option, but it’s not something my mom will participate in, let alone my dad, and my younger sibling has turned to other means of “therapy”, and not in any appropriate ways. It’s also time and monetarily consuming, which id feel guilty for. I just don’t know what to do or where to turn. Is there any kind of Alzheimers support group in your area? Please reach out to any sources you can get for help. My dad is currently in late stage alzheimer's and he lives in a memory care facility. She is helping us find resources to help our dad be the best he can be and she is also helping us manage our health/emotions. I am sure there is some sort of local 'healthy aging' agency you could look into. My dad has been in one for about 3 years now. Contact your local Area on Aging (every county has one). They will send out someone to evaluate your Grandfather and then make recommendations on ways to help you guys. They will also help explain financial help available.I’m glad that you’re able to help your Mother cope with all of this. It is a big big task taking care of someone with Alzheimer’s, once their disease progresses past a certain point. Educate yourself about the process. Watch as many as you can . Not all will be relevant to you today . My Mom is in a care home has not been able to feed herself for 4 years   not walked in 3 years. Both arms contracted the last 4 months  . These are a tool for hydration for dementia patients that hopefully will be on the market soon. https://blog.thealzheimerssite.greatergood.com/jelly-drops-release/ You are doing a very tough thing and it is admirable that you are looking out for the well-being of your Grandpa while smartly recognizing that the current setup is not sustainable for your family. Talking to others who have been in your shoes is an excellent first step toward relief.Some great advice has already been offered for how to enlist some experienced help outside of your family and get some respite from the stress - follow it. We were fortunate to find a “personal care home” near us with just 5 other patients and a rotating staff of loving professional caregivers who could help him without being devastated by the experience (as we family members now were). We were fortunate to have enough savings available to afford this place for the 6 months until he passed at age 86, but our plan if he had lived beyond the savings was to spend down until he qualified for Medicaid and do the best we could with those benefits (likely requiring a move to a larger memory care facility that would accept Medicaid rates).	0

thanks for being there even though you didn't know :D Hey guys,I wanted to thank you all for being here. She has no will, no poa, no plans, no waiting lists, no activities, no house modifications for safety, no geriatrician even. I was going to call elder abuse/neglect before I left to make sure social workers got involved. Contrary to popular belief, they don’t care if a caregiver calls and asks for help, the patient has to call. It’s been very frustrating.Yesterday I discussed at work and with my gaming group that I was thinking about calling them tomorrow instead of waiting because I really was afraid she’d get hurt before any changes were made. She has balance and movement issues. I kept seeing all the things I knew about from nursing school that would have made it easier to help her up that we didn’t have. Cause she has no paperwork! Four awesome firemen showed up. I wished I’d called earlier, but I was still afraid of authorities stepping in. I AM still afraid of authorities stepping in. I want her wishes to be honored, but they refuse to take any action at all. He’s promised everything before. Even when I admitted I was suicidal living here with no security and no plans with all these towers waiting to collapse around us, NOTHING changed. We’ll see if anything happens now, but I’m not afraid to call now. Even super temporary can make all the difference. When I was driving in, knowing I was taking my father to the ER one way or the other, I called a crisis line to find out exactly what the steps would be.	0

Need advice on Power of Attorney/Alzheimers My grandma is turning 90 in July and her mental health is rapidly deteriorating. Shes a stubborn German lady who has been ridiculously independent her whole life. Loses keys. Which turned out to be the money my mom was trying to help her find the week before. My aunt did not tell anyone in the family when my grandma got into an accident and lost her licence. She has taken care of so many with it and wants my grandma to move in with her and my dad. Checking the mail and walking to city hall to pay her bills has been a daily task for years. Writes receipts so my grandma can see as keeps track of all her papers and constantly looking at the ones in her purse. After my grandma was found wandering, my mom put a Bell Smart Things tracker in my grandmas purse to keep tabs on where she is. My aunt found it, took it out and hid it in a box under papers in a cupboard. My aunt changed the locks on my grandmas door and didnt tell or give my mom a spare key. When my grandma dies my aunt has admitted she wants nothing to do the properties,  wants to wash her hands of the family and she says she will sell it all. Her Will states everuthing is to be split 50/50. Would rather put her in a nursing home and forget about her.My mom wants my grandma to sign a Power of Attorney so she can have access and control to grandmas banking, bills and health care while shes alive. POA for health care allows my mom to pay herself with some of my grandmothers funds for taking care of her as my mom will need to quit her current job to take care of her full time. My parents are selling their forever house to move into a ranch style home where theres a really nice plot of land with a chicken coop that grandma always wanted. The blind dog (who loves my mom) will live there too. We dont want my aunt to trick grandma into signing the POA and tossing her in a nursing home. 2) Anything you might know? 3) Anyone you know we could contact?This are not funny cat comic... Wrong subreddit. Check the other posts. go to r/alzheimers My grandson sent me a funny Garfield picture!	0
He's uncomfortable talking about much of substance and always seems to feel ill at ease, like he isn't sure what's coming out of his mouth and not certain of where he is. I have no idea what their finances are, and furthermore, I was told never to contradict someone with Alzheimers. He's taking care of her, everything, still works full time, refuses to let me move home to help. We never had a great connection to begin with, and I hate that I don’t know what to tell him when he’s afraid. If you anymore questions feel free to ask Great suggestions!	0

Advice Please So I have been caring for my husband for a little over 3 years. He has a seizure disorder, BPD, and other mental health issues. Some ins will pay for adult day care or home visits. I feel like I almost have to just say well you're going to have to deal with it while I have this time but his seizures are increased by anxiety... UGH depending on where you live there might be social service or non-profit programs that could help. Check with NAMI.org and the local disability office too. Seizures and anxiety... are you in a Medical Marijuana or Legal state/country? Currently saving up to get both of our cards! So if your state has laws like California did, he can get a card and you can sign up as his Caregiver, which means you can purchase, transport, prepare, and administer, but not take any yourself. That's usually cheaper.You'll want to look up studies (Doctors like Pubmed studies, but using a pot website to find the studies themselves might be easier because some of the studies are written very med-speak-ish) to print out and bring to the doc. This isn't to get a pot recommendation, this is to ask the doc if there's any contraindications with your husband's current meds. I've found all these studies on how Cannabinoids reduce anxiety and seizures (hand them over), so I need to know if there are any possible negative interactions between his meds and cannabis, please, before we try them. We do know that pot has a boatload of different things in it, some of which are good, some which do harm, and some of which could go either way. For instance, CBD is great at managing my dysmenorrhea and anxiety, but we know that THC actually accelerates HPV tumor growth. Derivatives from whole leaf (edibles, tinctures, vape, etc) will have less of the chemicals that might do the job. well honestly we already use it daily for medicinal purposes, his doctors are aware we just don't have the cards yet. He gets very lightheaded and dizzy easily so I feel like I can't leave him alone without him getting hurt. He always tells me to go and do stuff, I'll make the plans and then when it comes down to it he gets anxious and I end up cancelling, causing issues with friends and making me feel slightly resentful. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may really help him not be so reliant on you. It's time to look for fixes for this because... what happens if you break your ankle? I have no clue how to make him see that he needs it. I just want an hour or two out of the house without feeling guilty. :( So you need advice on how to either get your husband to therapy for his anxiety, or advice on how to get some alone time without guilt. Therapy can help you figure out solutions for exactly these things. It's been advised by my primary. Ok if by BPD you mean borderline personality disorder, DBT therapy can definitely help! It reduces perceived abandonment depression which looks like triggers his seizures. Grand mail? That's the goal. They started about 3.5 years ago. Triggered by a falling out with a friend and financial issues. I've posted about this before, but my advice is to be open to talking. Going on to such forums is a great starting point. I'm sorry I just saw this today. It's hard to find people who understand the demands. I spend a decent amount of time online conversing with people to get human contact lolI have suggested getting a carer/thought about it. I feel like since I can adequately care for him that I'm taking away from people who don't have someone who can care for them if that makes sense. People do need it, but you and your husband will need it too. It has helped me too. It's full of nice people and it's a nice way to socialise without any stress.	0
Hi all. Is there a good app I could put on his phone that is reliable, hidden, and always on so that we could keep track of his whereabouts?Google maps for android and find my friends/find my for apple! They both use gps tracking on the phone. You would need to get his phone and have him share his location with you still but after that point, you can pretty much check at anytime. He needs to see a doctor for an assessment. try Life360 Life360 is really good for android or ios. You would have to get into his phone to set it up. You can pay to get a driving report, too. Yes for around $7 a month you can get a complete driving and location report. It lets me track his driving as well as speeds and hard stops. It has been a game changer for us, $20 a month for the gps, like $20 to buy the monitor. I'll be interested to hear what folks say as we have this issue with my dad but he doesn't use a phone anymore so we can't track via an app. If he’ll let you put something on his keychain you could use Tile. thetileapp.com Throw a Tile under his floor mats. Or shove the tile into that spot between the seat and the center armrest. You know - that no-mans land where your hand won’t quite fit into the crack to pick up the stray coins that always seem to fall there? Family can see where the person is. Where are you based? I’m thinking something I could discreetly put on his phone would work...as long as it stays ON, you know? Thanks so much. I turned on location tracking one day on her Google maps app. My daughter was able to get his phone and install life360 on it and hide the app. Every now and then, we’d have to turn it back on because he enjoyed changing all the settings, but he never knew we could track him because, if he had, he’d still be screaming and he passed away in August. He won’t even keep the account I made for him on Netflix. Good idea with hiding the app...I don’t actually think he’s tech-savvy enough to figure it out, so that might work! Thanks for your help and I’m so sorry for your loss. Someone suggested an Apple Watch, to track location. I saw a news story just in the last week or so about a GPS device built into a shoe sole insert. Life360 is good, if you’re sure that he keeps his phone powered on and with him. My mom, and a few other older folks I know only turn on their phone when they want to make a call or are expecting one. I thought about getting one of those small pet GPS from the wish app and putting it in my 98 year old father in law’s wallet. Came here to recommend TILE Neck bell. This kinda applies -- an Apple Watch is good for tracking, but I found out today that the Series 4 and up has fall detection! I can see getting my dad one -- although he is fearful of some tech. If you have iphones, set up a family plan and add him on. You’ll always be able to get his location without any apps installed and it won’t notify him.	0
A study shows that, when given in a way that facilitates passage to the brain, lithium in doses up to 400 times lower than prescribed for mood disorders can halt signs of advanced Alzheimer’s pathology and recover lost cognitive abilities. Many natural springs used by humans for their medicinal waters contain lithium.

Video calling device recommendation? Does anyone have recommendations for a video calling device for my mom with dementia? Would like to be able to call in without her having to answer. Also if it can be tamper proof as we set up laptops with skype auto answer before but she accidentally changes the configuration of the laptop or turns off wifi. The CNAs try to help but arent as tech savvy. Thank you all!Amazon echo and google nest hub both have drop in features where you can call in without the other person answering.I wish facebook portal devices had drop in calls as they have the largest screen by far and the camera does a better job following a person around but unfortunately, last i checked thry didn't have that feature (maybe they added it by now but I doubt it). Thank you for this information, i was also looking into the facebook portal but in the end the echo show seemed a bit easier.The screen is a bit small and sometimes i can only see part of her face depending on where shes sitting but still seems to help :) also during these times where we cannot visit, its really helped making daily check ins easy.	0
Why aren’t there more/better technology options? My mil has had short term memory loss, basically she can’t make new memories it seems. It doesn’t seem to be progressing fast and she is self sufficient- she can take care of her self well because it’s all automatic. I’m looking for ways to communicate with her in real time where she doesn’t have to learn a new method. Like, a sign in her apartment that I can text info to her such as “ appointment is at 10 today, be ready for pick up” or some thing like that. Basically some sort of control able device that can be visual.We used a whiteboard for a while, but reading comprehension took a dive and it confused my mom as she couldn't read it. She never could figure out a device like Google Home and she stopped answering the phone if I called as my VOIP, no matter what we did, would show up on her caller ID as my city only, even though my number was stored with my name, the calls never showed my name. So I'm here to remind her of upcoming appointments, but it's still a struggle to get her out the door. I put a whiteboard magnet on the fridge door with the day's date and and any appointments or events. It's been up for months and I can't tell that my grandmother ever looks at it. Wish there was an easy answer. I use Amazon Echo Dots all over the house. You can set verbal reminders to go off for them and drop in from your own phone on an intercom set up. Thanks.	0
A tool that will prevent my grandma from using the stove? We're not sure whether she has alzheimer's at this moment, but there was a time when she turned on the stove and forgot to turn it off. Is there a device that will lock the stoves or the stove knob? Any recommendations for the products?Throw the fuse that controls the stove- an easy fix :) This is a great answer: get a lock for the fuse box and lock it too. We never tried this, but we looked at it when my mom kept turning on the gas to the stove. https://www.alzstore.com/automatic-oven-control-p/0352.htm In stores like Babys R Us, they used to sell child proof devices for stove knobs. I think Lowes and Home Depot sells them as well.Amazon sells a bunch of them. Turn the breaker to the stove off when you don't want her to use it. These have worked for us: https://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Stove-Covers-Count/dp/B005XTCMSQ/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=safety+first+stove&qid=1579487141&s=baby-products&sr=1-2Although Jenn's suggested to cut the power to the stove is probably the most surefire fix! If it's a gas stove the fuse thing won't work.	0
Need Advice - early stages of care My mother in law was diagnosed with psuedodementia about 3 years ago. She has refused to acknowledge it and gets pissed when it is brought up. So badly that we are going to move in with her. But we are at a loss for how to handle it. My husband has power of attorney over medical. We aren't sure how that works exactly but we were able to obtain her past medical records and look at them (she is very tightlipped about it all). A nurse told me that we could call adult services and they would have someone determine if she is in need of anything ...and we could have them order a forced evaluation. We also have a 2 year old that makes things difficult because she is particularly interested in him and very judgemental towards my husband and I. Not even for any particular reason it seems, just seems like shes old and insecure about all the ways parenting seems different nowadays or like she's super jealous because she truly enjoyed her time as a mother and seems to wish she could have it again (her other son died relatively young ☹ so a lot of emotion there). I see this as being the hardest thing to deal with. Any tips? We figured we could track her phone using the Google find my phone thing so we would always know where she was (if she had her phone)  Anything that could make this easier?Hey there, sounds like you've got a lot going on!I'm not from your area, so not sure what your process is for diagnosis and stuff, but getting  support is important for her, and you. It may be you discuss it with her head on, or maybe a sneaky trip out and call at the doctors 'to pick something up' while you're out..  speaking with the doctor first will help figure out how to approach it.Social services should be able to advise on what support's available in your area. Worth a chat even if it's just that for now. There may be advice and support you can use now, and it's worth knowing what help you can get if and when things get more difficult.Great that you're doing her meals so she's eating healthy. Can you just stop buying them? Or offer healthier snacks for if she's getting hungry? with dementia, it's easier to try and avoid confrontation, so either let things slip if she's just being critical, or if she's telling you to do things a particular way, maybe reply 'that's a great idea, I'll try it later', or that your child's sticking to a routine for now, and hopefully it'll go forgotten?Good luck with things!	0
"Aging Parents and helping their adult children My parents are in the late 60s and 70s and have never been able to manage their finances well. Normally I let them make decisions and give my opinion, however in this case no one is listening to me and I don't know what's the right move.If I say no to the transfer of funds I'm sure my sister will stop talking to me and then try and go around me.If I let this happen my parents are going to lose 4000USD and likely have to help her out again in the future when she realises she can't pay the bond, levies and rates. My parents have all there mental faculties however have never understood how to handle money or say no to my sister.When should I step in?This same thing happened with my MIL and SIL. At that point in time, it looked like my MIL could afford the $10,000 but my husband was worried that down the road giving it to my SIL would prevent my MIL from obtaining the correct services that she may need. It's a lot of money that they could put to good use for themselves down the line.Going to have a stern conversation with all involved and hopefully they listen to reason.Thanks again! My other brother and I had to step in, and although we were able to block a lot of it he has still manipulated her out of over $100,000 in vehicles, etc. is there a financial advisor they've had for a long time that you could talk to as well who could give some respected input?). Talking to a financial adviser would be great, my family don't have one but I'll see about speaking to my friends and finding a good one.Just spoke to my mom and she seems to be in a tizz about the whole thing and my dad apparently doesn't care and just focuses on his readings and wants everyone to be happy.I appreciate the caution and will take it slowly with them. At this point I'm just trying to do right by them because they raised me as best they could and I owe it to them to make sure they are comfortable or atleast know they have some future to look forward to. Agreed, you dont know what the future may bring and its much better that they be able to handle what Life may throw at them. he thinks he should spend it all and i just cant seem to convince him to hang onto it in case something else happens. We helped a family member buy a place, because she could not get finance. Within 3 years she couldn’t pay the loan any more. And I can’t do anything about it. :( Ouch sorry that this happened to you and it's a big fear that the same will happen between my parents and my sister. Being the one fiscally responsible person in a family full of people who cannot manage basic financial planning is AWFUL. I don't know whats worse: continuously watching them fail and mess up their lives; or the knowledge that they'll be coming to YOU and begging for money when they're broke and facing homelessness. I think the latter is worse because it affects us more than just watching people make mistakes.After a long drawn out conversation my folks decided to give the sister the money with the full understanding that I will not support them financially ever if they did it and that they can no longer ask me for financial advice as they don't take it.I'm going to have lunch with my sister tomorrow and let her know my feelings and that I don't want her in my life.Family is important but your own sanity is more important >I think the latter is worse because it affects us more than just watching people make mistakes.Agreed. Or give the 4K as a personal loan with no interest (paperwork required), and a declaration of intent to pay back, so that she will have documentation of owing it back to the estate, when the time comes? Ya we tried the loan thing and then she stupidly said she won't pay them back because a brother loaned money 15 years ago and never paid it back.At this point I'm likely going to absolve myself of power of attorney and go no contact.Thanks for your input :) oh, wow. I'm really in 2 minds about things after talking to my mom I think I need to find a solution to protect them. Then you manage the bills or put them on auto pay, and they get a card with like $200 limit that you pay off every month.You could also just play hard ball and decide that you're willing to protect your parents at the cost of the relationship with your sister - and say that you will not agree to the gift of $4K. It will only be a loan, and if she doesn't pay it back, it will come out of her portion of the inheritance. Make sure that's listed as a debt owed to the estate and consider legal action to get a judgement on it if he won't even pay payments toward it. Many banks offer this as a service for a fee. Pretty sure the word you're looking for is Conservatorship. My brother is now 58 years old and my 88 year old parents still ""help"" him all the time (like EVERY month!). This is what I fear my parents will die penniless and then my sister will want help from me...Sorry that you going through this I'm really frightened of the same thing! My parents are at the stage where they need additional in home care or assisted living. Not sure if they can afford it due to giving my brother all their savings. Keep in mind that power of attorney CAN be revoked - if your parents still have their wits about them and decide they aren’t happy with how you are managing the money, they can have you removed as POA and still give your sister whatever she wants.Others have recommended you speak to a financial planner, which isn’t a bad idea, but I would also suggest you consult with an estate planning attorney. How will your sister qualify for a home mortgage without a down payment? properties. I think there is always one in the family that gets a raw deal (or feels like they are).If my parents had the money to help my siblings as yours did I'd have no issues with it. I think it's important for one to separate financially from their parents early on to learn independence and become self-sufficient. Since you have power of attorney, my suggestion would be ask about this in /r/personalfinance.What I'm thinking is maybe there are trust arrangements you could put in place that would protect the bulk of their money. I know vanishingly little about such things, only that they do exist.Anyway, if you could get their money locked up in a trust, it wouldn't be a matter of you having to say ""No, I won't allow this"", but instead, ""No, it's not possible, it's out of my hands, the trust won't allow it"". This may cost a bit upfront, but maybe make an appointment with a personal financial planner -- for the WHOLE family. Sounds like your sister needs to talk to a PFP anyway, and it could help your parents out as well. One of my siblings and his kids got monthly checks. They were giving away a lot of money. Mom was pissed about it, saying it was her money and she could gift at will."	0
My mom was hospitalized with hyponatremia from late November to mid December. When I questioned this and the swelling I. When I arrived home, her legs were 100x more swollen than usual, she was flushed (arms and ears especially), said she was dizzy, and just “off” in general. I also took her blood pressure with the home device and it was absurdly high!! 200/98!!!! If I didn’t move and get a new job none of this would have happened. I’m at a loss for what to do anymore with her. I also took two sick days for a medical appointment (I have to see a dermatologist for a possible skin cancer biopsy. My mom was mentally doing fine, but now her body’s gone to hell because I couldn’t come back soon enough to take her to her family doctor. What on earth do I do?You know when you fly in a plane and they tell you to put your own mask on before helping others in an emergency? It may be time to look into assisted care facilities. She's been in a facility for nearly 2 years now, and I finally feel like I can breath. And go easy on yourself,  none of this is easy, and it does not have to be 100 per cent your responsibility. If they aren’t willing to keep fighting to have value, purpose and health in this stage of life, you shouldn’t sacrifice yourself for it. Or can she move to be closer to you? Perhaps see if her insurance would cover an in home aide for a few hours a day. Often the nurse case managers at the insurance companies have resources they can recommend. She was having issues that would have happened regardless if if you were there are not. Those services exist for a reason. Granted, this was a gradual thing (but comes back to herself needing to alert you when things go awry), but the older she gets, the more the only way to be reasonably sure nothing bad ever happens would be to not only live there, but also never be absent for any length of time. You moving away was a necessity, and one that actually will give you more financial options when making decisions about care and visits moving forward, and one that somewhat protects you from the gradual swallowing up that otherwise can happen. If money is an issue, and your mother qualifies, Medicaid can help pay for this. They can tell you what services are available in your area. Contact your local Area Agency on Aging (or the equivalent where you are) and see what services are available for her. Do you know your mom's neighbors? I discovered in dealing with my mom that assisted living (at least in my area) isn't a thing unless you have thousands of dollars to spend a month. But we do have adult foster care homes that take low income seniors. There are many ways to help your mom that don't require you to sacrifice your future, find out what resources are available and start bringing them in. But I also think that if you do a good job, and the folks at your job are good people, they would understand, especially if it's something you can get a handle on.I don't know if this is possible with your job, but it may be worth it to look into taking intermittent Family Medical Leave with your employer if you are in the US. By the looks of it, even the doctors don’t know. She has other good ones.	0

Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult Hi All,I'm (M early 30's) a caregiver for my chronically ill partner (F late 20's). She can't keep track of her belongings very well due to the pain (I bought her some tile trackers, but they can't track everything). We split time between our parents houses. She always has bags of meds and other stuff and I feel like we're carting around duffel bags. I haven't acted on this, but I may. Being forced to rely on others is frustrating and would upset me too. It's hard to stay positive and I would be depressed too.I want to make this work, especially since she is still slowly improving and getting better, but I'm having trouble communicating my caregiver fatigue and what I need. We have definitely had our fun together and she was incredibly supportive when my mother died and continues to be an anchor when I'm struggling with things.I feel lost, overwhelmed, and depressed. My wife has Fibromyalgia, tendonitis, arthritis, carpal tunnel, and a few mental health issues that include PTSD, anxiety and Non-epileptic seizures. You, and her mom from what you've stated. Talk directly with her mom about things. Figure out who your support network is. When my wife's anxiety and PTSD are flaring up, her pain levels skyrocket, but the opposite isn't necessarily true. You guys seem to have a pretty set schedule, which is good. Block out an hour or two that is your time. Schedule things around it. Window shop. Play video games. It is so very worth it. They can offer lots of advice and help when you need it. Also look into counseling! I'm more than happy to answer any follow up questions you may have. I appreciate your willingness to talk about it.We're not quite sure what all is going on because it's all still in flux. My partner is thankfully not terminal either, but sometimes it feels like she has everything under the sun.I've been thinking about making a fun photo album for us. I looked around my area a few days ago, and while they exist, almost all of them seem targeted towards people who have a dying parent or are taking care of someone who cannot take care of themselves at all. Yep, look for Chronic Pain support groups. She has non-stop emotional labor, but I managed to get myself into an auxiliary role where it's basically just my job to know everything (or how to do a web search) and answer coworker's questions. There's something to be said for being around great people, even if the money isn't as good. Try to talk to and make them understand that things are tough for you as well and it has to work both ways to make things go a little better.	0
I went ahead and removed admin capabilities from their PC, but that's not going to protect their wallets. I'm a tech-type, and I was wondering if anyone out there is using any sort of call monitoring software or devices. Basically, it would be nice for my friend to get a text or email notification with the caller ID info any time they get a call on their land line, or possibly even outbound calls which would require more specialized hardware. The parents do have a modem on their computer, so a software option should be straightforward. I may end up programming something on my own, but I don't have a land line to test with easily.Is anyone using a program, device, or service which accomplishes anything like this?Thanks!Spectrum has a service called Nomorobo which has been really helpful with my parents’ landline. It filters out scammy calls. All my mom needs to know is, don’t pick up the phone on the first ring. If it rings twice, she can pick it up. Maybe their service provider has a similar program? Not sure where your friend lives, but at my previous workplace, we had Vonage connected to a landline and a cellphone. Anytime someone calls the landline, it will ring on the cellphone as well. Though, I'm not sure if the caller ID appears on the cellphone (it was my boss' cellphone and I wasn't brave enough to check), but I imagine the caller ID would come through on the cellphone as well. I also use Nomorobo with my Comcast/Xfinity account. It works really well and is available on many cable landline companies. It's free for landlines but they charge for a cell phone ($20/year for my iPhone app). I've also blocked numbers but Xfinity will only let you block 25 numbers. Go to nomorobo.com to set it up. You'll need your mom's Xfinity (or whatever her landline company is) account number or login info plus password. Just follow the directions on the website - it's fast and easy. She can answer after two rings. I found that once it was set up, I got fewer and fewer phone calls as time went by. Thanks! They keep phoning her & trying the same story. Luckily for us all, she doesn’t know how to log in. If possible, limit their phones to place and receive calls to and from only those on their contacts lists. They have a big Rolodex.	0
Taking my partners mother to a birthday party My partner is considering taking his 96 year old demented mother to his sister in law's 70th birthday. This is a really, really bad idea, yes ?More pressing concerns:1) Is she a flight/eating poison/stealing risk if unattended?2) Do some people still think she's capable of telling truth or executing contracts / promising things on someone else's behalf?3) Is her mobility ok, ability to move without hurting herself?4) Is she depressed/manic? She doesn't know where the hell she is, what she's doing their or that her mother and father, a son and husband are dead. I don't have any support or the means to purchase a bloody firearm. We have a nice home to move into very soon so it's been hectic.	0
"Working on software to monitor the health and location of your loved one through iPhone + Apple Watch - Would love your feedback. My aim is to solve the problem of a lack of visibility into your ageing loved one, as you can't always physically be there with them.&#x200B;Features include: - Emergency: A ""panic button"" they can easily activate by simply holding the Apple Watch crown and saying ""Mayday"" to Siri. This will send you an SMS + Email of their latest location and health data. - A dashboard to track health such as heart rate (active, resting), distance walked, energy burned (active + resting), steps walked, stairs climbed, sleep etc. - Location - Where are they right now? Where have they been? Is this something you would find useful and if so, what would you like to see from it?I liked an article I saw a few years ago that was a smart electric kettle that would send a text to a neighbor every time an old man in Japan pressed the button for water which he did often since he drank a lot of tea. They may not have the wherewithal to push a button. Or a wandering Alzheimer's patient that you need to track down?"	0
"Sorry if this has been asked before; I couldn't find a FAQ for the sub. My mom is almost 80 and lives by herself, and she has no interest in going into assisted living or anything like that. She gets around well enough, but age is starting to take it's toll. I was wondering if there are any sort of devices that are good for taking things up and down the stairs? Maybe some sort of mechanized pully system, so that she wouldn't have to carry it?Have you considered a ""stair lift"" aka ""chair lift""? My dad had a stair lift and it worked great but they are expensive e.g. $3500 per ramp. Upfront costs but maybe a contractor could do it nicely.Haven't tried this, but look up on the web for UpCart Stair climbing carts."	0
What is your experience with alert devices for falls? I am very worried about him as they couldn't pinpoint what it was.I heard about GreatCalls being around $15 a month after buying the device for a Keychain.Are there any of you that have experience and could share with this or similar products?He will likely never use it but what if he did? Seems like a small amount of money for someone I care about.It only works if they wear the device. Is the Keychain kind different? I don't think I could ever get him to wear a neck one.Aren't both just push a button and help comes? When they work, they really work. We had one on my dad and he did fall and immediately they were contacting us. If you can ensure he will wear it, it could really be useful. But I agree, if he isn't going to wear it, don't waste your money. My mom is very good about wearing hers, and they've helped with a couple minor incidents. We've also had a few false alarms, but we discovered they need to be worn inside the clothing. They swing too much outside, which triggers the false alarms My experience has been that I paid for MedAlert for about 6 months, credit card was stolen (unrelated) so I got a new number, forgot to update the billing info and never got a call, email or bill from them, a year later it still works and I haven’t paid a dime for it in that time. She hasn't fallen since she got it, thankfully, but hardly ever wears it now because it has sent several false alarms. When she pushes it, it automatically dials through three pre-programmed numbers you can enter until someone picks up. It puts the phones on pager automatically so you can talk with them.Downside is, the alert also triggers a kind of alarm that is a bit loud, and I put pendant in quotes because it is quite large to wear around the neck. We ended up tying it to my Grandma's walker. She only let us get this new one because she blacked out and had a fall and had to crawl through her house to get to a phone. They are great to have. My brother and I receive calls when she pushes it and medics have always come right away. The only downside I can see is it has a distance range which for her is ok and it is extremely sensitive.like when she has taken it off to shower it has been alerted. It’s a peace of mind for us tho knowing help is close by My dad is a veteran and got his for free, no monthly charges either. Vets or their caregivers or friends should check it out. I can’t remember the name of the company we’re using at the moment, but if you’re interested I can get it for you. Both activate a central box in the house and call an outside service.So far my grandmother has not needed her necklace, but if she were to fall and not be able to move, she can use it. So it’s been a big peace of mind for us. You can also press the button on the main box to call for help. I am interested for sure and would love the information. That sounds like a good service. I guess I wonder if it could replace the spot of a normal wrist watch. I found the company, it’s called Senior Safety. They have a website. (I have no idea if this is the best or only company, also...my aunt found this one and got it set up for my grandparents. )Unfortunately it’s just a button, not an actual watch. It has a Velcro strap that is remarkably secure. Also, they have a lockbox that allows emergency services to get into the house if the doors are locked (the service provides them with the code for the lockbox), but you can get those much cheaper from somewhere like Amazon.	0
Looking for recommendations Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice. My fear is that one day nobody will notice that shes left and we won’t be able to find her. The thing is that she always takes her purse with her, does anyone know of a GPS tracker that doesn’t need to be charged too often and works well, maybe that is compatible with an app. All suggestions are welcome. Thanks in advance!TILE works well. It's up and running 24/7, works for a year. It does work better in heavily populated techy areas, you might want to get a few (they're cheap) and see if it works as you'd like. I strongly recommend a perimeter fence you can lock, if you can afford it. We have definitely been looking at that, my fear is that if she feels caged in if she could get violent. Putting trackers on them might be an issue if they tend to take things off. At some point the fence wasn't just an option anymore. I think the GPS tile type tracker is a good idea. I don't know where you guys are and what the climate is like, but a missing senior with dementia is an emergency where I am, due to the snow/ice and extreme cold. The potential for falls/fractures/freezing to death is there.That said, on top of the GPS tracker, can you install a door alarm or something so that there is an alert when she is leaving? Does she have a medic-alert type of bracelet or something to help ID her (and her medical conditions) if she were to go missing and be found by a stranger or EMS/police? Do you have recent photos of her, as well as a good description of coats/hats/scarves etc that she might wear if she wanders? Medic alert works too. Also notify local police just to make them aware.	0
Is there a way to lock the Watch to his wrist?I would suggest registering him with your local police departments vulnerable persons registry. If wandering is a concern though it may be time to look into a secured care home for his safety. We’re looking at care facilities but they’re all so cost prohibitive. if you're interested in a good day program or hiring private caregivers, feel free to PM me for local resources! We’ve done a latch at the top of the door but he easily defeated that obstacle. My mother is retiring in a year and looking to sell the house to get a smaller condo so watching him is easier. You might be successful in finding a solution by searching for gps trackers for autism. He didn’t wear his winter jacket, which would be the perfect place to hide a tracker. if he takes a wallet or keys or something every time get a TILE tracker He has an iPhone but never takes or charges it.	0

money.Feel free to skim read, or miss out the intro (masses of context).&#x200B;Sorry if this is in the wrong place. I understand you all must have a lot on your plates but if anyone could relate to my situation and give any preventative tips it would mean the world. A bit of background. Half way through this she moved to the middle of nowhere for the only available council house. My brother since the age of 16 has had a steady decline, dropped out of uni, falsely (?) The past 10 years have been abysmal for my mum since she was distanced from her one purpose in life . By the time she needed serious care I'm sure I would be well established in my career and it wouldn't be an issue.HOWEVER. I have this dream of reviving my mother to the incredible vibrant an creative person she was before we went away, as a grandmother. She needs to find this for herself first or else I would be scared to leave her caring for my children. I would want her to live near me (big city) and not 3 hours away in the middle of nowhere. I am currently dating a man (52M) who sends me 750 every week. I have been saving 500 of this (2000 of 3000 a month) in the hope of being financially independent as soon as possible. Here are my questions:1) Should I focus on saving as much as possible so that in the next few years I could buy property and potentially move my mother in with me to break her out of the council house trap?2) Should I send my mother money each week so she has enough spare to pursue the zest of life again and get herself out of this mental hole so when the time comes she could be mentally capable to care for herself and her potential grandchildren?3) Should I settle down with this man, soon, be moved into a big house and potentially have a flat bought for me where I could move my mother? Risks - might not be in my name and if things were to go wrong I would have uprooted my mother from her security. Basic chores haven't been done since I was last here. Some more points:I sent her 150 to get her passport renewed so I could take her to Germany this Christmas to see her dying mother. Don't know where that went and still passportless.My brother is living in the same area as her but chooses to be blissfully ignorant. She has no idea about my current boyfriend - the age or the money. We aren't close. We know we love each other immensely but are unable to connect or talk. Sorry in advance.Hi. After trying my best to rescue my own mother for many years I’ve realized nobody can do anything for anyone if they don’t want it for themselves. Best to you! She does want help she just is unable to help herself. Maybe I’m trying to re-live her life and fulfil her dreams knowing I would actually be successful in some attempt to help her. I probably should try and figure out what I actually want in life, other than family. I sent her money for years and years, did everything I could to try and help her but no joy. I’m generally very self aware of my patterns but I need to figure out a way to actually want to break them and discover what I want as an individual - or is that even possible? Re. The money I’ve been super on top of saving and paid off all my debts. A lot of people define their existence by their work, and when there is no more work...well, it is as though there is no more life. Why? This advice is certainly the most difficult to follow through on, but I believe the most helpful in answering my question. Sometimes the hardest things to do are the right things. It means a lot that and you told me the truth I had been avoiding. You throwing your life at this problem isn't going to solve it. are tools to help your Mom get on top of it. Your Mom dug this hole, it's not your responsibility, and it's definitely not his. If he makes an offer, consider it, but just bailing your Mom out of this hole is not necessarily going to save her. You might also want to try to drag her to a financial advisor, because if she's on welfare and drowning in debt, and has a gov't provided housing, she might be able to get rid of her debt by declaring bankruptcy or something. Anyone? Fortunately you have being given money and abundance in this aspect. Therefore you have the ability to use these funds in the most effectual way possible. You never know how much time your mother has left here so, giving her and guarding her and whatever way you can without draining yourself it's probably the best course of action. I can give you my advice but I don't know your full situation. I think you already know the answer.If it were me personally, I'd  utilize and go with number two. I would also utilize the services available if you live in the United States of America from The Division of Services for Aging and Adults with Physical Disabilities. Estate can provide her let's transportation to take her to be around others like her, where she can draw, have people that help her with basic daily activities and visit her, engage and Musical and art therapy. If she is able to use a tablet you can find some good programs that will help her like Luminosity or others that could help her strengthen her mind. You can also with funds or money provide her with a healthy diet of nutritionally rich foods and things shown to Aid and mental and physical health. Not so much ones that Force you or her back into your child ego state, but when that bring you both into your adult ego state. We helped out with travelling home every so often to do cleaning and shopping, and helping with paperwork.	0
"Can we start a list of ""smart"" devices for the home to help one parent care for the other with dementia? My parents (one with dementia) are determined to stay in their home, and the addition of smart devices may help them do so safely. I was hoping we could start a specific list (i.e. links to devices) of smart home devices to help make their lives easier. Some general ideas include cameras to warn when someone may wander outside, smart plugs to turn off appliances when left on, tracking devices or fall monitors, monitors in the bathroom (that also allow privacy? ), etc... the caretaker parent is fairly tech savvy. Any ideas or previous experiences are welcome!An Alexa echo video device. - My parents leave phone off the hook accidentally a lot. And we are able to tell them to put phone on hook. Google has something too but you can’t just “drop in”. Tile mates - used Tile mates in all their keys to find them if they lose them in apt. GPS trackers work for anywhere but they are expensive to buy and maintain. August smart lock - It allows us to give codes to different workers and revoke them without worrying about keys. It also notifies our cell phones whenever someone opens, closes, locks or unlocks door. So if it looks like they are leaving at a time when they shouldn’t be, we can drop in on Alexa above and if necessary call security guard in their building. They’ve  never really left apt unexpectedly but others may be worried about that. There are many smart locks but this fits on existing interior deadbolt thumbturn. Smart plug - My mom was putting stuff in microwave in middle of the night that is not supposed to go in microwave. I just bought a smart plug to disable microwave at night and repower it in morning when we know my dad is awake and can watch her. Ideally looking for a way to control the range too since we’ve had some issues with both of them forgetting stuff on the stove. But can’t find any reasonably priced solution smart for something with that much power Safe - We put a basic safe in pantry where we can store important stuff like papers, I’d, meds. You can get smart safes that can be remote controlled from afar to give others access to stuff in there without giving them a pin. But we don’t need it yet. There are also smart locks that can be fitted into a drawer to make the drawer like a mini safe instead of getting a separate safe. Make sure the smoke and carbon dioxide monitors are working. Mainly because its not something that dies like GPS."	0
And looking for any options to deal with it. Long story:  My mum's mother passed away several years ago from (I believe) Vascular Dementia - we were told this is a hereditary type and more common in women? She can't organise herself (she used to run and manage a busy day care plus the household)&#x200B;She forgets things unless they're listed or on a calendar, she needs reminding multiple times where she's supposed to be or what she's supposed to be doing. She had to be hand held to every appointment, my dad had to take notes for her, she got lost in the clearly signed hospital and (armchair psychologist here) I'd say she had a full blown anxiety attack and anxiety for several weeks, she compulsively made lists, lost track of them, made them again and then fished the shredded pieces out of the bin when we threw them out, whilst getting angry with us. I went to one of the appointments with her and ....it was like taking my toddler, she just sat there quietly letting me explain these really intimate things to this GP, I felt awful and patronising, like I was stepping all over her. She just said thanks and could I text dad the details cause she'd already got a bit confused. About 4 weeks ago she finally started and we've been holding our breath hoping that this is the answer, the GP did say it should start working almost right away even if it takes a few weeks to go full swing. She has a follow up in a couple weeks. Last week we went away as a family together and the length of time we spent together made it really apparent there is still something wrong. It's to late for her to go back to work (her career credentials have expired and regaining would be like starting from scratch as it's changed so much in childcare) she has very basic IT skills (As much as I love her I wouldn't wish her on the office of my worst enemy!) And all of this is made harder by the fact all of us have full time jobs and I have a child to run around after as well. We will absolutely figure something out to run her where she needs to be if we have to, but regardless of intention and desire the fact remains we're all adults with families that also need care and time - luckily we all live about 3 miles apart! I don't know where to ask for help, I don't know how to get her to come get help, I can't even talk to my dad and sister properly because we're all skirting round the issue hoping the gel will work and she'll start getting back to 'normal'. I'm hoping to find some information about how I could approach an appointment to discuss this - should I make one for me alone (can I even discuss someone else in an appointment for me?) Are there any UK counselling services for this, or is going through the GP the best? Are there any things we could passively encourage her towards that might help her mentally in terms of activities/hobbies/clubs etc without her feeling to 'old' or 'helpless'?Take her to neurologist. I'd call the national dementia helpline. The dementia helpline will be able to give you information tailored to where you live. https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/get-support/national-dementia-helpline this is the national one, if you're in Scotland Alzheimer’s Scotland also has one Hi OP. Once they diagnose what is happening they will put you in touch with different resources. The Alzheimer's Society are excellent and will do home visits, offer advice and tips and help with planning. There are also numerous Carer's charities depending on where you are in the UK who can give you excellent advice and support. I want to make sure we don't let it go so far we regret not speaking up sooner... U.K. science suggests drinking silicawater rich in silicic acid helps remove neurotoxic aluminium from the brain associated with neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s	0
He's not answering any calls, which is unlike him, and the whole family is incredibly worried. Part of the problem is, he doesn't realize he needs help. Is there a discreet tracker they can use?It's a horrible situation for everyone and they're all overwhelmed and don't know how to proceed while maintaining the dignity of their parent. Any advice you can give would be helpful.Tracking is only possible if someone takes something with them. I know they have pet trackers that are smaller and less obtrusive, maybe slip them into something the person always takes with them.Outside of that, there's not obvious way. We also had my father's driver's license taken away, which was also difficult but we are very glad we did. This is in Canada BTW. It's hidden in the soles. Its a new product and probably expensive. But might give the family peace of mind. Devices like this bandage are specifically designed for situations like this to notify the family when he wanders so he doesn't lost in the first place! Sorry to hear about this situation-- I know its tough!	0
Advice on watches to track loved ones? My grandfather is currently in the early stages of Alzheimers. He is still living in a home with my grandmother, but we would like to purchase him something similar to a fitbit just in case. He currently wears a fitbit daily and charges it nightly. I am looking at an apple watch with a data plan, but didnt know if there were better options. He does not ever carry his phone with him so we need something outside of just phone trackingThere is a little device that can be put on a keyring/belt loop or carried in a pocket, it is basically a GPS tracker.For the life of me I can't remember what it is called. These are quite popular. They're popular, and they're used to find things but I don't think they're gps trackers, I'm pretty sure they use Bluetooth. It's late here (2.56am) so I will check my paperwork tomorrow however check these out.10 Lifesaving Location Devices for Dementia Patients - Alzheimers.net I’m going to be monitoring this post because I am in the market for the same thing for my dad for Christmas. I think he’d know if we got him a watch specifically for dementia patients or tried to place a tracker on him somehow (and both would make him upset).I will also let you know if I come across any good options! So far it looks like the new apple watch is the way to go. It also has some fall alert tech in on that looks pretty cool.It also has a find my watch feature you can set up for friends and family to ping if needed. We will pick up a cell data plan as well since he always forgets his phone, but never forgets his watch. My husband bought a Yepzon tracker for his mom to put on her keychain. I looked at a number of options and eventually we ended up getting Verizon's tracking watch for children. It is only about $100 and just a little per month on our bill. Not near as much as some that are specific to alzheimer's.Has time and some other options you can set alarms for things and call him on the watch.	0
"Are there any devices/services that only allow whitelisted numbers through and send everything else to voicemail? I need something that will automatically send any unknown, untrusted numbers to voicemail. Any ideas?On my cell I can put the phone on ""do not disturb"" mode and ""allow calls from contacts"". That would work, but you must be vigilant about keeping the contacts list current. IMO Should I Answer is the most updated and it has that option I can’t help with the landline issue, but we‘re having that issue with my dad’s iPhone. Any tips? Mom has been scammed a few times on the phone. We added the call forwarding options to mom's landline number and when no is around to over see her calls we have her calls forwarded to our house. iPhones can send all calls from numbers not in your contacts directly to voicemail. Set this up in Settings > Phone. Thank you!! They let you block entire area codes. Also look into NoMoRobo. Verizon has a call-blocking ap you can download for cells. I don't know about land lines. Check out the teleCalm service. Usually, they call me and relay messages as she won't touch the phone anymore. I believe the iPhone can now do exactly what you're asking:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099"	0
I got him a tomtom gps watch because it was waterproof and meant to have good battery and be quite resilient, but it only showed where he was whenever I could plug it into my laptop later- I couldn't find him if I ever decided to open the app and look. The watch broke within a year too because he's quite rough with watches I think.He's never been a phone guy but I purchased a phone for him and a band to wear it like a belt, a shockproof case, etc so that I could just keep the phone connected to my account and track him plus we could call or he could call in an emergency. Forget the smartphone and get him a cheap flip phone.At least with a flip phone, when it rings and/or vibrates, all your Dad has to do is physically open it  to receive a call...Not navigate the UI of whatever smartphone app/OS he is at the mercy of remembering. He’s pretty good about taking it and I always know where he is. Apple series 4 or above smartwatch - battery can  last 24 hours. Can act as a phone - very simple phone to use too. It will detect falls and also monitor heart rate for irregular heart beats (though apple doesn't say it will detect heart attacks or anything) - and then send you or your mom an alert. You can use apples find my friends to locate him with your phone.jiobit- Does he always wear the same jacket or belt?

Not a visit goes by without her calling back to ask if we have seen this or that which she thinks she has left behind. It could be an earring, a book, or a package of over $500 worth of fast food gift cards that they buy at the grocery store in order to rack up fuel discount points because they drive between multiple counties for their grooming, doctors, pet grooming, or to check their mail. )I never hear about anything until later. One picks up things, the other hangs onto information of all sorts. It's a perfect storm, and apart from the 2 homes, there is another facility that probably cannot even be walked into judging from the last building I saw that housed the objects of this profession.What do you do? It doesnt feel right to ignore it and push it all aside, but I am powerless to help. They do not want help and are dancing on the fine line between perfectly competent and questionable decision making.TL/DR: how do you cope with feeling responsible for parents when they want to live life differently than you would see fit, puts them at risk, but does not quite count as incompetent?I don't know the answer to this, but I feel your pain. And something bad will happen, it always does - financial loss, dementia, whatever. In the meantime, don’t let it drive you crazy. I also used an auto theft in the neighborhood to convince her to let me put a gps tracker on her car (so we could find it if stolen, when really it was to make sure we could find her if she got lost). I also convinced her to let me put security cameras in the house. These were ones that I could see using an app on my phone.	0
"Your opinion on some of these medical alert device commercials? This commercial comes on all the time on a channel she likes to watch so that we don’t even put the channel on anymore. I suppose maybe there are people out there who aren’t convince that an emergency alert device is necessary for their elderly loved ones and maybe this commercial is supposed to convince them? Do you remember or could you find out which company is running the ad? I would be interested in seeing it/digging around the company behind it. In fairness to them, it is a very serious problem and I guess they feel ""shocking"" the viewer into seeing the reality is their sales tactic. And I guess that’s what I figure too, either they genuinely want to make a point or they just want money. So it appears the commercial I’m referring to is from Life Alert Figures. Ew That's half the reason my mom with dementia is no longer allowed to watch television. Others in the memory care unit she's in still have televisions but mostly blast CMT or something neutral. Mom when she had a a television in another room played a lot of MeTV stuff and almost all of the commercials after 5pm are aimed at the elderly, including some of those disturbing ones."	0
Does anybody here use wearables (e.g. Apple Watch) to keep track of their loved one with Dementia? I just bought the 5 with cellular for my dad. He was just diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and he mostly needs help telling time (analog is hard for him) and an ability for us to keep track of him. Is there a good app for seeing where he is with the watch? I really like life 360 but it doesn't seem to be compatible with the watch. I don't like using apples find my phone feature as much as history isn't as easy to get.I use the watch with my dad mainly for fall detection. But thry seem to all have bad reviews and thry don't look good.Also, there are trackers who's batteries last for a week. We just use find my friends. Haven't really thought about history as much as just looking to see that he is where he is supposed to be. He was losing weight for a while and I didn't know if it was cause of not eating (it wasnt).Thanks. Can see his location 95% of the time. 🤨 I tried a couple of the cheap (>$100) watches and for both the GPS was always off, if you use the circle alerts, you may have a heart attack when you get a false alarm that he is 2 miles out.We went back to the phone, he likes it. He has an Android and we use this app Localizador Corcanoe https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=corcanoe.gps.tracker&hl=es it has been very good, more accurate than the watches, it has an out of range notification and since my dad doesn’t use much the phone battery last an entire day or two.	0
Christmas Gift Advice Hi; my dad has early onset Alz (diagnosed at 56, 5 years ago) and is still in the moderate stages. He’s still very aware of/embarrassed by his forgetfulness and challenges so I want to find something that isn’t too obviously designed for children, like some of the Alz “toys” I’ve seen. We have an Alexa system for him to listen to music and podcasts, but he’s had a lot of nervous energy lately and needs something to do with his hands. Thanks in advanceHave you heard of fidget blankets? Hope you find something that will work! My mom also has a fidget blanket which works great, but if you’re wanting something like that to carry around in public if he feels uncomfortable with the blanket, I would suggest a fidget cube. You can find one easily at Walmart or online, and it’s great for keeping my mom’s hands occupied with its switches and buttons. Definitely going to look into a blanket! Theyre very cute, not too expensive and could be engaging. Thank you!! my dad loves music and mentioned that he wants piano lessons.	0
Seeking At Home One Patient Caregiver Appl Hi Caregivers! Also, thank you for all that you do. It’s hard work with little thanks, but know that you are appreciated. My husband is the “House Manager” and caregiver for a close family friend who has MD. Our family friend is fortunate that he is able to afford 24/7 at home private care. We have also just hired two other people to assist with care. We need to monitor eating habits, water/other drink consumption, BM, daily mood/behavior and be able to communicate appointments, warnings and a daily general report. I’ve done some research and tried some caregiver tracking apps (CareZare, CareZone, CareCore, Carely, Care Angle & Capella Care), but haven’t found anything to meet our needs exactly. CareZare is exactly what we need, but it’s not well developed nor reliable. I was wondering if y’all had any suggestions or could refer an app. We would prefer to use an app vs paper log, just to streamline things. Anything is appreciated! They work with available schedules and provide both logbooks for the caregivers to make notes and communicate, plus an online app for recording incidents and checklists for each shift. They can also make notes for one another. If you get a social worker or case worker for him, they can help navigate a lot of the decision making and care. u/wife20yrs you should look into the platform AgileCare. They're still pretty early, but it was founded by people that grew up working with clearcare and understand the pain points :) I’m sure it is probably good, but I have to go with my agency’s app.	0

Does Alexa and other smart devices really work? With the added cameras so I can see what is going on, it has given both of us peace of mind. At first, she couldn’t remember the name, so I wrote it on a big card where she sits. Setting up reminders has been a help for me to tell her what needs to be done at certain times, like meds. My boyfriend and I purchased an Alexa and Google home mini for my mother who is diagnosed with dementia. She's 61 and we bought them before she moved in with us thinking she will be able to use it herself since it's voice commands. BUT if you download the app for either device you can control it from your phone. We have the Google upstairs for my mother and downstairs is the Alexa that we actually use. I use it for my mother for just music but since she can't work the TV remote it gives me some security knowing I can play music for her even when I'm not home. My mom has never been able to work them. We can also make announcements to her room (dinner's ready). I've thought about that too for my dad but this is a man who barely even understands his AOL email and there is no way he would figure out what Alexa is or what it can do for him.I have thought about getting it to use as a video monitor while I'm not home, where I can call him and talk to him if I need to (if he hears me, that's another issue!). Are there smart devices that have helped the caregiver? I'd like to get my elderly parents (mom has dementia) smart doorbells, smoke alarms, outlets, thermostat, etc... but only want to do so if it helps. My dad is fairly competent using android devices.	0
Hi everyone, I was hoping someone could recommend a radio for my grandmother. We bought her a radio but it has too many buttons and she has a lot  trouble tunning it to her favorite stations. We found a one button radio, but it's out or our budget ($100). I was hoping to find a decent radio with preset station buttons (preferably large buttons) . I was hoping someone on here had a good recommendation?Is Wifi available where your grandmother lives? It plays excellent music and no buttons. My mom has one and uses it for music. https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Rechargeable-Neodymium-Speaker-Automatically/dp/B07415WG1L/ref=sr_1_9?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI27ev-tiQ5gIVCtvACh0rEgsQEAAYASAAEgJ2DPD_BwE&hvadid=267948026588&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9027285&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=e&hvrand=3734980745988898742&hvtargid=kwd-304790733260&hydadcr=24627_9648891&keywords=radio+for+dementia+patients&qid=1575074290&sr=8-9 not sure if this would work but have a look. You could set it up for her to just ask to play music. My dad has PD and his voice fluctuates alot and his Alexa has a hard time with him. But you can even set her up an amazon prime acct and add her fav tunes to her playlist. I think some music channels tune to Christmas music at this time of year. I have Comcast Xfinity and it offers a wide range of music channels called Music Choice. The channels are within the 400 range and I was able to locate Sounds of the Season on channel 441 (the channel plays music that goes with the season, such as Christmas as this time of year). Experiment with this with your grandma and see if she likes it. Check out the Simple Music Player. It basically just has an on/off and a button for skipping songs.

"Dentures As my (28) father's (84) full-time, live in caregiver, I must admit, it's far less scary for me to hear him say,""Where's my teeth? Once, I found them stashed in a box of Oatmeal Cream Pies.Does anyone have any tips for keeping better track of said chompers aside from the impossibility of truly constant monitoring? (As I think all live in caregivers know, there's also a household to take care of in addition to a loved one and chores inevitably must be done during my dad's down times. Not to mention, we need time to take care of ourselves as well. I'm fumbling ungracefully throughout this entire process, but this particular thing is really wearing me down. Any help or humorous observations are welcomed. :)My solution is cheap web cams from Amazon. I don’t have a solution but as another younger caregiver, how do you find time for yourself? And assume they aren't being assholes deliberately but are not being mindful of your needs, you're dad's needs, and their actual contributions to his needs.You should consider taking online classes that would allow you to work towards a degree online while you are your dad's primary caregiver. In home caregivers make real money. This puts you in a pickle! You also need regular breaks that do not have you worried about him while your are gone.How are bills paid and groceries bought? I’m not sure what to do. First few weeks were a night mare, me hired someone to help during the day, but nights and weekends became hell.From the get go I did my best to avoid getting my kids involved, they are young adults with a life ahead. The thing is we now seldom go out by ourselves together which mis hard. [deleted] Hang in there, also do take a look at CBD, ketone diets and coconut oil. I bought like 5 and leave them around the house. No real help, but know you're not alone. She's completely lost all her recent pairs and only has one way out of date pair, and *coincidently* has been complaining of headaches... gee, I wonder if it's from wearing out of date prescription glasses?? Not much can be done in our case, other than order a few new pairs and hope she doesn't hide/throw them out immediately. Caregiving is tough and can feel very unappreciated, but know you're doing your dad a great service and it's a true act of love :) [deleted] No solution, but hoping for an answer....we are in a similar situation. I paid 2K for a dental bridge for my mom that got lost 2 days after I paid the bill. I have searched the room a couple times, but no luck.One of those ""What was I thinking"" moments!"	0
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia We are a team in MIT Hackathon and we were interested to ask what are your thoughts on wearable glasses for patients with dementia? Is this something  the caregiver community would be interested in?For what? What we really need is something to help caregivers not burn out, and solid support staff. If you design anything, how about a system for police to know when the raving elder they're trying to corral is just demented, not coked out and dangerous? The gadgets and apps are like watching a movie when you have appendicitis. That's great and all, but what we need is real solutions. More apps targeted toward CAREGIVERS: addressing behaviors, bathing tips, etc. would be great. A device to help locate misplaced items, such as glasses would be beneficial. Simple locators to attach to devices would help early onset people with dementia and caregivers. Except the milk and butter. So I know where to look for the TV remote Glasses would not be viable as they lose them often. I lost several pairs of my own sunglasses to my dad pilfering them somehow from out house. What is the purpose of these wearable glasses? (What is their purpose?? There is little chance someone diagnosed with dementia will tolerate wearing new eyeglasses for any purpose, no matter how useful they may seem from the outside. My mum has been short sighted and worn glasses since she was 7 and she has lost 23 pairs of glasses in the last 6 years. Her current main set is yet to be located today... Dad was still wearing a wristwatch for a while and that could have been a useful place for a tracker? The most useful wearable device would be better tracker options. We just can't find a tracker that we think my mum would actually WANT to wear and on every occasion when she has properly gone missing she didn't take her phone with her so we couldn't even track that. If there was an actually attractive necklace, bracelet or brooch that she would really like that would be way better. Glasses usually get lost or get stepped on. A device that a senior would wear as a necklace or such is much easier and maybe no accidents would occur with that device.	0
They want me to get him some sort of GPS tracking keychain / necklace etc. If he has an iPhone and you want more into on how to set it up let me know.My mom was/is extremely resistant to wearing any kind of tracker or life alert system which is very frustrating, but luckily she carries her iPhone around. We installed the life360 app on my mothers phone. It's a pretty easy set up. We have been ok with the free version so far. I don't know if the paid version is any faster.We are still interested in having something else as a safety net. Maybe something that pairs with her phone that would alert her and us if she left the house without one or the other? We got a tracker for my FIL that we put in his shoe. Argh)  The most important thing is for it to always be on him.	0

"We live in the same house, which is split. My Grandma has a basic apartment to herself as she is still able to manage herself to a degree. We have gone through quite a few of each. A flip phone with basic tech to big buttoned land lines. She cannot grasp how technology works anymore. There's more to my grandma's fading world, but right now my focus is on tech. has Alexa or an echo worked, something that requires no pushing of buttons as she has a light touch and claims to press buttons but ends up turning the phone off in the end. She had a little list of who was at each number. She just insisted that she have it in her purse. She has her sister and decades old friend she talks to in another state. Along with making appointments for herself and talking to a local friend or two from the local synagogue, and talking to the family Jewish center.It wouldn't be so bad if we could just hook a phone up to an automated system that just responds to her calls, but she's still capable of calling and talking to people. "" If she is actually trying to telephone someone, perhaps try a product like this https://www.alzstore.com/memory-picture-phone-p/0030.htmIf it's more about seeing / believing that she has a phone, but not actually using it to make calls, maybe get an old rotary phone?I'm sure an amazon echo or Google home could have the ""talk only"" functionality that you are looking for, but depending on her cognition, she may not be able to use the tech or even identify the tech as ""a phone"" regardless of how many times she is told or how detailed written instructions are.Good luck She does try to call people. She has her sister and decades old friend she talks to in another state. It wouldn't be so bad if we could just hook a phone up to an automated system that just responds to her calls, but she's still capable of calling and talking to people. The phone you linked is one we have not tried. I will pass along the info, ty.Edit: added words What about an intercom with the button labeled as CALL DAUGHTER? Have you tried a simplified phone, such as the Jitterbug Phone? Whatever phone you choose, make sure her contact list is limited to only a few numbers:  the people & numbers she would most need.Updated thoughts:   Does she know how to use Siri? We actually got the jitterbug last week and she's still having issues with it. If i recall there's a total of 12-13 numbers on the phone. This is all quite so daunting. I've taken the time and read through some of the posts on this sub and have a slightly better understanding of things to come and the patience required. Tons to think about, this is quite the journey. Check out Teepa Snow's videos -- they've been so helpful for us."	0
"Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids My mother is in her early seventies and my dad is in his late sixties. I want to help them, they dont want to help themselves and it's really shitty. Keep a safe distance I wish I would have. My wife and I actually bought a condo for her mom to live in about 10 years ago, and part of the discussion was that a cheap condo is probably cheaper than a murder charge. It's only about a 5 minute drive away, but that's far enough.

My Father managed his early dementia for 9 years until he had a stroke.Repeating questions is completely normal dementia symptoms. My Father now ask me what time is it every 10mins.If possible make a video of her daily routines so she can watch and follow along. Get a clear big clock with the date, time & month on it . She already has a pillbox separated into days, but I'll get her one with an alarm as someone else suggested. Have her set up a health care proxy NOW. I'll also buy a few binders and a big calendar so she can organize herself better. Thanks for your help	0

I'm looking for feedback on an idea: A wearable arm band for chemo patients that will constantly monitor body temperature and alert the wearer, carers and medical staff if their temperature rises above safe levels. As those of you who are caring for people undergoing chemotherapy are probably aware, if they have a fever they need to get to an ER within an hour.I'm currently completing a startup weekend to make an armband that will monitor temperature and alert the user AND send a notification to nominated carers and medical staff should a fever occur. We are hoping some feedback from other carers about our proposed product, Temp-Band and whether it would be useful to you and your loved ones.We would love, love, love some opinions from Doctors, Patients and Carers.A survey can be found here: https://forms.gle/hsgG3y1ty6ZaJwvA8 This post has been removed.

What home automation-based applications can be developed to help those with neuromuscular diseases or their caregivers? However, with the large amount of home automation software (like Echo) available now, what can be done to help them? What applications or systems can we design which can be used by the patients to make their own lives easier? We are a group of students who want to create something in this area to see if we, or someone with more expertise, can create a better world.Context -> Problem Statement -> Who are weContext: There are numerous people around the world who have some form of neuromuscular disease. These are everyday people with everyday needs, but sometimes they are unable to make use of the solutions that are available. Different solutions – less physically challenging ones – are needed to help them. Some use cases are listed below but please don't limit yourselves to them.One potential use case could be to help patients with their progressive loss of autonomy in completing daily task, such as by having robotic arms help them carry out specific tasks like pull up a blanket.Another use case could be in the area of using home automation software to provide entertainment for the patients who can no longer do so themselves. Recently, we were looking for a problem to solve for a startup program. While we realised we didn't have the experience in this area yet, we were ready to move on. However, we realised that there are communities on reddit who have either the experience or expertise (or both)! Hence, we are trying to see if we can tap on the collective smarts of intelligent subreddits to come up with solutions to more bespoke problems. The bottom line is that we are trying to find ideas which can be developed. If we can't take the solution forward, hopefully students and entrepreneurs in that particular field can come across it when searching for problems and see if they can take it forward.We truly appreciate the time you've taken to read and the input you provide :)This post has been removed.

"Yesterday I stopped by (he's still alone for now) because he was having computer troubles -- on the phone he said he kept trying to do Bank of America and Yahoo but ""no sound was coming out."" When I got there the internet was out (was he remembering dial up?). My dad was the handiest guy around  up until recently -- way more competent than I'll ever be -- and it's been hard to keep him involved with projects at the condo, especially when I'm learning as I go. At least he can help me pick stuff out. In his few words, he offered me guidance on choosing one -- plastic vs. wood, cheap vs. pricy, etc. We settled on a mid range seat, $20 with tax. Next stop was his house for a wrench. We needed to remove all the seats at my mom's and I, being a complete beginner and all, didn't know what to expect. His basement is full of tools and he didn't really know where to look anymore, but we made it work! On to the third seat -- this one turned out the best of all and he did it entirely by himself."	0

My siblings were never really present in caring for her or keeping track with her doctors, medicines, disease progression, etc. So it all fell on me and my husband while we were both still working full time at our regular jobs plus part time school for my husband.The first year was tough. Took her to support groups, outtings with people from her exercise classes, etc. We hired a private caregiver to help take mom to her exercise classes and to give her companionship. My husband and I couldn't recognize who we were anymore. I'm glad to say that my siblings have stepped up a bit. I'm still handling the administrative side of her things, like benefits, doctor updates, paying her bills. To do what IIII wanted to do. And the other half that knows better not to go there. I look at pictures of me and mom over the last 3 years... And it hurts to see that we took fewer and fewer together as time went on. I still don't know who I am. Being her caregiver was such a large part of my identity, that I feel incomplete now. Pretty sure you have lost the intimacy and comfort that you used to have with one another. Two hours away is not impossible for visiting purposes so you can see your Mom and your siblings for visits. Especially about being patient with myself.Definitely trying to find a way to rebuild my relationship with my husband. But since we saw mom declining, we wanted her to be able to enjoy our wedding and express herself, so we chose to have it that same year. My last visit was just about a month ago, and I purposely wanted to put more time and space between the visits because we still had so much friction. BnB near the beach? Hiking Trip? Please do stop by /r/Parkinsons as we appreciate caregivers inputs. 2.5 hours later I crossed the finish line. Hey, if you are close by I'd love help stuffing about 100 of the Aware in Care kits. We're trying to plan a camping trip in November.Rock Steady Boxing are the exercise classes that mom went to! We're in San Diego, CA. There's one in the same county as her assisted living home, but in Los Angeles traffic, it'd be ridiculous getting her there with her med schedule working on time, etc. It's not as high intensity as Rock Steady, but she says it still works her out.It's great to hear how active you are! This year is was a long road trip and got to enjoy Glacier National Park. I had been as a kid, but first time for my son and had a blast!I'm the youngest of six, so I can relate how hard it was when Mom went into assisted living. So I'm still trying to figure it all out. I'll look into it! Everything from quilting to Tai Chi. I'm lost and confused as well.. All I can recommend is therapy.	0
"It's always been difficult but even more so now she lives alone since my father passed in spring of this year. She writes EVERYTHING down so the house is a wreck of scattered papers, and she has a hard time remembering appointments and keeping track of her belongings.I'm just looking for advice on how to get started with this. I live near her now but may not always, plus it's absolutely exhausting checking in on her all the time and it's put a strain on our relationship. Any advice on how to start this process and what to expect cost-wise would be really helpful.We found steno pads to be helpful because at least the papers are held together in one place. As far as check-in in on her , get her internet and a wifi router then setup an Alexa echo show 5 ($64)  in the home, so you can ""intercom"" from your mobile device, as well as setup her reminders and alarms and have the echo announce the information...Of course  at some point  you still will need a person to provide caregiver services as.the dementia progresses This is actually a great idea in the interim. I guess I see ads where people can just use it to pop in on their loved ones. You can get people from $15-$25 per hour depending on your market. Care.com is a good place to start. They can often provide help for certain things (sometimes income based.) My mom (no impairments,  just poor) was able to get some maintenance done on her house at no charge. They can usually point you to other resources as well. There are several companies that provide in home help note. They can help with cooking,  cleaning,  personal hygiene and companionship. Pretty much everything but meds.And try to be patient with her."	0
Were able to get passes for my father to walk her to gate and me to meet her at gate, direct flight. Inviting all the friends I have she's wanted to meet and making her a super spread of foods she likes... this could be the stupidest thing I have ever done, or make her tickled pink... My living room looks like a bomb went off in Macy's but I don't care, organize away. The birthday party sounds like a great idea. Have a great time. I don't know how some of you do it without a camera or two to peek in a few times a day. My father isn't even that bad and a few cheap wyze cams have been an incredible piece of mind.

The problem is that it was really sudden, before he was active, healthy, walked about 4-5 miles a day, and it was a sudden change for him, they told him he would be at work by August approximately, so he’s down about that, he started gardening, which is harder now it’s not growing season anymore, he also tried cooking but he loses track a lot and I’m scared of him leaving the oven on or something, and he gets really disheartened when something doesn’t work, I just need suggestions for something he can do with a short attention span, and doesn’t involve walking around or using too much energy, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading this far!! That might be something to pass time, sanding & glueing the pieces. Hugs from Florida. This is really helpful, thank you so much I really appreciate this, I’ll look into this stuff, hugs back from England Get him a keyboard and find him piano lessons on YouTube. It looks pretty cool and could be a great party trick. Some adults I know are against it as being too kiddy. He could set up a coded scavenger hunt for you/people.Organize photo album or documents in storageGet him into meditation/reading/podcasts Those are really great ideas, thank you so much! !	0
She calls me and she comes over a lot seeking my help for things that most adults would generally know. For example, today she called me saying that she couldn't figure out why her phone bill didn't get paid when she's on auto pay. I cannot help her anymore because I am expecting a little boy in February and it's taking away time that I need to get ready for his arrival. What can I do?Its hard to say just from your statement about potential disability. Have you seen the story about Kevin?Hopefully there are apps or other methods she can use to keep track of things. Maybe a life coach? I'm about ready to go into her phone and text her brother to let him know what's going on because I think she needs to be in either a group home setting or in Assisted Living of some other type. If her family isn't willing to help, you may have to step up and attend doctors appointments with her to see what can be done. Your county (if in the US) could help with assessment through Adult Protective Services, or some other outreach program similar. I think I will call Adult Protective Services because I can't help her anymore. As I said in the post, I am preparing for the arrival of a baby boy in February, possibly January and it's getting close to that. We’re going through the process with my brother. We hope he’ll be eligible for housing benefits soon. Like one time, I forgot what she wanted at the store, like one thing and she completely went off on me like it was this huge crisis. So much hostile affect and silent treatment from this guy. And yeah I've called her brother this morning after I got the number off her phone last night and let him know what was going on with her. He said he's going to come down and take her to a doctor to get evaluated and if it's found that she cannot live alone that they are going to take her back to New York with them so at least I know that she'll be getting some kind of help. Do any of these symptoms seem to fit for her? Like I had to sit down with her and figure out what her income was so that I could create a budget for her every month and pay her bills on time so that nothing got disrupted. There were a few times that I had to come help her out because her electric had gotten shut off due to her not paying it on time. She couldn't get the money back unfortunately. Call aps but also call your community of mental health. Cause no one can do nothing without a diagnosis. Maybe they can get her in a sip home. First step would be to get things ruled out by her doctor like a health issue. Many times there programs that help people maintain there independence by helping them develop skills. Sometimes you can find them through your states developmental disability agency, the public library or community colleges.This could help remain independent while building the skills through programming and therapy to allow her to  manage her finances and social interactions.I personally believe her diagnosis doesn’t matter the support she needs remains relatively the same. Thanks I will look into that and tell her brother about it	0

It's not 100% confirmed yet. I know I shouldn't be getting upset before the tests have even confirmed things but in the past six months I've watched my finally healthy wife suddenly decline to barely functional, with now a potentially terminal illness, and I'm at a loss for how to keep my wits about me and keep pushing on. I'm used to chronic illness, but this potentially terminal stuff is out of my league and I need advice.> I've tried looking for caregiver support groups in my area but they're all during business hours and I can't make it to them. This is the toughest spot you can be in; there are no silver bullet answers. Call Social Services and see if she is eligible for any programs, whether in-house or in assisted living facilities. I don’t know how many family members are helping with grandfather’s care but it may be time to reach out to see if anyone can help you two out? And amazingly, we did. Don't be afraid to ask for help from any and all family. People are out there who will help you. Please let them know you need them.	0
You start with a premise that herbs cannot be used to treat Alzheimer's disease, and then dismiss all evidence to the contary as junk science. Most of these items have proved to be worthless in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. IMHO, the only thing which may be preventing the abolition of Alzheimer's disease is the mental inertia of scientists, as well as the bureaucrats who fund them. Unfortunately, the human trials have all shown that targeting it at all the stages they have tried does not change disease. These large scale trials have also failed.When I read that meta-analyses of evidence around a hypothesis is inconclusive, I certainly don't dismiss it out of hand. My problem is that you discuss your relatively fringe theory as basically settled fact to a lay-patient population using jargon-filled posts to legitimize yourself while promoting unproven and potentially harmful herbal remedies.I would love it if Alzheimer's could be effectively treated with aromatherapy, or CBD, or essential oils, or anything else that is readily available. The linked blog is a great summary of the current work on EMF and AD research.	0
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets? She is 58.. Mostly in good health.But recently she fell and hurt herself in her apartments basement parking lot. Or at worst case notify emergency services?It's called Life Alert. I'm sure there are a few different companies that do this, but my grandmother had this one. If no one answers then they automatically alert emergency services. I'm sure they can save your info as an emergency contact...that way if they do get a hold of your mother they can determine the severity of the situation. Best bet would be to contact a couple of these places to see how far their landline coverage would extend. I think Verizon has an emergency medical alert, but there again you run into the no cellular service issue. Wish I could be more help on that. How close is her apartment to the basement? You could try getting a WiFi booster that would reach the basement. A few suggestions, but none are simple:Ask the building owner and see if they'll add something for safety, like install a cell signal booster (it might be a liability if someone fell and died in the basement because they had no cell service to call for help)Make friends with someone on the first floor, get their WiFi password, and then see if you can put a mesh router in the basement that would pick up on their WiFi signal so that your mom could use that when she was down thereDoes she own or rent? My grandmother's  single story house has two steps into the garage and they've been a nightmare. Also, move her some place accessible - my grandmother lives in a fairly remote retirement community in NJ, so she has to rely on expensive taxis because there isn't much public transportation. Plus, it snows, and since she's isn't near i-95 (largest highway on the east coast), it isn't like we can drop in to say hello while we're driving by on a road trip. If you can move here somewhere near you, that's ideal - it would make our lives so much better - but you probably can't commit to living in the same town for the next 20+ years, so just try to make it a place that isn't hard to get to. [deleted] The cell booster is a great idea. If you are so inclined, you might offer to buy it and donate it if they would install it. Sell it on the safety merits and you're surprised they don't already have one. I assume you dont live in that same complex. There are devices you can get if there is someone within say 100 feet. I live with my dad and got him a small wireless dorrbell. he puts one around his neck, the reciever is in my room and is quite loud. It works by wireless, i believe 2.4ghz. Got it on Amazon. I dont know of anything other than Life Alert of that kind. What about something using satellte technology? If you cant find anything try this....if theres a college close or just email one with an engineering dept and present your problem and see what they say. can also try an engineering firm. Might also try a communications company. Cellphone boosters...would be a good idea for the landlord to put these in, in the event someone does fall or is sick or gets attacked. It is placed on the upper perimeter to boost the signal to the outside world.WiFi-calling, which doesnt rely on the cellphones usual signal, if the basement has wifi coverage then try her phone using the wifi instead of the usual signal. You would need to check the coverage all thru the garage.Just thinking out loud. If they make a emergency call box that people could just dial from their phone, 911 call. I would start by getting a cell repeater for the house. Its a plug in device that  boosts all cell signals in the area. Then get a smart watch, so she can monitor it herself. There are devices she can have put on her by her doctor that will monitor he heart rate, if the doctor thinks it is necessary. It will usually come with a wireless unit in the house that will call someone.	0

Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4 Hi, appreciate your input. He has used an iPhone 4 since 2013... probably not going to get him to upgrade now! My problem is — it seems like the majority of the tracking or call screening apps that might be useful for me to put on his phone are no longer compatible with iPhone 4. Ever since I read about the EKG reading and the fall monitoring component, I have wanted to see if it could help the geriatric community. I was able to get my hands on an iPhone 6, and despite some initial problems, he seems to be doing fine with it. The fact that it’s new and shiny helps a lot, and I was able to remove most of the newer features that would cause him trouble. Seconding what the other commenter said - would you consider upgrading to an iPhone SE? Have you tried Life360? I used that app with my mom and she had an iphone 4 (or maybe 5?). alternatively can you share his location with you using find my friend.	0
New here and still trying to figure out what I need to do. I had it ringing at home AND my cell but disabled the ability to receive calls at home since the other day she answered a call from a scammer and gave out her medical information. Fortunately the doctors office alerted me when the scammer called there trying to elicit information.When I asked my wife about the call she didn't remember what she told the scammer.On one hand I hate to block the phone completely (I also screen all her email) but I don't want what happened the other day to happen again. Our utility has a device that can be installed on the electrical panel that allows you to monitor the electrical system and see what devices are being turn on and off. Designed as a tool for monitoring expenses but I'm using it as a safety tool to make sure the stove/oven gets turned off if I'm not around.Any suggestions or should I just let things be as they are with calls all coming to me? She was still able to make calls though and we left a sheet with friends and families numbers beside the phone. My Mom is going nuts this afternoon. Scammers keep calling but of course she doesn't think they are, they're checking to see she's home to come get her, they're this, they're that... the only problem with completely re-routing calls is she has family and friends that do call to drop by, or take her out for lunch etc., and would want her to get those. If anyone knows, would be grateful for the the answer. (At least that we could find at the time) But I think I remember seeing a TMobile plan or something that would only ring if certain numbers were calling. It depends on your phone and carrier. I'm using Comcast for a landline and you can block all or block up to 25 numbers total. We also use a free service to block spammers (nomorobo.com).Cell phones (at least my iPhone) has the ability to block everyone except your Favorite contacts or your address book. It's a land line. She has a cell but was never very good at it and now forgets how to make a call on it at all most days.	0
"He's been losing his phone a lot lately. I have Find My iPhone on his phone, and we're usually able to locate it...however that doesn't work when he forgets to charge it and it turns off. So I just bought him a bungee tether for his phone so i'll be attached to his pants and he can't lose it. I would like to get a tracking app for his phone that is a little more sophisticated than Find My iPhone. Something that will have a more specific location tracker, something that has a ""geo-fence"" that will let me know when he has traveled outside of a particular area. Preferably something that my mom can patch into and see where he is, or if she forgets, it'll tell her if he's not where he's supposed to be. Also, and I don't even know if this is possible, something that would allow me to patch into their phone and either use the mic to hear what's around or the camera to see what's around, in case we really can't find him. I know there are good kid tracking apps, but I don't have kids, so I don't know what they are. An app that I would recommend is Life 360. You can create a “circle” and that shows where the family member is, shows trip history if they were to go somewhere, and even shows their batter percentage so you can remind him to plug it in if you notice he’s getting low. You can set up notifications for when he leaves and arrives and destinations. I will look into that. The peace of mind it's given me since putting it on my parent's phone is worth all the hassle getting him to allow it. My parents can't even remember how to use their basic flip phones. They've given up even charging them. Setup nomorobo on the home phone and she’s not happy so many people “hang up”. My 76 year old mom has had an iPhone for quite a while and does pretty well with it - and she still works, with kids, and isn’t shy to ask one of them for help. IMO, you want more than a phone tracking app if he's forgetting his phone. I suggest something like the GPS tiles, where you can put one on his car keys, in the car, in the sole of his shoe, in the belt he always wears, etc, and then any time one of them goes outside a certain range, you get your alert. The other option is to put one on him obviously (like a necklace or bracelet) so that he has something to ditch if he wants to get away and he doesn't look for the other one(s). Many years ago - early 80’s when my mom was alive with Alzheimer’s we had military style dog tags on her with our address and phone. It was what we had to work with and it helped to keep her safe. https://blog.caregiverhomes.com/the-50-best-gps-trackers-for-seniors Find My iPhone is pretty much the best you can get from a phone perspective. It has lower level device location access that most apps won't. Other apps probably offer better GPS location features.For better reliability, you'd have to find a non-phone based device with much longer battery life. Garmin (and I'm sure others) make devices intended for being out in the wild with battery life's of 90+ hours. It'd be another device, but something that you could find him with.Have you considered case with an integrated battery? For when the phone is lost/dead, I use a Tile on my grandmother's phone. Works great! You can also get solar cases that Habe little solar panels on the back so it’s being passively charged even if he forgets to charge it"	0

Using smartwatch/fitness tracker for GPS tracking? My dad hasn't started wandering yet, but we have reason to believe he will as the disease progresses, so we'd like to get some sort of device for tracking his whereabouts. I know there are devices out there specifically for elderly patients, but he's still young (he has early onset) and he's really particular about style when it comes to watches (lol) and if it's too clunky or unattractive, he won't wear it. There's an abundance of good looking smartwatches & fitness trackers on the market these days, so I was wondering if anyone had used something like that for tracking loved ones (vs a device specifically made for an elderly dementia patient)? Thanks in advance!In time he will forget to put on his watch. She doen't leave the house without them, so I feel comfortable knowing if she leaves the geofence, I get notified and can watch it on a map where she's going/has been. The battery could be better, but the device is tiny so it's not too big.	0
Preparing my mother's house for Father's progression of Alzheimer's Just curious if anyone had any advice for medical devices that may be of great help when dealing with Alzheimer's. My father is in his mid 70s and had his diagnosis 5 years ago. He is starting to become incontinent, and has frequent dizziness and gait issues now. So far I'm assuming we have to make their shower wheelchair friendly, toilet handles, the reclining  sofa chair that helps you get up. Also looking into getting a hospital bed as right now he sleeps in a king size and will be a lot of laundry and linen changing for my mother to constantly be doing. Also does Medicare or insurance cover these items as long as the Dr writes a script? Any advice would be very appreciated! For the bed, you can buy material, by the yard, for his bed that is almost indestructible. It has flannel on each side and rubber in the middle. You can cut it to size and you can have several of them. Take the burner knobs off the stove, hide the car keys,  put slide locks extremely high or low on the doors (where he wouldn’t think to look). I will look for this type of bedding. Is it something I can find at Joann's? They have baby and toddler grandkids that come over frequently so a lot of their things are safer and they have minimal furniture. Any door locks recommended for basement door? I was thinking of changing out the handle because my mom is on the shorter side. Also think about helpful items for eating and deinking. Plates with 90 angle sides to help get food onto spoon or fork. Tumbler cups with lids and straws...., the sliding bathtub chair was super helpful for my Mom. And if you have hardwood floors, rugs or hallway runners for high walking areas. Also find whatever he is interested in and get a lot of it. We also child proofed the cabinets and appliances. It's scary but once you see that's the only way to get the bed and accessories without going bankrupt. It may vary state by state, but for my wife medicare (through hospice) paid 100% for a hospital bed, shower chair, disposable underwear, moistened wipes, lotions and soaps, waterproof pads (to put on couches, chairs...) 3x5 foam pad for the floor in case she fell out of bed, and all of her meds.Basically anything the hospice nurse decided would be useful would show up the next day.If you haven't gotten a referral for hospice yet, do it tomorrow morning. Bi didn't think those type of things would be available for him at this stage. The main nurse we had said she's had patients on hospice for over 2 years. Please let me know how it works out. Thank you, will do!	0
Internet for Respite Care Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but my grandma is going to be in respite care for a few weeks and loves to use internet on her iPad. Any suggestions on the easiest way to do this for a short time? Her ipad is wifi only but we could borrow a cellular ipad if that's easiest. Any tablet plans, cheap internet packages, or rocket stick type devices that you recommend? Thank you so much for any help.Hi, if you tell us what country you are in, that would help! I could make some suggestions, but I’m from Australia and don’t know where you are! Sorry, Canada.	0
Help finding a good tracker in case my relative wanders ... Hi r/Alzheimers ... we were recommended recently to look into a tracker for my relative who is slowly progressing with Alzheimers. We have no intention of doing this without her consent which, apart from times when she becomes a bit lost, we feel we can still obtain. Trouble is, the devices I have found online are very  expensive, or cheap and not well regarded. Does anyone have any advice to offer about these tools?Thanks for any thoughts.All the GPS devices require charging every 1-2 days - does your relative live with someone who can do that for them?If someone can charge the device/ We like this but it runs on a 2g network, which will be discontinued in Canada next year. https://www.amazon.ca/Canada-Portable-Tracker-tracking-personal/dp/B06ZYKT4BP Thanks ... A battery that could handle a longer charge wouldn’t be as inconspicuous/easy to just clip on their house keys, purse, or belt. They have to update location via GPS so that’s a big drain - even if you set it to one update every minute, it’s still a big drain. )If the relative is alone, do they have PSWs coming in? If so, are they government PSWs or private? A private PSW coming in daily might be willing to charge a device. You could buy two and swap them out. I'm looking for something too, in fact I posted this a few days ago:https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/d1h11s/seeking_recommendations_for_tracking_watch/ See my post to check out the device I did order but sent back because it required 2G network connectivity which not a lot of networks support. I haven't tried a second device yet.Someone on my other thread recommended the GizmoWatch from Verizon, but the reviews aren't very inspiring. One of the reviews mentions something called a GizmoGadget, which must have been the previous version of the GizmoWatch.Have you asked whatever specialist helps your affected relative? You can use a cell phone for tracking. Even a flip-phone can be tracked. That way there is a better chance the tracker will be carried and kept charged. How can a flip phone be used for tracking? She's expressed interest in learning how to ride the bus or on going on walks. I have both my parents flip phones on my Spring account and I can track both of them.	0
Location tracker that isn't obvious? Hi all, My nana has advancing dementia but at the moment she is still self sufficient and lucid.My grandfather passed away last week and we are concerned as she has gotten much worse with the stress of his passing and cant remember that he has died and is calling everyone convinced he is either still in the hospital or has left her :(My mum is worried she may wander off, at the moment someone is staying with her every night but she has a few hours during the day where she is alone.We previously gave her a Tile as she was misplacing her keys but she took it off. We now want something we can low key put in her purse that she won't notice in case she goes missing as she always carrys her purse on her. Is there such a thing?We are looking into care options (UK) but she threw the poor nurse out of the house a few months ago that was supposed to be helping with meds and doesnt want strangers in the house. Short term any tips on keeping her safe/ keeping an eye on her in a non invasive way appreciated?Can you put the tile in the inner zippered pocket of the purse? Hey thanks for your help. The tile doesnt work from a distance I dont believe? We would need something we could check remotely on an app as we are a 20 min drive away. Ideally something that could slip in like a credit card. She does have a cell phone but she never takes it unfortunately. She also doesnt have wifi in the house so need something gps wise. Have you looked into putting the Alzheimer’s locks on the doors leading outside? My aunt bought my grandparents fitbits and made them seem like it was to track their health/exercise, etc. Didn't even tell them that it was possible to track. I'm not sure how much money you're willing to spend, and it may not be the best idea since it's something she could easily take off or could lose battery. You can put a Tile in her purse. They sold her house, and that's how they've been able to afford the expense. There are bracelets specifically for this. Difficult to take off, and has alarms if too far from home base	0
"Seeking recommendations for tracking watch Hello, my father in law has Alzheimer's and things have reached a point where my mother in lawdd has asked for my help in finding a watch for him to wear. I've done some research and ordered one device from Amazon that turned out to only work on 2G mobile networks which AT&T has deactivated. I'd rather not get something that is an expensive wearable that is geared more toward active people and is too focused on counting steps and heart rate and such.Has anyone here had experience with this or recently bought one that they ended up really liking? At a bare minimum we would want something that looks like a normal-ish digital watch and has the time on the front display. The primary purpose would be to have something that has a companion app that other family members could use to track him on their phones if he wanders off (god forbid), both android and iphone. Extra features like being able to call the watch or listen in on it remotely through the app would be nice, but aren't a must.The one I already ordered and had to send back because it wouldn't work on the cell network (it was 2G) was this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GRZQ6SK/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_C1wDDbSJP80V7The ones that I am currently eyeballing are:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MGWL3N7/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_B3wDDbF7X5QV6https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078LQQZCQ/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_m4wDDb3YNHMAKI also know that Garmin makes a lot of really good wearables but a lot of them are fairly pricey and not really geared toward this at all. They do have some ""vivofit jr"" devices that could work, I'm just not sure they provide the features we need:  https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/607996/pn/010-01909-31# Thanks for your time.Someone suggested device that you can put in a pocket or attach to his clothes. In in YouTube video someone posted here this week. I'll see if I can find it since I didn't finish watching it.Edit: found ithttps://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/d0gt0p/big_clive_on_his_experience_with_his_mums/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share Yes, this seemed like an option but I don't think it is quite what they are after. We use the gizmo watch for my mom. It tracks locations. I asked about a tracker for my dad and an Alzheimer's professional mentioned that it can give a false sense of security. We opted to not buy one. So I also suggest taking proactive measures to secure the home. We just put those cheap alarms on the door that shriek when you open them. We also put a slide lock at the bottom of the door we used the most since those alarms got annoying. Children's safety locks are also useful. They have grip and twist door knob covers that work great. Hope this also helps. I am looking for the same thing. It seems like Garmin must have a way to track users, but I wonder if they need to be near the phone app for it to work."	0

As such, he needs constant care as if he wanders out, after 45 minutes to an hour or so he'll have forgotten what's going on entirely.&#x200B;We can't afford to keep taking care of him, I'm trying to get my own life on track and I'm giving up about a quarter of my paycheck each month towards his care, as he has to go to adult care while we're not home. I really don't know what we can do. We don't have anyone else to turn to as he's the last surviving member of my mom's side of the family, and he's 58 so barring another major stroke we're likely to be caring for him for the foreseeable future. Outside of governmental, do you guys know of any charities or organizations that can help?Your first call is to Social Services to see if you are possibly eligible for any benefits. It shouldn't be that expensive. It's a little complicated.Has he signed a Power of Attorney over to your mother yet? Because this will be important for her to have when he gets to the point where he can't make any decisions, and the house absolutely needs to be sold. However, another way around this might be to investigate on your own, what memory care facilities are open, how much they cost, and what they offer. Talk to others who have gone through a similar situation, and go look at the places they sent their loved ones. Once you have the costs, this will be info you can share with him that will point to the necessity of selling. It's called a move out order. If you have evidence (documentation -bank records) that she's taken money, that's valuable info for the judge. It's good to know what they can do before you make that call. Is he on private insurance now? Read through his policy and find out whether he has an HMO, PPO and how his plan works. The problem is it doesn't matter how much we talk to him, his recall period is only about six hours so all he can remember is that his daughter is living in his house and that we're trying to sell it, so when she calls him and tells him that, he thinks we're trying to do it out of malice.He's not afraid of his daughter, he legitimately wants to give her a place to stay but he can't understand what's going on because he thinks he's only been staying with us a few days when he's been here over 6 months.As for insurance, he's on the low income version of Medicaid rn so we can afford doctor visits, but they won't cover longterm care unless he has less than 9k in assets. That would my first stop, anyway. Best wishes, and big hugs for your kindness taking care of your uncle.	0
Help with early signs/symptoms? My uncle died in January this year from Lewy bodies dementia. Bearing in mind that her and my cousin see us every 2/3 months, I see my mum multiple times a week and I’ve noticed it, which to me says a lot. I don’t know whether it is stress (she’s got a new job, moving house and losing her brother) or whether it is more than that. I am already keeping a diary of when I notice things. What else can I do to keep track of things? I am at a complete loss right now so anything would be helpful.Better safe than sorry love. It could be fatigue and stress related but it's always good to check. Lewy body isn't necessarily hereditary especially at the age on of early to mod sixties.But back to your question. If there is progression and the neurologist can narrow down the cause to dementia then unfortunately it's time to have the hard conversations about how to handle it. Contact your Primary Care Doctor and have him or her look at your Mon.	0
This could take a few years, or a few decades. We used to be able to leave our apartment together a few times a month and have meaningful interactions, but now his level of pain and suffering has him completely bedridden unable to even handle the volume from the TV. He is 100% ludic, and he says he no longer wishes to suffer like this and is petrified of the next stages of the disease which “he does not care to be around for, this is already beyond what he can tolerate.” He tells me numerous times he wants to die. He does not want me working to keep him alive anymore, yet if I don’t he wouldn’t die naturally anyway... just suffer more greatly. But I do know that in a year or so, his caretaking needs will seriously surpass what I am capable of and he won’t even want to be kept alive just for the sale of suffering longer anyway.I am NOT asking how or if to end his life. I don’t know how to emotionally cope with taking care of someone I love and who I know loves me, but no longer wants to be alive or be taken care of for what some people may see as a rational reason.I don’t really know what advice I’m looking for other than how to stop crying and how to make what’s left of his somewhat functional time here the best it can be.I read all these posts in this subreddit and it always seems like the caregiver is overwhelmed with their love one’s physical needs and demands and often have to treat them similar to a child. I just don’t know what or how to do anything right for him.You are not wrong to have feelings of understanding for his wish to allow himself to die. Feel free to PM me anytime.National Hospice and Palliative CareEdit to clarify: I know you are not asking how to help him die, but if his wish is actually to do so and there is nothing that can be done to prevent progression of the disease, then palliative care may be the most appropriate route to take. Is he on Medicaid? Again, I am so sorry you are both having to go through this.Caregiver.org Hello and thank you for your kind response! It’s so rare to come across somebody who seems to really understand everything, and I would love the opportunity to chat with you about this briefly and seek some clarification! ), and to request comfort care. With regard to the noise discomfort, what about noise cancelling headphones? My husband initially balked at the idea of a walker, but I ordered one anyway (he already had a cane from rehab from the 1st  stroke), and he did use it around the house and came to appreciate that it was available if/when he needed  it. Others have suggested looking into more direct caregiver support and I second that too. I haven’t had the time or income to seek therapy. And I mostly cope by playing video games and keeping myself occupied taking care of the house. Sorry I don’t have any concrete advise other than mild distraction, but feel free to DM me. I know it's called Agency on Aging but they also have resources for disabled people. I understand that it is not physically or financially possible.That being said, the Agency on Aging should be able to point you in the direction of a caregiver to assist you who is paid for by the state. I can count on one hand the number of times she ever said Thank you to me for what I was doing for her.Anyway, I wish I could give you more advice than that but just try not to take it to heart when he does yell, understand that he is in quite a bit of pain and sometimes when people have chronic pain it is hard to control their reactions to other people. But like I said call that place and see if they can help you. The medical establishment knows and can do nothing; half the doctors have never even heard of what he has (ME/CFS). Its about a forest near the base of Mt. Fuji in Japan where people come from all over the world to commit suicide. ; p I know about Aokigahara. Blocked. Have you looked into the foundations? You may want to cross post to r/cfs. You may learn of some tips or treatments there. There seems to be legitimately nothing that helps anybody, and 50% of the posts are about ending it all.	0

I use this app to keep track of my elder who has alzheimers.

"Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location Hi all. First post here. I'm at a loss as to what I might do to put a tracking device on him. Any ideas? Thank you.I think I found it! https://www.jiobit.com/Small, keychain compatible GPS tracker, with an inexpensive monthly fee. I know I can get him to put this on his keychain. The smart watch can last 24 hours and he can wear it while sleeping even. look in to GPS fobs I can't find a single one of them that is really a GPS tracker, despite nearly all of them calling themselves ""GPS tracker"". They are all bluetooth trackers that alert you when an item moves a certain distance from your phone. Thats not what I'm looking for. We don't care when he goes a few feet away from my mom's phone, we care when we can't find him. All the true ""GPS"" trackers are either too big for a key fob or require a constant power supply. I have a tile tracker for my keys. Its great but not at all suitable for this need. There is a huge range from expensive to affordable, there are also keyrings that have inbuilt GPS. A quick Google search will show you what is available in your country and most are available to buy from Amazon. Hope this helps x Google emergency alert trackers for seniors. You'll find trackers that allow your dad to call an emergency service company with the push of a button and some have fall detection. I got my dad the apple series 4 watch. It's the only one that I know of that has fall detection though rumor is more are coming soon. He does seem to wear it but it's going to take a lot of practice to get him to wear it while showering like I want him to.The problem with both of these is that the devices need to be charged so your dad would have to remember to charge them. Also both require a service charge or phone service charge.I found this too but I'm not sure if the business is good so they won't go belly up or not. Plus it's service charge is quite expensive too. The benefit of this is that you can get a power charger attachment that let's it run for 2 weeks without having to charge battery. So maybe you can be the one that charges the batteries instead of your dad.https://www.amazon.com/Tracker-Tracking-Vehicles-Equipment-Valuables/dp/B07S7DVT33/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?keywords=tracker&qid=1565867605&s=gateway&sr=8-4 Thanks. It is pretty large and doesn't appear to have a way to attach to a key ring. He's not going to remember to carry it and its too big for a pocked. Appreciate you advice. There are skinnier trackers but they have limited ranges so I think it's a no go.You can attach a tracker to his car. There are door opening sensors that alert you every time he opens and closes the doo but this still won't tell you where he's goneDoes he always wear the same jacket? I think that fatter device could be put on a key ring with other keys. He likes to keep track of his exercise, a smart watch might just be the trick. I think I could show him how neat they are at heart rate monitoring, distance, elevation, etc..  BTW, he can no longer drive. The most affordable and universal one is something like SpotGPS , it's a small satellite GPS.tracker , not as small as a key fob, bit small enough.The biggest issue with these devices.besides battery constraints is MAKING SURE THE PERSON HAS IT WITH THEM when they walk outside , of they are having memory issues, this will be a challenge.. but solvable with some diligent planning Thanks."	0
How long is this going to go on for and should I even be feeling so frustrated over this situation? However, another pesky tumor popped up on the MRI screen while one of his new doctors stammered and stared down at his feet, repeating to us he can’t take any more radiation. It’s been this wishy washy for nearly four years, and I’m sure you’re all real familiar with how existential death and love for family can make us.Now as for the actual caregiving day to day: Mom’s still in the picture but spends most the day working, also spends most of the day being a mental wreck of an individual as of late. (My dad and I hid the pills and just keep two out in case one happens) Especially since someone I knew tragically died two years ago from bad alcohol/medication combo. She helps out a lot during the day when she’s sober as I’m obviously not going to be the one hooking him up to his pee bag and helping him shower, she also tries to get time off for his big appointments downtown. He’s pretty good on his own (uses a walker), and can be left home alone for short periods of time, but doesn’t remember to feed himself and kind of just stares at the TV or makes some phone calls, we just started watching twin peaks and he’s thoroughly enjoying it. He’s fallen down once before which started a year long recovery and major setbacks with a broken back so I worry every time I leave. It’s weird to remember being like that now even though it was only about 3 years ago, instead of forcing myself into making things for other people because of tiny amounts of money in return and giving gifts. Don’t seem to have much of a future after this is all done, and he’s already on too many government plans for me to receive the medicaid caregiver money. Have the best friends in the world too, but such little commitment to see them. More than anything I want my zest for life back, and respecting the mystery and confusion of the world with excitement instead of disdainI’ve been typing for too long, I know, but it does feel good to get this shit out and hopefully to some people that can relate. If you read this far thank you, thank you for all the work that you do, and I guess the best way we can look at it is that no matter what your beliefs may be, where you are or what you’re doing is exactly where the world wants you. There is no place for creation when you are barely surviving one hour at a time. This, one day, will be a start-over for you.

Deal with the crisis as they come, not a decade before they happen.As an artist myself, over the last few years as a caretaker, I discovered that when my creativity is in the pit that learning something new could spark me back into my art. Try you-tubing things like cardboard furniture, or macrame wall hangings, or DIY concrete. There is nothing to look forward to in a economic or environmental hellscape other than pain and suffering.And I don't care if people persuade me not to end my life because of a exciting economic or environment collaspe.	0
I needed to check another call light that had been going off for a while who gets extremely upset when I’m late. Note to all caregivers, please please read their care plans, memorize the fall risk residents as best as you can even if you have 30+ residents that you have to try to keep track of. If you have a million call lights going off at once, utilize your coworkers no matter what to help you. Keep your head down, focus on the job in front of you, and let yourself grow. At the end of the day,its all just another layer of skin that is getting thicker every day. Keep your own list of fall risks, maybe.	0
"Trying to make something to help people who financially support aging parents My in-laws are nearing the end of their ability to work, and have never saved well. Most of their income will come from social security, but my wife and her five siblings all realize that some level of additional financial support will be needed to help them along, especially as they become less independent. I'm trying to figure out what would make life easier for all those people, and wonder if it would be possible to help families form a better sense of partnership in the process. Here's what I'm imaging—I'd love your input to tell me if I'm on the right track or totally in outer space:There are some common problems I'm hearing (and extrapolating)... those are the headers below.Below that are things I could picture building to help solve those problems. Thanks in advance.“My siblings and I are willing to help my parents, but there’s not a shared understanding of the financial need or a simple way to feel like we’re on the same page in solving it.”Potential solutions:Online-banking-like platform gives everyone a financial dashboard with various levels of visibility customized to the parent and primary caregiver/POA’s preferences Family members can see upcoming expenses, contribute to the cushion for day-to-day expenses and/or longer term savings goals. “I’m struggling to get my siblings to take my parent's financial shortcomings seriously and contribute to cover the needs""Potential solutions:Easy way to set up matching contributions—You’ll contribute more if your siblings contribute more to living costs or future savings. Bill forecasting for all siblings to understand when expenses are about to exceed balance in accounts. “I don’t know if my parent's bills are getting paid""Potential solution:Bank transaction monitoring to alert you when a regular monthly expense hasn’t posted by the expected date. “I want to contribute without encouraging unwise spending""Potential solutions:Separate account specific to bills, managed by caregiving children—easy contribution mechanism for anyone in the family who wants to help with living expenses. Limited debit card for elderly parent—certain merchant categories restricted (sweepstakes, telemarketers, online gambling, etc.) Local caregiver receipt capture tool for increased accountability Option for uploaded expense to trigger auto-contribute from other siblings to help cover a percentage according to rules customized by each sibling. For example, the whole family can see the status of the goal “Travel for next Christmas” or “Move Mom to Condo” and chip in to help reach the goal. Elderly parents wouldn’t have access to withdraw from shared goals directly, but maybe certain goals could be set to automatically cover specific types of expenses. “I can’t find a definitive roadmap to help me navigate best practices in financial and estate planning""Potential solutions:Interactive, data-driven platform walks you through a personalized checklist tailored to your situation—establishing POA, adding account beneficiaries, probate avoidance measures, and everything in between.

You can poll in the channel, etc. On the more somber side how-to guides for funeral planning, etc would be helpful. Love the idea of a social aspect. If you’re willing to share, I’d love to hear more about your specific situation...you’ve navigated this stuff with others in your family? Yes I experienced having to deal with family members unspecified end of life choices, elderly fraud, and funeral planning. I have friends that are dealing with family squabbles over land and possessions and how to fairly contribute among siblings. And products here are absolutely needed. How do you calculate someone time who is on site/on call vs someone who consistently checks in via phone? And please dont even get started on the personal items to inherit. Be that PM and take good notes and circulate them. When you talk about establishing logs and covering yourself... I’m not sure where to start with that. I have kept minutes and notes of decisions and family meetings so every single thing is clear. My parents have sold their small modest home and rent the inlaw suit in our house (purchased solely for this arrangement). I have managed a risk log and made sure to have a mitigation plan because my parents should not impact my life goals  I.e. affect my marriage or retirement plans."	0
Supposedly can answer questions with the eye tracking technology. Numerous  surgeries including to try to fix a collapsed trachea, massive spinal twisting due to contractures, etc. He requires 7 machines, including a cough assist (he can't cough), oxygen machine, ventilor, tanks of oxygen, etc. All of these machines and tubing require maintenance, cleaning, etc. Multiple syringes for feeding and meds,which also require washing etc. Doctors have said he will never get better, in fact have recommended DNI on several occasions. Caregiver not taking  care of sibling as well as should be, because of depression and devoting every ounce of energy and time to patient's care. House is a mess, pets are not taken care of, spouse is breaking down and stressed beyond belief. What life is this? Nothing in return but pee and poop and pain. It can help some people and rehabilitate them, but for others it just keeps them alive long enough for old age to eventually take them. That’s no life, maybe gather your family together and openly talk about these feelings. This is torture, and changing the DNR request is a humane decision, because if it’s their time to go, you’re selfish to not let them. You can prolong life or you can end suffering and though I can't make anyone's decision, I would  opt for that latter. Seems like OP knows exactly what’s going on and what’s required. I was the primary caregiver of a total care child and I would give anything in the world to have her back. I have seen several cases of this now.	0
In the case of my mom, it's washing her hands and paper products (napkins, paper towels, etc.). It's annoying as hell, but just how it is, and we just have to make the decision to accept that this is their reality and to accommodate it as long as it doesn't pose a threat to their well-being..	0
"I took some advice from here and I straight up told her it was never going to happen, giving her a list of raises why it won't.She ended up getting up set as all she heard was ""your never moving into my house"".It's been a few months since then she's still not healthy but her and her doctors think they have her on the right track. Which is a positive sign! I was driven away from the church by the lies, hatred, and the negatives that went with church. My Mother still does not go to church but she's started praying. Knowing she doesn't have the money or credit I offered to put it on my card and she can pay me back as she can.I get everything taken care of and she post on FB how God has answered her prayers and how great God is. I just feel like I can't win some times, I didn't care about the FB post untill she texted me. Fellow church raised former attendee here as well. I've learned it's always best to be honest, be atheist, and be proud of it. My 92 MIL wants to move into our home and my husband keeps telling her it's not going to happen but she keeps asking. Ever since my wife and I bought our house, my Mother always joked about moving in. We ended up moving to my wife's parents house and within a few weeks moved into our  ow apartment.I know my wife and Mother have unsettled problems but my mother just doesn't understand that it will never work. Uhhh, I know how hard I worked to get here and how hard I work to keep it."	0
am i crazy, or is this just completely unprofessional hi internet friends. dr has refused every time. i called the 'on call dr' for the local hospital and explained the situation in detail to the nurse taking the info, the on call dr is busy, so they take my number and they say the dr will call me back. am i just wired and hypersensitive, or is this bullsh*t? Sorry to hear ! whew. thanks for listening. thanks for listening. it took almost a year of begging. i tried a few natural remedies way back, but none of them helped. what a ride. So glad they finally prescribed something!Hope you can put aside some time to think through how YOU can get support. thanks, TranZeitgeist. It’s so depressing, gut wrenching and soul sucking...:( I truly get to the point where I give zero fuks about once a month. That’s my cue that I am over tired and need some self care like a couple of nights away to rest and pretend I’m normal. Wishing everyone on here the very best! Please know there are people out here sending you strength and huge hugs and experiencing this “life”. I no longer wish for a long life, just for a swift end when it gets unbearable... What is the long term prognosis with your Mom? They can be very helpful. we have zero long term prognosis. my mom's health has steadily declined for a year, and all the specialists are just shrugging their shoulders. it's just me. i have started thinking about placement, but i can't stand to think of her in one of those places after seeing how terribly they treat her normally. it might be time. Its a tough decision.My father said, he wasn't going to leave his home anyway but horizontal.	0
Father in Law wanders off a lot I just stumbled upon this subreddit and I hope this is a place where I can get some advice. One thing he tends to do when he gets fed up enough is he will leave the house without telling us and we usually only realize he’s gone once he’s made a good amount of distance from the house. So we’ve got together with other family members and are looking into a form of locating device that we could put on him or he could carry that we could use in these kinds of emergencies. Has anyone here had similar issues with Alzheimer’s patients?And of course the big question, does anyone know of any devices we could use to help us know where he is if he wanders off?I was looking into that for my dad but was told by a seasoned care giver that they give you a false sense of security. Worked great.If you do get a gps device it needs to be on a non removable bracelet or anklet. So remember that it’s not a perfect system. alarms on the doors +cameras in the house. its always good to be able to be doing your own thing and be able to pull out your phone and check the cameras to see exactly what he’s up to, and be able to hear when the door opens. another option ive not personally tried but read about on this sub is special locks for doors that are specifically meant to keep young children and/or people with alzheimer’s from opening them. theyre usually still really easy to open but work differently from other locks so they cant figure it out most of the time. I've used an Apple Watch with Cellular for my Dad. This won't work if your an Android user. Also, if you don't want it connected to your Apple ID you'd have to connect it to a separate device with its own Apple ID. You might be able to setup an Apple Watch without a companion device now... [deleted] I live with my Dad so if there isn't someone there to make sure it gets put on then I wouldn't recommend it due to the cost. I've also used Insteon (smarthome product maker) door sensors for alerts. Arlo cameras are also all around the house so I can check up on him while I'm at work. I put deadbolts on the doors that are keyed both sides. So far this combo seems to be working wonders for my mother in law. Yes!!! My great nana gets fed up and often “escapes” since we took her car keys away. She’s speedy when she wants to be...We’ve given her a flip phone with a bunch of important speed dial numbers on a piece of paper taped to the back of it. She’s gone on walks without telling us a few times now, but we’ve always been able to find her if two of us each take a direction, and one of us waiting on the porch.	0
Looking for recommendations: Mobile medical alert with pendant or wrist band My father is getting ready to move into an assisted living facility. )I'm looking for something he can wear around his neck or on his wrist in case he has an emergency and is away from the pull cord locations. (Outside the facility is not an issue as he will not be traveling outside unassisted. )Can anyone recommend a decently priced solution that has either a neck pendant or wrist wearable? Ideally it would have an option to call a number that you choose (I would just have it call the nurse station at the facility he is living in.) But 911 would be ok too I guess but that would add delays until they found out he is in a facility with 24/7 medical help available.thanks in advance!We used Guardian Medical Monitoring, which is wonderful but limited to a few midwestern states. We live in the Southeast so I guess Guardian is out of the question. I got this and it hooks into the phone line. It's kind of more for home situations but it works - no monthly fee either. thanks!	0
Any booklets that can help here? I am looking for a free brief booklet that has various strategies and techniques on how to make a patient fully compliant on their medications and blood pressure measurement. I am out of home for 15 hours a day for work five days a week and I don't even get to call home. We have not been able to get a diagnosis on his symptoms and regular monitoring and adherence to medication is a must given the diagnosis is uncertain and in order to get a diagnosis you need to keep track of your symptoms as best as you can. I have no leverage. So like the other poster mentioned, it might be some event scaring him straight, unfortunately, or a nurse coming in and administering it through a home health agency if he qualifies.	0
makes this seem like a bit of a money grab. Red flags everywhere.Can you provide some details on the implementation? I hope you can provide more details (or, even that I simply missed an important link where they are hidden), but until you do that I could not recommend that anyone give you any money. Constructive criticism taken. You can Google me: Fernando Tarnogol. It can also be found here: https://gitlab.com/ftarnogol/alzheimers-vr-test/wikis/Test-OverviewThere is even a complete project file with a concept that can be compiled in Unity. There is no way I am releasing a health related tool without science's blessing. That's how I've worked since 2012 and I've managed to maintain a spotless reputation. I did not do an exhaustive search, but the point here is that many potential investors will be dissuaded by the difficulty in finding that kind of information. Don't you think it would instill confidence in potential investors for you to provide a clear link to your publications? It would be a shame if someone with reasonable idea missed out on an opportunity because they did not properly represent themselves. I am not looking for investors. I am not seeking to make a business or create a startup. Free and open source is not exactly a business model. With $30 per month we have everything we need to keep things running. We’ve been clear what we will use the remaining funds for. We already have the development team, our national scientific activities council and 2 universities in 2 different countries have expressed interest to do the reasearch.Last not least, you invalidate most of your own points (mainly the ones I find mildly offensive towards myself and my track record) by saying that you only did basic research, but thanks for the good intentions.End of this thread.	0

Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements Hello, my grandfather suffers from dementia and cancer. Is there a Smartwatch that looks easy enough to wear and can help us track him? and is not overly expensive? Or anything that can be wearable and doesn't hinder him.I'm getting my dad the apple watch series 4. It's arriving this tues. I think pretty much any watch will do what you ask. You can even set up his phone to do the same thing I think without having to get a watch.But the apple series 4 is special in that it's the only watch I know of that can can detect falls and send out an alert to you and emergency services. I posted on the Google sub asking if there was a Google watch that did the same thing but no, it doesnt seem like it based on the responses I got.The watch needs to be paired with an iPhone that is 5s or above if you get the GPS only version. Or a 6 or above if you get the cellular version. With the GPS version, you have to wait till he gets within a WiFi area to see where he's gone IF he forgot to bring his phone.The bad thing about thr cellular version is you have to pay more money per month for the cell service.I'm getting my dad the WiFi version since I'm cheap and it's unlikely my dad will forget to bring his phone (its habit for him I think). Are there any other smart watches with GPS and the falls feature? I do but I live 2 hours away and not sure that would work... plus my mom no longer knows how to use any devices but does wander. The falls feature, no - I can't find a single watch other than the apple series 4. If you find one, could you message me by chance? I want to get a watch for my mom too but she's an android user.Your mom doesn't need an iPhone if you get the cellular one and sync the watch to your phone instead. You can be really far away from her then and it would still work but then you'll have to pay the monthly cell service. Also, the smart watches can receive calls, calls from your phone if you sync to the watch. I'm not 100% sure you can turn off the calls. You'll have to ask someone with a cellular version of the phone (maybe in an apple sub). to find out. She couldn’t answer the watch intentionally or run it. I will look into it some more. If it's your grandfather and he doesn't have his own iPhone, if you go with a watch, you will definitely need the cellular option and to get cell service cause I assume the iPhone won't be within range of the watch all the time.Another option besides a watch is to sign up with a paid alert system. It's  typically more expensive than getting cell service for a watch. But some of the devices can also detect falls similar to the iphone. Your watch can call emergency services too but you wont have a special person on the other end talking him through things. !	0
Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips? I knew virtually nothing about dementia when I entered the care profession, but once I realised the majority of care home residents were afflicted with some form of dementia, I began scouring the internet for any information, research, and advice I could find! I've learned quite a bit both on the job and through my research, but I'm always anxious to learn more. This always seems to receive a positive reaction from both residents and staff, so at one care home, I half-jokingly asked about being added to the home's entertainment roster. The activities coordinator asked me to put together a short show with backing tracks, which would serve as a sort of audition, and said if the residents enjoy it I'll be welcomed aboard as a fully-paid entertainer at the home beginning next year (she books all of the year's entertainment in January), as well as receive a ringing endorsement if I'd like to do shows elsewhere in the meantime. The residents range in age from 64-91. The show is this Monday, July 1st -- I have taken this week off, spending much of my time putting together the show and practising. Do you have any advice as far as additional interactive elements I could add to this show, or other fun stuff I could throw in to increase general enjoyment (without spending any/much money)? I know it is only an unpaid sample/audition show, but I'd really like to make sure it goes well, and that I give the residents something to enjoy. Thank you so much for your help! <3<3This sounds great!! I gathered requests from every visiting family member/group over the past month. Adding the instruments for them to participate is a great step.	0
Alert system? Hey all, I have a request for an alert system. We used to used our Google home to send text messages to my phone and that worked great for years - until recently it broke and refuses to send text messages. I was wondering if anyone uses/knows of an alert system that has a button or a speaker my mom can use that can be set up at home that sends a message to my phone when she falls? Thanks!I am following because I probably need to know soon. I ended up buying this and it arrived today, if you're interested. I recommend Life Alert. Press the button and a call goes out to a call center which responds immediately.If the the patient lives alone, they recommend having a lock box and a key outside of the property. EMS will be notified of the combination of the box, get the key and go inside. Saves them from having to break down the door or break a window.I don't know what the fee is.	0
Advice needed: grandmother with Alzheimer's is having trouble using charging cables Hello wonderful community. Any advice would be appreciated. The problem is that, as her cognitive decline worsens, she's increasingly having trouble working the charging cables for the devices. She constantly breaks cables and misplaces them. She puts cases on the wrong way, covering the charging slot, and wonders why it isn't working. I've looked into wireless charging stations but they don't work for iPads or pre-iPhone 8s. Besides the charging issues, she also has trouble loading money into iTunes to unlock game levels (which is important to her) and needs constant help with that. She doesn't necessarily need a smart phone as the game are the only thing she uses it for.&#x200B;So, does anyone have suggestions for:1) A basic handheld, touch screen gaming device that has access to Candy Crush-style games? 2) An alternative to standard insert charging cables for Apple Devices? Wireless charging isn't an option unless we buy her a new model of phone. Thanks all!You can get magnet charging sets  https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+magnetic+charging+cable&oq=apple+magnet+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l3.3545j0j4&client=ms-android-samsung-gs-rev1&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8, she would only  have to hold the charger near it to connect it which might help with the picking the wrong connector That's a great idea, thanks! I needed to buy tougher cables, several in bright colours so that they didn't get damaged or lost. But she can still plug them in ok.Is it possible to have someone (neighbour, paid carer) pop over on a nightly basis to check that devices are plugged in to charge overnight? I think the magnet was a great idea I've been looking into ordering those magnetic cable adapters. The system we've been using is loading on iTunes gift cards when she needs to top up for her games but that's something we have to do for her (she can't remember passwords or how to navigate the process). I'm a graphic designer who's interested in accessibility and product design, I love products that offer real solutions to enable people with cognitive decline to participate in their world and maintain quality of life. There's a lot of brilliant senior-focused tech out there for communication and safety but I find entertainment tech for seniors is lacking. Having seen the pain points in entertainment tech for those with cognitive decline has really made me want to develop something more suitable (I'm pipe dreaming here...). games, on-demand tv) and then have them taken away just because the mediums that host them (gaming devices, smartphones, smart TVs, complex remote controls etc.) I also suggest stocking up on used devices. Try freecycle.org where you live. Tell them your reason and people will be glad to help. Also try a group online for the game to see if someone knows a freeware game that would be indistuingshable to her.good luck. Great project for her to have. You can add a credit or debit card to her Apple account. Then she wouldn’t need to load funds to iTunes. If all else fails paint round the power slot on device and the front of the power point that goes into the phone with bright nail polish.	0
The most significant time I spent with my bio father was a summer that I worked as an intern at his company in another state, and that's when I kind of sensed that I had a future in the corporate world. He's brought up celebrities from the 60s and 70s who he shared a beer with -- people like Elvis, and the Bee Gees, and Willie Nelson -- all those stories are false but they are based on a true story he told me years ago, when he really did share a beer with Harry Belafonte. I'm heartbroken at what the world is losing in this process, and I hope I can find a way to help make his transition better.I am sorry to hear this. This disease is awful! Will look it up in Amazon I’m so sorry. And not too long ago, he’d also go on walks and get lost. Also seek out support in the real world. Talk to clergy, see if you can locate a local support group, consider joining a charity to raise funds/awareness of the disease. Talk to your SO and family.	0

First-time look at finances and email and I am horrified My 75 yo father has been in the hospital and/or rehab for at least four months. I don't know much of the specifics. Finances, email etc. He is very manipulative and I'm not interested in the hit to my mental health that a visit of any length would cause.FinancesHe is tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I have no idea. I've added all of his finances into Mint so I can at least track when bills are due. I have no idea how he pays his bills, because the money he owes (even with minimum payments) exceeds the money he brings in. I have power of attorney but none of the credit card companies can take anything but a fax (no secure uploads either. It is 2019 ffs. ).At least so far I do not see anything recent that is suspicious. He has SO MUCH OF IT. These are the following categories.Marketing emails. Hundreds and probably thousands. He must be on a list of chumps who buy stupid flimsy stuff on the internet. Sports gear. Dresses for young women. Dozens a week. He has paid this preacher a few times from what I can tell.Guns guns guns! I am not an inbox zero freak but I do like a clean inbox and keep my newsletters to a minimum.Mystery policyHe claims he has a policy that pays his minimum credit card payments on his *checks notes* ten credit cards that he currently is making payments on while he was in the hospital, yet I can find zero evidence of this policy. He is past due on a few of them, some of them two payments past due. The individual cards do not seem to have a policy (I checked to see if there were recurring charges for something like $10/month and don't see anything like that). He seems to think it is a blanket policy from a single company that covers these issues.Any ideas what this is? ADVICE WANTED: An easy, cheap way to fax without having to go to a FedEx store and bring physical pieces of paper to fax? He says they are jokes and I truly think he believes that is the case, but I don't think he understands how that makes women feel.Do not pay on any of his debt. That will start you down the road of being accountable and the credit card companies will try to put you on the hook.Talk to a financial planner that can advise you better, but his best option might be to claim bankruptcy. I am definitely not using any of my funds to pay for his past mistakes. I won't ruin my future for someone who has always been bad with money. This is all coming from his money. Brother is handling some of the lawyerly stuff since he is local, and I may ask him to bring this up.3. I have POA and medical POA, but not a living will. There’s no reason to keep paying on what appears to be interest on interest. Stop whatever service he claims is paying his bills. He’s most likely paying for that service too. Get a new email set up for him, and redirect any needed emails to that account. It’s much easier than going through so many emails to unsubscribe. Email - I use a service called Unroll.Me to manage my spam and promotional emails. It’s a well reviewed system and has been easy to work with, for me at least. There is a monthly service fee to keep the number and for a certain level of security(to maintain hipaa because I’m a health care provider), but I think there may also be free services available if you just use it occasionally.

How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather? My grandfather is 87 and has been having some trouble around the house lately. He stayed on the ground for a few hours then was finally able to crawl up onto the bed where he stayed until someone got home.&#x200B;I am wondering if there is something I can place around the house so he can call for help if he needs it. I thought maybe Google Home devices so he can call someone in the family or an Apple Watch with cellular so he can use Siri to call family or at least hold the emergency button on the side to call 911. Does anyone have any good ideas to use these devices for help if he needs it?The only idea I have is to make sure he is wearing the medic alert at all times. My mother has Life Alert, which I believe is the company name, and she has a central unit in her living room, which is a big box with a very big red button she can hit for help. She also has a bracelette with a button, and a necklace. She doesn't use the necklace because just knocking it on stuff would call for help occasionally, but the bracelette doesn't seem as senistive and she wears it all times. You can talk to whatever company your grandfather uses, and maybe they can set up more of the stationary boxes, like one in every room. It seems to be what is working best for my mother. good luck:) I agree with the medic alert bracelet. Some are even waterproof so you wear them in the bath. He likes it because it looks like a men’s watch.Did you know they have a version that detects a fall and alerts on its own? Pretty cool.The only problem I see with a device like Alexa, is the range. I’m wondering if an Apple Watch might be a better alternative to a Medic Alert bracelet. I know I can call people using mine (1st gen) and have it on speaker via the watch. It would combine the medic alert bracelet and the Alexa you were thinking of. Going off this, is there any way you can maybe tie something to your dog's collar? My mom fell a few years ago in her apartment and was able to yell to Siri on her Iphone to call 911 and paramedics came. She also has the Alexa Show device now that allows her to call and video call anyone with her voice. I can drop in on her anytime and see her room even if she doesn't answer it verbally. My mom forgets sometimes the way to answer Alexa or even the fact that she can use her voice to get a call or help. That can be hard to help. The life alert and med alert pendants are great as others have mentioned especially when they react based on the fall motion so no action on the senior is needed to indicate they need help. So finding a way to make sure they have it on is key and can be tough if they don't want to wear it. I know they have ones work on the hip in addition to the typical pendant style. Hope you can find something that works for him:) Thanks for the advice. We ended up with an AppleWatch for him which he thinks is the coolest thing ever. We like it because it will also text us his location if an emergency is triggered as sometimes he goes on walks. I also showed him the walkie-talkie feature so he can use that in pinch too. He already knows Siri from his phone so I made sure he got a lesson on how to activate that too. We covered pretty much every way to use the watch to call for help.	0
She gets upset often and accuses my grandfather of not telling her of plans that were made often, such as vacations and family get togethers. I was thinking about a GPS tracker but the thing is that she won't want to wear it, and she is already wary of tracking and doesn't fully trust or believe that she needs it.For medication, I've heard it's only effective for 6-12 months but is there anything else that we should know?Any other advice or things we should know?Thank you all.For me, one thing I learned was just to go with whatever she believes. It was surprisingly useful. She needs someone there watching her full time.The mat at the front door is a good idea, it’s amazing how so many small things like that can make a dramatic difference. My Papa is still alive and well but he isn't always able to be watching her. This worked pretty well for me.Your papa could contact a family member to watch when he leaves for a while.He can deactivate it when he’s home and most camera systems have geo fencing connecting through an app on your phone, where it automatically deactivates once you get home anyways.I used the Arlo cameras. They’re wireless and about $300 for 2 of them and the base station, they come with batteries and last for 3-6 months if you only turn them on when your gone. I encourage you to search for all the resources you can get. We had a social worker and aides come in to help my FIL.Regarding the tracker, you might be able to get some that go in or on her shoes. We're considering this for my own mother. If she's still driving, make sure there's a tracker with the car, but on her body somehow would be better.I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I saw shoe ones online but still a bit wary because what if she doesn't wear those shoes that day.Thank you. That's the same question we have. It's not hard to set up tracking on a cellphone, and even flip-phones can be tracked. Fortunately he doesn't wander outside these days. It might be worth trying a matt black rug/mat at the front door. Worth a shot, but please report back to us if you try it. You may want to read this article, and see if any of the recommendations made therein could be employed. Anything that might help in such a situation is worth considering.	0
"Emergency Alerting System using Alexa Requesting advice about technology that could be used as a reliable intercom system. We are looking for a way to ensure that we can communicate between rooms in case of an emergency with our grandfather who lives at home but recently needs to be watched full time because he is unable to swallow properly. His wife is currently sleeping in the guest room downstairs but needs to be alerted at a moments notice without the press of a button if the aide needs assistance in the case of an emergency.They’ve tried baby monitors so the aide could yell for help in that scenario, but they are disruptive to his wife’s sleep because she can hear him coughing in it or the aide watching TV ect.Recently they’ve been trying an Amazon Echo system with one in grandfathers room and a dot in her bedroom, but sometimes when we try the drop in feature it does not work. I would really appreciate any suggestions you have for a communication system because they are helping keep my grandfather safe and as comfortable in his home as possible.My mother has a Google home, not sure if the same program is availabl on Alexa, but on Google they have an app called ""Call my buddy."" it will then (after setting it up) send a text alert to my phone letting me know something is wrong. It's the best solution I've found and it's free, or you can donate a small amount of money a month through PayPal for more texts."	0
So of course when im at work and call to check on her and she doesn't answer I go into panic mode. So I bought an echo dot. Privacy and problems that have been reported aside I got it for one reason. Drop in. It's a life saver. I can call the dot basically and talk to her. I can make sure she is doing ok. Stress level dropped significantly.Ya, tech has helped me too.Wyze cams. Stuck one on the front door and one watching outside. Wyze cam answered that question and others. My cameras should be here today. We have pt and ot coming in too when im at work. Just added peace of mind 1)  The PTZ ones, I have two and rarely move them. Just buy the cheaper ones.2)  They seem to have really inconsistent audio. One close to the TV can barely tell it's on. One on the other end of the room hears it plain as day.3)  The audio OUT of them kind of sucks. Are the cams only motion activated? No, you can do a lot with them actually.The cams will record 24x7 (a 32GB card will do 7-8 days on SD IIRC), on a schedule, on sound, on motion or you can do no recording and just use it as a live cam to log into whenever you feel like. You can turn on motion and send alerts to your phone. You'll get free 12 second cloud storage. If you put a 32GB micro SD card in (about $8) it will also record a 1 minute video on the card and you can connect from anywhere and watch that. Sometimes dad will pause at the door and the 12 seconds ends so I'll connect to the cam and watch the 1 minute or the live to see what's happening right at that moment.Also have the ability to set a detection box. Things will even do time lapse video.There are a couple of different types of these things, like the Arlo or the Blink cams. These were cheap and worked for me. I never knew you could do drop in on a dot until someone in this sub recommended it, definite game changer. Download the amazon Alexa app on your phone. Once you set it up to communicate, you’ll be able to drop in on your echo dot Wow. I have Google Home , does it do a drop in style service? And if he can’t figure it out, he can call me and I can switch stations or turn it on/off using the app. I set it to play music but I didn't know I could turn it on through the app. Thanks for the information! Mom loves listening to music but after a bit it's too much stimulation	0
She's 76 and seemed ok until a couple of years ago, slowing down with age but nothing majorly different. I'm happy to look after her where I can but would like some help, I risked going away for  a week's holiday a while back and she was found by a neighbour screaming my name on the street, apparently convinced I was dead. MRI done etc ? I've only got the info my mum has told me about what tests have been done, so it's not fully reliable.... Would her GP provide details to me ? I'm not in the UK, but Canada so I would imagine some things are similar. In order for the GP to tell you things your mum would have to have you come to the appointments with her/give consent, but your best bet is getting power of attorney for both finances and personal care. That way you are in charge and they can tell you everything. You really do need that diagnosis to proceed with certain things so I would contact the GP, express your concerns and see if they can expedite things. Even without the POA you can tell them things, they just can't reveal a patient's history. Yes yes,POA pronto while your mother can still give consent. I would advise that you make an appointment with ur mum to visit her GP together and perhaps call the GP first yourself to discuss your concerns. We went back to the GP again recently and said that we would like an official medical diagnoses,  Alzheimer’s has a wide spectrum. So in order to medicate correctly we needed to know what she had exactly in order to do so. We have told her that they are her new ‘Sleeping’ tables and because of this she can not have anymore alcohol ever again (In fairness she did like to have a drink or 3) but she has stopped from this point on. After MRI we quickly met with a consultant Psychiatrist, who gave us more details and clearer view of outcomes etc.We know this is not a cure and never will be. So in short, and on my limited knowledge, get a proper medical diagnoses and don't give up until you get it, then work with her GP for the best medication for her needs. Go to the Docs,he will refer you to a Psychiatrist ,insist on an assessment,it may be because of her drinking they are refusingI am from the UK and how the system works is the Doc will refer her to a psychiatrist who will diagnose her,send her for scans to determine the type of Dementia and issue meds,if she is not drinking anymore that should not be a problemShe cannot drink while on medication	0
He is still pretty sharp about some topics, but I'll hear the same story and get asked the same questions again and again. They share a family doctor in a larger nearby city where they live for the rest of the year, and he gets check ups with this doctor, but my mom has not yet taken to time to alert their doctor about this. Obviously that previous test was not comprehensive enough, and I feel that the next step is a proper assessment so we have a better idea of what might be happening. And also convince my mom to take a more active role in tracking his health?Your Father is in the very early stages,it's vital you find a way to have him assessed,try explain to your mum the sooner he can be assessed the sooner any recommended treatment can start,catching it early is vitalI am not sure which country you reside in so it's difficult to give precise advice,I live in the UK and from what I read on here treatment and diagnosis are very different	0
Her memory isn't terrible, but she gets confused easily and can't keep track of tasks that require multiple steps (like making coffee for instance), and she can't read because she can't keep track of where she is on the page.I'm looking for suggestions as to what sorts of activities she can do on her own when we aren't able to give her attention.So far we haveColoring bookTV....and that's kind of it.That depends on the stage and the individual and even the time of day =/A couple of thoughts though:So when my mom was less advanced she enjoyed Instagram. I set it up. I also set up a bird feeder and birdbath. My mom loves to watch the birds. It's potentially something to do independently as well, not just watching them but refilling the bath and feeders, making suet etc.Watering the garden is good for the earlier stages. This year I'm planting a butterfly garden and bringing caterpillars in to raise. The type of magazine depends on specific interests. I like the magazine idea! Going thru photo albums. Laundry is always a good thing to give them to do! puzzles, and theres a load of good apps if you have an ipad she can use! gardening if physically able could be fun too, my grandmother can spend hours just walking around her yard picking up leaves and twigs and putting them in a little bucket. We got my mother a therapy cat that appears to breathe. The puzzles we got her had too many pieces and she would put them in odd places. We now have puzzles with fewer pieces, but she seems to go through them rather quickly.Tried getting her to listen to music with this simple player but we were kind of limited by what music we had to hand and it's a mixed bag. My dad keeps forgetting to put it on for her and she won't do it herself. They want to feel like they can help still. My residents do well with sorting and looking through greeting cards. Sometimes I ask them to help me find the matching envelopes or to find a specific type of card to “give to someone we know”. Some other ideas include:-puzzles-fidget toys -anything to sort-old picture albums Lots of folding laundry. 1) Puzzles : get hold of kids puzzle sets. Those with large but fewer pieces2) Kids Basketball set : gives individual a chance to toss a ball into net. Coin sorting, sock matching(I have a basket of socks for only this), dementia puzzles(larger and less pieces), fidget blanket(lots of different type of closures to fiddle with), a purse with stuff she can fiddle with, and children's picture books or magazines. The baby doll would keep her happy bc she liked taking care of it, amd it kept her from wandering around too, bc she wouldn't want to disturb it by getting up out of her chair.	0
Need help with telephone solution Hey everyone- So my mom has occasionally started forgetting to hang up the phone, which leaves us unable to contact her throughout the day. I've found a couple of products online that will automatically hang up after a certain time, but I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions or experience with anything like that-Or, as another thought, does anyone know of anything that would work almost like an intercom- a device/app where I could place a call and end up on speakerphone without the need for her to physically answer the call? As for your mom, heck we actually got the Google home hub, I think you can get a free google phone number and she can only make local calls online. ALSO it's bigger than a phone and all she has to do is push the green button and it hangs up when the other user does, hope this helps Will definitely look into this. We already got her an Echo, and I know there’s a way to link phone service to it, but she forgets she has Alexa it's visual as well so it has a camera and it turns black when the caller hangs up, pretty handy Side question, is she hearing impaired? It does speaker as well as handset. I printed out instructions in how to drop in on her kids if she wants, so we are testing out that feature now. This sounds perfect, thanks! Looking into it now I have Amazon Echo Dots set up around the house and I can literally drop in whenever I feel like.	0
"And, to be honest, the phone app interface is not setup very well at all. The senior-focused phones/devices like the Jitterbug and Grandpad have mixed reviews when it comes to dementia patients. And there aren't a whole lot of other options out there that I can find. I'd be interested in what has worked for others.Thanks!For the brief time between ""can't use cell anymore but can still make calls"" and ""can't make calls at all,"" my husband set up for my father-in-law a Google Voice number that rang an ""old-fashioned"" cordless phone, with speed dial programmed with the numbers he might need (mother-in-law, husband, me, maybe one friend?). I don't know if this is a feasible setup not at home. Thanks, I'll look into that. We got this for my mom and it’s great!

Mom willingly gave up keys to car, but is now dangerously wandering My Mom hasn’t been definitively diagnosed, it’s could be Alzheimer’s or Dementia, she is 65. What can we do? Is GPS tracking an option? A Memory Care facility may be needed. Stay strong. Look into medical alert bracelets. There are GPS options, and at least people will be able to help if she wanders and someone finds her. So the first thing you need is a diagnosis, that’s the key to starting any sort of process for additional care and support. There’s a chance it might not be dementia at all so you really need to get this part sorted . Not sure how it works where you are, in the UK we just book a GP (primary care physician ) and take our relative along and say ‘I’m worried about their memory ‘ and it goes along a diagnostic and referral process from there. Until you have a diagnosis you can’t make informed decisions about what should happen or how you’ll access those next steps. I was thinking that you could try geofencing. At least, you'd know where they likely are, but nothing is really foolproof. If the vehicle isn't driven often, just unhook a battery cable. But in the meantime, unhooking the battery will prevent her from endangering others. for the wandering make sure it's an anklet with GPS because they never think to check the ankle.	0
Recommendations for GPS tracking bracelet and door alarm I’ve just joined this subreddit and I did try to scroll through to see if there’s any posts about this but didn’t see any. Until then, can anyone recommend a brand of GPS tracking bracelet and door chime that they have used. And what other equipment or resources have been helpful for you? Besides some theft because he's leaving doors open, I decided to install security cameras that send me an alert whenever they detect motion. That way I'll know when he's left, what direction he went, what he was wearing. It's peace of mind for me since I work an hour away from where I live. I've also installed Echo Dots around the house so I can drop in and turn them into intercoms. I can set up reminders, etc. Doesn't answer exactly what you asked but might help lead to some better solutions for your predicament. We used tile for a bit but it is reliant on having people with devices around so we weren’t comfortable with it.	0
"There are a few Human Drug/Treatment Trials going on, but they're few, far between, you have to live near a hospital that offers them, many times they don't work, and anything they do find is years away from being available to the public.The sufferers and caregivers who do the best with this disease are those who plan for the future. They know what the next stage is and they've already done the research and signed the papers. Electronic GPS like a Tile can help here. All financials nailed down, local laws researched, support group/network for caregiver found and activatedDNR, ""quality of living"", death, corpse arrangements, burial arrangements discussed ahead of timeLong-Term Care Health Insurance attained (ASAP, the longer you wait the more expensive it will be) Shared home prepared for sufferer to live with caregiver (separate doors, ramps, extra rooms, extra baths, etc)Patient diagnosed with dementia, usually ""mild to moderate"" stageMedications to deal with side-effects prescribed, such as Sundowner's, violent tendencies, hallucinations, etc.Medications to help with actual Alzheimer's prescribed.

Memory Care Facilities are not cheap, they  can run between $2,000 - $10,000+ a month. I hope that anyone else can chime in if I've missed anything.​ETA: Thanks to u/Mitzukai_9 for the tips on costs, and added/modified points 1, 5, 9, and 18.It always hurts to hear, but it’s good to be prepared and know. We just buried grandma (96) today; she suffered from this horrible disease also. God speed, everyone dealing. We're between step 11 and 12 currently. This is incredibly helpful. This company is in New Jersey and she worked there well over 25years ago. We  corrected here but she stubbornly refused we were right until a couple minutes later. It's eating me up inside, and my dad has acknowledged a couple times that he suspects she may have it. It's too heavy a subject for us (my brother and dad) to really talk about or consider. This is a horrible disease and you deserve better. Like something just isn't registering and she's back to solitaire. :( It could be a low grade infection, like a uti or something, or even dehydration. Thank you for this information. I have no idea what to do. We're at #17 and it is becoming clear after applying for all state benefits and trying to get my father in a nursing home with our limited funds and only Medicaid to pay; I honestly hope he moves on to the inability to swallow stage and chokes to death."	0
Since previous generations with dementia didn’t always use technology to the extent that people do now, I’m having trouble finding resources on how to handle the current problems and how to handle things as she gets worse.Does anyone on here have a loved one with dementia who is it was an active user of technology, and how have you handled things when they could no longer manage certain or all aspects of technology as time went on? I’m out of my element here! That said, I know absolutely nothing about this. You would of course have to be able to access them financially logistically etc.	0
Tracker on iphone Has anyone put a tracker on their parents phone? How do you do that if you aren’t on the same payment plan?I use google maps and use the “share my location” feature set to “always”. Thanks!! Basically I set everything up, my mom doesn't even know it's on there. My Dad still drives, so am getting him a Sprint Drive, which  not only tracks location, but has Emergency Roadside Assistance and WiFi hotspot. Don’t need Sprint to purchase.	0

My Mom is taking a 12 week long night job at Walmart as a “Remodel Associate” at 70 - Help! For the last few years she’s slowing been declining mentally and physically, not enough that she can’t take care of herself but enough to see that she could use someone around and is definitely aging. For over 20 years my mom worked hands on in a woodworking shop until it went out of business 3 years ago. She has had 2 jobs since then in the same field but neither of them lasted long. She has fallen for online scams guaranteeing she will be hired for a fee, and gets endless notifications and calls from “jobs” on her phone. Last week she told me she was going to interview at Walmart and when followed up to ask her how it went, something was off. The more I kept asking questions about it she started to change the subject and I straight out said “mom, you are changing the subject because you don’t want me to ask questions about this Walmart thing. I looked up this position it says it is fast paced and psychically demanding, and that the duties are unloading trucks, removing and installing fixtures and stocking. She refuses to listen to any of my siblings or I about the dangers and insanity of her doing this job and keeps insisting she can do it. I am at a loss as to what to do. I am concerned for her well being, especially with this being overnight. I have a newborn, my sister is out of state and my brother also doesn’t know what to do. Any advice is greatly appreciated. She needs a job. Maybe not for the money, but because she needs something to do, to feel useful, for her emotional health, possibly for her physical health since keeping moving helps.Reading between the lines; She's been telling you this, but you don't seem to be listening. Is this the best or right job for her? They can either help you get through to her, or provide you with a path forward in talking to her Dr's and getting POA if she's mentally slipping badly. The things that age a person the most later in life is not having a purpose and not having social outlets. What types of jobs do you think are available for someone who is 70? How many 70 year olds are working in your company or your siblings companies? You have a big chip about Walmart, but they employ many older people when others will not.She went through an interview and they saw her ability level.	0
And not sure if this is the proper sub; tell me and I'll remove if it isn't.My uncle is going through this disease. So we are looking for a device so that he can go for a walk and we can know where he is and if he is ok.We tested - without success - a device like this and this one. He also hates tech (no even regular phone, since I have memories), so an smartphone is discarded.We have thought of giving him a smart watch (analog appearance). Maybe he wants to take it and not take it away, but we're not sure about this.Any ideas? Any source to look for a solution?We just want him to be happy for as long as possible, but in a safety way.Thank you in advanceThey have systems like this that may help:  https://www.angelsense.com/protect/dementia/?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=DSA_search_dynamic_US_Can&gclid=CjwKCAjw-OHkBRBkEiwAoOZql5vpYpqQn7IgSTuWN9glGGSTzHuCmHG_USbo3RhIXvsr2dhMw8AIWBoCqdMQAvD_BwE  I'm checking this and the GPS Shirt could be an option. Thank you very much! you could attach a bluetooth tracker like Tile to items he usually carries, such as keys. it's not 100% coverage but a good backup if he forgets or disables another device.	0
"I have HUM devices on both of their vehicles, but the tracking function doesn't seem to work very well. On top of that their house is a mess, it seems like mom goes out and buys duplicates of the same antiques, books and kitchen wares- making for a semi-hoarder scenario. The house is a giant cluster-fuck. Gonna have to use about 30 or 40 hours of free time to get it organized. So between working my ass off and trying to get the next few classes needed to apply for med school, it's hard to know what to do. Mom kind of wants to talk about it, but is too worried and talking about it seems to make things worse; dad won't talk about any of it with me. I just don't know how to handle or process any of this. Any response or insight is deeply appreciated. Even now. Help them as sparingly as you can but don’t take it over. This could go on for many more years. I threw away TONS of useless junk/trash/god-knows-why-it-was-their stuff. But part of it is a bit of my responsibility, should have been on top of this a while ago You have my sympathy - I have been going through similar things for the past 5 years or so. It is a whole world that you have to learn about to navigate, and if so I would suggest seeing an Elder Law Attorney (certified) to help your parents plan ahead while your mom can participate. There are lots of options for getting care in the home, adult day cares, etc. so nursing homes are only at the very end if at all, and you want to make sure they have a cash flow for care without spending everything, especially if Medicaid is involved.And ""The Car Keys"" - the bain of all children taking care of older parents! There is no good time and no good way to take them away. It's a final admission of no longer being independent and it's so hard.I would focus on getting her a good diagnosis first and other things will fall into place. And please, remember to practice self care. Helping your older parents can and has given many caregivers health problems of their own. There are tons of closed support groups on facebook too! The cab companies in this town charge 2 or 3 times as much. your Mom needs to know how to use Uber/Taxis as an alternative to driving. It's a small thing, it's manageable. Not a single enormous chunk of time that is impossible to find. Get on their HIPAA forms at their dr's offices. You'll need to get it directly from the Dr. You might not be able to make it to the appointments, but you can get on the forms to get the information for yourself. Next door or down the street?Do they have a neighbor with a kid who could be paid to come over and do simple chores - like helping move small furniture out of the house, or mowing the lawn, or changing a lightbulb, or even driving somewhere? I think we finally have an interim living situation so we can get their house sold, but just cleaning out their 10K square foot, ex-marina, stuffed house with a 3K sq foot carport, and multiple vehicles and boats on the property that aren't in running condition - it's stressful just to consider. Right now all I can do is track her iPhone which she often forgets to take with her, the necklace sounds like a great idea. Bought her the first smartphone she's ever had, she loses it frequently. Also, check out wyzecams. The nicer model ($10 more) has a speaker and connects via Wi-Fi. I know that diet and a sedentary lifestyle has not helped, on top of her having surgery and chemo a couple years ago.The 2x day split with calls is a great idea, will definitely incorporate that!I have some close friends that live around the area and will come check, and help if they have the time. You're really on point about getting someone who is more available. Luckily the live in a college neighborhood and maybe I can find some young, well-minded college student to help them out.Good god, I can't imagine taking on the task you have at hand. Good luck and you'd be surprised who may be willing to help for a good price. When my grandpa was in a similar situation we hired local high school kids/farm hands to help. Cleared out a bunch of old tractors and other industrial-level machines. You have my sympathies as well “Elder care/Senior Care” are the search words you want. Everything from getting a intermittent housekeeper, to hospice. We never want to go through this but there is no option. Failure or buckling down under pressure is no option."	0
Hey all ! I'm currently a research student at California State University Los Angeles, and I am helping conduct a study about how caregivers such as yourselves communicate with chronically ill family members and their doctors. Unfortunately as you may realize, few resources focus on the additional impact that illness has on family members who care for the patient. We are conducting this study to better learn how to support YOU. I understand many of you are busy, especially with the responsibilities of caring for your loved ones, so any help is greatly appreciated!This study does not seek any financial or monetary gain-it is simply to better support caregivers. I really appreciate you all taking the time to read this post or consider the survey. I wholeheartedly admire the strength you all display on a daily basis in caring for your loved ones.Survey link: Please enter my name (Alexander Guillen) as the person who referred you to the survey at the end.This post has been removed. Please post requests for research in our Research Wednesday thread. It is stickied at the top of the sub.	0
Could use tips Hi all!&#x200B;I come here today with sad news. I visit with her several times a week. I already had to install a tracking app on her cell phone since she has gotten lost several times. 1st, sorry to hear about your grandma, my mom has it but just keep remembering how things were got me through some of the frustrating times. BUT I will say find a Alzheimer's support group for you and your family members LOCALLY, trust me your going to need it for the long haul for support as well as getting tips locally in terms of supplies/help as it progresses. I have already started looking into local support groups. Feel free to pm me if you need someone to talk to. Also, if she gets to a point where she can't eat, does she want to have a PEG tube for feeding?Alz.org is a great place to start. There is also a wonderful group on Facebook called Memory People. ❤️ You said you added a tracker app to her cell phone. Keep in mind, that the time will come when she will lose her phone, maybe repeatedly. Have a back up plan, if possible. Once she is gone, that history will be lost.	0
Out film is about dementia, hence the tag line of this post, something myself and several of our crew care deeply about, and we really want to help with awareness of this cruel illness. Our film summed up is about an old man who views himself as his younger self, and because of this he’s confused as to why he is in a care home - struggling with care workers that aren’t looking after him in the best way possible. I don’t wish to be insensitive, or to communicate crassly about a really important issue but we’re currently raising funds so we’re able to create our set and pay our lead actor so that we can do this issue justice, the crew have all donated money to our kitty but any help would be appreciated. Our script is in it’s last stage of development, we’re shooting on an Arri Alexa mini, and we’re securing a studio so that we’re able to make this as cinematically pleasing as the message we are conveying. I’m happy to show a copy of the script to anyone that is interested in donating or just generally interested in our project! I’ll leave the link for our gofundme below, and please feel free to contact me on email! On the one hand anything that brings awareness to this illness in a professional way is welcome and needed. On the other you are asking people dealing with it firsthand to help fund your graduate studies. A graduate school film, no matter how well done, is unlikely to actually help advance research so in my mind it would not a donation to the cause, but mostly to you. I can think of better places to actually donate that can directly help and if you read most of the posts here the illness places financial stress on a lot of families. I don't get the impression you have dealt with the disease in your family from the post, though maybe you didn't mention it.&#x200B;I am not trying to dissuade anyone if they feel like giving, just wanted to put my thoughts out there.&#x200B;EDIT: I saw this is your first post as well so you obviously are not familiar with how this works. I completely understand where you’re coming from, I’m aware of how sensitive a post like this is and the implications of it- I’m working as the producer of this project but this is an issue close to the heart of our team and my director (who initially pitched this project), my grandmother suffered with brain tumour associated dementia so I understand.I was trying to be sensitive towards this subject and I apologise completely for any upset caused, it’s difficult to find the appropriate forum/tone for this. Most who post here are struggling to pay caregivers for their loved one, looking for a musing home they can afford etc.	0
Is there a pill planner device that lets you set to a visual notification (light flash) only and no audio alarm? So far this seems to be the best candidate:https://www.amazon.com/MedQ-Reminder-Flashing-Beeping-Keychain/dp/B076653C1D/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=medq+pill+reminder&qid=1550490747&s=hpc&sr=1-4From what I've read this model must do both of the alarms (I contacted the company and am waiting for a reply on this). The planner I'm seeking also needs to have 2 slots a day, and at least 7 cases for a week. Any recommendations?I need something like this for my mom. We don’t trust her with meds anymore. Keep me posted on info on this please. The company said try tapping/covering the audio part.If I remember correctly I may have come across some more expensive pill planners, where they stay locked unless it's the one that needs opening. You could use an Alexa device and a hue changing light. That way there is a log of what I did and I could tie a bulb to it too.	0
"at this same time while Taking care of my mom (mind you I am on SSI and I give half to my mom every single month as rent)  during this time one of my sisters basically has me watching a toddler and mind you there are times where she would ask me to baby sit for 8 hours almost every day while she works there were times where I would get sick of it and tell her no and she would try make me feel bad but I would just hang up, she would just call my mom and tell her she is dropping the baby over even though I said no my mom would tell her ok. (also mind you I was doing this for about 3 years total and check this out.. 8 hours a day almost everyday for 3 years and in total she gave me in grand total close to $100). At the same time I have 2 delinquent cousins would would often stay weeks to months at a time and not offer anything while sleeping and eating here, not even there mothers would compensate (they all work btw). ok back on track, when she is home I find out she fractured her spine when she tried to go in the wheelchair by herself and the wheelchair slammed back to the tv stand and she hit her back with it.&#x200B;Fast forward about 2 months ago. My mom is showing signs again of uti and blood infection and she has not been eating (mind you she is showing all the signs of dementia and I am having to deal with this and it is very hard for me). )I visit my mom every few days, mind you the reason is, its the same each time ""I tell her hi mom, I give her a kiss and right away she tells me these people are keeping her hostage and I must take her home, I inform her as much as I want to I can;t you are sick ""she would go into a range and cuss and insult me and physically try to hurt me"" (hence which is why I told my family they need to be there for her when she is in the hospital)&#x200B;She comes home about a week and a half later, her decline really starts here. I won't be able to fix it because social security says this can only be done by appointment and the earliest they can do on march 20th.I was able to pay jan rent before they took the checks back, my sister is going to pay feb rent and me nor my family have no clue what to do for march rent and I can not do a dang thing until I get my check back and have cash to get a apartment I can afford.&#x200B;I will be ok, but I am just so tired at times. I am lost and have no clue what to do. That feeling I know well. I don't know anything about how you could get help, and I can't do anything to help right now. They can help you find a job and provide on the job training if necessary."	0
Research suggests that helping carers have more compassion for themselves may help with their wellbeing, and by taking part in this questionnaire you will be helping to further our knowledge in this subject. Your participation will provide us with information to better understand carers and hopefully help us develop ways in which we can better support carers in the future. Thanks to those who have completed the survey! More participants will really help me achieve more accurate, thorough results! Every survey helps!	0
Medical alert bracelet suggestions needed Hello,I'm researching different options for a medical alert bracelet, to notify emergency response if there is a fall, etc. Monthly cost is a factor for me, so I'm looking for a budget option that is still reliable. My mom prefers something that is bracelet style, as opposed to a necklace or device to tote in a pocket or something. Are these ever waterproof?Thanks! !I did a bit of research on this a few days ago to someone that had a similar question. My response is hereHope you find what you're looking for! Do more research before buying or subscribing to any service!	0
Do you what? “Do I want?” What do I want?	0
She has so many health problems and can't be left alone as she falls very easily. My brothers are no help and the only break I get is when she is at dialysis a few times a week. I tried everything I could think of to keep it on and finally broke down and bought a video baby monitor. I can't nap during the day, because she doesn't want to wake me up and ends up falling trying to get to the bathroom by herself.I have been begging her health care provider for months and months, for a pulse ox with an alarm. At first they kept telling me there was no such thing, then after doing my own research and finding one, they are dragging their feet on whether or not they are going to approve paying for it.Her worker, home health nurses and everyone else that comes in, are making me feel like I'm doing a bad job taking care of my mom, because she's missed an appointment here and there that was first thing in the morning and there are dishes in the sink and the laundry is piling up. If you can't find a way to sleep, get some rest and get some time to yourself, you'll fall apart and won't be able to take care of your mom anyway. For things like the pulse-ox alarm, try requesting medical equipment or supplies through one of the home health aides or workers. As much as I hate to say it, sometimes those companies are more 'financially motivated' to help you. You might also broach the topic of a 'sitter' through either the home health nurse or directly through your mom's insurance (if she has it). Is assisted living an option either of you could or would consider? Talking to a therapist might help - some will do Skype sessions now. I'm not always great at communication and, like a lot of caregivers, I tend to have a 'solver' mentality. Give yourself a break - you are doing the best you can and sometimes you will have to settle for 'good enough' regardless of what others might think.Wishing you some downtime and a good night's sleep. Assisted living is an absolute last resort. She's been in one, it wasn't a pleasant experience and she's terrified to go back. I admit we, as a society, have a loooong way to go in improving the quality of care facilities. With dialysis and such a low room-air (unassisted) oxygen level, I, like some of the others here, am surprised hospice hasn't been mentioned yet. Or are you not sure? There are pads that can go over the ears to make the tubing more comfortable there, I think usually supplied by the oxygen supplier? I've read that wrapping soft medical tape around the tubing on the face can help. For any dryness (which is always a big gripe), you can use KY (or any water based lubricant) in the nose and beeswax on the lips. We finally switched from home health care to hospice for my father who has Parkinson's with Lewy Body Dementia. We now receive so much more assistance. With all that being said, we are still looking to hire extra help for evening for bedtime. If you've not looked into palliative care that may be something to investigate?I truly hope things get better. This sure isn't easy! Drop your mom off at your brother's house saying you will be on a week's vacation. Leave detailed instructions. These are the people that can give you the best advice, as they are aware of the situation.Please take care of yourself. I'm making the best use of the available help that I can. The state home health regulation format or whatever its called that they use to determine how many hours a day they will pay a caregiver, is only 3 hours a day. Which is neither here nor there. I thought this was a place to share and talk with other caregivers who would understand how hard this is... not have yet another person tell me I should be getting help from the agencies, which have thus far, proven to be decidedly unhelpful. I have been run ragged and in circles, I have gone back and forth between my mom's primary doctor and the pulmonologist to the social workers and medical supply/ insurance company. All well saying they can't approve more hours so I can get another caregiver coming in here. By worker, I meant her Long Term Care worker and LTC nurse. You didn't give many details and I was trying to find support that you may have missed. Thanks for trying to be helpful. Just want to add that you may want to consider finding a geriatric care manager. For what it's worth,  they'll dig up all the info you need to find to get the help you need for your mom. There are a lot of resources, some free. Those hospital/LTC give you the minimal.	0
Caring for a caregiver Hey everyone. Hoping that someone in here has some advice that I can pass along. It was said from the start that the breathing mask was a temporary solution because it can cause skin to break down around the mask area. After being presented with all of these options and then looking to good old google, SIL told the doctors that she wanted a trach put in instead of the other options. My inlaws strongly advised against the trach but ultimately SIL went that route. My inlaws have very good insurance thankfully that has covered most of the expenses that have been incurred in this whole ordeal. After deciding that she wanted the trach, SIL also informed my inlaws that because she will need full time care after the trach, she's moving back home. But by no means are they wealthy. Because my SIL has decided to move home, they have incurred huge financial costs related to moving her in. Total cost of this was around $30k to do everything needed done to make it work. Even after insurance helps, they are looking at another $50k out of pocket. All in all they are going to spending around $100k out of pocket just to be able to move her in. Very good insurance that my inlaws have cover something like 100 hours per week of care. Even longer stretches on the weekend while they are home. They even had a no show from a night nurse so my FIL had to take the 10pm-5am shift and then go into work. They have no down time, no off time, no time to relax. Because this situation is still unfolding, I don't think it has fully sunk in yet, but I'm incredibly angry for them. A decision that they had no control over has cost them money and their freedom. Before this whole thing with SIL happened, my FIL was talking about fast tracking retirement to this year. My MIL had a calendar with every marked with a countdown to when she could retire next year. What I don't know is what happens to people that don't have parents that have enough money to pay to accommodate them at home. Some kind of care facilities or homes that would be great for SIL, and allow my inlaws to feel that they are giving her proper care without having to destroy their lives in the process. What can they do? What is out there for them to be able to help? Any ideas or services you might know of would be greatly  appreciated. Or a transport service could be used. Make sure that she has applied for all assistance she qualifies for and take advantage of all of it. Thanks for the info. I know they have looked into some things, but she seems to be in a weird limbo where there aren't government programs available to her. I'm sure there are other things out there but I am just starting trying to figure out where to look. Please check it again, there are no age restrictions for diagnosis that I am aware of. It's worth taking the time to explore, because so many services are tied to having it. I'll dig into some SSI info. Thanks! Best place to get info is directly from Social Security. try making an appointment! Outside help is required to ease their burden, and throwing money at the issue is just going to make things more difficult down the line. I'd like to offer to look up some resources in their area, a zip code should be enough for me to work with. You can reply with it, or PM me and I'll find what I can with the info you've provided.One bit of info I would give is always look for resources and assistance for anything regarding care. Don't just take the insurance recommendation, do some legwork of your own, and see if their suggestions are whats best for your situation.What I would be looking for:Paratransit. - if they live in a metropolitan area, odds are there is a disability program in their public transportation system. Insurance. Its great that your in-laws have good insurance, but is it possible for her to get her own? Your state's health options may be able to help out, and may come with a social/case worker  that can assist in other ways. She could have her independence but the assistance she needs when she needs it.Theres a lot of research to do! I hope your in-laws are willing to let others help them. It may save their financial future. All good suggestions. Everyone in the family needs to be proactive in looking into options. Asking for advice in online forums like this is a great way to find ideas you might not think of on your own. I wish I had something constructive to tell you, it's a terrible situation for your in-laws. You might want to start checking for alternative care for the SIL sooner than later. Other than that, feel free to rant anytime, we're here to listen. Appreciate it! Many hands make light(er) work. This can be a starting point for complex needs for professional help—referrals, directions to seek when they don't even know what they need. Best wishes and virtual hugs. Thankfully my FIL has a very clear cut estate plan for when things do come up. Both inlaws are very wise with their money and have made it a goal for the kids to have nothing to fight over when they are gone because everything is pre planned. Eventually we would like to get that as well, but it was something like 30 hours of training needed to be able to help. These are like paid social workers who dig up all the info and resources in the particular community that pertains to the particular situation.	0
She has become forgetful and thinks her neighbour is stealing her money sometimes and had a few episodes of being very upset. She isn't sure on days of the week but I can understand if you don't have daily tasks it's easy to lose track. We did have the opportunity to speak privately with a social worker and the dr. You could call the clinic ahead of time and ask them what to expect. It is certainly an important interview but it's perhaps an idea to write a statement pre interview and let doctor assess her without too much input, only when necessary. I just want an honest determination so we can move forward. My mum's mum and all her sisters unfortunately suffered so I hope to lessen my mum's anxiety with early intervention and a decent care package. That's very decent of you to pass me the information rikwilliams. I'll get a read over it and perhaps ring. i work in the Digital team at the Society, but the Helpline team exist to speak with people just like you. Best wishes. Rik. and remember to take care of yourself as well, i know the process is very exhausting. During the appointment, there’s a lot of head shaking behind her as the doctor asks her questions, and prompts from us to a more accurate answer. As far as diagnosis they had her do a short (15 min) memory test and once that came back with poor results they had her do a long (1 hr) memory test and thats when they came back with Alzheimer’s. Though we sort of already knew by that point and it was just formalizing it. Doctors are overwhlemed, over worked, and rushed. Otherwise they don't get on the table and will not be addressed.	0
This isn't so much of a problem during the day, but at night all the bedrooms are towards the back of the house and the sofa is in the living room (where he likes to move to) and it's very hard to hear him when we are asleep even with our doors open. Is there any kind of alert device that is very simple, maybe just one big button, that he could press and alarm us loud enough at night to know that he needs help? I'm completely new to caregiving but I don't want to leave him in a position where he is calling for us and I'm so sound asleep I can't hear him. I've heard most people use baby monitors, I'm just worried I'll either A. not hear him as I'm a very sound sleeper or B. The feedback will keep us awake. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.Smart Caregiver Two Call Buttons & Wireless Caregiver Pager https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0032FMSWS/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_hUXbCbY6HTSDFThis thing has saved my life and his. Works everywhere around my house and yard. Cheaper than most baby monitors. THIS is exactly what I was looking for. Admittedly, I'm a light sleeper, so YMMV, but it's a good first step before springing for something more fancy/expensive. I care for my father with the wonderful assistance of Hospice. I realize Hospice may not be an option for your grandfather, but Hospice ordered a bed and chair alarm for him. It’s called MultiPro Safety Alarm from the Skil-Care Association. It literally was just delivered so I can’t speak to the effectiveness yet or the cost as it was covered by insurance. It’s essentially a pad that has a pressure sensor and will alarm if he moves from it. Skil-care.com  Yeah we looked into hospice and unfortunately his needs are just too sporadic that he really needs someone here all day long. I will check out the alarm though. It has helped me with deciding what to purchase so we can help out with my aunt as we care for her. You don't need to pick it up to use, just hit it with a part of ones hand. You can buy them online.	0
Help with parent wishes vs medical advice My mother has lived alone with in-home help for several years. We have suspected, but she is particularly non-compliant with the advice of medical personnel. Seeing little girls, thinking traffic lights were Christmas lights, seeing pizza restaurants that weren't there. Two people who are causing problems are her former home CNA and her caseworker. Her friends are tellingme they will take care of her, as well as this caseworker and aide, who have seriously been troublemakers for me. Or am I just jumping to nursing home placement too soon. Additionally, talk to your local police. Let them know where your mom is staying, show any documentation, names of who might call to make trouble, etc etc etc. This will head the troublemakers, or your mom, off at the pass. It will be lots stress managing emotions with  her dementia. Some people get aggressive too and with a child you should not risk it. I couldn’t even schedule the day. That means they are using invalid information to base their complaints. They either need to come see her in person or shut up. What's worked for many years may no longer work. The other wound up moving to assisted living a couple years before their death, realizing in-home care was getting too complicated. They are typically realistic and detailed, such as images of children or animals. Source Thanks for a great reply. We plan on getting her into a dementia care unit, under the care of a neurologist, and then hope to move her back to a less restrictive living environment if her symptoms are adequately controlled or truly do improve.	0
Disabled, aging mother can no longer care for herself I'm trying to figure out the best course of action my sister and I can take to help our mom. She is 67 years old and has been disabled (medical issues) for nearly 20 years. She has lupus, diabetes, kidney disease, heart problems, and is mentally ill (bipolar/likely BPD). We think living alone is unsafe for her and would like to explore what options we have for getting her into an assisted living facility, which will likely be against her wishes. Do I need to speak with a lawyer? We are overwhelmed and have no idea where to start. Any advice that can be given would be greatly appreciated!Additional info that might be helpful:She is on Medi-calShe has an in-home support/caregiver type person who is allotted about 30 hours per week. Financially, I am willing and able to pay for part of the cost of assisted living, so we wouldn't rely entirely on Medi-cal/Social security.Thank you!I do not have details on a conservatorship, but I recently read an article in OC Register (Sept 23, 2018) about Probate and Conservatorship that you should read.I personally have Power of Attorney for my mother established a few years ago and it gives me full power over her financial details. My sister is my mother's Health Care Proxy and she handles all the details of my mother's health with various doctors. Use an elder law specialist.My mother lives in an assisted living complex that also has independent living, which is what she thinks she is. You will have to research what is local and how they work, what they cost, etc. Be careful what you sign in terms of guaranteeing payment. I signed one for my mother as POA for paying the assisted living place with her money, but won't sign one for a nursing home which I know will require filing for Medicaid once her money is spent down. I don't want to guarantee personally paying $13,000/month at a nursing home!First, though, she will need a nursing evaluation to determine her level of care needs, which I assume she has since she qualifies for home services. Can you replace the bad help? Can you hire a nurse to come once a week and fill a pill box that separates pills into am/pm?	0
He's always wanted to help out, he's always been a great dad. He was active as a scout leader back in my scouting days. My aunt is here helping now, but that's soon coming to an end. I'm thankfully a seasonal worker so I have time to be around, since winter is here.Just recently my mom let us know she can't do it anymore, which I completely understand. We're currently trying to figure out the whole nursing home situation, which will be an absolute shitshow. He's got the money for it, but at \~$8000/m won't last forever. Taking him to the home, without his dog, is going to be horrible.I'd usually been able to decipher what he's talking about, he's usually pretty close with things, as in if he's talking about the cat, he'll say dog. Her stories are absolutely crazy and I could relate to A LOT of what you said.Your family being together and helping one another with this is the most amazing thing you can ask for, and when the time comes to move him somewhere that he can have the care he needs, it won’t be nearly as difficult as a family torn. I’m asking because I’m anticipating the same thing with my mom in the near future, just wondering how others gear up for it. Sorry for getting back to you so late. Our plan is to take him to a walking track (which we frequently do) then stop at the home on our way back. It's going to be a shitshow and we all know that won't go over well. The way the place wants us to do it is to drop him off and just let them do their thing. In the past, posters have mentioned the following resources:https://www.alz.org/help-support/community/r/caregivers/r/Alzheimers/	0
"Advice on moving from home to care home. We have nurses & companions visiting two times a day to administer meds, food & company and we visit in the evenings after work to walk the dog, stock the fridge, talk and provide evening meal. Simple questions but what a disaster!Last week she could have easily fed the dog but not now. ""Let me show you where the dog food is. The pasta shapes fall out of the packaging and all over the floor. They are mouldy and nasty! We have sound and channel change but no visuals. I get stuck into this and after checking cables, batteries, sockets, input device and running through a few re-boots I determine that the backlight has gone and the TV is done-for. There is food all over the place! It's all over the worktops, on her hands and up to her elbows, on her face...  She is busy trying to wipe everything clean with a kitchen cloth but basically speeding fish pie everywhere. I check the fridge and see that in fact the Fish Pie is not the only foodstuff that has been opened. This is going to have an impact...So, things have rapidly changed over the last few months, weeks and days. The only alternative is for one of us to give up work to become full-time carers or get a live-in carer but what she really needs is company and a safe environment - not being closeted up in her own home. advised a few days ago that our time on the waiting list is over and we can have a room next week. We know this will be a huge stressful event and are mulling over how we should announce it and perform it...  Any experiences good / bad and advice would be gratefully received. What are the Do's and Don'ts of transferring to a specialist care home?You're doing the right thing. Thanks. Maybe a favorite chair, lots of pictures on the wall, we have residents that have a wipe board or a calendar and write down when family saw them and when they will be back next so the hcw can show them if they ask where everyone is. Paid companions are great they will take your loved one out to get their hair or nails done or out for lunch because the hcw on a unit well be looking after 6 to 9 other people and won't have a lot of time to socialize with the resident. We do have a familiar chair and cabinet and plenty of pictures and bits and bobs to bring...   A family album of pictures is a good idea - we'll put something together an try that as a distraction. We have got a whiteboard for the carers and us to write on - we were hoping that she could read it to understand what is happening each day but sadly her concept of time is shot and reading comprehension is low. All of us here know how soul-killing this process can be. Bring in whatever perfumes cleaning products, room sent Etc that she used it home. Thanks. The trick, I think, is for us to make the room as familiar as possible. I know I need to be here. Set up her new room prior to bring her. We got the place all set up nicely with her own bed, lazy boy chair, small table & chairs. And pictures hung on the wall. Thanks. We are off to the home shortly to assess the room and then start preparing the list of things and how to do it. He has somewhat of a companion, but recently she's been declining and so has he. I prepared the room ahead of arrival and we managed to cajole her into the car and then out of the car and into the entrance and then she refused to budge."	0

My grandfather (78 in March) was with her for 56 years and took care of her for all those years of bad heath which started before I was even born and has since felt a hole in his life. One night two months ago he started saying he was seeing explosions and hurricanes outside and was hearing my grandmother talk to him. It was all going well and the meds seemed to calm him down and he was on the right track but lately he has such bad anger. We don’t know if it’s time to find him assisted living, which he’ll fight on that, or if he just needs us to do something we just don’t know because this is all of our first time dealing with this awful disease. His late nephews wife is getting tired of being verbally abused so she is thinking about sending him home to us but I just don’t know how two young girls will be able to take care of a strong 78 year old war vet with random violent tendencies but we also feel like it is wrong to just give him to a home because our grandmother told us to take care of him. I know she didn’t know that this would happen but I feel like I’d be letting her down if I gave up so fast.I’m sorry this is so long but we just don’t know what to do and need advice or tips on how to handle this situation.TLDR cause I know this is long: 78 strong grandfather with recently diagnosed dementia randomly gets very violent verbally and physically, including threats of murder and suicide and we don’t know how to calm him down or handle it at all Your Grandfather absolutely should not be with your young children. You want to look after him, but is it in yours and his best interests?	0
"In 2016 a scan of his brain was done and sure enough....Frontotemporal Dementia and an Alzheimer's diagnosis. I'm trying to promote his independence as much as possible knowing that there is no turning back once the keys are lost but I also don't know at what point that decision should be made.So here I sit....A 36 year old male, who owns and operates 5 businesses, POA and ultimate caregiver to Dad and Grandma with progressing Dementia/Alzheimer's, and I have a wife of 13 years and 3 children...ages 8, 5, 4. I'm trying to balance everything but undoubtedly this caretaking role is taking its toll on my mental and physical health, my marriage, my ability to be the best parent possible,  and my effectiveness as a business owner. I'm in the acceptance phase of this process. I know it's going to get worse and not get better. But I feel like I am on my own island here and I could use some advice, direction, resources from people that have been in a similar situation. I'm open to any questions, feedback, suggestions, or input as to how I can continue to navigate this without sacrificing everything. Thank you in advance.BrianUnfortunately you are going to sacrifice something. This disease is worse on the care takers than the afflicted. Easiest thing would be pitting him in an assisted living or hire home care. I find my job is taking the toll then my marriage (lack of one on one time). At this point I am stuck what to do as he doesn’t have enough resources  to pay for assisted living and we don’t have enough to supplement it. We are waiting in medicaid. Where are you located? I work for an agency currently part time, let me ask if they know of any emergency help. I am located in a suburb of Omaha, Nebraska. I'm learning that there are not many FTD resources in this area and I am thinking about getting involved and changing that.&#x200B; Thank you so much. It takes a toll. All we can do is try to be patient and do what we can. He wasted a lot of his savings, but we are still able to afford in home care. Driving for at least four years. We've found that people will come and take him to movies or out for meals when we contact them and it makes him so happy. It's not a hugely busy sub but there is support here and some good ideas for care.Stay strong. My patient's frat brothers from decades ago still come around and visit all the time. I have reached out to his friends and they have been great despite them feeling quite uncomfortable with what to say, what not to say, etc. My best friend is in town for the holidays and texted me to ask when would be a good time to swing by so she could see him knowing he's so lonely. They don't get enough credit. I'm not even really sure where to start. Enlist help, if not from family, then see what his insurance covers. Look into respite care. There's actually a lot of resources and support out there. And I'm happy to talk and help if possible. With this routine, there isn't much time to spend focusing on my business or my wonderful wife and 3 young children. I told my boss about you and he said he'd be willing to talk to you if you'd like. That's an amazing offer. Thank you so much! Just let me know. I went to several meetings and found out about local resources for help. They helped me and informed me of resources available for help. In my state (Texas), there are five or six:  a will, listing my sister and me as co-executorsa legal power of attorney, allowing us to make legal decisions on Mom's behalf; a medical power of attorney, allowing us to make medical decisions on Mom's behalf; a HIPPA form, allowing doctors to inform us as to Mom's medical condition and test results; a do-not-resuscitate form (DNR, also called Physician's directive), informing medical  personnel what to do in case Mom cannot be resuscitated; Additionally, there is a ""Guardianship in case of incapacitation"" form, which makes the children legally responsible for the elderly parent. Some government agencies will not accept photocopies, they require an original document. They can help discover assistance programs that you never knew about. This has helped in handling her financial matters. We found all of her bank accounts, and consolidated it all to one account. 7) In the earlier stages of her decline, we hired a home senior care person to come in and sit with Mom several hours a day, and to cook meals for her at her home (www.homeinstead.com). Message me separately if you need to. I am his POA and we have adjusted his trust/living will. Banks are on board. Dad has BOTH FTD and Alzheimer's so we are trying to reach out to the local resources to find support for both diseases. Hi, I wanted to let you know you're not alone. For now, there are quite a few resources about legit support groups, https://www.theaftd.org/living-with-ftd/support-for-care-partners/Aftd is a great resource. Support groups are more helpful than you think. Please start researching care facilities or care givers to help. My husband has had PPA for about 3 years and is starting to demonstrate behavioral symptoms which can happen between the two variants. AFTD has 0 resources in Omaha, NE. My degrees are in social work and I am thinking that getting involved and helping to to bring these AFTD support groups and such to Nebraska. I can't change the diagnosis for Dad but I am 100% committed to doing what I can to spread the word about this terrible disease and find ways to reach others that are in this struggle as well. The neurologist doesn’t know either. You’ll know hopefully when the right time to take the car away is. Feel free to DM me anytime. Thank you so very much! I told her the car was broken, which it was, and then have the mechanic tell her it was a irreparable. Luckily his vehicle is a lease and has to be turned in soon. That may just be a blessing. I too am a business owner and operator of a consultant group and  work with a few companies in leadership roles. I too am my fathers only relative who can manage and care for his affairs. I am currently in the process of gaining guardianship, which has been difficult due to my fathers reluctance and non-acceptance of his failing state.I just want you to know you are not alone, and that people like you and I are forced into this position and in many ways can have closure for the ways our fathers behavior may have impacted us. In some ways, although this feels like the worst time of my life (business is not doing to well and financially insecure), in many ways i feel the most sense of relief. My only worry now is that my father is safe, i can manage his affairs, I can maintain my relationship and stay a float financially. Find balance, and learn everything you can.cheers,Steven Thank you so much Steven! I am so sorry to hear about what you are going through. Your feedback is spot on and this has been a journey that I wouldn't wish on anyone. It's for his safety, well-being, and for my own relief. Even to bounce ideas back and forth. Brian Fox i think you mentioned the difficulty and lack of resources/process there seems to be available in these matters. I would like to fight for protocols to be in place, similar to that of a psychiatric disturbance, which can be initiated to identify and prevent further tertiary destruction that comes with these situations. &#x200B;I am not sure where you are located  but i am out of Nevada and we do not seem to have anything in place to make this efficient or effective. Simple solution but I am not currently doing this. If I can be of support to you in any way, please let me know."	0
I guess it's time for *me* to share. TL;DR at the end.The past couple of months have been rough on me. My wife (who has multiple debilitating physical conditions, Fibromyalgia, tendonitis, arthritis, GERDS (just to name a few) and some mental health stuff leftover from her stint in the Navy) has been having some severe 'episodes' where her muscles contract along her spine and shoulders. It's the only thing that has helped her get through these episodes. It doesn't help that the closest VA emergency room is in San Francisco, an hour drive away in good traffic. So we did. Went to SFVA the next day (last Friday). The biggest stressor was just not knowing what was wrong. I apologize in advance if I'm not as responsive during this next week, but I will be with her the entire time (save for some sanity breaks, and/or possibly a couple of meals). She's had them since we went to the hospital, and staying with us this past week to help us out. I really don't know how we'd do this without her help. We've talked about possible diagnoses, from a seizure disorder, to cancers.. but right now, it doesn't matter.	0
Moving in with my mother was a mutually beneficial arrangement. My wife had to make a career change and lowering our rent allowed us to more easily afford some time with her out of work, plus we could start saving for a house. After a year and a half, and multiple discussions, my mother continues to violate my wife and I's boundaries by moving our things around (problematic for my wife), eats some of our foods (not basic staples, problematic for me on shift work), and doesn't want to share the common parts of the house with any of our stuff. Very little closet and storage space. I spent $1,000 and a few weeks last year remodeling the attic into a loft so that we'd have our own space, but it's not habitable year round due to limited climate control in the summer. I know this stuff is pretty petty but here's the thing. We've discussed this multiple times and things haven't changed. We pay half the mortgage and 2/3 of the utilities but have very little storage and living space. I know that bothers my wife more than she let's on. With my wife stable in a new career track and some money in the bank, what obligation do I have to my mother and her continued aging in place? I want to start my life with my wife, not be buried away in a small bedroom and a loft, but then my mother's comfort and quality of life could take a severe dip if we leave her on her own. There are subsidized senior living apartments if you do a little digging and work. A senior living community might be better for her socializing anyway.https://www.after55.com/blog/how-find-low-income-senior-housing/ I moved across country to help care for my mom/parents and am in very much a similar situation, minus them needing my money. I personally feel we should all care for the elders in our family, but we are people with lives too. If it's the latter, then you need to set some ground rules.For myself, I'm moving out. They don't need my rent so I can swing by a few times a week and do meal prep for them, take mom shopping, and clean. No, it may not be what she wants, but, right now, it's not what you want, so you figure out what really matters. The generation over 70 never really had to care for their aging parents because back then, people died mostly before they were 80. It's much better if she can decide on her own to move before that happens, so be sure to inform her of her future before it falls apart. The over-70 crowd in general doesn't believe they are over 50, and live in denial that things are changing.Source: Read some of my replies here an here, this isn't my first rodeo, and the one I'm in now is ongoing. There are options for her living arrangements, maybe even with some financial support from you (send your $ directly to the apartment complex or utility, don't give it to her willy-nilly unless trust is absolute.). We’re considering looking for a house with a detached MIL apartment. We live in a different state and things are looking like she will need to be closer to people who can give her more support than she is currently getting. I can barely survive a 10 day visit with her in my space, so she will absolutely need her own living quarters. A separate house/apartment on the same property that she rents from us feels like it will be the best solution for our situation. If my wife and I can swing a duplex that’ll be nice but it won’t be with any help from my mother. I would move out and let her know she can now go to rest of family for help. /u/intothemirrorFor a approx 3k, invest in a mini split ductless unit for the loft.Yup.... That's money that's supposed to go into your new home savings account.Screw that. Plus the aggravation you are both going through can't be good on your marriage.Get the ductless unit. Put a lock on the attic door.And take the unit when you move.	0
Music players? It soothes, calms, distracts, is generally a great thing. Are there any stand-alone devices out there that include memory storage that we could load with the right music, integrated speakers, and simple (preferably big) buttons for PLAY and STOP? Is there a gadgety subreddit that might have suggestions? I would suggest looking into mp3 players with built in speakers. I plan to do so and will update if I do find anything, but thought I'd recommend you search there as well.I think your question could lead to a great solution, making listening to favorite songs simple. someone made one and published plans to make one yourself! see here:https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8mwaer/make_a_dementia_friendly_music_player/?st=JOBK29EK&sh=eeb8c65f	0
My other favorite things are the non slip plates and the self balancing spoon.EDIT: https://www.liftware.comhttps://www.caregiverproducts.com/non-skid-dinnerware-dishes.html Very cool products. Are there any other websites that you use to find good caregiving products? Most of the ones I know of are from working for large state care companies, they were always good about getting new, helpful products. Those things are amazing. Where do you tend to purchase all of those products? Bed Bath and Beyond. On their website, it's called Drive Medical Premium Series Spa Safety Bath Chair. Also a baby monitor. Instacart! If all else fails...we have groceries.	0
Caregiving for my father is unsustainable. Help? On several occasions he's made near-catastrophic blunders like bringing tanks of gasoline into the basement near the heater's pilot light.However, between his lies and doctoral incompetence, we've been completely unable to establish the gravity of the situation. Social workers have told us there's nothing they can do because he isn't in imminent danger (because we who live with him been breaking our backs to keep it that way for our own sakes, let alone his). He himself can't be confronted directly because he's always had a paranoid streak and becomes angry and abusive when pressed on even minor issues.I'm 30, and between caring for my parents and my own health issues have never had the chance to make a life for myself, and certainly not now that we're down a set of hands and with somebody needing constant supervision. Extenuating circumstances prevent us from moving out, as if we had the time to search. If we're lucky he'll concede to give her DPOA and we'll be able to do something the next time he has a crisis, but there's no guarantee that he will (as he's perfectly content to make us come to him to rubber-stamp the bills), and even if he does I'm not sure we can hold out until the next crisis.We can't keep this up. Need mri and ct and the psychological testing. And Medicare will make sure he has spent every cent he owns before it will cover anything. And when he runs out of cash, proceeds from the sale of his house, where it sounds like you guys are living, will have to be used to pay for it before Medicare will step in. Call Adult protective Services. That is my job. This helped us get our mom on the right track.Ditto what SoloHappyCup said about finances. Unfortunately one answer would depend on his insurance and what your options are financially. If you can find another doctor he would be willing to go to that might be more sympathetic to this specific issue that couldn't hurt maybe? IN my dads case as I got more involved with taking him to doctor visits I realized this is the same family doctor he has been going to for years. And while I have no doubt he did counsel my dad about his overweight issues and lack of exercise as he had two previous strokes before this last one that brought on the dementia, I feel like for years he somewhat enabled my dad by giving my dad reassurance that he was fine. And if you notice any family member trying to 'take care of everything' themselves, do your best to help them, and yourself. Well what culminated in the family doctor taking us seriously was when my mother lost the car and denied even driving it and parking it.	0

We're the only ones local family, my dad lives 2 hours away but we're lucky if he comes by once every few months. At the time we moved in, she was still pretty independent and was able take care of herself for the most part (bathing, cooking, meds, finances etc.) Since then, my grandma's health has deteriorated, slowly at first and then a couple months back pretty significantly. On top of it all we're worried now that her mental faculties are fading (constantly forgets conversations, sometimes immediately after they occur, forgetting basic info about herself, losing track of when she takes her meds). We've rearranged our whole lives to try and accommodate her, but now it's starting to hurt my relationship with my fiance and our relationship with grandma and it's made it impossible to focus in school or make any long term decisions (we are both in the sciences and are looking at grad school... Based on this current trend I'm worried things are only going to get worse, and the burnout factor is already really strong. I dunno what to say, guess the stress of the last month or so just finally sank in. /End rant[deleted] Thank you so much for your kind words! I have family on my mom's side that's offered to help but it's been really tough convincing grandma she'd be ok with one of them. My best wishes to you and your family! The same offer extends to you, my inbox is always open.	0
Can I help my mom vote? November is coming up and we always vote, but mom has trouble filling out forms. She's gonna need someone to help keep her on track and help her remember who is who and so forth. Contact your local county elections to get directions on the signature part. We've wondered this for my dad too. It may be easier done as an absentee ballot or defining a proxy. May be too late for this election to designate a proxy or setup an absentee.https://blog.alzheimers.org.uk/campaigns/general-election/ There should be plenty of time to get an absentee/mail ballot in most states. Usually they can be requested online and arrive quickly. If you don't have enough time to mail them back you can always drive them to the elections office.I took my mom to early voting in 2016 and was allowed to stand in the voting area with her. She can't do it -- even by absentee she lacks the ability to indicate a valid preference, and she was never uber-partisan so we couldn't even predict who she might vote for if she could understand it. Voting is something we can definitely get her out of the house for, and it will make her feel involved. My state allows anyone 65 or older to request an absentee ballot for all future elections, including primaries. I have full power of attorney for my mom. If it is completed with assistance, there are boxes to check indicating why, one of them is the voter is disabled. That's what I checked for my mom.Check with your Secretary of State'd office to be sure. I worked with a woman who 'helped' her mother vote using an absentee ballot - the mother did know recognize her daughter, did not know current events or day of week, so basically it was her daughter voting twice.	0
Assisting with taking care of dad with dementia I am currently helping my mom pack up so my dad, who had dementia, and her can move halfway around the world to be closer to family. I noticed tv works well but almost too well. He needs a clock to tell him it's bed time, I'm thinking a toddler clock that shows red for sleep time and green for awake time night be good.I'm also thinning about gps tracking. What's a good option for someone that doesn't always bring a phone or wear a watch?Lastly, any other tips? I'm worried that the new environment will be trickier than any of us imagine. Make sure to have thier favorite foods on hand, helps Them feel like they belong there if stuff they snack on is around. (my GMA has to have orange soda at all times or she thinks we hate her and want her to die or that she's just visiting and wants to go home) Idk if any of this will help but its important to our family when dealing w dementia. Thanks for sharing, I think this is a really good tip, didn't even think about it Lots of different GPS options these days even including things like shoe inserts.If he is liable to wander it would be worthwhile asking local police if they have a scheme to register his details with them. A sensor for the front door that beeps will be helpful. Also- pictures help. A picture of a family member (even one from his childhood) on the front door will help him to know that this is the right house.Night lights for the bathroom and hallway are a must for people with memory issues in a new location, as it can be hard to know where to go in a strange house, in the dark.I have found that fewer possessions make things less confusing for memory patients. It's nice to have comforting items with them but too many things can be disorienting and makes it easy to lose things. We got my father-in-law a clock like this: https://www.amazon.com/American-Lifetime-Newest-Version-Clock/dp/B019G79V1Q/Seems like a rip-off for what it is, but it was worth it. I had been considering using an old android tablet and a clock app/screensaver, but I tested it at home and it would occasionally freeze or the screen would sleep and it would need to be restarted/reset. I got this exact clock for my mom, on a whim, as we were relocating my parents closer to us. 100% worth the price, imo. Doesn’t need setting or adjusting... automatically sets itself to the correct time and day when plugged in.	0
How do you keep yourself organized? I keep loose leaf binder with folders in it that contain all the medical information. Bring it to every appointment and make copious notes. I have a copy of every pill taped onto an index card so when she argues with me I can show it to her. Keep all messages, they may come in handy even two years later to remind you of what went down.I put a dry erase board with calendar Etc on the refrigerator for everyone to refer to. We used to keep a separate calendar that she would write notes of who she saw each day so she could remember she was not alone.	0
Can anyone recommend a GPS tracker with its own sim card that doesn't require the person with Alzheimer's carry a charged cell phone? Are there any good wifi-enabled TV remote controls, or reminder iPads that can be managed remotely? The neighbors threatened to call adult protective services and sue him if we didn't move him. At night, I call him to try to coach him to turn on the smart TV and watch the local news, sometimes with success. He absolutely loves youtube and netflix, to a lesser extent, but I won't be able to train him to do more than turn on the TV and change channels. I do plan on getting a big-button remote, but I would like to be able to be able to put youtube on a continuous stream in the evenings. I was thinking of getting a video-enabled Amazon echo spot, and was wondering if anyone else has done something similar.It would also be nice to have an iPad-like picture frame that I could use to give him reminders. Any technological solutions that allow me to improve his quality of life would be greatly appreciated. I'm very new to this.You may want to consider the tile. Because her iPad has the Tile app running in the background and her Tiles are shared with me I can see details on where she is. The downside to tile is that it's Bluetooth, not GPS, meaning you can't just track where he is, you need to be near him so your phone connects to the tile. Someone else's phone (who has tile) can also pick up his location for you to see, but they also need to have their Bluetooth on. This may be helpful in a big American city, but wouldn't be too helpful in rural locations unless you could go looking for him yourself. You could try a gps tracker for dogs. We have the podtracker and it works well. You do have to pay a small monthly subscription, but I can open the app on my phone and geolocate the tracker anytime. The battery lasts about four days. We bought a spare battery and just swap them out when the one on the tracker gets low. Edit: added a word for clarity  Look up tinitell watch If this is the web site https://tinitell.com/, it seems they are out if business :-(&#x200B; I'm in the early stages of a similar problems as yours and have also been dealing with my mother in law who has memory loss, but without the added aggressive denial. It works pretty well and has circumference alarms, checkins etc. It needs to be charge about once a week.&#x200B;For daily reminders, an Amazon Alexa Show could work well. It will do reminders and will display google calendar entries. You can also do video conferencing and MAY (I'm not 100% sure here) be able to configure it to allow you to just drop in and listen to the room.&#x200B;Hope this helps. I'm new to this as well.&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;	0
Wood, rhinestone, feathers. I've recently become aware that my wife's shuffling/walking problems have to do with vision problems -- specifically, that Alzheimer's gives a patient tunnel vision. The number one determinant for falls is quad strength.	0
My Grandpa's Story Hey everyone I just stumbled upon this community and I wanted to write a little bit about my grandpa who passed away last saturday. My grandpa passed away last saturday after years of fighting off the inevitable. Even though we were kind of prepared it still hit us harder than we thought. At this point he was not able to walk down the stairs for quite a while now but one night he managed to get down the stairs, woke up his SIL and basically told her to lock him up and beat him to death which was odd and totally out of character for him to say something like that and since then this event stuck with us...He was 75 years old and an avid runner. I can't find the exact number but it's gotta be more than 35 marathons and he even participated in a few 100 km (62.1 Miles) and 24 hour runs. The burial is this friday and until then I hope to learn a lot more awesome things about my grandpa which light him in a different, motivational and happy way.Thank you all for reading this!	0
Myself -- I work as a software engineer, I'm known to be pretty intelligent, I can more than ably take care of myself and have a good circle of friends and support more or less. He was then let go from the new job in March 2018, and was supposed to start another job (in Florida, away from my family) in September of this year. Last month, my mom took my dad to see a neurologist (funnily enough the one who I used to see for my juvenile epilepsy, which thankfully I outgrew). His dad died of Alzheimer's related dementia around 82, and his side does have a history of it, but from what I know in old age mainly. I'm in the process now of trying to schedule APOE/PSEN2 testing if I can get it, but I don't even know exactly how I'd handle the results if I get them. So here are my thoughts and hopefully other people will be even more helpful. Sometimes terrible things just happen. The question of a genetic test is one many people struggle with. So I can only answer for myself. In terms of your family, I think a good first step would be to contact the local chapter of the Alzheimer’s association. You can call the 24 hour helpline at https://www.alz.org/ and they can put you in contact. One of the nice things is you can meet to talk to a social worker and they can lay out some possibilities. After that you’ll want to talk to an attorney to create a financial plan and get documents in order. The genetic component of early onset Alzheimer's is really misunderstood. It could be some sporadic type, or associated with a gene not yet identified, or alcohol related, or who knows what. I had the opportunity to talk in-depth with a genetic counselor within our neurology department to discussed genetic testing. Because my mom's Alzheimer's is not likely to be familial (she has no first degree relatives with early onset Alzheimer's), genetic testing would not offer me much. In the end, for other reasons I did the 23andme ancestry & health testing, which actually does tell you your APOE status. However, I'd recommend speaking to a genetic counselor or at least reading a LOT about what that means before looking into that option, because it's definitely not a test that will tell you if you will get the disease or not. I am my mom's only family to speak of, and have arranged all of her medical care, tests, financial stuff, and care for the last ~10 years. Please let me know if I can help to answer any questions about all of this. This may require more extensive testing to prove he is disabled, but those tests will be helpful anyway.Have you dad assign power of attorney and fill out advanced directives for his health care wishes.Consider asking his doctor to evaluate if he is still safe to drive. The best initial advice I can give you is don't panic. She's now 64 almost 65 and lives with me full time, and isn't able to do much on her own.It's best to start looking into your options now. Find your local chapter for Area Agency for Aging and Disability, they are the gatekeepers for many of the assistance programs. Early On-Set Alzheimer's qualifies for a compassionate allowance from the SSA and can be processed more quickly, but don't be surprised by a denial. SSD will can get him Mediciad and Calif9rnia has expanded those services. Most neurologists will likely take your dad off the meds and place him on a Keto diet to see if there is contributing factors from either source, but only if it is ALZ. The best way to confirm is an MRI and Spinal Fluid analysis.Check with your employer about assistance for legal fees and caregiver relief options. Most of the tech companies in your area do that. Also see if there is a legal aid society to help with any financial issues, forgiveness processes on debts. It's incredibly frustrating,  but there won't be any easy answers. A lot of this will depend on evaluations over time and determining the extent of changes in his cognitive abilities as well as MRI results. As far as your Dad is concerned,  I agree that you need to get some things in place - a financial and a medical POA,   a plan for the future. Do talk to your local Alzheimer's organization. They have many resources. It can take months to get them started. There are counselors who work with adult children of dementia sufferers,  frequently licensed counseling social workers. I started working with one several months ago and its helped me clarify a lot and make decisions based on what was in my best interests.Whatever you learn,  good luck. So don't forget to take care of yourself,  too.	0
Such as directing me to do things that are more about busy work and doing her housework than helping the client.Generally, I'm posting today because there is a dearth of discussion on Reddit about this big elephant. I have no idea what's coming but am interested so, clicking POST.You sound like a very good person and someone I would have loved to have helped us with my mother. On behalf of other family members, thank you for helping. You sound like a very caring person.I'm not a sole carer so I can't know what you're going through but wanted to let you know you are making the world a better place. It's nice of you to reach out.Alzheimer's is one ugly disease. Keep going though, it takes a special kind of person to have the patience to work with this illness!	0
"He prefers to keep some autonomy, which can be helpful and take some of the burden off of myself and my family, but has it's own difficulties. As of the last year I've been more closely observing his water and nutritional intake and began to grow concerned about a few things, chiefly not drinking much water and having a very low protein intake.First step, I got a general idea of a minimum daily water intake, found an appropriate container and kept it simple: Make sure you drink this entire container (~60 fl.oz.) of water a day to be in a fairly safe place. The next step, we started recording what foods he was eating so that we could enter them into a food tracker so that we could see information such as calories, macronutrients, etc. When I talk to him about this, there's always some reason or excuse. He doesn't always meet caloric goals, and he's generally very low on protein. Sometimes if you put flavor in the water they will be more likely to drink more. For protein, you could try an protein shake or ensure or boost as a meal replacement if you are really concerned. Make sure you check with his doctor before you decide to use a meal replacement. My dad won't drink water without Mio drops anymore and he has a chocolate  protein shake every afternoon. My mother loves mio lemonade drops, she only drinks water with it. It takes work and effort keeping track of fluid and what you are eating. I have a hard enough time tracking my medications, thankfully now every four hours for Sinement due to DBS, but other meds are every six hours (I can eat those with foods), but tracking water is a challenge. Bottled water is expensive, so I like your idea of the jug of water but still hard to keep track to remember to fill that. Somedays I just get sidetracked and forget to eat.In a way having a scale that automatically measures the weight of the jug would help in tracking and reminding him to have a glass of water. Both loss of control, and not being able to empty it. I've learned it is easy to empty more of my bladder sitting down than standing, but that takes time! Other times my bladder lets loose without warning, yes there are Pads for that, but my not drinking water before running errands or long drives, less of an issue. I see you around a lot and know your username well enough, so it's always nice to hear what you have to say, so I appreciate you taking the time. He's been through DBS surgeries and recovering from the final one for the second side. The water jug is ~2 quart (~64 fl.oz.) pitcher which we use and keep on the kitchen counter so that it's always in view when he's around the house and eating, and he can see how he's managing his water. We just fill it every night and record how much is left - no worry about keeping it filled, if he needs more beyond 64 fl.oz. It's mostly just to get him over that minimum goal and keep him aware of it.There's also a chart on the fridge to show how much water (from the juge/pitcher) he's drank (drunk?) We're trying to deal with it, but it can be difficult. Hence why I turned here. We've taken steps to address that as well (reminders, ease of access of pre-made foods that aren't carbs, etc. You can also try Gatorade or similar if he is not responding to water. My grandfather is on a strict water intake but he gets incredibly bored with plain water. To that end, pointing out to my grandmother that a feeding tube might be necessary if she won't eat something healthy each day does help. Remind yourself- as much as you remind him to drink water and eat right- that you are doing the best you can and that is all you can do. Same with foods, my goal is to make food they eat healthier rather than feed them healthy food. Small servings that look good help. I have been taking a client to the senior center for low impact aerobics, bingo and lunch. EmergenC isn't necessary as we already have him on a routine of taking multi-vitamins and his vitaminC and other vitamins/minerals are at a safe level. It's mainly the macro-nutrients and water that are a big deal right now.But the jello - that might be a great idea. He does like using applesauce for a lot of things, but that isn't a primary source of hydration.>  ...no one drink plain water.As someone who is currently drinking plain, iced water as I'm typing this......I lol'd.> Same with foods, my goal is to make food they eat healthier rather than feed them healthy food. The socialization is helping.Keeping him active is a toughie. i thought it was for me?! "" The protein water is flavored, so she enjoys drinking it and she loves ice cream so she didn’t even notice that it was actually a nutritional supplement. Thanks. The first few years we were caring for him we were actively trying to keep him healthy and avoid suffering. No, just concerned. I tend to be someone who can, at times, be whimsical, imaginative and creative - but it has to just simply come to me. Part of the reason why I'm here looking for help.Thanks again for your response. Maybe he needs a caregiver to come in and be with him while you're at work, to make sure he's getting nutrients.Another thought--if he's topped up on meds before he eats, then he might eat more because he feels like it's easier to move.Does he like soup? Ensure tastes good and is water and protein together--another benefit is that it's very easy to drink so it doesn't take much energy.Are you aware of the interactions between protein and l-dopa medications?http://www.livewellwithparkinsons.com/index.php/strategies-for-living-well/protein-ldopa"	0
Best non monitored personal emergency device? My parents aren’t at the point of needing a costly monitored service yet, but I’m researching non monitored ones and wonder if anyone on here has any suggestions. I live less than a mile away and can be there quickly if I can find something that will notify me if there’s a problem. ^(Info ^/ ^Contact) It doesn’t have fall detection, but the Apple Watch works well with Hey Siri. It also sends selected contacts an alert if the resting heart rate goes above a number you designate. You will need a phone plan though as it requires one for updates, but the watch doesn’t need the phone nearby to work. I think I saw that Apple Watch now has a fall detection app.	0
has anyone had any success with using GPS-tracker wristwatches bought online from sites like amazon? It will be possible to take the watch off, so there is the chance of him wandering undetected even if you have the device. I'd love to hear from anyone that has tried these. I've committed to buying one and we're currently charging it! Will use it for a week or two and update you if you can wait that long :)  yeah definitely let me know I can let you know specifics and send you some screenshots of how it tells you the GPS and how it makes the SOS calls/texts. It was super easy to set up and the prices aren't too expensive :) You can also set alerts so that if they go out a certain radius then the tracker alerts the contacts that the tracker has left the set perimeters so you know the person is wandering :)  Hey! So we've been using it for five days now and I'm so happy with it. Here is the link for it - https://www.unforgettable.org/personal-alarm-gps-tracker?gclid=CjwKCAjwh9_bBRA_EiwApObaOEjIrQ6eoZofKH8ddZvI_L_qwMat0p0h_twa95Ud6jTTbbznqdX38RoC8PoQAvD_BwE  thanks bud, unforgettable.org is quite a handy little site xx What are your goals for buying the watch? I'm presuming they want to be able to track a parent/patient that wanders off. OP let us know what you find, we're approaching the same point with a family member too. A 1/4 inch deep skillet of oil is spattering hot in what? I didn’t mention but I power down the kitchen. Came by and saw a straight fire in the microwave and she was just watching it and didn’t mention that it was a fire. has anyone had any success with using GPS-tracker wristwatches bought online from sites like amazon? My dad was pretty ingeniois at removing them. Once you can do this then geofencing can be set up. They also need (or did when I looked into them a few years ago) daily charging. It seemed to me likely that when it would be needed that it would be removed or have a dead battery. We were planning on getting carers to charge it each visit. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:[/r/dementia] has anyone had any success with using GPS-tracker wristwatches bought online from sites like amazon?&nbsp;^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact) https://www.unforgettable.org/personal-alarm-gps-tracker?gclid=CjwKCAjwh9_bBRA_EiwApObaOEjIrQ6eoZofKH8ddZvI_L_qwMat0p0h_twa95Ud6jTTbbznqdX38RoC8PoQAvD_BwE This is the alarm we've found to work the best for us. We put it on a lanyard and my Grandad wears it around his neck, then he won't remove it. Or a keyring and attach it to their wallet if they always seem to remember their wallet. We found by putting the lanyard on my Grandad part of the daily routine he got used to just having it on and forgot to take it off when he went wandering. We liked this one because it was easy to set up, has no monthly charges or hidden fees and works like a mobile phone so we can reach him as long as he is somewhere with signal. The call will ring through and if you answer it, you can talk to them like a normal phone even though they aren't pressing the silver button anymore. If the first contact doesn't answer, then it rings the second emergency contact. If the second doesn't answer it rings the third. The GPS co ordinations have been super accurate so far. It does need charging most nights but we just charge it when he's asleep and put it on him in the morning. We can top it up easily online using debit card, there's no hidden charges. It has fall detection, so if it detects a fall it will call the emergency contacts automatically without him needing to press the SOS button (this can be disabled) You can set it so that if the tracker goes outside of certain locations it alerts the emergency contacts via call or text so you know the person with the tracker has gone wandering It is small and discreet for him If we call the number of the tracker it answers automatically (he doesn't have to press anything) and we can chat with him, and check he's ok, at no cost at all. I would like to post such a product elsewhere on social, but the product-displayed doesnot work well on google plus, because it clearly says s.o.s. & that's not good for passive marketing a good product in sensitively anxious communities.Do ya think that you could get in touch with them to give another page with a different picture (maybe the back of it) and then link to that main-product page, cheers (? We're currently using the Jiobit because of its small size. So far it appears to be working fine but haven't had to use it much. The watches my dad hated the size and would take it off.We tried those SmartSoles so that we can put it in his shoe. Our experience with that was terrible. The customer service was fine but they simply kept messing up, The soles would stop sending the gps location, or stop charging, or never update etc.. They have enormous quality control issues.	0
Any experience with iTraq Location Tracking Devices? Looking for best device for cell phone forgetting Alzheimers patient Haven't used iTraq, but we have a tracker on my mom's dog called Whistle. It also tracks walks, patterns. It is a life saver.	0
Best GPS tracking device for someone who wanders? We are trying to find GPS tracking device, but which ones are the best? I know our local dept. keeps records on vulnerable adults (read: wanderers with dementia). They will take a photo, description of the person, and who to call when found. [deleted] I've recommended this in  a different sub, #1 on this list is solid: https://bestchoicesforseniors.com/gps-trackers-for-elderly. Give me your budget and I'll fire over a few more. Some of the shorter range devices (like tile trackers) aren’t as reliable in, well, a longer distance. There are some GPS trackers out there, but many seem super sketchy, banned in the US, or still in development. It might sound cold, but perhaps check ones made for pets? Not to attach to your loved one - but maybe to slip into their wallet / pocket / whatever. My dad (thankfully) doesn’t wander, but his fear is being left behind. You can customize what’s printed on them, they Velcro on and off, and there’s a decent selection of bands that are water resistant - so you don’t have to fuss with it coming off and on. I'm also here looking for a tracker. !remindMe 1 week Hi, If you are looking for best GPS tracking device then you can rely on VoxTrail Software Solutions.

Gps tracker for shoe My step dad ran away the other day because he was angry and over-stimulated. We estimate he has another year or two before he needs to be put in a home so we'd like to preserve his freedom as much as possible.Does anyone have a suggestion for some affordable small GPS trackers that we can either put in his shoes or in his clothing? Our thought is that he will remove or lose a dongle or a watch.It’s been a few years since I checked but the downside to these types of devices is they have to be charged often. I decided that it wouldn’t work well for my situation because it would need nightly charging. >downside to these types of devices is they have to be charged oftenThat's why we installed institution locks on all exterior doors instead. Has to be something that makes sense and affordable. You could try a Tile but the range is pretty limited, the best one is up to 200ft. I have my fathers' phone (flip phone) on my cell phone plan and when he would decide to go out for a walk I was able to track his phone. The advantage for using a cell phone is that you can call  as well as track it.	0
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv Noob Alert!Be gentle, this is my first post! Although I have found many interesting articles pertaining to dementia and posts regarding remote access of all kinds, I have yet to find anything which specifically answers my query below. Of course, if you can direct me to something I would be most grateful.Our Mum is 95 and her memory is diminishing day on day.She is otherwise in good health and we, as a family, are trying to allow her to keep her independence for as long as possible.We have installed 4 Nest cameras (connected via Wi-Fi to her high speed Virgin broadband router) in her flat so that five family members – across the globe - can make certain she stays safe. We feel this would be helpful for her as she is finding it more and more difficult to put faces to voices and, therefore, reinforce the memories/connections of her extended family. It would also be a more effective means of reminding her to get her breakfast/lunch/tea (regarding Mum’s TV, it is quite a dated so I will be purchasing a Smart TV and advice/suggestions would also be helpful).Does anyone know of a way we could do this using an App on a mobile device?What sort of interfaces and other hardware would we be looking at?I did find this guy’s YouTube channel with his clever system of voice activated home automation utilising Broadlink RM Pro 2:https://youtu.be/DJIhEyMQ0TI but, as I say above, our family would really like to be able to access remotely via the internet.I may not be the quickest to answer your replies but do bear with me.Many thanks in advanceI'm sorry I don't know of anything but just wanted to say that I have been wondering the same thing myself. We are four siblings on three continents (2 are local to our Mum) We would love a way that we could check in on her and remind her of things. I believe there are great opportunities for app developers and entrepreneurs to come up with ideas to help. Sadly our Mum has been deteriorating quickly and I'm not sure she will be in her home for much longer. I must say the Nest camera system is fantastic (should be seeing it's a Google product! ).Obviously you'd need a strong, consistent broadband to start with. We now have 4 cameras, living room, kitchen, entrance hall and her bedroom. The latest camera was only installed recently as mum took a fall in her bedroom and it was only by chance one of my sisters was passing and dropped in. All have a microphone which you can talk through via the app on a phone/tablet.You can set up specific zones to be covered and set for notifications of people, movement and/or sounds.I installed 2 Nest CO/smoke alarms which can be tested via the app and will notify us if there is an issue. They each have a night light which can be set to turn on if someone passes in the dark.They are ideal if anyone has a big property because if one alarm is triggered it will 'speak' to all the other alarms in the house stating which alarm was first triggered and where!If I manage to work out a system regarding the tv I'll post it ☺Thanks for your reply and hope your mum's ok. Is your mom good with technology? We ended up getting the old one back for her. BUT I think if you don't already, maybe try getting her a smart home device. My mom LOVES hers. She has a Google home and she can ask it questions, turns on the lights (we have a smart plug adapter), set alarms, appointments, etc. We have one that when she yells for help it sends a text to my phone to notify me. Unfortunately Mum was never good with tech so, at this stage, nigh on impossible to introduce anything new. Like your mum, we tried a more modern wire-free, digital phone some time back but had to quickly revert to her original. It does have 3 quick dial buttons for those of us nearest to her which she can use.I love the idea of the system you have set up but Mum's memory couldn't retain the instructions for anything even slightly complicated.When we phone her to remind her to get her tea/supper from her fridge, if she doesn't do it within 30 seconds the memory is gone.	0
My mother has started decline  over the last few months. She can't be at home anymore, and it is getting to be too much for my sister and I.My brother  is a creature of habit, and also needs some care to keep him on track thought the day. So, memory care and assisted living together in a single unit with double occupancy. My mother has Humana for insurance, and brothers is Medicare and Family Care through Wisconsin. She had enough money in her account to self pay for a year or two, maybe, but no more than that.So, my questions is; does anybody know of any resources for finding such a facility? We have been turned away from a few of them so far because of the differences in care required by them individually and don't know where to turn for help in this, but just can't keep this going as it is.To the coworker:  You and your sister have done an amazing job with a difficult situation. This next step isn't going to be easy, no matter how it goes down. You may not be able to achieve all that you want in one step, especially since good facilities, even if you can find one, often have waiting lists. I'm in MN and have never heard of a place which could take and care for a pair of people with this level of difference in needs. There are many group homes for adults with Downs, and you can search online by county. Once he is settled, you can start looking for a dementia group home or facility close to him for Mom. It's even worse to move them after the parent has died, because they don't understand why mom/dad isn't there. I live in Madison, and have relatives here in a elder care facility, and one in a place between here and Milwaukee. Finding a facility requires leg work. There is a service called: A Place for Mom, but I found it unhelpful. Help him and the mom Skype. This may be an interim solution while you're searching for longer term opportunities...adult day care centers provide daily care for seniors (including seniors with dementia) and adults with disabilities. Most centers provide transportation to and from the center, in addition to taking members to daily appointments. As a lifelong Wisconsinite AND a mother of a disabled adult child (who has Medicate and Family Care) I suggest you get in touch with your brother's case manager. She can help you and put you in touch with other agencies that might be able to help further. DHS has many resources. My son, who is 28, lives in a great group home that Family Care helps pay for. There are plenty of middle aged and older adults in the group homes owned by the company that runs my son's home. Do your brother a favor and get the ball rolling NOW. Start now so he can move before it becomes a crisis situation.Call the caseworker and then try this:https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/adrc/index.htmWhat area of the state are you in?	0
I'm just feeling overwhelmed.My SO and I have been staying with my father in law and just started home health and home care services for him. We keep having issues with his catheter. We haven't heard from respite care about some time we need this weekend (we're in a wedding). Can we get home care long term? How can I convince my SO to seek help and where (neither of us has mental health insurance right now).Sorry for the long post.TL;DR How can I keep myself and my SO same while we take care of his father?You mention a catheter. If that is a long term solution, it probably isn't appropriate to continue home care. Thanks. Unless you have a serious budget to worth with, in-home care isn’t a long term solution (when things progress and he requires round the clock care). It doesn’t seem like you are up for the task (not a criticism, just a reality - it’s a huge undertaking and it’s only going to get more demanding and require more specialized care), and if you’re going back to work you’ll need someone there all the time. Research the options in your area and go to a financial planner. Find the Az resources in your area and call them, tell them you’re trying to come up with a plan and ask them for help. Wishing you all the best  Thanks!	0

"What's the best medical alert device? Anyone know of some good options for medical alert devices? Maybe one's with fall detection and GPS technology.I did find this one from POM Tech, the Belle+ Medical Alert. Seems to be a great option! Don't know the ""Best"" but a lot of my clients have Life Alert. Be a little careful with Life Alert. They're also much more expensive than the competition. Check this comparison chart of different medical alert devices in the market?"	0
I've finally figured out what I want to major in and pursue in my life. I've been at the city college on and off for years, working on and off at crap jobs, going back for a semester, rinse, repeat. Now I've aged out of my dad's insurance, I have no job, and am living off of about $800 left of financial aid until I find a job. He will pay for gas if he needs to. The person I always thought would be there to help me figure things out is gone. I do as many errands as my dad throws at me, and will do them at the expense of my time, my gas, and plans I previously had. While I cannot afford to pay for any of them, I schedule their vet appointments, I take them in, I medicate them for fleas and anything else that pops up. I keep my dad apprised of anything going on with them. I try and keep track of what my mom is eating and what she isn't (anyone else have dementia family members who have new cravings every few months?) I'm much better than I used to be, but of course could always use improvement.None of it feels like it's ever enough. I'm still stuck at home. Despite the few moments where I feel like I'm doing enough to prove it's okay for me to be home still and figuring things out, there are always the long patches of me telling myself no, you're doing it wrong, you're useless. I live in a very expensive state, so moving out by myself is really not an option. Some days I struggle to get myself out of bed, let alone to look for a job. My dad insists he never wanted my sister nor I to be responsible for my mom, and yet when we go over the list of everything that wouldn't get done if we stopped being involved... it goes on. Thanks for reading up until now. This has all been coming on for months, and it just kind of boiled over last night with me feeling really, really awful about not having a job and my own income. This is so similar to how my little sister feels. I have tried to get my sister to do this, but she doesn’t want any medical care for herself. Read books on it, google it, write out quotes that make you feel hopeful and tape them up all over. My sister has a little sanctuary for herself set up in the carport. There’s a great resource for caregivers on YouTube. You are so valuable. Some is dependent on where you live and your family's (your parents) financial situation. This can have a large bearing on what help they may qualify for. Not knowing these things, I can offer suggestions of help available where I live (US, state PA) but I am not sure if it will be applicable to your area. A few include:The Dept. If so, you have accrued valuable credits. They may be able to offer resources and advice that can help you move forward.I don't know your family dynamics but the situation you face will surely strain them even further and likely cause a further breakdown. Doing your research and being knowledgeable and dependable will better position you within your family and earn their respect. Organize your life to best reflect your position as a caregiver as well as valuing your own hopes and dreams for your future. I hope I have helped even a little and good luck to you.	0
Gps tracker I am just wondering if anyone here could recommend a reliable non bank breaking gps locator? My mom and sister are heading away for a holiday at the end of the summer and we are looking for something to be able to locate my mom for peace of mind. My mom doesn't use a smart phone but does use a standard one, so tracking apps installed on the phone are a no go.We use MasTrack. It has given us a piece of mind. It plugs right into their car and you use the app on your phone. https://www.mastrack.com/ When you say 'standard' phone - do you mean a flip phone? Because you can track a flip phone. Check with your phone company to see what kind of deals you can get for adding a flip phone and if there are extra charges for using the locator app. Because the phones are on my account, I could see when my father called 911 and check in on him (he forgot to pay his electric bill and the power was off - I took over paying that account as a result). When they are living some distance away this can be a good thing. remindMe! Tile doesn't work as a GPS locator. It connects to a phone via Bluetooth and uses the phones gps to see the last location of the tile.I would recommend that you buy the cheapest Android phone possible that uses gps. Then try life 360. Probably would be cheaper than buying a standalone GPS tracking system. If you find something better I would like to know as well!	0
When did you know it was that time? She has declined fairly rapidly. I feel like my life is on hold. I haven't been able to pursue the dreams I had of traveling in my 20s or going to grad school. I finally think its time for her to be placed in a home so my sister and I can start living again.When did you know it was that time?I'm in a similar situation as you! My sister and I are in our mid 20s and my mom has VERY rapidly declined in the last 6 months. We're trying to get finances together and we're still figuring out how  to handle things because it all happened so suddenly. While you are in the process of getting her in a home, you should look into in-home caregiving options. If she really is declining quickly and having trouble taking care of herself, it might not be safe for her to live by herself for another year. If finances are a problem, you might want to look into medicaid. this. In-home care is less expensive and more effective, but it takes f o r e v e r to get the state to come evaluate. Start now, before something bad happens! Having covered in-home caregiving would be such a godsend. I feel so guilty because I wish I could do more like move up to where she lives but Im going to school and have so many commitments that it would be hurting myself if I leave.	0
He's done a great job of tracking so far, but he's using pen and paper which I fear he could lose. Before then, I to make sure we have a dependable system in place and figure someone here might have gone through something similar and has advice to offer.Some more details about everything below, but if any more information would be helpful please please ask Sorry this got so long...I am looking for something that will:1) Help the **patient** (my dad) easily log their weight, sodium intake and fluid intake, daily2) Allow the **caregiver** (me) to monitor the patient's logs in real-time3) Prominently display the **patient's** weight, fluid and sodium intakes in the appThus far, it seems diet and weight tracking apps are best suited to accommodate the workflows we're after. And of the  apps we've looked at, MyFitnessPal and LoseIt! are top for they both allow for weight, fluid and sodium intake logging. However, they  feel quite bloated and neither allow you to include fluids in your primary goal tracking dashboard among other things.What about just setting up a shared Google spreadsheet? You can do stuff with autoformatting to highlight cells where any particular figure is way high (or low) that would let you see in a glance if there's a problem.Something else I'm really a fan of is Alexa devices - get a pair of Amazon Echo Spots, one for each of you. IMO, there are obvious shortcomings, but as I'm coming to learn, whatever helps keep up his habit works for me.We did however order a wifi scale , so we'll see how that works.	0
Has anyone here found any great uses for new technologies that have helped in the day to day care / routine? For example, uses for voice activated devices (google home, etc) or apps that are particularly helpful in organization for caregivers? Or anything else!We use Alexa for a playlist so whenever in the room we can just ask her to play songs my mum likes which tends to keep her calmer  Awesome. It's not exactly high-tech but I recently bought some motion-sensor lamps on amazon, they were really inexpensive..less than £10 each. It also prevents her turning on every light in her path and then leaving them all on as she returns to bed at 3am.. Very very helpful. Would be really keen to get other ideas too! This is a wonderful idea!	0
I am new to Reddit & didn’t know where I should seek support... Here are my issues, and I am shaking with so many emotions. I don’t know if I’m angry with my husband, my son, MYSELF, or just plain confused and hurt. I am desperately seeking advice:Dear Crohn sufferers.I first want to say how helpless, horrible & guilty I feel about passing on this crappy set of genes to my (almost) 22 year-old son... his father’s family may have had something to do with it, too, because there have been some similar symptoms on that side of the family, as well. Regardless of who, how, why:  It is what it is, and nobody deserves this insidious disease. He was recently dxd with it about a year ago, and we are all trying to learn about the do’s and don’ts... we are all TRYING to educate ourselves, too... as well as TRYING to comfort & console him. Heck, it’s over my pay grade, so to speak. This last episode, I kept telling him that I didn’t know the answer to his specific questions over & over the other night. He perceives everything I say in response to his explanations as me being a know-it-all; argumentative; and he goes off on me all the time... zero-60... (he says I do the same to him). Yet I do come back and keep trying... as does he... but we wind up escalating each time. I know with MS, for me, I had a LOT of misfirings, feelings that I can only describe as electrical shock, pain and confusion during my flares... especially during my initial diagnoses... He is sending out so many mixed messages... loves me, hates me. I WANT to know what I can actually do differently or better to help my son without always setting him off. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells or glass, and we are both getting so upset, stressed and fatigued as a result of our encounters. I see broken items of sentimental value and broken items all over the place and can’t figure out why everything is spinning out of control. My husband and son literally left me and have been gone two days now... It’s especially tough if two of the three family members in the household have these chronic issues, and the healthiest of the three won’t help de-escalate a situation... in fact, it makes it worse for the family... we should all be helping each other as a team, right? Be the hero of the family team to get the family team back on track? Or advice for my husband as to how he can help in an effective way for the benefit of every member of the family when there is discord in the house? I’m hoping that the best people to ask are those who have the same disease.Disclaimer: I don’t have your disease or your son’s and this may sound simplistic but —Family Counseling! Someone to help defuse the high emotions and help with communication skills? Absolutely in that boat with you.	0
"My great uncle and aunt both were had and died of it, my aunt has it, my great grandma had and died of it, my grandma has it and so on and so forth. my mom took him down to mayo for a checkup on the sleep disorder and the doctors had bad news. i honestly just dont know what to do or say at this point. I would really encourage you to seek support from your community of faith. Also don't give up hope about his attitude. You never know what past the future holds. You need to find a local support group that can help you find good local solutions and people to talk with. Be anonymous there so nobody connects it with your family. The right kind of support may be the difference in whether you get through this whole or broken. Third-to-last good day is when I'll do it, before I don't have the capabaility any more. Look at alz.org - you might be able to find a local support group that could help. People can think of those with Dementia (as well as the family for the changes they make to accommodate it) as just plain weird.That's just people reacting to anything different in a negative manner, and there is a lot of people that will tell you what you ""should"" do. Enjoy what you have now. Just because he may forget who I am doesn't diminish the value of our relationship, or my desire to help him have a higher quality of life.4. Constantly look for new avenues. This is the way it is with Dementia, and the smallest thing (like a stuffed animal, for some) can make a night-and-day difference in how they feel and how they relate to others. Being able to talk to others with the same situation makes our seem so much easier to handle -- and definitely a little less lost."	0

"One of them has been aware of the situation and trying to help for a long time. At the appointment, we saw a PA who confronted me about why I was there, told my mil she ""didn't need anyone to go to appointments with her"" and gave a mini-mental status exam that I'm pretty sure she assisted mil to pass. Had never seen such a thing.Each time a family member has tried to get involved in her care, mil has initially been receptive, and then refused to share information about her appointments and removed any information releases she had previously signed so we could not know anything about her health care. She does not take them on schedule and sometimes takes too many. She lives way out in the country on her own and has repeatedly said she would rather die than move OR have any professionals come into the home to help her. One knew about the dementia and has been trying to help for years. The other son has been in total denial and has avoided the situation until recently. My husband had to jump in between them, and he put down his hand, but it's really got us shook up. We finally found the living trust and DPOA paperwork after searching the house for over a year. (Her paperwork is a mess--she hasn't paid her taxes yet and we have no idea what's happening with her bills). But these documents require all the brothers to cooperate and that is not happening. The burned out apathetic brother is not participating because he is stressed out and thinks his dead father meant for him to be in charge of everything, even though the paperwork has all three names on it.We have consulted our own lawyer and are trying to find our way through this mess. It's beyond frustrating and heartbreaking. Most of us understand now that it was never personal, but ragey brother is causing a lot of problems with his behaviors. Rage bro and his wife are still hanging on that evaluation, though, and are holding up addressing her safety needs until they get their ""proof. We spent last weekend with her after she had some teeth pulled, and then we had to just leave her home alone, where she is clearly not safe, because the local brothers think that's ok. She's insulted by the idea of it, and it needs daily charging, as well as her to cooperate with wearing it and remember to wear it.Has anyone else been through this? Sorry you're going through this! It sounds like you are doing all you can.Are there neighbors you can ask to keep an eye out? We asked the longtime neighbors of my grandma to keep an eye on her and let us know if something seemed wrong. She was in early stages at this point, and we had no idea. Ask a pastor or priest to drop by.You can try calling APS to see if they can help start a fire under peoples butts. At my local dept families could send in a picture and info about vulnerable adults. My dept also has the RUOK program which is an auto call system that calls seniors every morning and sends out an officer if there is no response. She doesn't have very many neighbors and the situation is beyond what an occasional check in would solve. Our hands are tied right now from speaking with her doctors because there's no information release or medical DPOA on file. My husband has one, but it needs to be signed by all three brothers to execute, we think. We had financial POA for years, and I managed to get things straightened out and even got her approved for Medicaid which got her some home care and eventually covered her nursing home costs. So, out of the blue, his sister has a lawyer draw up a new POA that put her in charge, and their mom told us (after whispering that she’s not supposed to tell us) that his sister is working on getting an apartment for the two of them to live in together. Or, you can do what we have done, which is to let them have their dysfunctional mess, and get your own therapy to deal with the pain of watching it all happen. For us, it was too big of a chance to take. You could also call adult protective services anonymously, but you’ll have to weigh that with the possibility that they might know it was you because of your previous action with her driver’s license.Whatever you choose, know that I am with you in spirit, and wishing for the peace and safety of all of the family members involved. In the past few years, I've tried getting help from child protective services twice for children I know that are being neglected, and CPS did nothing. The very ironic thing is that there are assets, but rage brother doesn't seem to know about them. He's been preoccupied with ownership of minor, nearly worthless belongings on the property, like an old fishing boat that's probably not even worth $1000. There's lots of odd concern by both of the local brothers about her not being able to afford care, etc., as if she is poor, or as if her only asset is the house. I think for some reason they trusted us to talk about finances, but did not discuss it with the others."	0
Looking for input for School Project Hi everyone,I am currently an engineering student in University and would like to seek the inputs of everyone regarding a project I am working on. I am currently in the midst of developing a tracking device that could be attached to the shoe in an inconspicuous way, and one of key features I am trying to go for is to make it require as little charging as possible.Would such a product be of interest for your love ones that are still active but risk getting lost outside?Any feedbacks would be greatly appreciated.Thanks!Yes absolutely. Something that is small and goes in/on the shoe and requires little charging time. My mother is in a care home and I doubt the workers would remember to charge a device, and my mother has trouble learning new routines so it might depend on my occasional visits for charging a device.	0
What gadgets do you recommend to help someone with dementia? I've read about using an Echo or Alexa to help my mom with dementia, but her english is poor and she won't remember what it does in order to use it. I'm looking for something similar to an iPad, something with a screen, that displays the day, time, photos, and perhaps notes about the day. Something that can remain on her nightstand and she can see first thing in the morning.Anybody know of any gadgets similar to this? Or any recommendations of your own? iPad has a feature (kindle fire does too) that allows you to lock the device to a single app. I originally didn't want an iPad as she's had trouble with them before and they become frustrating, but I may have to look into that. It's not really meant to be played with, just something that can be glanced at and has small details (date/time/maybe changes into photos occasionally) on it. The iPad will require a lot of minding from you/caregivers, especially if your loved one can’t process things like battery alerts. I have a call blocker on my mom's line. It syncs with my phone. I will get its name when I get home. It's software for your phone is a pain. The software task over your phone. The app has like 20 icon in it, but one hooks to this device via blue tooth. I have it set to just not ring the phone so they go to voice mail. Call Control Home - iOS ONLY Landline and VOIP Call Blocker, Blocks RoboCalls, Political Calls, Scam Calls, Unwanted Calls. Here's an example of such a gadget (from Amazon).I don't know if you can find a tool with all those characteristic, but my guess is that it'd be way easier to get the clock and a digital photo frame. We've never seen it again, and have no idea where she's hidden it.We've given her colouring books and other 'things' to do, including knitting and crochet - which she was so good at. Nothing.She hides everything, probably as soon as we're out of the door, and then tells us it's 'disappeared'.We've tried putting notes on her fridge, tried giving her a new and updated address book so she can find family phone numbers more easily - she claims her phone is broken and that it's a conspiracy to stop her using it. She also thinks that her tv doesn’t work because we don’t want her to watch it (she can’t figure out how to turn it on sometimes, the remote is actually really confusing). My mom hides a lot of things as well. She’ll keep anything from a paper clip to a restaurant brochure to a wire that was used to secure a bag of bread, to plastic grocery bags. I wish I understood where the urge to hide things comes from... and so many other things. :( She never was one for puzzles of any sort, so no.We used to buy her magazines. Then we realised they weren't even being opened so stopped buying them. She's never asked why she doesn't get a new magazine.The first thing she started hiding was fairly logical - her cheque book. She didn't want me to steal it! When the fourth replacement was ordered my husband decided it would be the last, so there are several of those squirrelled away somewhere.	0
Nighttime urination help My grandfather is immobile without help from caretakers and has been using a urination contraption (I don't know what it's properly called) so he can pee in the middle of the night without waking someone up to help him. I'm wondering what other devices there are to help, because I'm at my wit's end with everything in the house smelling like piss between this poor man and our cats acting out.Depends, adult diapers. You'll know better than I though, whether the time has come to use onsies or not :) There are things called “condom catheters” that could be of help. He will need to see a urologist to see if these are appropriate for him. Many people don’t know because it’s not often talked about, but the majority of men will have a prostate problem at some point. Between these options, depends, disposable and washable chucks you should be able to find something that will help.	0
Ideas for Caregiving 'Life Hacks'? I'm planning on covering a bunch of things already and am curious if anyone has topics to share? The talk is in June and will be recorded. I'll share a link here when it's live!Some of the things I'm talking about alreadyPersonal WellbeingJournaling / Meditation Documentation / FinancesSmart Home Techtracking with cameras and sensorshands free tools (lights, doors, etc)MediaVirtual Assitants (Alexa, etc)Apps and ThingsGPS TrackingWorking with Health Aids / NursesVideo ChatNot directly related to caregiving, but there are a lot of startups that are focusing on bringing care directly to the home in a technology connected way. It can be a huge help to get someone to come to you, rather than having to take someone you are caring for to an office.Some examples:https://pager.com/https://www.joinhonor.com/https://www.carolhealth.com/ This is a great insight. Yea, we're seeing a huge market emerge for this type of care. Telemedicine is reducing costs, but nothing beats actual, hands-on care from a real nurse. On top of it, you have a huge gig economy that's slowly expanding to healthcare.Suddenly, the burden of taking someone to the doctor's can be replaced with a visit from a nurse. If it's out of the nurse's scope, they can facilitate a call with the doctor and provide in person examinations. This sounds amazing! Scheduling is a HUGE issue for us, especially if someone is sick and I'm not well enough to find subs, or if people are having trouble remembering their work schedule. We use ~~and~~ an app called When I Work for that but there are many comparable apps out there. “click the picture of the snack you want”. My  mother in law hires through an agency so it’s all phone based. It sounds like you are working with freelancers,  I’ll check out that site / app for sure. Please do share the link and beat wishes.	0
Student Researchers Creating Life Alert Alternative. Looking I'm a student researcher from Brigham Young University. I'm working to develop an alternative to Life Alert.Here's our blurb: AllyWatch is a smartwatch application that provides health monitoring services for the elderly. Unlike products like life alert, AllyWatch is inconspicuous and provides heart rate monitoring, easy SOS emergency dialing, remote monitoring of loved ones, live GPS tracking, and more.I feel like this community could provide a lot of valuable feedback to let us know if we are headed in the right direction.Here is a link to a survey we made. We would really appreciate if you would be willing to fill it out.https://goo.gl/forms/HmUgEOY1eveVHqxL2The survey is designed to be very quick.	0
"What's Coming Not a caregiver, but I could really use some advice on how my family can deal with the issues caused by my great aunt and uncle right now (both in their mid-80s).Just a quick background: my parents, sisters, and I are the only family my aunt and uncle have, we all live 1+ hour driving time (one way) from their house, and obviously we love both of them very dearly.My aunt and uncle have each had their health problems over the years, but we are now at the point of no return. My uncle can no longer take care of himself, and even though he knows it, he refuses all help unless it's coming from my aunt. My aunt is not capable of taking care of him for a variety of reasons, with the most difficult being that she refuses to see the reality of the situation. We have tried everything we could think of at this point, but it wasn't much. My parents have more or less given up because they've tried things over the years (begged my aunt and uncle to move closer to us, spoke with them about independent living and assisted living facilities, etc.) and nothing has worked. If I was able, I would be their live-in caregiver in a heartbeat. I just don't know what to do about what's coming...my uncle isn't going to get better, and I'm afraid he will die in terrible accident around the house, which my aunt will have to witness, if my family doesn't do something. But what can we do? Edit: In my rant I forgot to mention that my uncle has recently been diagnosed with dementia (though we've suspected it for years)In my experience, it has to be their idea to get help. They fear losing control and so hold onto it fiercely. All you can do is to keep gently nudging them to accept help. There are lots of in home services like Home Instead, Visiting Angels, etc. There is also a referral service called ""A Place for Mom"", you tell them what you are looking for and they'll have the right people get in touch with you. Also check into your Area Wide Aging Agency. They also have loads of information. Thank you very much for your reply, color_me_curious. I will look into the services you mentioned and see what I can find."	0

Advice on managing my parents mobile Devices Managing my parents Tablets and Phones has always been tough from a settings/wifi/password perspective. For better or worse, netflix, youtube, facebook, & kindle are some of the Big Things for him to look forward to in his life. When he is locked out it is incredibly heartbreaking and I want to help him.I'm several states away, and my Luddite mom isn't able to help. Has anyone found a way to manage their parents devices? I'm open to anything from a corporate-style mobile device management suite, to apps, to post it notes on walls. I hooked my father up to Netflix. They have no password, it is unsecured; and I am well aware my neighbors are stealing their WiFI. My father knows the name to logon, my mother can check her Facebook and talk with her sister. By not securing the WiFi and telling them the name to click when they log in, I have saved so much hassle and undue stress. I hope my neighbors aren't looking at kiddy porn though, lol. My partner uses two apps on his tablet. You can use a feature called guided access. When I wanted to allow him access to a few apps I bought a 50.00 kindle from amazon and used their version called “freetime” to set up which apps are on his “home screen”. Do their phones or tablet have fingerprint recognition? What about a password manager with fingerprint capabilities? They do, but they tend to forget the master password, their Apple ID, etc. I would make all passwords the same, stick all devices in cases, and put the password on the case. I wouldn't change any bank passwords or anything, but i am really much less concerned about netflix or youtube security concerns.	0
App or device for dementia caregivers Attention dementia caregivers! My team is currently brainstorming ideas and would love your input. What problems do you have in caregiving that an app or device could address? So basically old photos, videos and the ability to facetime people makes her happy, and if she's happy then I'm happy! My wife squeals with delight whenever I start playing her songs.Unfortunately, the GUIs for all of the above are too complicated both for her, and for our part-time caretaker.An app that would help with self-sufficiency for the sufferer or the caretaker would be great! One challenge we noticed was how difficult it is to coordinate wellbeing activities in a residential care facility, to ensure all residents have a healthy activity level. We have worked over the past two years to build a shared activity logbook and visualization tool. Our project is fully open source, and has a growing backlog of tasks/features. It would be a win-win as the students would get real-world experience improving a production web application to improve the lives of people with dementia spectrum disorders living in residential care homes.https://github.com/GeriLife/wellbeing Some type of medication reminder/log, I'm sure there are apps out there I just haven't looked. An alarm that goes off when something is needed at a certain time(lunch, pm meds, insulin, etc..) One topic that comes up over and over is a tracker for a loved one.They want it to be small. Be able to put it on their wrist, or on a lanyard. Another topic that has come up over and over is a simple phone with a few contacts. It needs to have a large font size, and a photo of the person they are calling. App or device for dementia caregivers Attention dementia caregivers! My team is currently brainstorming ideas and would love your input. What problems do you have in caregiving that an app or device could address? Launch the app, drop it into the pockets of their loved one, and from a second device, know where they currently are.• When my wife's diagnosis was confirmed, I began to keep a semi-daily journal of things I'd noticed that didn't quite seem right. A simple app to quickly jot down personality changes or whatever might have made the difference for me.• A checklist of medical and legal things caregivers need to keep track of (medical tests, suggested legal things that are recommended over at alz.org).Good luck at your hackathon, and come back and tell us what you ended up doing! We had to deadbolt with a key the locks so she wouldn’t wander. We also had to child proof the kitchen and bathrooms so that she wouldn’t get into non-food items and ingest. Currently I have the SmartThings hub to monitor my house for security, and I could see that it would have been a godsend for dealing with my mother. However, I think that current caregivers are older, and typically not as tech savvy to use this type of product and fully utilize to their benefit. I think an ‘out of the box’ hub, specifically designed for dementia patient caregivers would be a real benefit. For monitoring doors, location, and even vital signs and medication dosage. It's the only thing that's able to engage her, besides humans, on her good days. I think there's something there worth researching and developing. A tracking device would be so helpful, something that had a long charge. Also the ability to have checklists to take the best care of them. A discreet looking RFID system of iron on tags for clothes or something that would send traps/notices to a human monitored device like a smart watch the caregiver wore and/or a phone, when the RFID tags approach a movable detector. The majority of helpful devices for caregivers are surprisingly not internet/WiFi connected. A simple button to be pushed to ask for help. Most connect to call center that can only call an ambulance and cost a fortune. I found one that will call on my phone through a landline connection so it can be used for more than just emergencies. Bed alarms, door alarms chair alarms and incontinence alarms all do nothing other than screech which is helpful but sometimes counterproductive. My SO can no longer walk well on his own, but his dementia makes it hard for him to realize this. Trackers and cameras are always helpful but so are simple door alarms.	0

Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker) I’m here looking for some advice.My family is currently facing a stressful situation, as my 93-year-old maternal Grandmother has been suffering from Dementia. In many ways this has been a blessing – my Grandmother lives alone, in another state. The last contact they had with my mother, was a call to inform her that they had done a home check on my Grandmother and found there to be no issue (as in she did not yet pose a danger to herself). They ended up closing her case file.So where does that leave my Mother/us? In the meantime, my Grandmother’s personality has become more and more volatile. She has begun to question whether my Grandmother ever even loved her.The pinnacle of this came tonight – my parents are currently at my Grandmother’s house checking up on her. My mother was in the process of throwing out expired food in a basement pantry, when she stumbled upon decades old food. The decline in the relationship between mother and daughter is taking a very large toll on my mother emotionally.I know this post is a long ramble, and I'm not sure if any one will even read it in its entirety, but I guess my purpose here is to figure out a way to help my mother. I can’t (nor can my siblings) be there physically to help (at least at the moment). What can you tell someone who is going through such a difficult thing that will make them feel better or will be useful to them?Though we are all here to support her in any way we can, I know there are many times when she feels as if she is carrying the burden alone. Any advice would be much appreciated. I don’t know how internet savvy your mom is (mine isn’t), so you can also help by doing online research for her, especially on the tech front if there are any gadgets that can help your mom keep a better eye on your grandma. Every little thing helps. It sounds like your grandmother is no longer capable of making decisions for herself. It will involve getting your grandmother's doctor to certify that she is incompetent to handle her own affairs. Perhaps, the hotline might be a good resource. I'm not sure if my mother is aware of it or not, but I will pass the info along to her.Both my parents of recently taken charge of her bank accounts so that they can pay all her bills online (there was some worry that she would begin to overpay them). Since they are now on a fixed budget themselves they are hesitant to spend any of their own money on my Grandmother's expense. My grandmother has more than enough money to take care of things, however, her personality is such that she does not wish to spend money on anything but expensive luxuries.Hopefully, the fact that my parent's have taken control of her accounts, will help this issue. However, the current worry is that if money is spent on assisted care (like a nurse/health worker doing in house visits), or assistance based tech (security cams, WiFi, emergency alert devices), not only will she not use them, but she will find a way to retaliate (as in she won't answer the phone, etc.). As her last neuro appointment (December) actually showed some improvement (at that point she was correctly taking Exelon), we didn't have enough to show she was not capable of living on her own. ), which will undoubtedly make the situation a 100 times worse. Try adult protective servicesMaybe literal piles of mold is enough to have them take action  Thankfully, it turned out to not be mold. We have gone through adult services, not to sound like a jerk, but they are pretty useless (at least in this case). They had opened a case on her and were working with my mother. The first time they only went as far as the doorway - asked my Grandmother a few question, but didn't conduct any type of house/safety survey. She got angry with my mother over that and threatened to cut off communication, which would have ultimately made things much, much worse.The second visit they did go into her house briefly (amazingly my Grandmother let them in), but they didn't find anything that overly concerned them.	0
Recommendations on GPS Tracker? Hi,My grandfather is in the early stages of Alzheimers, and my family is looking to get him a GPS tracker in case he ever gets confused and wanders off unsupervised. I've found several products online, but genuine reviews seem few and far between. If any of you have personal experience with any of these products, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks in advance!I installed Life360 on my moms phone but it requires her to have it on her with location on. Notifies me when she reaches selected places, tracks her driving speed, notifies me of any incidents along the way and when her phone battery is low. I also use Life360- it’s been great. I've been thinking about getting something like this too but my mom doesn't have a smart phone, any other reccomendations? Here's a list of other contenders I've been looking at. Reviews seem few and far between, so my family is weighing our options carefully. PAL seems to be the most acclaimed, but PocketFinder seems to be the best for the money. SmartSole seems cool too, if a bit of a hassle. There was another one we were looking at called iTraq, but I took it off the list because reviews seemed largely negative. Let me know if you find anything interesting!Project Lifesaver PAL: $549Type: WristwatchTracking: GPS, CellularSubscription: 1 year free with purchase, $30 monthly afterFeatures: SOS Button,proximity alertCharging: Dock stationPros: watch functionalityCons: most expensivePocketFinder: $160Type: KeychainTracking: GPS, Wifi, CellularSubscription: $13 monthlyFeatures: SOS Button, proximity alertCharging: USB CablePros: Well reviewed, low costSmartSole: $300Type: Shoe InsertTracking: GPS, CellularSubscription: $75 quarterlyFeatures: proximity alertCharging: Wireless PadPros: DiscreteCons: must insert into shoes every day.Trax: $195Type: Belt clipTracking: GPS, CellularSubscription: 2 years free with purchaseFeatures: proximity alertCharging: USB cableCons: Belt clip could fall off Thanks! The pocket finder seems like it'd be best for our purposes. I'm looking for something that will work without bluetooth and other tiles, but that's still a great solution on a budget! Thanks! yes, Tile is a good solution for some things - attaching one to their coat or shoes, maybe wearing it like a dog tag, keys, purse, wallet, all the other things they tend to misplace...I just wish it could be traced from a desktop. My mother has a small dog she got before she started going down hill and needing help. We tried Life360 on her phone and it worked for a while, but she started leaving it behind when she'd go on walks. We mentioned it to our pest control guy that takes care of our house and he recommended getting a tracker for the dog. It's been a life saver. We got Whistle tracker designed for dogs but it has cellular capability, long battery life, and weekly/daily reports on trips. Appreciate the info! Anything for sale like a white/ clear woman’s digital waterproof watch w/gps?	0
It's a wifi connected device that has a pressure+moisture sensor you put under the bed. You can set it to send notifications to your phone if this person wets the bed or wanders at night. Does this seem useful to anyone? You can find the original thread here.I spent some of my free time looking into this and building out the initial prototype hardware and software for this. I'm still a bit off from where I can produce this even at a small scale, but I figured I'm close enough to start asking people if this is something that could be valuable to them. I was thinking of just either giving it away for free or selling it at costs, and hopefully just asking for some feedback in return, so if this is something that might help you, please feel free to send me a private message!That's wonderful! Your device sounds like a great solution. My Papa has since passed, but I am sure other people would find this helpful. This would be really helpful! My dad has days when he sleeps all the time but he gets up and then falls often happen or other shenanegans. It would be helpful. The bed alarms don't seem great. And the moisture sensor would be awesome. This may help that battle if an alarm went off and let you know. The push notification obviously is smarter. [deleted] Right now, there's a single long wire running to the device which you can keep tucked underneath the bed or in a night stand. On the other end are the sensors. Those are small, the size of a quarter that need to be placed under the bed. The pressure sensor sounds good as long as there is waterproof material between it and soiled pads and  bedsheets. I am interested in the cost of a moisture sensor and how/if it could be made reusable. Sounds like a cool project!	0
it's been a while, and a lot has been going on. it was apparently crazy busy to the point where people would cheer every time someone would leave, according to my dad. my mom was in shock but my dad was on it, and discussed how he wasn't able to find a home for her that was willing to accept her insurance that was also accessible to the family. we've been kind of expecting this to happen for a while. those got finalized in the last few weeks since she's gone to the home, so all they need to do is make one call once grandma passes and everything will be taken care of. mom's visited every day after work since the home is right on her route home anyway, which has been fantastic. because the doctor deemed this a necessary thing, it's 100% covered by insurance. all we have to pay for is whatever miscellaneous things she wants, like new shoes and clothes or something for solo entertainment. i really wanted to get this all out there, though, because it can be so easy to give up and feel like the world is working against you and your loved ones. the world is moving on whether you can feel it or not, and things are not permanently how they are right now.	0
"Portable Personal Home Intercom System I'm looking for something like a walkie talkie that will be easy for my dad to carry around the house/yard with him that will connect to a device I keep with me that will allow for immediate communication between the two. I want to find something that is not limited like CB or Walkie Talkie push-button-to-talk and then listen to the reply. I want to find something that allows for real time conversation for as long as the connection is open.I bought a wireless phone system where we have handhelds around the house, but it's too cumbersome for him to activate the ""intercom"" mode and remember which code number my phone is so he can call it when I'm in the basement or something.Does anyone know of something that can help?So, this is not exactly what youre looking for, and it's expensive, but it's been 5 days with no response, so at least it's something. You can set up devices in different rooms, or you can drop in long distance. I think the video amazon devices let you use the camera too for the drop ins. Also, I hope it's not needed, but im pretty sure Alexa will call 911 if you say ""Alexa, call 911"". This post sounds awfully ""hail corporate-y"", so sorry about that. My Grandfather had an echo dot for awhile, and he has mobility issues, while my Grandmother has Alzheimer's, and Alexa has made their house a bit more accessible. I haven't ruled it out yet. The Apple Watch 3 would enable him to say “Hey Siri, text so-and-so”"	0
Help the staring is making me irrationally angry; I KNOW SHE CAN NOT HELP IT. Life has robbed my partner of a chance to grow old (early onset) and me of my lifelong sweetheart.

Has anyone put a Tile or Trackr location tracker on their parent's keys? She loses her phone sometimes, and has gotten bad about returning calls. I'd like to be able to check her location from time to time. I did buy a Tile - you have to be VERY close to them in order to locate. (left my wallet with Tile in a grocery store and was parked in the closest spot before it dinged that they were in the customer service desk at the front of the store - this would not be useful for searching for your parents if you needed to). There may be a better product, but ideally it would work just like iphone find friends and be something she would not lose. The Tile is barely better than nothing. This is what my grandmother has. It goes in your wallet like a credit card and is Bluetooth powered. You can track its location with GPS, make it ring if you’ve lost your wallet, and even call your phone and it will ring (even if the phone is on silent). What's your experience with battery life, and does it have other features you use that affects battery life?I'm close to trying this kind of tracking technology with my dad. Not that he NEEDS it now, but every day it's like I see micro changes in him. On Android phone or tablet there is a share real-time app.. My husband and I use it because he takes 20-50 mile bike rides and if he needs help, I can find him.	0

Roku/Chromecast for Somebody With Dementia? (x-post from /r/Cordcutters...they were helpful, but I figured this subreddit might have some insights they don't know about. What I can say is if he prefers a certain genre or TV show to just record those and make it easily accessible. My mother likes old Westerns so we fill the DVR with them so anyone that is with her can put them on since she can’t. When I moved my dad in with me he was on his own for four hours a day. We also only have a roku. I made step by step instructions with pictures on how to use and operate it. Personally I woukd suck it up for right now and find a cheaper package as the flipping through to stop on something is much easier than trying to pick. Maybe look into an antenna too for the broadcast channels. Honestly, just get bare-bones dishnetwork or something. If it's possible to make a device autoplay a single channel, and you could get to that one, it might be a nice compromise.With that said, we replaced my parent's TV with a Roku 'smart' TV a couple of days ago. My dad really struggled with the Roku remote. The Roku remote we had places the volume controls on the side, and when my day would grab it to try to get his finger on the power button, he'd mash the volume buttons on the side.I'm very thankful that their cable box universal remote had a setting that worked with the new TV.	0
GPS Bracelet for Grandfather w/ Dementia Hello,My grandfather is in his 90s and recently had a stroke. Can any recommend a reliable and easy to use GPS tracking bracelet? Ideally, the bracelet could also show is name and a phone number if someone finds him.I did some research on Amazon but everything has poor reviews. Thanks for your help everyone. Even with the GPS tracking they might remove it,  and also he may not have the sense of mind to dress for weather.	0
"In Washington state, to qualify for the majority of the programs you must be:At least 60 years of ageorUnder the care of a professional This means for me at 43, I can get almost no help. I've been out of work over a year and have no income so there is no way to pay a professional. It seems like yet another thing one can buy their way in while the rest of us get screwed. Social Security made a tiny error in my claim and has denied me twice. My prognosis is I'll most likely die before then. It is especially screwed up because this is a fast-track disease on the SSDI list of 400 quick-acting diseases. She has assaulted me three times and is verbally/emotionally/mentally abusive. Legally I'm too young to be taken advantage of. Three weeks ago I decided that I would kill myself right now or get out of the abusive situation. Having Dementia and leaving with no set destination or money is the most terrifying thing I have experienced. She's kept all the money we had as well as our food stamps. I've dropped 30lbs but I was only 170 before :(My mother died last year and I got her house sold. I have the proceeds from that sale first week of November. Until then it's homeless shelters, free church dinners, and borrowing gas money. I have literally $0 today. In 20 days I'll be set for years. This wait is brutal - and all the more frustrating as I put a deposit down on a place but can't buy it until November when the trust releases. Edit: $25k will get me a place to live, groceries for the fridge, and very importantly - I can get the meds I NEED (Medicaid only covers some) - the trust is worth many times that. Anyone want to make a generous return? Funds disperse on Nov 3. The trust attorney will send out checks before anything comes to me. We are paying out of pocket and will burn through his IRA in a couple of years. We don't know what we will do after that. We want to put him in a memory care center that will provide him with some stimulation but it's just completely out of reach. We don't know how to pay for his long term care. I am so very sorry for your diagnosis and living situation.You should be able to use your trust payment as a collateral for a short term loan. I would start by speaking to a trust officer at the bank who holds your trust. They are less highly regulated and will try to give you as little as possible, I don't know if you feel up to negotiating. I hope you are finding some good answers with this idea. Please update us. I will send you good positive energy which can only do so much. But know there’s someone thinking of you and hoping you can get through this shit time. Internet hugs. I'm starting to cement my thoughts about moving out of this area. It's gorgeous but expensive. What kills me most about this is that the resources are there. Food. This is a dreadful situation, and it sucks. It is possible that getting to the station might help you find somebody who will actually take you seriously. (No guarantees, damn it.) Thank you for mentioning this, last week I did contact two House Representatives for this state and actually both their aides got back to me with quick answers and we're super awesome to deal with. Unfortunately, they found that because Social Security is a Fed program, they aren't able to do anything legally to help. They did, however send my information over to a congressman and his staff is looking at it this morning. >homeless shelters, free church dinners,I'm not in the States so don't know how those things work over there, but in homeless shelters in this country there's always somebody on hand who's employed and should know a way of getting specialist support for those who are living on the streets due to abuse or a medical condition.This website https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/help-for-battered-men#1 says there is a helpline for men who are victims of domestic abuse.>""The Domestic Abuse Helpline for Men is the only one in the nation that offers support and help in finding resources specifically for men,"" says Brown, of the not-for-profit helpline. ""We urge anyone whose relationship scares them to call the National Domestic Violence Hotline (NDVH) at (800) 799-SAFE (7233) or the TTY line for the deaf: (800) 787-3224. The Hotline is staffed 24 hours a day, year round with live advocates who can answer questions, discuss safety options, and connect callers to resources in their local area. I will!"	0
Anyone using a monitoring/communication device in case their loved one has a fall or any sort of emergency that leaves them unable to ask for help? We have decided that a wearable device with a panic button is what we need for that unlikely but really dire scenario. Here are some examples of what I'm looking for, I'm wondering if anyone has had any experience with them or similar/recommendations/criticisms (there are many others, but these are the only 2 that mention a price):https://www.medicalguardian.comhttps://www.bayalarmmedical.comI would also appreciate suggestions of any other subreddits (already saw r/eldercare) or discussion boards.Just happen to see your post, I searched for a long time and decided on https://wearsafe.com/ , it is a fraction of the cost of the outdated life alerts systems. we had life alert for my grandmother, but for my mom we found it more cost effective to just add a wearable panic button to her current home alarm system. another benefit of the home alarm... i have my cell phone tied to the alarm notifications so i get a text every morning to tell me when the alarm is disarmed. you can customize the notifications to keep a eye on them from a distance. thanks. What is your service called, what do they charge, and which part of the world are you in? im in Pennsylvania (USA). i use a service called vivant for $50/month. I'm a computer geek. I found a webcam from ebay that allows me to look in on mom from my phone or pc/mac. The camera I choose has digital io lines, which I attached to a receiver for a garage door opener, which used a wireless remote key-fob which mom wears around her neck. When she pushes the button, the camera send an email, which can be a phone text message.Total cost about $100 one time cost, without any monthly fee. They also make motion detectors, door open and other transmitters besides the push button.We keep a tablet watching the camera feed, so when we walk to the kitchen, we can look in. this is the camera(s) I use. If you look at the photo of the back, there is a little green connector that if the 2 in wires are connected it sets off an alarm. Old phone wire or ethernet cable is a single stand of copper and is easiest to use.the dxr also needs a 12 volt power supply. It doesn't matter what end it has, because it will get cut off and screwed down on the dxr.The camera can also be fitted with a motion detector and the camera programmed for hours the alarm is active, so sleepwalking can be detected and notified.Figuring out what to buy was the hard part, anyone who can strip a wire and setup email can do it. I'll be glad to help all i can.	0
Looking for a group home or assisted living community in Dallas area. I am currently the sole caregiver to my schizophrenic brother of 36. Caring for him has been taking a huge emotional toll on me, especially since my younger brother passed away. I am seeking an alternative living arrangement for him where he can receive minimal care with supervision. If anyone can recommend a facility or group home in the Dallas area it would be greatly appreciated. This list from Caring.com might help: https://www.caring.com/local/assisted-living-facilities-in-dallas-texas Thank you for responding. I will definitely be calling some of those facilities. There is no one else and I just can't do it anymore. I'm still looking. If you can contact ResCare they have group homes with round the clock care.	0
Desperate need of advice on how to help my father. they spent an hour trying unsuccessful and eventually, she grabbed me and I drove her to work. We are in a pretty financial tough spot and I don't see it getting any better in the foreseeable future. Are there any cheap devices or methods to help him be able to get up off the floor? He is on the state low-income insurance so I don't think they're going to cover any medical grade items. No retirement or any other accounts either, just what I and my stepmom work for. Is there any cost-effective aid for someone in his position?You mention that he's on state low-income insurance, and that means he could potentially be eligible for some local programs that might be able to help him. For my dad, who has limited mobility, we set up Uber and Lyft on his phone for him to request rides to his appointments. The prices to transport him are extremely reasonable (about $6 for a 2.5 mile drive). It's basically a big canvas belt you loop around (under armpits) and they use that as an option in PT in case the patient falls. It helps you not injure the person as you help them get up and allows you to use better motion/force to get them up with less strength. I watched a 90 lb woman pick up my 250lb father off the floor with one (granted.. this lady was a badass :)) Check this out. Find out if your insurance covers it.	0
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother My apologies in advance for the lengthy post.I posted a question about her safety in a different thread, but I am providing the same first paragraph here just for context. For the moment her husband is acting as her caretaker, and I don’t know if he has been appointed a conservatorship for her (I doubt it). This question is related to a conservatorship for her estate assuming he has not been appointed.My mother (age 64) was recently diagnosed with possible Alzheimer's and is taking medication which seems to be helping. She definitely knows me, but had a hard time remembering my birthday when I asked her this morning.Here is our history: I am her only son. This is now her estate. She was also emphatic that the assets, which represent our family and my father's life work, were to be mine when she no longer needed them (which relieved me because I do not want my father's life work and financial legacy to support my abusive step-father or his family). I never knew my father and I want her to tell me about him as much as possible and I am also learning a lot about her and her experiences which I never knew. I do not have much experience with anything legal, and I need to find an attorney to begin the process. Where do I start and how do I prepare?I understand I may need to apply for a conservatorship, in particular of her estate. Is this as simple as visiting an attorney who specializes in elder law? Some lawyers won't touch it. We ran into this problem with my mother who had to sign some stuff. In order to do it properly we needed to have her doctors say she knew what she was doing, and the lawyer involved needed to interview her also to make sure she understood. My mother was Compass enough to do something legally but it made the first lawyer not want to do the paperwork. If I have a prepared doctor's statement that she is competent enough to execute legal decisions for herself, this could facilitate interactions with attorneys in the matter, if I understand correctly? We are going to review and amend the designated trustees and beneficiaries in the document to reflect her wishes, so we have to work with an attorney for this I imagine, a notary probably wouldn't work. I found out the some doctors will write a letter about their assessment, our specialists preferred to have the lawyer speak to them over the phone. So if you can get him into having a younger person i.e. you, on it as the first so they don't have to change it later, that might solve some of the problem.	0
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker? My mother lives with him and I live just a few houses down but he is sneaky. Although we have lived in the same neighborhood for our whole lives he is getting lost and scared.Although it seems like a creepy ""big brother"" move, It crossed my mind that a small tracking device might be one option.Possibly looking for a GPS tracker that I can put in his pocket that would allow me to quickly locate him in the event he takes off and gets lost.Any advice on this or any other options I might have would be appreciated.You should look into Tile (I discovered them a couple days ago - the reviews seem good, I'm likely to order them soon myself).... you get four thin Tile Slim gps tracking devices for $100 (or four Tile Mate devices for $70) and can track them with your phone. Here is their website: (You can search their app in the App Store) https://support.thetileapp.com/hc/en-us I had a tag made for my mother, at the Petsmart dog tag station. It has her address and my phone number, and I'm going to put it on her keys, which she remembers to put in her purse out of habit. That way at least she will know where she lives, or someone can call me to go get her. Have you looked at the cellphone tracking apps? They're made for parents trying to keep track of their kids, but if you can get him to remember a cell phone, that might work. We can't chip them yet. It  lets me find her  by showing a radar like  screen  that points me in her Direction and also it beeps  and make some lights  so I can track her by sound . There are trackers that are used 4 Hawks by falconers which actually allow you to track them down with another device. They cost a couple hundred dollars at least. The problem with most GPS devices is they are not exact. The advantages of both these kinds of devices is they are small and can be attached easily as a piece of jewelry or in a pocket. I am sure there's also GPS devices but I haven't used them yet Have you considered a clock that shows the time of day and his schedule and putting it next to the door? Clock and schedule posted might be nice to help with re-orienting, but near the door probably wouldn't do much... though might attract more attention to the door and idea of leaving. GPS tracker , cell phone apps, in addition not a bad idea I think, of course the ethical concerns because he is not giving consent or assent to the plan. Put something on the door to notify you when opened (there are different products). ensure you have at hand noted in one place info like height weight identifying features so you wouldn't have to think about it, with up to date photo. Try to find out places he goes or tries to go and routes he usually takes to keep in mind where he might get lost if that ever happens."	0
Venting: memory care move in We moved my folks into memory care. The greater family has either given up or will be some version of 'doesn't get it'.I'm taking a one month break from contacting them because I think they'll need months to fully connect with the staff. Although I think there cell service was suspended just now so my phone should stop ringing every hour.Hang in there. It's so frustrating & yes, I have gotten totally burned out again & again. There's nothing to say you can't stop by for 15 minutes to check in on them, short frequent visits generally work better and cutting off all contact so quickly can be very disorienting for them. It was recommended to us by the first care home my mom moved into to cease all contact for 3-4 weeks. We were ultimately not comfortable with not supervising her care in those early days and in a place she was unfamiliar with. It's all in the moment now, your visits won't have an impact before or after, only in the moment.	0
"Need a ""Panic Button"" that SMS' myself or family instead of 911 I have a live at home Grandmother who needs care to help going to the bathroom and changing her oxygen mask etc. None of these are 911 worth but she needs to be able to alert one of us when there is an issue. I work from home and am often home with her, but sometimes Im out to eat or going to the store. Is there a device that is a simple button that has wifi and can SMS me when pressed? Seems pretty simple but I cant seem to google the right words to find what im looking for.Maybe a cell phone? Jitterbug has big numbers if she can't see well. I understand, there's also a Sprint phone called wego. They have some on eBay. We bought a greatCall button system on Amazon that can be set to dial 5 phone numbers or 911. She can talk into the call button once you pick up. It got me an amazon link.. ""personal emergency response device"".. which will lead to a bunch more. I found stuff in there which does do what you are looking for."	0
It seems as though the simplest solution is hardest to find! Anyone have any ideas?As I say .. just a button, connected via bluetooth to an app, that when pressed calls a contact or emergency services.Thanks for reading. Hi, GreatCall has a little thing called Lively wearable (wristwatch) or Lively mobile (can wear on belt or as pendant around neck). They are emergency alert jewelry that enable the user to push a button and talk to the operator who can help them with emergency needs or with other senior needs like contacting you - tho not sure about the overseas part. Price varies from about $25 - $50 depending on if you want one that will send an auto alert to 911 if it senses the wearer has fallen.	0
"seeking tips for upcoming trip with grandma hi there, there is a trip to a camp that our family has made every year for 50 years. it's a regional conference for churches which my grandparents have always loved. however, many people in their generation have passed on or are not able to travel. she is 88. she can walk around and is very familiar with this camp in one sense, but in another sense she doesn't even remember that she still lives in her own home. she is aware that she has a relationship with her daughters and me, but does not recall the type of relationship (mother/daughter, granddaughter) or our names or how long we all know each other or, again, where she even is at the time (one of our homes which she should know)... so any tips please?! how to keep track of her while retaining her dignity and self respect. we have a room in the lodge right across from the bathroom and i want to hang a sign on the door with her name or our family name so she will think to herself ""well, this must be my room. Something about the unfamiliar surrounds along with the change of schedule just makes for a bad time for all. But... none of it is up to me. My aunt is the POA. I have fought this battle countless times.. in the end I know that my grandpa arranged for my grandma to always be cared for and her every need satisfied. it is hard for me because i have worked in an AL and memory care facility and i know why grandma says and does things while my aunt is somewhat blissfully ignorant."	0
Any recommendations on GPS trackers for loved ones with alzheimers? I was looking at a few online but they all seem to require smartphones. My mother-in-law is the primary care giver and she does not have a smartphone. She would need to track him via the web.What range is she needing to track him? Is not exactly what you are asking for but I suggest you look into LoJack's SafetyNet. Thanks! We use a specifically created ALZ phone for grandma, which has a GPS in it. It also only permits four numbers to be called at all times, and on the back there is a distress signal which automatically calls the numbers on the list and sends them an immediate text with coordinates. It's called the Doro 580 Secure and looks like this  My uncle has the Lively GPS device. The location is shared through a web dashboard, so no smartphone is needed. It also comes with a button that he can press to talk to a customer support person who can assist with directions and other matters eg. call my aunt on his behalf. It works well, but the downside is that it costs close to $30 a month. We've been looking at getting it for my dad. This review goes into more http://medicalalertsystemshq.com/reviews/lively-alert-mobile-urgent-response-device-review.html	0
I've chosen to focus on the eaely signs of Alzheimer's and more specifically this four parts:-Forgetfulness-Losing track of time -Losing motor skills-Familiar places becoming unfamiliar The whole video will be 30 seconds exact and I plan to incorporate real life examples of this happening without showing any faces. While this may be simple, I hope it will stir the emotions of some of the viewers.Like I said above, this may be the entirely wrong place to post this but I will try anyways. Any ideas are welcomed though preferably able to be shot within a students budget(aka no budget at all). That sounds like a great Idea. At this point he never really drove as I did all the driving so I walked to the post office with him. He went from a happy go lucky guy that never really got upset to scared and confused easily.	0
Is there a frugal way to keep track of dad with a gps/wifi watch? I don't need it to have a SIM card, I just want to be notified when he is about 100ft away from his living room. Seems to me that someone could hack a fit bit or other common wearable tech. The watch wouldn't even need gps, if I just got notified if he left his wifi perimeter I would be happy. I live across the street, so a quick notification is all I need.If anyone finds anything please Post. Thank you!http://www.ebay.com/itm/322043117831https://www.usmobile.com/plansEdit:-Simple non SIM Tracker:http://www.ebay.com/itm/292091522745 Try sticknfind. https://www.sticknfind.com/sticknfind.aspx . This is a location tag  that is Bluetooth oriented to your phone. I can set it so that it notifies me if she goes out of range . we have also used it on my grandchild at the playground just in case. It also can be set to make a different sound when the object, AKA darling naughty little kitty cat, comes back in range. It also helps you track and find the person or object. It even makes a beeping noise when you push the call button. It has  worked very well for my family and I anticipate using something similar on my mother eventually. There are more expensive things like this that have a greater range. The important part is it is free to use and you can install the app on as many phones of the family as you need. But I use an app called Life360 which I installed on my mothers phone and my own, it tells me when she leaves and arrives home.	0
Is anyone using Windows and/or Android Parental Controls to limit (this is ironic) their parent's ability to mess up their devices? My Mom sent each of the kids, and her ex- a query about protecting herself from attacks such as the recent ransomware.Unfortunately, she does not understand that she needs to do things on an ongoing basis (pay attention, take updates etc.) I want to protect her from installing/allowing things to install, etc. Best way is to control her pc remotely from yours so you can do the stuff needed for her. Google control pc remotely and you'll see several programs to do this. To solve the problems we were having with my 82 year old mom, we got her a chrome box and large monitor.	0
Its literally all over etsy and facebook) written on an IHOP receipt in her own handwriting. Even questioning my brother in law about a man that is the chairman of a committee that they are all on.To  be clear, not a single one of the four adult children believe our mom is having an affair. I told him i would listen to the tapes, but mostly because I feel this is my only opportunity to possibly get him help. Plus I live about 4 hours away, and if there is anything, my mom is probably chalking it up to it just being dad. All I know for sure is this is a major personality shift and I`my really concerned. He's been through her phone a million times, and the phone bill. My point is this is not based in reality and he's hanging onto a few circumstantial items like they're nuggets of fact and they just aren't.	0
GPS tracking for those with Alzheimer's Does anyone know if a device exists that is a GPS tracking device within a watch that looks like an old school regular watch? However, we are getting worried about him wandering off or getting hurt somewhere without anyone knowing his location. He refuses to carry anything he isnt familiar with, so something that looks like a normal watch would work well. Everything I find is very futuristic looking...No idea about a GPS but at the very least make a bracelet with his name, address and emergency phone number. I never found anything. It set it off a few times at night as he was getting ready to leave for work. I can track my dad using a cell phone app. That's the easiest thing but it can be lost or battery lose its charge. That's how we used to find my Oma. A kind soul or police officer would bring her back or call us. We use the Yepzon Freedom. It's small and will fit in a pocket or on a lanyard. Haven't needed it so far, but it's good insurance. It looks somewhat watchlike. In case you haven't figured it out yet, avid LifeAlert because it is only a panic button that works within a certain range of the home.	0
If I can give you one piece of advice is to use all your worrying as motivation to work really hard on something you really love. I'm working on creating a course to help people do this. If you're interested at all I'm happy to share it with you.	0
I don't know what to do.. Life is crazy People are stealing $ and i can’t do anything. It has been like that since I moved in 5 years ago. I feel so powerless to do anything. He has apartments that people are stealing 15k a month from. When i talk to him about my feelings and the way the things he says affect me, he just insults me further calling me a pussy, bitch, piece of shit, etc. I don't really have a life. My dad is racing horses all over the country. ), I don’t have nice things, no life and I’ve given up on it. I haven’t done anything for my life in that whole time, I dropped out of college when he got sick with a bowel obstruction and that was it. He tells me that if I do then I’m out of here! Because the way my dad is he doesn’t listen to anyone. The memory of him telling me how worthless I am and how he wishes his daughter was still alive taking care of him when we were at the bank has scarred me… I was just trying to help him… He was destroying me in front of the whole bank (echoing all over) just yelling at me how I’m a pussy and I need to be made into a man all because the teller said we had to pay $6 for some copies of checks and I didn’t want to fight with her to get it for free because it is irrational (it feels like fighting for free food from a restaurant..) He thinks only he knows. He is a control freak.. But I just don’t know what to do.. The years are multiplying and my life has slipped from me. Talking to his workers, the only people that talk to him are people that work for him.. And my dad doesn’t really treat them too well which is why there is always problems with his horse racing.. He never wins and his trainers usually don’t even care because in my opinion they are upset about the way they are talked to. My dad will hire anyone that will talk to him on the phone and answer it. He doesn’t care for my opinions, I can tell right away when a trainer won’t work out and he doesn’t listen. So my dad spends his days watching fox news, on the phone, or on the pc(writing letters, reading articles, watching videos.) He would rather just eat an apple for the day or a can of sardines so I'm forced to feed him every day because he refuses to feed himself. You need help and you need it now from people who've been there. You might also seriously consider taking a class locally that you'd enjoy.	0
"Early signs? Should I keep track? I've thought about getting a planner to keep up with my mother in laws odd behaviors, and forgetfulness to see if she is showing early signs since her father had one & her mother had the other. I will be the sole care taker for my mother in law when she is no longer able to care for her self. What I can do to help her if she is showing signs and ends up diagnosed?>  Knowing her she will keep it secret just like her mother & father did, until it was too late/obvious. There are a couple of home tests you can do to see where she is:You fill out fill out the test for ""mild behavioral impairment"" (PDF)Have her fill out SAGE TestThe completed tests should be taken to her doctor. . You're pretty on point with your knowledge of what to do as far as planning goes. The immediate course of action would to be what plus_dun_nombre suggested and to get the future plans in order and in writing. Depending on her symptoms, it might be too early to give a real diagnosis of dementia, but the testing can't hurt nonetheless. If both her parents had it then she's a very viable candidate for the disease but it can develop in anyone."	0
For the past few years now my mother's cognitive ability appears to be declining. She will get dates and times mixed up frequently even if I have reminded her multiple times (and this will be for something that is happening later the same day or the next day). I'm just wondering how to broach the subject of dementia with her or if I should? I know there's some online screening tests you can do but I'm not even sure it's dementia. Thanks. If you haven't yet, get a will and POA handled ASAP. The challenge is my mom is really sensitive. Probably the most sensitive person I know, so I will have to be super careful on how I have the discussion. My mom is in long term care with Alzheimer's. It took a long time for my dad to convince her to be assessed and a 2nd geriatrician 2 years later to get the diagnosis right.She has never acknowledged (or realized) that she has Alzheimer's. I can't speak in terms that I have a loved one showing signs of a cognitive decline or with dementia, but I am a CNA who has the pleasure to work in a specially designed lock down building dedicated to dementia only residents. The best thing you can do is get the required tests done to produce a proper diagnosis. It is a broad spectrum that has numerous different types that all cause different behaviors and affect the brain/body differently. It takes a lot of patience and you really have to be a special fit to work in that environment but I honestly can't think of anything I'd enjoy more.	0
Our facility is large with anywhere between 25-40 children in attendance daily. We have a pool, gymnasium, track, trampoline room, and a huge outdoor area, their favorite place to play. This area backs up to an assisted living facility.The assisted living facility has one rogue occupant (~80ish) in the advanced stages of dementia who likes to sneak out, wander around, and oftentimes gets lost. She can walk fairly well but is otherwise non verbal and cognitively checked out.When she sees us bring the group of children outside, she wanders over because she wants to play with them, which makes the children extremely uncomfortable because she will proceed to try to grab them, tug their hair, poke their faces, get at their jewelry (necklaces, bracelets, etc), pull at their clothes, hug them and not let go/block them from leaving, grab their backpacks, chase them as they run away, and more. When she finally leaves, it's usually to wander around elsewhere and we're always having to call assistance to one of the subdivisions in the area that she frequently gets lost in.We have had a talk with the children and they know to try and avoid her while playing, but it hasn't helped because she just chases/corners them if they ignore her. I don't have the authority to talk to her facility or otherwise take extreme action. My boss knows of this issue but I don't think she understands just how uncomfortable it's making the kids because it's 'just an old lady who doesn't mean any harm'. Is there anything I can do? This is not only a huge liability for you, but it's hugely unfair to the children. This should be taken up with the facility she lives in. There is a lot of legal action that can be taken out on both your work place and the facility this lady lives in. It is not the lady doing these things, it is the disease..So please dont feel guilty, it would be for the best of her and the children. As others have commented, she needs to be in a skilled nursing facility or a lock down memory care unit where the workers have been properly and professionally trained to take care of people like this woman. This patient's wellbeing and life are at risk if she has escaped so many times and it is pure negligence. If they contact you to ask questions please help them in any way you can.	0
Bluetooth Necklace Device for Elderly Neighbor My elderly neighbor asked me for help finding a product and I am struggling to find it. She recently purchased a home phone system that also has Bluetooth and she was hoping to buy a new neck unit that would allow her to connect to both. I don't know the typical name for this device nor can I find one that allows you to connect two different Bluetooth devices. Do you know of any devices that fit the bill? Or more appropriate places to look for help? Thanks in advance.I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)	0
"He misplaces things like his keys, phone, hat, chargers... etc and gets confused with even the simplest of things that 10 years ago he would have been able to do just fine, he's broken several things lately from trying to ""fix"" them himself because he would have normally been able to fix them but now he just does things wrong.We recently installed new taps in the kitchen and bathroom and within a month he had broken the taps in the bathroom because he tried to undo them because ""they felt broken"" which is just because they are different and could be turned easily where as his old taps had broken and were pretty fused up.He purchased a new door bell recently and he brought it over unable to get it to work so he wanted me to have a look at it, he had tried to open the doorbell to fix it and had damaged all of the plastic where he was trying to push a screwdriver into it to open it up when all he had to do was pull the plastic tab (it said ""Pull me out"" on it) to get the battery to connect. I let him take it home and we said we'd come and put it up on the weekend (2 days away), when we turned up he had been trying to open it up again because it ""wasn't working"", he had forgotten that he had brought it over and the only thing required was to put it up on the wall.Violence/AngerHe get's quite angry when he gets confused and he's also been a little violent towards my Nan by punching her on the arm on multiple occasions, we've spoken to him about this and told him that he can not do this, we've also spoken to my Nan and told her not to wind him up. He however isn't aware that he's told us.Recent ScansOver the past month he's also been having a few MRI scans and memory tests to check for any changes with his brain, however he still doesn't really tell any of the family (or his wife) the results and probably forgets the results by the time he gets home.My Granddad was spoken to on a 1 to 1 basis with my Dad in the car when they were coming back from his MRI scan and my Granddad said that he didn't think he had anything wrong with his memory, my Dad thought this was the perfect opportunity to talk to him and he told him straight up that he did believe that he though there ""was something going on with his memory"" but that there isn't anything to worry about and that he should just get on with life and enjoy himself. I could tell him the upcoming winning lottery numbers though (he asks all the time if I can get him the winning lottery numbers as I am always able to help fix things for him) and within an hour he would have more than likely forgotten them.Getting Lost...The biggest worry with him for us is him getting lost, he goes out in the car (doesn't tell anyone where he's going) and goes off at hours at a time, we don't know if he gets lost or what is going on.What we really kind of need is to get a tracker on his car/on his keys but we don't want to appear or be invasive for his privacy, the main reason we want a tracker is to make sure he's safe and ok, there's been many occasions over the last two years where it's 11 at night and he's not home after going down to the pub, he's not told his wife where he is and she obviously gets very worried, upset and scared. We have to go out and try and find him. He just doesn't understand and laughs at it every time.We noticed a note in the Kitchen about a ""loan"" and we're not sure what that is about, he says he doesn't know what it was about either and we're obviously a little worried that he might be in trouble with money and also a bit worried that he seeing someone on the side (I wouldn't be surprised, likewise our Nan wouldn't be surprised) and maybe giving her money (even though the money he has is equally shared between him and his wife)Taking control...We've already kind of taken some form of control by speaking to the pharmacy (with him being there) and getting agreeing that no changes to his tablets or how they are delivered can be made by him without one of us being there because he gets confused and has changed delivery of his tablets several times causing himself lots of stress, the staff at the pharmacy stress and causing himself to have to wait a few days without any tablets.Forgetting to do things like eating, brushing his teeth, wearing a coat... etcHe forgets to eat and has to be reminded by his wife constantly, if she was to pass away he would quickly get into a state and either not eat enough and become unwell or just get dirty because he forgets to brush his teeth (his wife reminds him every day), he forgets to put underwear on (his wife reminds him every day) and he forgets to go out with a coat on even though it's supposed to rain later on.What next?This is all of our first experience with someone with Dementia/Alzheimer (we're pretty sure it's vascular dementia) and really don't know what to do so any help and advise would be very much welcome and appreciated. The first thing you need to do is get him a thorough check up to make sure that these symptoms aren't being caused by anything treatable. Honestly, the meds that are currently available show little efficacy in most patients, but you can try them. A clinical trial could offer some home. Even if you sit them down and they agree to everything half an hour later it will be as if the conversation never happened; to them, it didn't. Most homes are utterly unequipped to deal with them. [Here's] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1307463/pdf/westjmed00154-0073.pdf) a list of reversible and irreversible dementias. The document is a bit old, but it'll help you understand (just like it helped me) that dementia is a symptom of a disease, and you need to know what you're dealing with in the case of your dad/grandpa.Second, form what I have seen in my grandma, your grandpa's symptoms sound quite similar to hers: see them here She hasn't been aggressive, though, but this could be due to her personal character. So, archive his scans and make sure to bring them to your physician/s for progression checkup.Keep in mind that if your grandpa has irreversible dementia he will be unlearning things day-by-day, from more complicated tasks like driving to simple ones like feeding oneself and going to the bathroom; so there will come a day when you'll need someone who will take care of him 24/7. A good, trained caregiver will be your godsend. Whenever my grandma talks about wanting to see her dad who died in the 1950s, we just straight up lie to her that he is on a vacation and will be back in a few weeks. I don't know which state/country you live in but reach out to your local Dementia organization. If I can be of any additional support, please pm me. Hi,That's part of the problem, he's very private, stubborn and the sort who would stay in denial for a long time, he would also get angry, frustrated and upset if we spoke to him about it and wouldn't let any of us come to the doctors with him so we can't ask the important questions; let alone get anything done. It's not really for me or my mother for example to step in as we can't do much being non-immediate family.As far as our medical knowledge goes (we have a very healthy amount between us) it certainly looks like vascular dementia, he's had 3-4 MRI scans over the last 3-4 years and they haven't said anything yet, I fully expect the results of his most recent set of tests to come back saying that he definitely has dementia and I can see something happening on the medical side. The only reason my Dad mentioned to him about he thinks something is going on (memory/brain wise) is because my Granddad started the conversation and it was the first and more than likely only good opportunity to speak to him about it, in private, without his wife (she'd chip in with comments which wouldn't help)Your advice, story and help is much appreciated. I don't know where exactly you are in the UK, but here in Aberdeen we have http://www.alzscot.org/ chapter and although I'm not originally from the UK and my grandma isn't being treated in Scotland, I have been visiting them for some moral support since last year and they have been extremely helpful. So have a look online for a local chapter and do give them a call even if you don't have anything to say and just need a bit of encouragement that you are doing all that you can. I'm sure there must be some sort of help out there.Yes, get your Nan on board as soon as she feels better. My dad has been struggling too. Hi, Thank you for your reply, very very late from me.I had a look at that website and we believe he's actually stage 4, but not too far away from being stage 5. The hospital gave us some telephone numbers and we were asked to organise a meeting with a lady from age concern / dementia uk.The lady went to my Granddad's place a few days ago and they (Granddad, Nan, their daughter in law and the Age Concern/Dementia UK lady) discussed a bunch of things, she suggested a series of things that should be done such as a joint power of attorney, getting attendance allowance for my Mum & Dad as they go down a lot and help them with all sorts of things from decorating, cleaning, sorting their tablets, taking them to the hospital/doctors... etc). We think it's because it's confirmed now so he can't be in denial anymore because you would understandable deny it, I certainly would!We're going to organise another meeting with the lady again but this time without my Granddad being there because there were a lot of things that weren't brought up that are a concern including things like in the last two weeks he's only showed twice and if this was brought up in front of him he would definitely get angry.My Nan, unfortunately is rather useless she is the sort of person who won't step up to the plate and take control. She's also really not good with knowing details because she nags at him and she also is very sneaky and uses his obvious forgetfulness to get things that she wants even though she doesn't need it. OR he needs to be placed in a memory care facility because legitimately elderly people cannot care for other elderly people. Have his license taken away. Or like I said, a memory care facility. Neither are cheap. In the states memory care places range from $4,000-$6,000 and up per MONTH. By the time I made it home to help my dad he was hiding knives under his bed and living on hostess snack cakes and not paying the mortgage. We have noticed that recently he has been letting people help more with things which isn't like him, almost like he's starting to realise he can't do everything anymore.In regards to the physical violence, he has stopped and hasn't hit her in 6~ months and that is after we spoke to his wife about how she needs to stop winding him up, going on at him about forgetting things. She's the sort of lady who would frustrate even the most sane so I can kind of understand my Granddad but we are all well aware and in agreement that he can't hit, we've told her if he does it again to tell us and we'll have to sit down with him and talk about it with him present as it's unacceptable and will NOT be tolerated.Do you know of any legal means for us to either put a tracker on his car or on his keys (I would put one on his phone but he uses old school phones) just so we know where he is for his safety and our peace of mind. His driving is still very very good, I can't really falter him in terms of his driving.We check up on them regularly between the sons and daughters and we also make sure they get out and about, be it food shopping, clothes shopping, random trips to the town for coffee or even take them to the cinema, theatre... etc so we know roughly what they're like, except for the financial side of things he refuses to talk about money and keeps everything private when it comes to money; it's a very British thing to do unfortunately. The only gps trackers I know of require a monthly service fee. I would work on the money thing if you can. My dad was very very easily upset about his money, of which I had total control of for the last year of his life. At the end of the day it's all being done with the persons best interest in mind. And the will forget they even need help if they do realize it. And persistence. Be observant and note any changes in behavior etc. We explained that he had already left and we told her we would drop in to the pub to see if he was in there and drop into the supermarket to see if he was there but just as we were going to leave the house to check the phone went off and it was him. We have no idea where he went. It's hard to develop a plan without access to his physicians and medical records - doesn't the spouse have access or any authority? To more practical things: I would ""break"" the car (take out fuses?) Limit the amount of cash and try to make sure he doesn't carry checks (my dad would just sign a blank check and hand it to the cashier at stores for them to fill out...). Make photocopies of identification he carries in his wallet because that will probably get lost."	0
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing? I think these devices could improve the ability for these people to live independently a little longer.I would like to know what caregivers need, and if there is enough demand to develop such tools. Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to complete this survey! Here is the link:https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/6ZVQKJKMods, please let me know if this is in violation of your rules and I will immediately take this post down. I don't believe this is advertising, insofar as I'm not making any immediate profit off of this survey. Furthermore, this is far from a get-rich-quick scheme. I sincerely want to develop tools that would improve the quality of life of patients, and simplify the caregiving process.I've gone through the survey, and while there are intriguing questions raised there, I have some general feedback.I'm a developer with multiple decades of experience, and I can see (in a general way) where you're going with this. If there were a device something like a fitbit or Apple Watch, that certainly would allay any concerns.Since I'm with my wife most of the time nowadays (and we have a small house), I couldn't really relate to the other features you were asking about, but I'd be interested to hear from other caregivers as to their opinion. I imagined that patients in the early stages would be as connected as you or I, and carrying a modern phone with bluetooth and gps. Indeed, a smart wearable might be a better requirement. My understanding is that an Apple Watch has a GPS radio, but doesn't have a way to broadcast the wearer's location to the internet. But there are inexpensive Android wearables out there that have more-or-less the complete cell phone experience, with 3G and GPS radios. It might be as simple as building a simple watch face on the front-end and adding some monitoring software that runs behind it. =]  They really highlight the fact that it's hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution. I agree with the simplicity and portability of the device. I have tried to set up netflix for her on the TV but that didn't seem to keep her attention either. I have painted the correct device button gold so she could get back to TV/Cable box control but she doesn't understand that. She needs some sort of thingie that prominently displays her name and address for any good samaritan who encounters her and wants to help.• I worry that her food choices have become very limited, and I'm unsure that what I'm feeding her doesn't accommodate all her dietary needs. I have no idea. Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing? Hi /r/dementia,After working on a weekend hackathon project, I have been interested in small devices that can help caregivers with loved ones who suffer early stage dementia or Alzheimer's disease. I think these devices could improve the ability for these people to live independently a little longer.I would like to know what caregivers need, and if there is enough demand to develop such tools. Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to complete this survey! Here is the link:https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/6ZVQKJKDone. Um, most of the products you are surveying about already exist on the market in the form of baby safety gear. You really want something I'd be interested in? I want a safety device that can track the location of an eloped patient in real time down to a 10 foot radius. I want it to be waterproof and tamper proof that is safe for frail skin and can't be removed by an elderly patient. I want to be able to set a radius alert that either creates a radius around the house or a fob that I can carry on my person. You make something like this and just about anyone who cares for someone with wandering behavior will be interested. As far as I know, there isn't anything like this on the market. It is incredibly helpful to hear back from people who can tell me to look down one path and NOT to look down another path. A simple text is useless. Moniters work great, but won't tell me where grandma went when she escaped. My sister in law recently was part of a search for an elderly patient that escaped their house one night. Every night she was out the temp dropped down into the 30's. A strait up tracker that was always attached to her would have alerted everyone to her exact location and prevented such an arduous search. If you can create the tracker I described, you would not only capture consumers who care for elderly wandering patients, but also a ton of parents of special needs children with cognitive impairments, parents of toddlers, or just parents who are paranoid. That is a MASSIVE market. The patient wouldn't be using specific voice commands they would need to learn, they would just be shouting for anyone to help them. By the time I got an alert ID probably already know grandma was missing.How would you already know that grandma is missing? The product that I envision would be sending an alert at the very moment that the patient leaves the house irregularly. Irregularity is to-be-defined, but it might mean leaving at odd hours (after dinner, before breakfast) or any time that the cell phone is not being carried on the person. Most moniters have a button I could press to let me speak to her like a walkie talkie to let her know I was coming.The second thing: baby proofing doors can prevent a lot of escapes but not all, but again who care about a blanket text, I watched granny like a hawk but she was sneaky as fuck. They are impossible to wash, and are useless unless on the patient, which I can just about guarantee, 90% of the time a patient escapes with nothing more than the clothes on their backs and where they are going is the important information, not that they have left an area because a patient can be astonishingly fast when they want to be. This isn't just 'simple app stuff' you need to design here. There's a zillion apps, and they all have a major flaw, a phone can be destroyed by the patient. Putting something on a phone like this would be mostly useless. Here is something that may fit your needs. It's a gps tracker that goes in the sole of the shoe. http://gpssmartsole.com/gpssmartsole/ The closest thing are GPS locators for dogs. Here are a few of them:https://www.thepawtracker.com/blogs/the-pet-tracker-blog-by-the-paw-tracker/84621315-top-13-gps-pet-trackers-dog-and-cat-cell-phones-best-of-2016-reviewed	0
It is a requirement that each of the residents wear a wander guard device that will alert the facility if they attempted to elope. We need to find a way to mask the wander guard device so that it can be placed on his body and not have him take it off. There is only one device per resident. Or if he has glasses, add a necklace/drawstring/lanyard to it and attach the wander guard to it.	0
Worried About a Neighbor I am really sorry if this is the wrong place for this post. If it doesnt belong here I will delete it or the mods can handle it. Last night at ten PM my dogs went crazy and started barking at something outside our front door. I went to look and I saw a little old lady crouched beside my garage hiding from something. This is in Anchorage, AK and it was 15 degrees out and snowing heavy. We chatted for like 20 minutes, she had no ID or other effects with her just a coat, house slippers (her feet where frozen), and a pocket knife. She didn't have a phone or list of contact numbers. I suggested that we call the police to come help us find out where she should be. So we got in my car and started looking (I was very skeptical that we would find it) but sure enough after 20 minutes and some back tracking we found her apartment. She told me all their names and married names and about her grandkids. So heres my question, I found her adult daughter on Facebook she is a second grade teacher at a school very close by. I want to send her a message but am very uncertain how best to approach the topic. My intentions is to let her know that I found her mom in a pretty unsafe place and if she wants to exchange phone numbers so that if she needs someone close by who can check on her that my wife and I would be happy to help. I just don't want to see this lovely older woman get hurt because of improper supervision. At the same time Im just a neighbor its not really any of my business and her family may very well have a good handle on things. You did a great job and I'm sure the daughter will be grateful that you stepped in to help. Im going to sound like a creeper but I looked through her daughters FB page and there are tons of pictures of her mom with her and her kids at lots of different holiday party and family events from this past summer. My grandma who I believe has some form of dementia, too gets very hazy around sunset and often wanders around at night. I think the old lady's daughter will appreciate your message, concern and offer of help very much. As someone with a mother with dementia, please contact her daughter! I would want to know. My own mother is getting up there and has a bunch of different health problems, none dementia related and it has been really hard getting her to accept the help she needs. It was very hard for me to accept help initially but now if someone offers a day/time they can help out I snap up the offer! Tell us what happens  I will I would definitely let the daughter know.She may not realize the danger her mother poses to herself. Nothing new to add in terms of advice, just want to say that you did  a really good thing.	0
They typically find her sitting in someone's car in the neighborhood, which in itself is scary because people not understanding what's happening could become violent in the protection of their belongings. Sits down and then gets right up and starts wandering around the house. Someone even told him he needs to divorce her which would make a ward of the state and they would then place her, but they could put her in a home anywhere in the state. I did for Early Onset Dementia and got it, to the tune of about $400 a month. This is not safe and your brother needs help. Please call the Alzheimers Association and tell them you need resources and advice. Ca APS, tell them you are concerned about her safety (wandering!) and health. They can provide help as well.	0
GPS tracker for elderly I'm looking at GPS trackers for my Dad. He won't carry a smartphone, but we think we can get him to carry a tracker. Just wanted to know if anyone had any insights. Location is Illinois.Hi there, I would call the Alzheimer’s Association. You can try Medic Alert and Safe Return. It's a great system to track someone with dementia in case they wander. The Alzheimer's Association used to provide GPS tracking device, but they discontinued for several reasons. I had a professional caregiver tell me that trackers give people a false sense of security. My opinion is that they are a good back up. I just recently found this item offered by Ting, a smaller wireless provider based on Sprint. They are likely available on a bunch of other carriers too. I really like the form factor, it looks like it would be unobtrusive and not get fidgeted with.https://ting.com/shop/Tinitell-Charcoal-New-GSM I believe most mobile phone carriers have trackers. LoJack makes a good people tracker. He needs a tracker but he won't wear one or he'll take it off just for spite. I'm looking for a chip of some sort that can be sewn into the hems or seems of his clothes. He won't know it's there so he can't remove it but it can be washed with the clothes. We've decided to try the Yepzon brand. Update:  The only way you can tell if it's charged is when it connects to the network. Our yepzon's last connection was January 3. I contacted yepzon and they said there were failures in the 2G network that affects the connections and the pairings of the devices.	0
"My mother-in-law is concerned because he sometimes gets lost. I've researched some tracking devices, but they all seem to have bad reviews. Does anyone know of some that really work and aren't very expensive?Has anyone used those ""tile"" devices for tracking? He hates technology  This is not a tracking option but could help. Find him a cell phone similar to his current that has an sos button. This is a dedicated button that calls a programmed number. The one we used would even turn the phone on and then dial the number if needed. They are starting to make tracking watches (often for children) that use a SIM card but that is another thing your father (or mother) will have to make sure is charged and he is wearing and had poor reviews. Again I have no help to offer in the tracker as I like you, viewed the options and could decide if any were actually up to snuff. I'm in the same boat with you.My mom carried PocketFinder for awhile but stopped carrying it regularly. I almost want to chip her. Have you considered getting your father in law a medical ID bracelet or med ID dog tag style necklace? It has my first name and phone number on it, along with her name and simply says ""memory issues"". Something like this might help: https://www.alz.org/care/dementia-medic-alert-safe-return.asp Sorry. In fact,  she doesn't even want to leave home most days.Have you considered an android or apple watch on a cellular data plan? There are geo location apps on the watches that help you track your routes. You would be able to see the routes on a computer. It would be both functional for him (keeps time and shows date) and for you (tracking mechanism). Have you considered getting your father in law a medical ID bracelet or med ID dog tag style necklace? It has my first name and phone number on it, along with her name and simply says ""memory issues"". Apparently our local police department has free trackers (radio frequencies??) We've applied and are waiting to hear if we're approved. My FIL is not quite at that point. My hope is that he will have something and be used to carrying it before it's really needed Pocket Finder is supposed to be coming out with new device soon."	0
My grandfather has started wandering a lot, including at night, and we need some way to quickly locate him once we realize he has left his apartment. We first tried project lifesaver but it didn't work for our son with autism that has sensory issues. It's a wearable gps tracker that will send you an alert with his exact location (anywhere in the US - which we wanted because our son visits his grandparents in another state during the summer) if your grandfather exits a predefined zone. You can even give the home where he will be access to find him if they want. It's the most advanced tracker we've seen and we've tried them all. Thanks,  I'll look into those. I see where PocketFinder is $130 but does anyone know how much the monthly service plan costs?? Is it month to month or is there a yearly contract?AngelSense has a Fall Special going on right now where you get the device and first month for $100 then it's $30 a month with a 1-year contract. *edit Ok looks like PocketFinder is $13 a month Yes, first attempt was a tracker that attaches to the keychain. It's heavy and needs charging daily.Naturally over time mom carries the tracker less and less frequently. Some have longer battery life, but the tech is still pretty new I guess. PocketFinder worked well for us. You'd need a way to ensure they carry it (keys?). You can set geo fences that will notify you when he exits. I don't have experience with GPS trackers. 1) Does he live with anyone? And 2) If so do you guys have a bed or door alarm so that you know when he's at risk of leaving? Someone has been staying with him this week and there is a sensor on the door to text someone if he opens it,  but it doesn't say if he left or where he went. There are also Webcam in his apartment so we can see him. It's more about finding something to let us know where he is if he leaves. I am interested in the Safety Net Tracking system. I got the name from a man who works as an EMT. It goes by radio signals and it is sort of like a Lo-Jack for a person.	0
But...apparently his doctor hasn't ruled it out so he was able to make an appointment at the DMV for someone to meet him, go over his medical history and paperwork in a month and see if he is allowed to even take a behind the wheel test.He also doesn't eat much. For reference he was around 160 - 165 and healthy most of his adult life, worked out and lifted weights regularly and had a hearty appetite, was never obsessed about calories or keeping a specific diet. ), and that he's never felt better about the way he looks than now, even when EVERYONE, including his doctors and nurses, comment on how thin he's getting, and advise not to calorie-restrict any more than he has, friends who haven't seen him in a few years couldn't recognize him in person, etc.Bottom line is I wonder how much treatment, (whether it's antidepressants, or other medication/therapy of some sort) that he SHOULD be getting that he's not because his doctor isn't made aware of the full extent of his issues. My oldest sister (f42) was given power of attorney after a heart surgery about 3 years ago, but is no longer heavily involved with his medical care since the stroke. It's comforting to know there are others out there facing similar challenges and how others are learning to deal with the fact that sometimes there's not much we can do but to offer our support and make suggestions but still lean out of it and accept that they're gonna do what they wanna do... You can call the Dr. and speak with a medical assistant. This person cannot tell you anything about his health, but you can tell them what you think they should know.Also, consider video taping his outbursts. I've thought about recording his outbursts but I am just really afraid that it will aggravate him even more? The video, if you were to make one, is for you. I'm kind of in that position with an unhealthy relative now. He does not want to have people making decisions for him, period.	0
created this site to help keep loved ones safe and independent in their homes I have been working in the community as a rehab therapist for many years. I ran into many families and clients that had no idea all these assistive aids and safety equipment were out there. So I decided to make a simple website to showcase the different tools and aids that I recommend on a daily basis for falls reduction and ways to increase independence.Please have a look at www.helpmedevices.com, I would love to hear if there are any other tools or strategies you've used and welcome any feedback. Thanks.For everyone's information, the website has my amazon affiliate links.Lovely site, as someone who's been working has a home care attendant I also didn't know a lot of this stuff. There does not seem to be a central location where people can learn about all the assistive aids. Will be adding a lot more items early next week. I think the site is great! I would love to feature you on our site!	0
Its a new emotional challenge in life that no one can practice for, There is only reality when it comes.I know that you are still extremely clear minded and ready for decades ahead, your ability to keep the house together so beautifully, keep the job responsibilities at Wally World for as long as you did, to deal with the gravity of your recent breast operation and treatment, and to deal with the every accelerating change of family and work between Chris, Beth, Dad, myself and Jen, and also the challenges that you've seen your sisters live through, between John's passing, Kathy's stroke, and all of the irregularities that come later in life.its all an incredible swirl, and it creates stress and frustration. You and Dad beat me to the Grand Canyon! There are still dozens of great American geographical and cultural treasures out there which neither you and Dad, or Jen and I, or Chris and Beth have visited. I am really struggling with my career yet again. Its Dad's moment to retire soon, and ensure that the two of you are fully released to enjoy yourselves.Physically and mentally you are just beginning to feel a new perspective, an emancipation, where you go with the next 5 years, and then 10 years, will only be guided by your imagination, and maybe the house cats (if they have any say in it, Bruce, Jenny, Ally, and Rip altogether! Comfort, Fun, Adventure, Discipline, Friendships, Community, Diversity, and most importantly Love.You and Dad Take care while Jen and I vacation, Enjoy the Soylent and gummies, and keep your thoughts creative, your Trust steadfast, your Faith focused, and your heart as warm as it always has been.No Matter Where Your Mind Takes You, I'll Always Know Your HeartLove always,  Your oldest, and wildest, SonVery sweet.	0
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes I'm sorry for what's going to be a long, untidy, and overwrought first post. I'm stuck in a cycle where I feel like if I can just find the right way to explain something she'll understand it. I know it's not going to happen, but I don't know what else to do when she harasses me relentlessly with questions and then insists on debating the answers. She'll then seek me out and tell me that I failed to give her her pain pills. I spend half an hour looking and finally find the pill box hidden under her socks in the bottom drawer of her dresser. She insists she never loses them. Why do I have HER pills? Several of them have outright stated that mom is 'my job'. Outside of that, I might as well not exist for them. They'll never once asked for more information on her medical conditions and I can't imagine them ever asking how I'm coping. My father worked several jobs when I was young, which is the reason taking care of my mother got pushed off on me (I'm not necessarily saying it was a good reason, just...an understandable one? By the time I was a young adult the pattern had been established and any time she had a surgery or illness I was the one expected to take off work so he could continue paying the bills. Now he works nights and sleeps all day, and interacts with mom for MAYBE an hour each night. For whatever reason, she does not harass him and will hush me if I'm frustrated because he's sleeping and 'shouldn't have to deal with this.' But I should, I guess? When they do interact, he really has a hard time coping and gets frustrated within seconds. I know how hard all of this is, but he takes it very personally if she can't remember things and I end up running interference between them. And yes, I know how messed that is, and the funny thing is that when I was a teen I used to say I would never become my father's wife. Well, now I've become my father's wife and my mother's husband, and fuck all if I know how it happened. When I was fresh out of college I gave up a great career opportunity because mom was sick and it would have meant moving away from her. At this point I haven't worked for five plus years, my savings are gone, I have a big old employment gap, and no idea how I 'm supposed to both work and care for her. I'm living in my parent's house and my father does provide groceries, utilities, a room, etc, but we've never been a well off family and I'm not comfortable asking him for other things. My car needs two thousand worth of repairs that ain't never happening. I've been trying hard lately to get him to go talk to a lawyer and figure out what he needs to do to be prepared for when it comes time to move her to a care facility. I do honestly that might be better for her, even if she's resistant or upset at first, but again he refuses because he doesn't want to upset her. Even when she had her neck operated on and couldn't get out of bed, I could have a rational conversation with her. But when I was 13 I thought I would have plenty of time to be independent later...only later still hasn't arrived. But now that I'm feeling like a fox in a trap, ready to gnaw off my own leg to escape, I'm in a financial position where I can't just pack up and go.She was doing the pill thing tonight and suddenly I just couldn't. I couldn't catch my breath, couldn't move, couldn't talk to her. Couldn't do anything but focus all of my will and conentration into NOT screaming at the top of my lungs. I'm scared, and I'm downright terrified when I imagine I could still be doing this a year or two years or five years from now. I'm not even sure what advice I'm asking for. Suggestions for how to take care of yourself when you're with someone that absolutely will not respect boundaries? Just...help?	0
"Dealing with my mother with dementia tl;dr: Mother has been recently diagnosed with dementia. ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE AND MY THOUGHTS ARE ALL MESSED UP, SO IF YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING PLEASE LET ME KNOWHello, I am 29 years old and my mother is almost 74. Even though she has been getting worse since 2010 we've only been seeking doctors since dcember 2014. This is due to the fact that she was taking care of her own mother (96 years) who had been bed ridden since 2010. I couldn't stand it for 20 minutes, let alone 2/3 years). Then she started sinking .. fast ... REALLY fast. He sent for a few tests and it took us a really long time to get back to him due to my mother's panic attacks making it impossible to travel. 3 months later we had to track him down and practically beg to get our tests back so we could go to another doctor. After that I tried taking her with me to where I live, a large brazilian city and my mother lives in a small uruguayan city. I tried taking her with me but she went completely crazy after arrival and I had to take her back home immediately (after 1 hour in my city) by car, where she procceeded to freak out the entire 6 hour ride and open her door while a car was passing us. Finally we go to a new doctor a month and a half ago who said it clearly .. she has dementia. At that time my world came crumbling down and I barely heard a few thing: ""She's probably had several microinfartions in her brain, which is certainly why she is always dizzy. Her dementia has a vascular side to it certainly and presents some symptoms similar to alzheimer and another dementia. We need to perform a pet scan with the FDG and PIB markers to get a better idea"". It turns out that I'm not prepared and I can't manage. After the doctor's visit she has been progressively worse very fast. Until a week and a half ago she was taken by her brother to the emergency room because she stopped talking and was completely stiff. Turns out she was severely dehydrated (probably a combination of medicine) and since then she can barely walk a little bit with help because she falls on her back if you don't grab her (her position is literally like the back slash ), doesn't take her medicine (we basically wait until they dissolve in her mouth), doesn't eat well, doesn't drink a lot of water and rarely ever makes sense or is able to pronounce all the words she wants. I checked this link about the stages of dementia and I can certainly tell you that she is now firmly in stage 5 and hast at least 75% of the symptoms of the 6th stage of dementia. She went from 4/5 to 5/6 in just 3 weeks and I'm scared.Ok. Sorry for the long vent but I needed it. - I live 500km away in Brazil. Instead this one lets me get back home whenever I need it and really helps me. This is specially kind considering the economical crisis that is happening in Brazil. The past 6 months I've spent at least 3 here. I have a really great boss (no, he doesn't reddit).Current symtpoms- Can't walk without help.- Can't do anything without help.- Can't maintain a conversation.- Confuses past and present.- Talks to dead people.- Confuses me for her brother and her brother for her father that died in 1977- Confuses TV and reality- If we don't give her medicine that make her sleepy she doesn't sleep.- She starts crying non stop after all medications wear off and stays like that for about 6 hours. I don't want to give her too much because it could make her worse, but if I don't give her something she'll kill herself. Any suggestions? Waht could it be? I already tried talking to her doctor but he isn't here. The nurse we hired was hired back then because my mother had a tendency to do whatever she wanted, not take her medicine or take any other medicine in any doses (we didn't know it was dementia, I had my suspitions but I'm an engineer, not a doctor, and no other doctor said it at the time). In march she had a lot of difficulty saying some words and started creating memories (If I said a number and someone said bank she would get it in her head that she needed to go to the bank to deposit the number I said in her account .. she did that for weeks, every day at least 50 times a day and she would read a piece of paper put it down then pick it up again and read it again .. she did that for 30 minutes non stop .. I timed it once). I can feel her getting worse and everybody else around her as well. Advice- How can I make her feel better?- Does anyone know how to deal with this? I'm kinda young and wasn't expecting to go through this at all, even though my mother had me almost at 45. She's always been a rock for her entire family and many people in the city (remember she was a doctor .. a beloved doctor to some a hated/loved/respected co-worker to others).- I live 500km away and besided going to her house every weekend and on emergencies I don't know what else to doEDIT: Added a question and reformated some of the textFirstly, I am so sorry you are struggling with this. Progression: It's likely that due to her vascular dementia she is continuing to have what are known as TIA'S, which is a ""transient ischemic attack."" This is basically a mini stroke and could be behind the quick deterioration. Alzheimers disease progresses steadily instead of in steps. Diagnosis: whilst this is not the nicest fact, it's true. The only way to 100% diagnose a dementia is via an autopsy of the brain. When a doctor diagnoses a dementia, it is not set in stone. So far the vascular dementia diagnosis sounds accurate, so does the alzheimers disease. If it's the latter, it is possible she has a lewy body dementia also. Think of your mum like an iceberg (weird but hear me out) what you see is what is above the surface  (crying or being angry) and that's her way of communicating to you that something is wrong. Below the surface, that's where the problem is and unfortunately you can't see it. It could be something like needing the toilet, pain, feeling sick, shoes being too tight, discomfort, not hearing well, not seeing well, things being in the wrong place, frustration as she doesn't know what to do, she's tired. It's mostly about trial and error. It could be that she is experiencing depression as this is unfortunately very common in people living with a dementia, especially alzheimers disease. Everyone's experience of Dementia is intrinsic to them, no one else will experience it the same way. Generally stages are referred to as ""early"", ""middle"" or ""late"".Dizziness: if by bathroom you mean urinating, she may have a urinary tract infection. If you mean pooing, she could be constipated. It could also be none of those and something else entirely.How can you make her feel better: you will know this better than anyone else. It's also important to focus on what she can do, not what she can't do. Try to go along with her reality. If in that moment she believes you are her brother, try not to tell her otherwise. Both of these have forums and people to talk to who are going through similar things as you. If you have any more questions please feel free to message me and ask. If I don't know the answer I can try and point you towards organisations that do. I completely forgot about it. I almost understand her behaviour like science. It usually calms her down but it doesn't work all the time and I am really afraid of giving her too much medicine, because I know it can worsen her condition.About the bathroom. Today she walked a lot more than she usually does and she did it until her legs were shaking (it's really difficult to tell when she's tired ... It started in 2002/2003 (I was 14) when all of a sudden she stood up from the couch looking like she was agonizing and she ""drunk walked"" (body pressed against a wall) until she reached the bathroom and started puking. She put her head on the sink, spread her legs and put her butt on the wall (very thin bathroom) or else she would fall. She went to doctors but they all said: ""you're fiiiine .. you're gonna outlive us all"" and all that ""jazz"". She did the next MRI many years later when I forced her to and by then the damage was already done.About making feel better. Fortunately I always aggree with her reality and I go along with everything. That's one f the few moments she feels well. As much as they may love their grandparents, when it happens to a parent or parental figure it's so much worst. If she's this advanced, I'm not convinced that she will be able tell whether she's in Uruguay or Brazil. In any case, you really need to secure your own position in order to give her the best care possible. Yes she can. At least for the moment she recognizes it. People with dementia tend to have plateaus and then they decline and then they plateau again for a bit. What I can say about coping is that with family members of those affected by dementia this is really where the grieving process start to happen. Whenever you are dealing with behavior the best thing you can do is meet her where she is. If she is looking for her mother do not tell her her mother is dead. If you need help get help. If you ever have any questions about a particular Behavior or something like that feel free to inbox me. I work in Recreation. It physically and emotionally destroyes her and there is nothing I can do.Thank you for your helpedit by the way. I mean. Her head doctor say her two months ago and then saw her in the hospital. He left the room almost shaking. It almost sounds like she may be regularly having little ones. Is the medication she is on available in any other form besides pills? And yes there is anxiety medication, but when it doesn't work it really doesn't work."	0
We aim to move our device to be a predictive device to help reduce the financial and human cost of Dementia. This is a brief overview of our product and business. We are on social media if you want to find us. Facebook,Instagram and Twitter search esoleltd  There are a couple issues I have in general with wearable trackers:. 1) the patient needs to remember to wear them. Question 1. Our research from speaking to carers in the field is that people with the disease often have very limited shoes often one or two pairs. So we feel confident that our device will be in the right place at the right time. Another great question, we are actually wanting to design our own large wireless charging pad. Hi kbsncme Sorry for the very late reply.	0
TrackR - find lost and misplaced belongings, or a parent I see requests for ways to track a lost parent here all the time. I will continue keep a look out for devices that might help families of ALZ patients.	0
"Selfish caregiver? Hi everyone,Thank you for reading. He had advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma and there is a fifty fifty chance he will make it.He has already undergoing a year of treatment, and we face another year after this. Before this I have dealt with some health issues, a difficult job, and some depression issues. It hurts to eat due to my medical issues I just purge every night now. I called a therapist to talk to someone about the bulemia issue and to help get me back on track, but an other advice would be welcome.My heart goes out to you. I started to read a lot of very positive comments about the technique and found a free app called ""Journey"" that could be used. From my perspective you are beating yourself up over some perfectly rational & valid behavior. Kick back, pet the cat, maybe watch something on TV."	0
"I don't think it's age-related. He said that I'm right, her short term memory is pretty bad. My mom had undiagnosed heart issues (that required an emergency pacemaker installation), and the doc said there was a small chance that those issues could have contributed to some cognitive decline. If not, I think it's more than just age-related mild forgetfulness.My parents do crosswords and sudokus together daily, and read a lot and watch TV/movies and go to concerts. But because of my mom's organisational issues and also a leg issue related to a childhood case of polio, she won't go out and walk much anymore. I noticed it on this last visit. She just won't do it though, and it's really frustrating to watch!I trust her with my son, but I'm not sure my dad does - so when they're watching him, my dad takes primary responsibility.I guess I'm not really asking a specific question...Just more to get it off my chest. I can't stress enough the importance of having a conversation now and how much of a burden it will remove if you have her input on what to do next. When my dad would shut the subject down I'd let it go but always made sure I verbally expressed ""Fine we don't have to talk about this if you really don't want to."	0
Any advice for cooktops (induction hob) with safety features to avoid saucepan left on height for long period?	0
In the period where he was still able to live independently (at home and then in sheltered housing), there was constant worry that something might happen; and regularly something did. Another time he had left the oven on and almost caused a fire, or his windows wide open when he went to bed in the evening, and once just couldn't get out of the bath but was too embarrassed to pull his alarm to call his carer and couldn't reach the phone to call us directly.Thinking back on this experience and interacting with others recently it’s clear that these aren't occurrences that are unique to my personal experience with dementia. Essentially, for the past few months I've been developing some technology/sensors that could allow families of dementia sufferers to non-invasively remotely monitor their relative’s environment and activity. They will be able to monitor and receive alerts on things such as unusual door and window activity,  temperature, humidity, and light in individual rooms. With these measurements close family members are able to be alerted if their relative has gone wandering unexpectedly, left windows open, the oven on, lights on, the bath running, etc. I would have bought it without hesitation no matter the price.Being able to do things inside the house remotely would be amazing. I love your idea and if I was rich I would give you lots of money to help this become a reality.As soon as my granny was moved into a home she changed and hasn't been the same since.	0
"I thank God I was working from home today. And I've suspected she has dementia from other clues (she asks the same questions repeatedly, she's forgotten how to do things she's always done, she's ""slower"" in her gait and seems constantly unsure, etc). But she has more good days than bad on average. She'd turn off the taps but turned it back on without letting the auto ignition click on to light the flame. She could have asphyxiated (???) or could have blown up the house.My house is pretty much wallpapered in notes to keep her on track, but I'm thinking I'll be ordering an electric stove today after this scare.Getting her to the doctor for an evaluation is also indicated, as some forms of dementia are reversible, while others so fast moving that the stove investment may be rapidly followed by an out of home placement, making it a waste of money."	0
"It'll really drive someone nuts. I get so frustrated with this one because she asks questions such as ""where's my mother, father, or brother?"" Not to mention, just recently when she walked out the house she started to throw rocks at my car and wanted to hit me with a stick.Hygiene: This one is just really fucking gross and there's no easy way to put this. In my own defense, no it is not.This is just a copy and paste from a post I made previously. It's the same thing with showering- not only do they forget they haven't showered, but they might also forget HOW to do it, and their brain often plays tricks on them- the water coming from shower head can look scary, it might feel cold even though it's warm, they might be afraid of slipping or think the bath water is deep even though it's quite shallow. Get Lysol spray and Lysol wipes, and just do a quick wipe down of door handles, sink handles, etc.I don't think you should be her caregiver either. This disease is a bitch, and caring for someone with it is extremely hard. I was with my grandma 24/7, but was struggling physically (migraines getting worse, gaining weight, very depressed) and couldn't afford to not work. Even in my grandmother's more advanced stage, she KNOWS something is wrong, although she won't admit it outright. The brain chemistry changes- they lose taste perception, temperature perception... Tell a white lie. It became easier for me when I started looking at it as a job, not as caring for my family member. And while you're figuring out the more long term arrangements, get on Craigslist, care.com, see if any aides at the day center want extra hours, ask through word of mouth... Find someone to supervise her, even if all they do is make sure she doesn't walk away! Thank you so much for your post. It's not that I'm discompasionate it's just that my grandmother used to live with a caregiver this was about a year ago now and the caregiver got overwhelmed with taking care of her that she was more or less dumped onto us. Since my mom doesn't come back around 6-7 I'm stuck taking care of her all alone just me for 4-5 hours Monday through Friday. It's definitely harder to be invested & kind & forgiving when it's not really something you signed on for. I was trying to be honest, and sometimes I can be harsh. I understand completely the situation you're in. Until you guys have a long term solution, my best advice is to breathe, and focus on this: ""so what?"" So what if she refuses your meal? ((Hugs)) message me if you ever need to vent, or pm me and I'll add you on Facebook. Just to chime in, I don't think it's a lack of compassion on your part, especially since you haven't really even had the chance to live your life, yet, but are already being burdened with something that your mom, and/or any of her siblings, if she has any, should be taking point on. Your grandma's wandering is an accident waiting to happen, and there are probably other at-risk things going on, maybe involving electricity and things that catch fire, for which you can't reasonably be expected to catch all of them unless the only thing you're doing is focusing your attention on her when it's ""your shift"", which, again, isn't fair to you. Get the doctors / social careers involved it sounds like it's time your Grandma transitions to a residential home. Later stage dementia patients are very difficult to handle, they can do harm to themselves or even others if not handled the right way. You're not handling this the right way, you're either too stressed/burned out or not properly trained to handle it. there are ways to cope etc but you might have heard all that already? Jesus. Your grandmother should be in a facility with people who are trained to deal with dementia. editI can totally relate to your frustration but please don't kill yourself. ((hugs)) With absolute respect to your family, I don't think you should be put in this position at all.Does your grandma receive Medi-Cal as a secondary to her Medicare? Does she have assets? There are many assisted living facilities that have space reserved for such individuals. Have you checked to make sure you are using all the resources available to her? Contact your local Alzheimers Association chapter to see how they can help you. Caring for someone with this disease can be soul sucking. Learning strategies can help you cope. TRUST ME. I have tried all the strategies. I am 100000000% done. First of all, I am so sorry for the situation you have been given. My dad has dementia and we recently found a place for him nearby but it is pretty expensive. You will need to look at ""memory care"" or alzheimer's facilities and ask for those that have locked doors or alarms that go off when doors are opened. I think there may be state funded nursing homes (?) Overall, i think I liked caring.com better in terms of customer service. They seemed more genuine and they didn't constantly call me and bug me. Being local, they might have a better idea of good places.My dad is at a place that is a national chain, called Brookdale. I don't know how memory care works everywhere but make sure the price is all inclusive. (For ADLs or Activities of Daily Living). I can't believe you have been saddled with her care while going to school. When my mom had hip surgery and needed temporary help, she hired someone that was recommended by the other retirees in her community. Please try to talk to someone in the meantime - councilor at school? And find something that takes the edge off like listen to music with a headphone in one ear while dealing with her. Oh! They also have an alzheimers support group but that involves you having time to go - so not sure that will help, but perhaps you could go once to ask if anyone knows of a facility?? I was (and still am) in my 20s when I lived with and cared for my grandmother who had dementia. I think the other commenters here gave excellent advice. I'm not playing around anymore. If you want the nuclear option call http://www.cdss.ca.gov/agedblinddisabled/PG1298.htmand tell them your mother is forcing you to care for your grandmother when you are not capable of doing so and your Gran is in danger as a result. OK well my mom does a lot of shit but nonetheless I love her and I do not wish for her or myself to be arrested. You could also try telling your Mum if she does not get a proper placement for your Gran you WILL call that number, and then there will not be a choice. I remember your previous post. Did you look into state funded nursing homes. They can only charge the income the person has. or your counties Council on Aging should be able to help you (I mean your mother) find a facility. waiting to be fed, she does not need to be taking care of your grandma either.First, your mother should be trying to get your grandma into a facility with a little help from you. Not the other way around. I would stick to my guns no matter how guilty she tries to make you feel. I would make sure I was not at home during those hours anymore. This will force your mother to do something about your grandmother. The only other thing I can think of would be for you to get a part time job and move into an apartment with other roommates. I know you are young, and putting your foot down and sticking to your guns, no matter what (like guilt and religious jargon), and making big moves can be scary, but if your mother does not change this situation, you need to find a way out."	0
Intro and my non life Hello all, new to this sub. My life is so out of control right now. I also take care of my mother. She has Leweys Body Syndrome (sort of dementia symptoms with mobility issues). Add to that, there is no pay (live for free with mother and sisters in the garage, but contribute with food), and trying to find 2nd or 3rd shift work that ties in with buses has been negative so far. So no money, constant demeaning, trying to stay on track with my own health. She got up and fell, after she was told to sit and wait. And no social life. Great dating resume! I moved here to help take care of my mother, but except for dressing and bathroom issues, it's me. Sorry for the rant, in what was really to be an intro. Hope everyone has a good day!There are bound to be social agencies where you live that can offer help. Where I live there's the League of Older Americans. They run the Meals on Wheels program and have groups where caregivers can meet to talk about our family member. They also offer a daycare program for people with dementia/Alzheimers. It is led by a psychologist who knows programs and doctors who can help. There is a large community out there who can help you. Just start looking!Take care of yourself. Thanks, I'll look into these. I'm sure there are groups like you mention here in FL, given many seniors here. We completely understand that here :/ You're in the right place.	0
First of what is the frequency and how does he gets tracked?	0
"MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective? Today my MIL wandered off early this morning while her husband was in the shower. It took all day to find her. My FIL has, in the past, used her cellphone to keep track of her, but this morning she left her purse in the house. She recently hid her drivers license from him leaving him unable to get new healthcare, because she believes he is tying to poison her. This morning she left because he wouldn't take her out somewhere at 5 am. We are sure she will attempt to leave again, and will not willingly wear anything her husband gives her. Will a GPS device really work in helping to locate her if she wanders off again, and do they make one for dementia patients that has a lock or some other deterrent for taking it off? The very real possibility that she might become paranoid enough to harm your father should be brought up with her doctor, as well as the wandering. With both those, she could be committed involuntarily (or ""sectioned"", depending on your country). The aggression can become very bad quickly.My aunt ended up in jail. Thank you for saying that. I genuinely worry about him, but I'm not sure what they will do. My husband's siblings are very against any idea of her in a facility, even temporarily. We are getting together this weekend to discuss options and indoor after this they will realize it is not just about her husband's safety, but hers as well. > My husband's siblings are very against any idea of her in a facility, even temporarily.Sadly when most people think of putting a parent in other living arrangements, they think of nursing homes.I have a close elderly family member who is in a care facility at the moment that only houses dementia patients. They lost their medical insurance and are in the process of getting it back. I will bring this up ASAP. Do you know for sure what type of dementia she has? I have been reading about Lewy Body Dementia and it sounds like the drugs really do have an effect on the quality of life of someone with dementia and can help lessen some of this behavior if they are correctly diagnosed and given the corrects medication. At least one of you should read about the medications and get to know it and any changes in her behavior to make sure its going ok.  Doctors rely on accurate representations of the patient's behavior. My father was never put on a memory medication for 5 years and is only now getting it. They also changed his meds to reflect Lewy Body dementia rather than Parkinson's and its really made a huge difference.My other advice though if improved medication does not cut it is to get her to a place where she will be safe. I don't unfortunately. She was diagnosed two years ago, but is not on medication currently because at the time she refused it and no one has brought it back up since. When they go to see the doctor I will ask my husband to speak with the doctor about the specific type of dementia she has. I did a quick search and found this kids watch. One feature I liked was the ""Electric fence"" ""After adding an electric fence name, you can set a fence with the watch as the centre and with a radius of 100 to 5000. The APP Client will receive an alarm when the watch enters or exits the fence."" Maybe he could slip this in her purse instead.This is a whole page filled with tracking devices. Thank you for the resources and suggestions. If she can remove it I'm almost positive she will. Project Lifesaver is a program run through many local police departments across the country. It's a bit chunky, about the size of the palm of your hand. Like this incident you described, it's not a foolproof strategy because they might not bring it- but it's an idea. It is VERY accurate., quick and user friendly. Scissors, knives, garage and garden tools- someone with dementia who isn't thinking clearly could injure themselves or someone else. It's a great suggestion at this point. After the wandering episode the other day she is even more out of sorts than normal. I made myself a ""three strikes"" deal- if she lays a hand on me ever again, I'm done and out. Maybe your FIL needs to make a similar deal, draw some sort of line- he does not have to live with physical abuse, whether the abuser is of sound mind or not. She can't necessarily help or control how she's behaving, but he doesn't have to suffer as well. UTIs are common with dementia because they tend to not wipe properly, and the infection can wreak all sorts of havoc. I know you said they don't have health insurance right now, but it's past the time for medication. He can call 911 or bring her to the emergency room if it gets bad, and they will have to treat her. If he refuses to bring her home, then they have no option other than to keep her, or they can send her to a geriatric psychiatric unit which will stabilize her with medication. It's an amazing source of info and support. I am definitely going to check into that Facebook group. I am going to talk with my husband about picking up a lock box tomorrow for him, so that he can start keeping things that might pose a danger to her safely away. Unfortunately she left it behind this morning when she left. The wearable devices are very expensive though, so I guess I'm just wondering if it's actually worth the cost. In the meantime I will talk to him about trying to figure out a way to keep the phone on her instead of her purse. I don't have any experience with them so I don't know if they are worth it or not, but I think if they have the right health insurance then it might cover some of the cost. Add an alarm to the door so he'll know if she leaves? We are definitely adding an alarm to the door. The logic runs to me that if she needs a GPS, what she really needs a boatload of meds and/or to live in a lockdown memory care unit. I agree that it is time for medication, and we are pushing for an emergency appointment with her doctor to re-evaluate."	0
The basic rundown seems to be that if something happens, a helpful stranger or emergency medical teams can scan the device with their smart phones and obtain information. Do people know to look for the bracelets or what to do when they find them? The technology relies on databases and some companies charge a monthly fee ($5 seems average). Do people want to wear the bracelets? To me it seems like there is no use in the thing if you can't convince someone to keep it on?Just wondering if anyone has experience with these things and would they recommend them?My mom has allergy to penicillin and the ER did notice her bracelet . I was with her, of course, to let them know. (my mother threatened to replace me with a bracelet; I asked her if the bracelet was going to fetch her paper in the morning, or make her dinner :D) So they do work because EMTs are trained to look for them, but strangers won't necessarily notice them. I guess that's not ideal but it's better than nothing.	0

Thank you.I actually use the family tracking app for android, Life360 to track my father using the GPS in his phone. Knowing this I should spend a bit more time on the drawing board.	0
New here. The police found him 2 miles from home. Some even have phone interfaces so you can check in. Look into getting an adult babysitter. They also have day programs for adults that can be amazing opportunities for new experiences, socializing, and giving caretakers a break without worry. It has an app, or you can view it on the website. It only uses battery when it's in motion, so depending on how much he is in motion, you might have to charge it every night. Also highly recommend having a flyer saved in your computer with his info and condition- a recent picture, name, places he might head towards, all of your contact info- just in case. I agree with the person who recommended a caretaker or a day program. To the person with Alzheimer's, it seems like just a watch, but it can absolutely be tracked and you can even monitor the vitals (heart rate, etc.)	0
"I am working from home about 45 hours a week and taking care of her at the same time, and taking care of my now almost 2 year old as well.I am really reaching the end of my rope. I am stretched so thin. My poor husband has just been lost to the shadows at this point, I have no time for myself or him. By the time I'm finished tending to everyone's needs, it's past 8pm and I just crash into bed, only to start the next grueling day all over again.I am so stressed out, and I am starting to feel incredibly trapped, angry, resentful. She hates those institutionalized environments and does not do well in them. Their level of care varies from really good to pretty terrible - they've repeatedly screwed up the (numerous) medicines my wife has to take, she's had some falls in the hoyer lift (which I can't criticize them too much for, as I've also dropped her from it).But with the advancement of the disease, I just don't feel it's safe for her at home any longer. I did my research and found an amazing home - it's about 30 minutes away (the only real downside other than being a nursing home), but it's a beautiful place with top-notch care. We talked about it (a lot), and then went for a tour. Oh - fix up this house and maybe buy a condo that could be set up for caregiving.I hate this disease, I hate this house, and I pretty much hate life right now.But to your original point (sorry, lost myself in a self-pitying tirade there! ): I absolutely understand about it feeling like ""the end,"" and the resentment you're going to experience. Realistically, a nursing home is going to provide the level of care and attention you cannot (well, if you find a good one, obviously). While a child absolutely has a duty to a parent, the greater responsibility is the parents' towards the child: it's hard-coded into nature that a parent sacrifices for their child. Some(often)times that is absolutely horrible, but it's what it is. If your mother were able to look at the situation objectively, she would agree. Put yourself in her position: if your daughter were taking care of you, wouldn't you want to make it easier on her and do what you can to allow her to take care of HER child? This is going to cloud her judgement and make the situation more difficult, but you have to put aside your guilt and base your decision on what is going to be best for YOUR child (and, really, your mother): you cannot continue in this situation. But I think you know this is for the best - there's just a ton of guilt and feeling like your failing your mother that you have to deal with. Stay strong, and we're here for you any time (even if we're not always the quickest to respond!)! Um....wow....just, thank you so much for your response. And I'm so sorry to hear about your wife. At least my mom is almost 70 and has lived a long and wonderful life. As age declines, we expect these things to happen. You do NOT expect these things when you are in your 30s. I cannot imagine how devastated you both are. Truly my heart goes out to you.I think you are completely right that this all really just comes down to guilt for me. Now we just have the long journey ahead of us to figure out timing, find the right place, etc etc.Thank you so much again for your thoughtful response. I simply cannot tell you how sorry I am for you and your wife. My husband and I both loved his brother very much, and as I'm reading your story it feels like my heart is literally breaking for you and your wife.I honestly don't know what, if anything, to offer you in the way of advice based on his experiences. It occurs to me that some things you may not want to hear and other things may not even be good for you to hear! If you have a question you'd like to ask, however, please feel free to do so and I will attempt to answer it as honestly as possible. Our thoughts andprayers are with you and your wife! I came here because I was feeling sorry for myself, having given up my career to care for my 88-year-old mother (who has Parkinson's disease and a genetic vision impairment) for 6 years largely alone, without respite or a support group. And then I read your story and kwip's and . . . wow . I think these are feelings that anyone would inevitably have under the circumstances you've described, so please just accept them as natural and don't be hard on yourself for them! Because my mother is older than yours, my sister (who lives out-of-state and deigns to speak to our mother on the phone for 5 minutes once a week) has for the past four years aggressively tried to place her in a nursing home. About four years ago, mother agreed to stay in a nursing home temporarily while she was getting some physical therapy and she called me every day of that 6-week period, begging me to get her out of there. Now, as my mother's condition continues to decline and her needs increase, the question has come up with more frequency, both in my mind and expressed by my husband, and the memory of those calls is one of the barriers. As a result, I applaud the fact that you're talking openly with your mother about it and referring to ""we"" when it comes to the journey ahead of you. I really think that, if it's at all possible, getting her on board and facing the decision as a family is key. And since you have small children, I think discussing this with your mother in the broader context of ""family"" may be helpful to you; they are also her grandchildren and it seems likely that she would want the best for them and be willing to make reasonable sacrifces to ensure their wellbeing. I value myself as a person, love my husband and other family members as well as my mother, and realize that there are no guarantees with respect to my own lifespan or theirs. Our family's value system is such that we don't necessarily value quantity of life over its quality so her happiness -- as well as mine and my husband's -- are factors that weigh heavily into the determination of where she would be ""better off."" My mother, for example, takes 1 pill at 7:00 am, 2 pills at 8:00 am, yet another pill at 9:00 am, pills at 1:00 pm, at 5:00 pm and at 9:00 pm because that's the time schedule that works for her medication. The machine could at least in theory be set up at your mother's bedside and all she would have to do is push a rather large button -- the machine calls out nicely whenever ""It's time to take your medicine"" -- for the cup with the appropriate medication to come out at the appropriate time. I feel a strong sense of loyalty to her and I truly want what is best for her. I'm afraid I'm not able to be the best mother to my daughter right now with all of the stresses and demands that come with caregiving. It's sad. I wish we had more years of her being healthy. She seems like a pale shadow of the person she used to be. I am already grieving her in many ways.I am also exhausted, burnt out, stressed out, overwhelmed, frustrated, depressed, anxious. I definitely need some therapy and help on my own, but I also think that working full time and trying to be a full time caregiver as well as a mom to a toddler is just stretching me way too thin. We definitely struggle with helping her to remember everything so an alarm and automated dispenser would be a lifesaver."	0
How do to know if a loved one is taking their medications? Hi guys,I'm wondering how you keep track of medication compliance of a loved one when you're busy with your day?All the bestThe only way is to watch them take it. take more than one day several time in the same day. That way I can only take out a specific day and set it out without having to worry about my wife taking more than one day. My pill situation is totally handled. This is really hard to do without being there. I combined it with a distinctive bowl to dump the pills in. If they never dump the pills you can see they have been missed. You can check the bowl to see if they were swallowed. Once a month I talk to the pharmacy, we make any changes needed, and they fill everything for the month. The only problem comes in if there are changes, then it gets tricky. So far we have only had to add meds so it was manageable.	0
Plus it's easy to read and it lets them see the date and the day.	0
My dad is in the late/moderate stage of ALZ. I put a door guardian on the front door (this thing is awesome - highly recommend it!). He's in his bedroom tearing apart DVD cases. Cool. So I walk back toward the garage. Knock on the back door to try to get his attention. 10 minutes later he walks by. I know full well he can't understand instructions, but I ask anyway. REPEATEDLY. I motion with my finger pressing the button. He's not saying anything and not really looking at me. YES! He opens the door to the garage and walks in there, but doesn't press the button to open the outer door. DAMMIT!So this continues for FORTY minutes. Me running around the house trying to get his attention and trying to get him to open the garage.Luckily, the guy 2 doors down (who happens to be a carpenter/do-it-all handyman) was around and saw me. He came by and helped me remove the sliding patio door from the track and I was able to get in. HOLY MOLY! This guy is a lifesaver. I felt (and still feel) SO indebted to him. he is 68 I'm thinking that the Door Guardian might not be such a good idea, and it might be better to install a deadbolt keyed on both sides. In addition to which, having an extra key locked in a key lock box that is opened by button press combination.	0
"Phone for Mother-in-law My mother in law is 60 years old and has some very serious memory problems. According to her son, she's had some emotional/psychological challenges throughout her life and they've compounded with the memory problems. We've done our absolute best to help her - from the initial realization, having her license removed, moving her into independent living - but she resists absolutely everything we try to do. She's also manipulative and only seems to remember things she wants to remember - she's aware of her memory problems and sometimes clearly uses them to manipulate us. It's fun and after 3 years is starting to wear on my family.To the point...She was recently involved with a dangerous person while in independent living. She didn't tell us about him and managed to hide the entire situation from us for 3 weeks and even made up a false name for him. When we learned she was seeing someone, we were happy for her. Then we figured out the car situation, then the money, then found a couple bruises. The police did nothing because we couldn't find him or the car and we didn't have a record of the cash.The man has a significant criminal record (DUI's with an impounded car - now we know why he wanted her to buy one, multiple thefts and break-ins, and he's homeless). (She is ""in love with him"")We were concerned for her safety. Somehow, and I have no idea how, she managed to call him. We had a week-long saga of phone blocking, which ultimately seems to have worked. We haven't found anything that is helpful or available in the US. It'd be nice if there was GPS tracking on it.Any suggestions?tl;dr: Mother-in-law, neuro degeneracy, psychological problems make it more challenging, involved with bad man who steals money and abuses her, she vehemently protects him, need to get her a dumb phone that can only call listed contacts, would like to have a gps tracker in her phone, can't find anything, hoping for suggestions and maybe some advice...I think they make phones like that for little kids. There are like 5 buttons max and the parents have to program the numbers and all the kid can do is press a button that dials one of the pre programmed numbers. Reddit has a sub /r/cellphones which might be of more help. Didn't know that! Super helpful. Thanks! What a mess. Thank you! I'm sure it's challenging regardless of age, but as a group of 20-somethings there have been many tough realizations and decisions so far"	0
"My mother thinks having one executor or one person to keep track of medical is playing favorites. What can I say to make her understand? She starts and stops meds on a whim (or because someone gave her essential oils). I spent all three days in cardiac ICU with her. She said it made sense. Then I find she's been inviting different siblings to different doctor's appointments. I told her I'm out totally. You may want to call a pow-wow with all your siblings, so that all of you are on the same page; that way if she invites Harry or Fred to an appointment, they will say, ""we need to take Betty, she's your executor"". Even if you don't get along with your sibs, you all need to be on the same page... I hope it works out. I only have one crazy sibling, so I've got that going for me.It sounds like she needs to turn power of attorney over to someone. You probably can't have her play fair."	0
Gps car tracker The other day my grandfather-in-law took his car for his normal 15min daily ride. He didn't come back for 4hrs. Any suggestions?sounds like you need to consider getting his license revoked.I Went through the same thing with my dad back in december.It's not easy but when you consider if he runs a red light or gets lostfor a day in cold weather, it becomes a safety issue for the community.you will probably need to get creative with the method you employ for taking care of this.remember it is the best for HIS safety AND the safety of the community. Hide the keys.	0
I'm constantly stressed, I'm having panic attacks and anxiety. Thanks for the reply. I'll get onto them tomorrow to see if I can find some form of help. I'll check out a local TD I didn't think they could help us! I'm going to the doctors tomorrow as I think I might need to see someone just to talk too, I've suffered from depression for a long time before all this so this isn't helping.	0
Alzheimer's Support Groups I went to my first Alz support group today. It's good to talk to others, if for no other reason then to vent. It may be comfort, it may be an emotional bond to it.See if Dad can do specific things, like empty the dishwasher, fold clothes. He wants to feel helpfulMaybe we should buy him tickets to the Opera again. He enjoyed that so muchThe movie Still Alice, We may want to check that out.	0
It seems like a lot of such devices for adults and children work under the presumption that the person is almost always in range of a base station of some sort. My family/SO have never had a problem finding me (on google maps anyway) when I've used it. You should look into the TRiLOC location watch. I currently work and intern for Alzheimer's Association. Here are devices they recommend on their website.http://www.alz.org/georgia/in_my_community_20344.asp#tracking We are working on something exactly like this designed for seniors and should be launching on kickstarter in Q4. I'd love to talk to you about it.PM sent	0
"I looked online for some ‘tracking monitor’ or easy phone… they were all somewhat patronizing.So I was thinking if others have this similar problem and what they used to fix it? Are there any products around that allow him to have some control of his life and his dignity? You should look into www.lifeprotekt.com. I have dealt with this company and it works very well. They offer wearable (watch-like) GPS devices, and a variety of other products that can come with good service plans. Good luck with your dad and I hope this helps! Thanks for the help. iPhones have built in trackers ""find iphone."" That's what we're using with my mother in law, who is 67 and has Alzheimer's."	0
I bet there's something out there I just haven't found yet, since yesterday when it became clear that wandering is now a part of our dementia fun.The stuff on alz.org looks pretty bad and exorbitantly priced. I was told to register my mother with the sheriffs department. They would provide a tracking device. The best thing we found was a child locator it was like 15 dollars a month. I'll give the police a call and see if they have anything to offer. They know us now, due to the frequent 911 calls in which she asks to be taken home. It's an app for both android and iphone and uses the cell phone's gps to track family members. I have dealt with this company and it works very well. The devices can be linked directly to your iphone/android/computer desktop. GPS technology is such an important asset to have when you have loved ones who can wander away or go missing. Also, try contacting your local police department-Let them know that your loved one has an issue with wandering, and sometimes local police departments can provide assistance in paying for GPS technology.	0
"Need to vent My dad, 66 is chronically ill, I'm 25 and my brother is 28.I grew up with a pretty rough childhood. My mom was emotionally abusive, and the only interest or support my dad did gave me was financially. I spent my teen years taking care of myself, researching, studying, trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with me mentally and how to fix it. He was never abusive, just maybe emotionally neglectful. He's just not very socially intelligent. His idea of being a good dad was working full time, providing money, having a pretty wife, a nice house in the suburbs, 2 kids, and a social life with weekend leisure time with family friends. Turns out that doesn't work out so well if you're constantly worried about money, your image, and what people think about you, rather than love. She and I barely talked for the next 5 years, and she never fought for any kind of custody, nor did she pay child support. I think I found out about the COPD by finding a brochure in his bathroom that was probably titled something like ""So You've Been Diagnosed with COPD..."" then Googled COPD.Eventually I went to college, and my brother moved back home, we switched spots. Going home is extremely depressing, both because of the state of the house and how my dad is living, and because it reminds me of a very sad childhood. He wallows in self-pity and every day he tells you, ""today is not a good breathing day for me"". Being around him makes me feel like I'm in a vacuum where any positivity, humor, love, or happiness that exists in the world gets sucked out. My happiness is based on travel and adventure and by surrounding myself with positive people doing meaningful, constructive things with their life. I am not meant to stay in one place. While old high school and college acquaintances are settling down, buying houses, and having babies, that is the last thing I want to do. The career I've built for myself has full-time travel in its nature and the field has no job opportunities in the city where my dad lives. He's been very generous in helping me out when I need it and in paying my health/insurance/student loan bills. I don't think he would expect me to, or ask me to stick around and be his primary caregiver, but honestly, I think he wants it and he needs it. It seems weird to consider the possibility of him having some kind of assisted living situation while he's still driving himself to the office and working 9-5 daily, so it's a confusing situation. I think he's partially in denial of his reality. He can't walk more than 20 ft at a time, yet he rejected my suggestion of getting a wheelchair or some kind of device to improve his mobility. The other day he suggested my brother, him, and I go to do something on the weekend like go to a museum or a place ""we can walk around"". My aunt suggested he mov into senior care facility, but he said he didn't want to be around old people... he's a senior citizen. I'm finally in my own recovery phase and getting my life on track. It's like I've spent my whole life caring for myself and trying to figure out how to be happy, and now that I've found that happiness that was so elusive for the greater part of my life, it's irreconcilable with caring for my ailing dad. I'm 25, I just want to enjoy life for once, I've endured and waited long enough. If I were to be my dad's primary caregiver, that would all be thrown out the window and I'd revert back to a world depression and anxiety. At this point in time, I've been accepted into graduate school overseas and I want very badly to go. His situation just came back and hit me like a ton of bricks. I don't want him to be neglected. My brother lives with him, but my brother is not the most responsible person in the world. I fear I will go to school far away for a year, and lose my dad in that time and live the rest of my life feeling I should have done more. But I also dread the idea of being stuck in a horrible suburban hometown in the southern US, in a home full of bad memories and feelings, and throwing a promising life and career out the window for a parent who never gave me the love or emotional support a child so obviously needs. Have you talked to your brother directly about his ""care"" of the house and your Dad while you've been gone in college? If he could see how he is neglecting the house and your father, perhaps he would keep things a bit more tidy. I would guess that he might have the same emotional ""pulling"" that you do... feeling torn on helping him because of his neglect when you were growing up.Would your brother will be staying in that area even if your father wasn't in the picture? Does your Dad have the funds to have a cleaner come every week or so?"	0
Drug Compliance (help please!) Hi Reddit- I am part of a group trying to develop a better device/method to keep drug compliance with Alzheimer's Patients. Any other general comments regarding Alzheimer's in-home care (esp drug compliance) would be greatly appreciated! p.s. I tried weekly pill boxes, then a pill box with alarms. He either didn't hear the alarms, or would dump the pills out to stop the alarm but still not take them. But like someone else who posted below, we would also have to stand by and coach her.Maybe something that is timed and won't open until it is the appropriate time to take them would be enough, I mean it is not like we can integrate all the medication into one super pill that is somehow easy to swallow!You might want to reach out to the Alzheimer's association magazine and see if they would be willing to have a questionnaire in one issue.	0
A year ago he moved to assisted living but we still use this.	0
Other than that I would say if they have a caregiver ask the caregiver if they can keep an eye on it and if it's taken off to try and have the patient put it back on, then record the date/time it was put back on. I don't think I can get it to look like a regular watch... Or maybe like an antique styled necklace if it can be worn around the neck. Unfortunately I'd say it'd be best to have like a house arrest bracelet. I've seen GPS systems modelled like watches, and bracelets, and the people (only about three) I've used them with didn't take them off, as long as it's familiar as an object that should be on their wrist it seems to be fine. I think I should test it out, but yes I want to make something nice looking. Would feel terrible (especially due to connotations) if it were used like an ankle monitor that they use for parolees! Identify something they routinely wear and embed the chip in that? Is this project still active? My mother has dementia. I have done some small work on cognitive prosthetics and would love to help you.	0
"Wearable GPS tracker I'm looking to find a wearable GPS tracker for a friend who has a loved one with dementia. They are moving their loved one to a home with a caretaker but would like the extra piece of mind that a GPS tracker could provide.Was wondering if anyone here has used any such device or has advice and recommendations. Cheaper device and plan. Things like these are a good option, you pop a SIM inside and they have a decent battery. The issue is making sure the person has it on them when they wander, and that they don't jettison it (my mother has a tendency to remove anything from her bag that she doesn't think should be there). I'd look at an ID bracelet or necklace, something with ""My name is Dave, please call xxxxxxxx on this number"" - we found my mum that way when someone picked her up on one of her excursions."	0

I'm looking for a device that will alert me when the elderly woman I work for leaves her apartment building. The facility actually has an alert bracelet that goes off when she leaves, but it's often faulty and the staff are too used to hearing the noise to pay attention.The family is hoping for some other noise-making device or something else that will allow the facility to know when she leaves a certain zone.Price is basically no object.Have you tried this option? http://www.navistargpsshoe.com/gps-shoe-how-it-works/ I have the same problem with my dad so I just put alarms on all the doors so when he opens them I know he is headed somewhere with out me.

GPS Tracking for Alzheimer's patient in Greece Hi r/Alzheimers,I'm currently doing a little research into GPS tracking for a friend's grandfather who lives in Greece - he has a tendency to wander, and his family wants to buy a GPS tracker for him. The only problem is that the majority of the products I've seen require constant internet accessto work - does anyone know of any products that can send SMS co-ordinates instead?Try looking at the Tramigo Portable Hey, don't know if this is too late, but I heard about this: http://www.gpsshoe.com/faq.cfm	0
"If anybody knows where I can find one or the best ones on the market, please comment. Thank you. There are a few types of tracker you can buy, the most basic (and cheapest) is a mobile phone - we put a mobile in my mum's handbag with numbers like ""Husband"" and ""Daughter"" in it - it won't help them pinpoint her, but it'll give the police a rough area, and anyone who finds her can use it to call you. Then you move onto things like these which are genuine GPS systems - the problems with these are making sure they stay with the person. http://www.alz.org/comfortzone/You may want to look into this program. It's not available everywhere but it's basically exactly what you are describing."	0

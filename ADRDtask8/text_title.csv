Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes Hi!
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,"My niece took our car, and it had Mom’s lift belt in it."
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,I cannot get it back.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,I used the belt to help my Mom in and out of cars (from a car seat to her walker or chair).
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,Can anyone recommend a replacement that I can order from Amazon?
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,"Also, Mom is having a harder time getting out of her shower chair."
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,Even with wall handles.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,"I have the chair at it’s maximum height setting, so I’m wondering how to get better traction for her feet."
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,She hates the bath traction strips I put down and insists on having a towel under her feet which is too dangerous.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,"She can only hoist herself up, just barely, from the right side."
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,Any slippers or other devices you can recommend would be helpful.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,We have a walk-in shower but I’m starting to wonder how many more weeks it will be practical for her.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,She can get into the shower fine.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,Getting out is dicey.Here's a really basic gait belt similar to what you get from the hospital.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,"I've found that the fancy ones with the hand grips and different features are too slippery and open up making it a fall risk.My dad uses this shower chair which sits much farther out so that he can sit while outside the shower, spin his legs around, and scoot over.Also early on in his recovery my dad had issues lifting his legs and walking."
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,This device helped him spin to sit and stand.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,It's basically a lazy Susan for people.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,It does need someone to assist.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,She may not be able to do it on her own.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,"There are a few good ones I found, I used the search term ""gait belt"" I dont have any personal experience with any of those, though."
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,I'm wondering if some pool or water shoes would work for what you need for grip though.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,"They can be fairly easy to get on and off, and pairs I've used in the past are pretty grippy."
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,Might be worth a look.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,Crocs.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,They make slippers that work well for my dad as shower shoes.
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,"My preference for a gait belt is the one with various handles as it gives me more options by which to grip a patient without hurting them.As for showers, look into getting a transfer bench."
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,"I have one elderly, below the knee amputee and that is how I get her in and out of the shower."
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,"The shower has a handheld so she can essentially rinse herself off, after I soap her up."
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,"Once she is out and dried, its up and back into the wheelchair."
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,"I have a ""security pole"" right outside the shower for her to grab on."
Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes,And she wears shower shoes for better grip.
Caregiving with Technology,Caregiving with Technology Hello AllI am a 27 year old caregiver to two elederly grandparents and two aunts with Parkinson’s.
Caregiving with Technology,"Me and my wife take turns feeding and helping around the house, I’ve noticed that Alexa has a lot of skills that could be useful for elderly folks."
Caregiving with Technology,"Asking for weather, time, calling family etc etc."
Caregiving with Technology,I’m a self confessed techie and wanted to use that skill to help.
Caregiving with Technology,I’ve created a few Alexa skills to help us around the house as wellI was wondering if there is any technology that anyone uses here to aid in Caregiving?Alexa has been great for us too!
Caregiving with Technology,"My boyfriend (30m) became quadriplegic a few years ago, and we’ve really embraced the Echo in our house.We use Eufy lightbulbs from Amazon with yellow-to-white options."
Caregiving with Technology,"So we can say “Alexa, turn bed lamp to white,” “Turn living room light to 100,” etc."
Caregiving with Technology,"We had the standard one at first, but the ability to have white light during the day and yellow light at night really made a difference We also have some compatible plugs for small appliances like the humidifier."
Caregiving with Technology,"And a fire tv for the bedroom, fire cube for the tv in the living room."
Caregiving with Technology,That way both can turn on the tv and control volume through Alexa.
Caregiving with Technology,What sort of skills have you made to help out around the house?
Caregiving with Technology,We’re always looking for ways to make things a little easier :) Elderly people often lose technological skills and abilities they had before.
Caregiving with Technology,"Your idea sounds great, but be prepared to be met with blank stares."
Caregiving with Technology,"But please give it a try, and keep us informed!"

I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I think I just need to know I'm not alone Sorry if the format is weird.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I'm on mobile and this is kind of my first actual reddit post ever.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"At the beginning of the year my (27F) Dad (64M) suffered a stroke, leaving him unable to speak, swallow, and move the right side of his body."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"He already dealt with diabetes, high blood pressure, an amputation (luckily just some toes), extremely poor eyesight, and overall was a very disorganized person."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,So prior to the stroke I was already somewhat of a caregiver.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I checked his feet almost every day for diabetic ulcers.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,If he had wounds I would dress them.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"I kept track of all of his appointments, and my boyfriend would drive us to all of them (I don't have a license)."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Other than that he was largely independent.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"He cooked his own meals, remembered to take his meds, and was pretty normal!"
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,But I had been taking care of him for almost 5 years already and was starting to feel the burnout.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,My life was on hold until we could figure out a way for him to not Constantly be on the verge of foot infections.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Side note: his foot with the amputated toes has a longer medical history than my entire life.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"It's kind of irrelevant now, since he's bed bound.....but my point is my life was stagnate and I was starting to burnout with no end in sight."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Until...My older sister and her boyfriend decided to move back home to help me out.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I was excited to have some help and maybe enjoy my youth.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Maybe find a job related to my degree instead of a part-time job (which I enjoyed a lot but wanted to move on from)...and then my dad had his stroke.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,They're still moving back!
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,In fact my sister is here already to help out....but she's working from home and now I am our Dad's full time caregiver.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I volunteered because I love my Dad and I Can do this.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,We also didn't really have a choice because no care facility in my state would take him.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"I quit my job, and take care of him all day and all night."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I'm stretched so thin I don't have the emotional capacity to deal with anything else.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Which is awful!
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"My boyfriend and his family are going through their own trials, and I feel awful I can't support him more."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,We've been together for 6 years.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,His family is my family.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"And my boyfriend is so stressed about my dad And his family, that he's constantly angry and/or depressed."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I don't know what to do anymore.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I just want everything to be okay.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I want everything to be normal but it can't be.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,My dad can't move half his body.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,He can't have anything by mouth.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,His care and therapy are my priority.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,But I don't want it to be.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I'm just so tired all the time.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,And I feel guilty for not giving Dad my undivided attention.

I think I just need to know I'm not alone,To ask for advice?
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,To seek validation?

I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"All I know I can do right now is take care of my Dad.First, you sound like you are already at burnout stage."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"If your sister is really there to help you out, then I suggest you get the actual help you need from her."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,She works full time yes but you are literally working 24/7 so she still has more spare time to help.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Even if it's only on her off days.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I'm guessing you need like an actual vacation to recharge yourself.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Even if it's only 2-3 days of you not being responsible for everything.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Seriously good uninterrupted sleep and not being in caregiver mode is essential.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,You need off time.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Even if it's only an hour a day.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,You need time to do literally whatever you want.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"Steal a kitten, rob a bank, watch paint dry, scream into the void, it doesn't matter what it is."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,No one should be asking you how you use that time to decompress.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,It is your time and you need it to be a functioning caregiver.Without any break you will be going further into the burnout which is going to hurt.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,You're going to make mistakes and it's hard to come back from a major mistake.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Likely it will be something not related to caregiving.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Like putting in the red with the white laundry.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Dropping a plate because you thought you put it on the shelf but you're so tired you couldn't tell the difference.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Worse driving while you're burnt out and you may literally not see the cars on side streets because you're so tired and stressed out.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I've done the double take and been unable to tell if it was my turn or they came up after I checked both ways.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,It's terrifying and at the same time hard to avoid when burnout hits you.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,You don't know how it is going to affect you exactly.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,At some point your brain will miss something that didn't seem important.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,You don't want to get to that point.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,It's not even your fault as you're doing your best with the resources you have.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I don't want to scare you but I do want to say I've been there.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I hope you take enough time for self care.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,You need to have time alone.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Even being in the same room watching TV is stressful because you're always in caregiving mode.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,You're always wondering if they need something.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"It is scary, and it's scary to hear about it, but necessary."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,You actually sound like my therapist!
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"But I think sometimes I need to be told things many times by many people, even strangers on the internet."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"I have trust and control issues, so I suck at asking for help."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I'm lucky to have people willing to help if I ask for it.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,My sister is seriously amazing and my best friend.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I can't fault her for not helping more if I don't tell her I need the help.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"And it's time I admit to her, and myself, that I really need help.Thank you."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"Sincerely, thank you."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Absolutely.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I have been told the same thing.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,It is hard to do but you'll get there!
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Also getting real sleep is totally worth it It is completely normal to feel the way you do.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I think most of us are or have been there.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"So even if I can't say anything that will truly help, I can guarantee you that your are not alone."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,It's okay to feel this way.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"Let yourself feel it, or else it could do your mind harm."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"If you can do therapy even only by phone, I recommend it."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Take care of yourself however you can.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"Hang in there, we are here for you Thank you."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I'm sincerely grateful to all the internet strangers giving me their support.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I wasn't sure how it would go or how it would make me feel.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,But so far I feel overwhelmed by the kindness and sincerity.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I hope to continue to turn to this community for support and advice.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Thanks again.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,That's tough.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Can you find an at-home caregiver service that could come part of the time to relieve you?
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"I know that can be pricey, though, and especially without long-term care insurance."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Hang in there!!
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Thanks!
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I think we can look into it.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"Even if it's not on a regular basis, any reprieve would probably help at this point."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,We're working on upgrading his insurance and getting him social security benefits to help pay for stuff like an at home nurse.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"We're not struggling financially just yet, but we're not at great place."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,Hopefully SS and his insurance will be able to help.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,[deleted] Gosh you're making me cry a little.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I'm glad you have some options to try and make your life easier while also giving your dad quality care.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,I spoke to my sister after making this post and fully realizing just how burnt out I am.
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"We cried, we hugged, and she's looking into all kinds of stuff for me, like respite care--where his insurance covers someone to come over for a day."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"She also is taking over Sunday mornings entirely so I can sleep in, and will take over right after work so I can try to nap/relax too."
I think I just need to know I'm not alone,"Hopefully I'll be able to let her help me too, because I'm sure at least in the beginning I'll still be worrying."

Leaving Dad at home,"Leaving Dad at home In the last month, my dad (early onset) has had neighbors call the police twice because he thought my mom had gone missing."
Leaving Dad at home,"My mom is his caregiver and has a routine for work that she adheres to very strictly to avoid this, but on the rare occasion she does something for herself (like going to dinner with friends tonight), my dad struggles and panics."
Leaving Dad at home,"He has issues with the phone (they just got a landline with pictures of family on the buttons) and even with Alexa reminders every hour of where my mom went tonight, he had the neighbors call the police."
Leaving Dad at home,Any advice or similar experiences?
Leaving Dad at home,"My mom is determined to avoid memory care and keep him at home, but if these instances continue I’m afraid she’ll isolate.Alzheimer's patients should never be left alone."
Leaving Dad at home,My dad was the worst about wondering off when we was just diagnosed and in early stages.
Leaving Dad at home,We never left him alone and I can't tell you the above of times we heard the door and had to go running to make sure he didn't leave the yard.
Leaving Dad at home,Maybe get a family member or hire an aide to give your mom breaks.
Leaving Dad at home,"Between my brother, husband and myself we've been able to work it out."
Leaving Dad at home,I tend to agree.
Leaving Dad at home,I dont know what stage of illness OP's dad is in but it sounds like he is at the stage that leaving him alone places him at risk.
Leaving Dad at home,"Dementia does not affect just memory - it affects judgement, reasoning, self-awareness, ability to sense danger, etc."
Leaving Dad at home,"It is also quite common for an early-onset dementia patient to have no ability to form memories of things said to them, but a modest ability to retain visual information."
Leaving Dad at home,"In my brothers case (early onset age 52), in the moderate stages of the disease we used visual cues, little photos of people with a brief note, scattered throughout the home, to make him aware of something (daughter is visiting, nurse XYZ is here to help today)."
Leaving Dad at home,But leaving an impaired person alone is risky.
Leaving Dad at home,Agree.
Leaving Dad at home,Think of it as leaving a toddler home alone.
Leaving Dad at home,You just dont do that.
Leaving Dad at home,"Rotate carers, arrange respite care, etc."
Leaving Dad at home,Similar experiences with my grandma.
Leaving Dad at home,She couldn’t be left alone- she accompanied my grandpa anytime he had to go out.
Leaving Dad at home,Once a week he’d go out with friends for a break and those days my mom would bring grandma to her house and keep her busy/occupied to give grandpa a break.
Instructions idea needed,Instructions idea needed dad has come to the point where he will think his phone runs the TV and sometimes that the remote is his phone.
Instructions idea needed,I can really tape or attach anything to the devices themselves.
Instructions idea needed,Only idea I have is to take a pic of each and make a how-to poster of what it is and how to use it.
Instructions idea needed,I can make signs and such but he will forget to look.
Instructions idea needed,"I need to do it anyway, even if it just helps a bit."
Instructions idea needed,All he does with a phone is make and get calls.
Instructions idea needed,The remote is harder because he has Hulu and Youtube and prime.
Instructions idea needed,Although the remote is simple to use he would navigate the apps differently.
Instructions idea needed,Anyone faced this and found something to work?
Instructions idea needed,he hasnt watched TV all day.
Instructions idea needed,Right now he's just vegging in front of an off TV.
Instructions idea needed,No idea if hes just vegging or he forgot how to turn it on.
Instructions idea needed,Will drop in in a few and get it going.thanksDoes he consistently use all three of those apps?
Instructions idea needed,"if not Id consider getting the ""flipper"" or other dementia-friendly remote-- they are much larger than other remotes and only have a few buttons."
Instructions idea needed,"There are some remotes that have pictures of  the app names (nexflix, hulu, prime are on mine) but you might have better luck just switching over to a basic cable that's always on and getting a simple remote."
Instructions idea needed,Our cable company had a senior-friendly remote included when we switched.
Instructions idea needed,"Now we rarely have problems, though she does sometimes point the remote the wrong way (a red arrow taped to the control may be a good solution if that becomes an issue)As far as the phone, I found a flip phone is much less likely to be confused for a remote (or sat down and lost because it just looks like a shiny black box)."
Instructions idea needed,"In lieu of that, you may get a clunky case on which you can put a label ""PHONE"" right at the top."
Instructions idea needed,"It might not solve the problem, but it may help."
Instructions idea needed,Thank you   he had a flip phone but he said it was difficult to open in time.
Instructions idea needed,"Tbh he never gets real calls, just spam."
Instructions idea needed,But in case one of his friends calls...He now has an adroid and all he has to do is press one button on the side.
Instructions idea needed,no lockscreen.
Instructions idea needed,he used to have basic cable but was more expensive.
Instructions idea needed,"he has a smart TV and Hulu, Prime and the Youtube app, along with the other lesser apps."
Instructions idea needed,"I know it doesnt matter that its easy to use, all that matters is that its hard for him to remember and figure out."
Instructions idea needed,Its been getting worse so it seems that he is declining cognitively.
Instructions idea needed,What I considered is taking a pic of his devices and doing a poster and labeling one phone and one remote.
Instructions idea needed,I dont think it will help to write directions on how to get to the different channels.
Instructions idea needed,he would forget to look at it.
Instructions idea needed,part of his issue is he just clicks buttons without knowing where his thumb is at.
Instructions idea needed,So he just clicks but hes not clicking on the right button.
Instructions idea needed,If I can just get him to understand which is the remote and to look what he clicks on I think thats half the battle.
Instructions idea needed,There is a voice search on Youtube but it isnt very good and he doesnt speak clearly.
Instructions idea needed,"I just labeled the back of his phone and the lower half of the remote, will see what that does."
Instructions idea needed,Need to add an arrow.
Instructions idea needed,If I could get one with a button to get each app then maybe.
Instructions idea needed,he likes to search around all of em.
Instructions idea needed,Thank you I labeled the remotes and phone last night and he was watching TV when i got up.
Instructions idea needed,Now if he can keep understanding the menus we're in business.
Instructions idea needed,I think a big part of this is he has good and bad days.
Instructions idea needed,bad days are going to be a challenege no matter what.
Instructions idea needed,Lets hope for the best.
Instructions idea needed,"definitely, it comes and goes."
Instructions idea needed,do you live together?
Instructions idea needed,Or you have some monitoring abilities it sounds like?
Instructions idea needed,"If you have smart home stuff (like google home/chromecast devices) you may be able to set it up so you can turn the tv on yourself, remotely, if you see he is struggling."
Instructions idea needed,Yes I live with him.
Instructions idea needed,I usually will turn on TV when I make his brunch but its all him from that point.
Instructions idea needed,he is a browser as far as TV goes.
Instructions idea needed,he doesnt use the search function he just browses around til he finds something.
Instructions idea needed,Ive tried doing a favorites on each service but Youtube always signs him out and he doesnt understand what to do.
Instructions idea needed,Either that or he just doesnt want to try.
Instructions idea needed,"Sometimes and it appears he cant do something, he just does it."
Instructions idea needed,Like somehow he gets motivated lol.
Instructions idea needed,I generally check on him about once an hour and if I see he's on a weird place I go help.
Instructions idea needed,Weird thing is he is a magnet for every adult show on hulu/Youtube/Prime.
Instructions idea needed,Dont know how he does it lol.
Instructions idea needed,"hey, the man likes what he likes!"
Instructions idea needed,":DI've tried to keep my grandmother off news commentary stations that just upset her, and steer her toward Little House on the Prairie, I Dream of Jeannie, etc."
Instructions idea needed,"Nope, every time I check she's somehow found Fox & Friends."
Instructions idea needed,Oh well.

Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,She doesn't have a smart phone but does have wifi.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I would need something that I could look at the stats when I'm not there.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Any suggestions?Not what you are asking for, but possibly helpful - We set up lots of cameras and door alarms and motion detectors so we would know if she went outside or fell."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,We also set up Alexa Dots in each room.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,We could drop in on her.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,We set reminders.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,We made signs telling her what to say.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,It all worked for a while.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Yes we have the alexa echo on two rooms, adding it to a third soon, just wanted her to get used to them."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"She's having a hard time remembering that she can get them to do things even with the signs, but she enjoys the old pictures and we can still drop in."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,What kind of cameras did you use?
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"We have the issue that she's in an apartment so it's hard to wire anything in, and there aren't a lot of plugs/she tends to unplug things of she doesn't know what it is."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Plus she would flip if she knew we had cameras.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,We used the Alexa to set reminders to drink and take her medicine.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I set reminders that said what the day a d date were.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I could use the Alexa and the cameras to help her fix her remote and hang up the phone.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,As needs changed we adapted.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,They gave her independence and us peace of mind for a good while.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Now I have playlists that run all night.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,It keeps her anxiety down.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,We have Wyze cams.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,They are inexpensive plug and plays.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,We told her they were alarms to keep anyone from getting in without us knowing.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,She didn’t really know they were cameras.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,They have little door alarms and motion detectors as well.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Occasionally she would unplug, but they soon became part of the background."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I live with her now.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I now have two cameras and bed alarms in her room.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I keep my phone open showing her all night.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"If she trips an alarm I can look over and see if she is getting up, or starting to fall if the bed or whatever."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Sometimes she is just turning over.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,It saves me from getting up more than needed.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Good luck.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Great info, thank you so much!"
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Just a warning about wyze cams.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I read they have a greater delay in motion  notification then many cams.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I cant remember the delay time but for me it was too long as I had to know right away when my dad got out of bed due to medical reasons.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,We use a bed alarm as well.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,It works when WiFi and electric is down.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,We try and have layers of protection.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Thanks, yeah we had looked into that too but he's all better on that medical issue fortunately."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,That was a killer as I barely slept during that time.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Hope you're not dying from the lack of sleep.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,The Samsung galaxy watch 3 can operate without a cell phone nearby if you get a data plan and the lte model.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Apple watch is another alternative though you need an iPhone to set it up.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Samsung watch can monitor sleeping habits and it can measure heart rate.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I'm not sure if it will send you an alert if the heart rate is irregular tho.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"It also has fall detection so if she falls, it'll notify  emergency services and you."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"She still needs to wear it tho.Theres also subscription emergency services which offer fall detection and if she pushes a button, a private company will speak with her and manage all emergency response."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"The issue here with my dadnisnthatnwithndementia, I don't think he'll remember to push the button.I videotape my dads great room to make sure he ate his breakfast completely and if he didn't, I push him to eat more later in the day."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,You can video and playback her sleeping if you want.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Do you have a suggestion for a camera?
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Been having a hard time finding one that would work.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,She has a life alert type thing and has fallen or had issues but WILL NOT press it.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,She always thinks she's fine or she can figure it out herself and doesn't want to bother anyone for help.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"I've heard about the fall detection in smart watches and it seems great, but I don't have an iPhone and we are trying to avoid another monthly fee, but I appreciate the suggestions!"
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I suggest not eufy cameras if you are using alexa.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I cant trigger routines with the cameras when they detect motion.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"I tried the blink mini too because I need routines but I had troubles getting the routines to work with those too even though they should have been seamless as they are amazon brand.I don't have a particular brand suggestion, but I do suggest you look for cameras that specifically can trigger routines if you think there might even be a slim chance you need routines triggered in the future."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Also, if you think allowing multiple users to have different levels and times of access is important, id make sure the camera can do that as well."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I want to higher a caregiver and give them camera access during certain hours of the day only.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,But blink minis don't allow for different users and eufy cams allow different users but don't allow restrictions based on time of day.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Although, I'm just getting an extra eufy came and then putting a smart plug in that turns the cam off during certain hours a day as a work around."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Miss cheaper than the more expensive cameras that can do all the stuff I want.Fyi, ou can get samsung smart watch 3 and not get a data plan if you wanted."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"I only suggested the data plan because if she left an area with wifi, then some of the watch functions wouldn't work but i think it should still work within wifi."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,That doesn't require an iPhone and you could just get the wifi version if you dont want a monthly fee.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Do a little research on the watch if you choose to buy tho cause I haven't actually gotten it yet.Just an FYI, The fee is just $10 a month typically  for data with most plans."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Though like i said, if you're in wifi you don't need it."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,$5 per month if you are on magenta or above plan on tmobile.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"But yeah, I'm debating getting the plan myself (will research more later) as I don't have a magenta plan."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I'm going to get the lte version tho just in case I change my mind.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Good to know, I will definitely look into the samsung smart watch."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Thank you!
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I forgot to discuss cameras so I edited my last comment just as an fyi.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I think what I can do is get a smart phone without a sim card and hook it up to the WiFi at her place.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Then I can have the app for whatever fitness tracker I get on the phone and it will be able to upload the data from the tracker to the phone and then the data will be accessible online through whatever app the tracker links to.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I'll have to do a little testing and some more research for which trackers upload to apps that are accessible remotely but I have some faith this will work I use my brain and a notebook.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,It's worked for several decades.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"That would work if someone was there all the time to check her heart rate, however there isn't."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,We've made sure her environment is safe for her and I'm just looking for something to give me peace of mind when I'm not there.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Well, why do you need (want) to keep track of it?"
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"I think it gets to a point where we impose this nonsense on ourselves and it isn't healthy.For example, my wife has dementia and she's going to die - maybe within the next year."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Is it necessary to know every blip and fart in real time?
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,It isn't going to change the outcome.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I'm very serious about that question as it takes a real effort to modify your thinking.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I think I've taken a fairly hand off approach.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"My aunt wishes to remain in her home, living alone, until she dies."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"That may not be the actuality of it, but I'm going to do what I can to make that happen."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,Knowing how much she's actually slept and what her heart rate is can help us guide her to get what she needs to feel better.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,She has blood pressure issues so being able to track it will let us know if bringing her to the doctor is necessary.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I'm assuming that your wife is probably getting more constant care/supervision than my aunt is.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"We are lucky enough to have technology that can help us monitor her, thus keeping her in her own home for as long as possible."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"While it seems that you don't have any actual help with my question, I did figure it out on my own, using my brain, as you had suggested earlier."
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"Well, are you trying to avoid the use of a smartphone completely, or just avoiding her having one?"
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,If the latter you could pair an iWatch with your phone for remote access.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,I would trust any of the Apple devices more than Windows.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,The issue with that is it won't give the data real time because it needs the phone there in order to access the data on the watch.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,So I would only be getting data from the time I wasn't there.
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone?,"The issue we wanted to avoid was another monthly fee for a cellphone she won't use, burI think I figured out a work around, I posted it below"
Best GPS tracker,"Best GPS tracker I'm looking around for a GPS tracker for my elderly mother who adimently insists she wants to stay in her own house regardless of what it means for her and her health, but at night goes wandering becuase she dosen't know where she is.I want her to still have her own independence and go out in her own garden, but any further I'd like to be notified on my phone, as she's wandered off for miles before.Which GPS trackers have people on here had experience with."
Best GPS tracker,"Preferably a one I can put my own SIM card intoHi /u/William444555, I'm sorry to hear about your mother."
Best GPS tracker,That's a really rough situation to be in.
Best GPS tracker,My grandmother suffered from dementia throughout her 90s (she made it to 96!)
Best GPS tracker,although thankfully she didn't tend to wander.
Best GPS tracker,That balance between independence and security is really tricky.I know a bit about these things as I work for a company which makes GPS trackers.
Best GPS tracker,Maybe I can contribute to the discussion.
Best GPS tracker,*Here's an overview of the different types of trackers on the market today.
Best GPS tracker,*Bluetooth trackers: There are lots out there but the best known are Tile and Samsung's Tag.
Best GPS tracker,They great for finding your keys when you've misplaced them at home.
Best GPS tracker,"Within a range of 30 or so yards, they can be incredibly accurate."
Best GPS tracker,"As more and more people use them, you will also be able to locate your Tile/Tag remotely using data collected from passers-by."
Best GPS tracker,"Great for keys and small items you often misplace, not so great for vehicles or people."
Best GPS tracker,Real time GPS Trackers: There is a pretty wide range of trackers in this category and most are focused on vehicle tracking.
Best GPS tracker,"A large number of the cheaper options are the same 2 or 3 models rebranded and resold by different companies under different names.These trackers ether use 2G/3G (or rarely, 4G) networks to constantly update their location."
Best GPS tracker,For vehicles they can be hardwired in.
Best GPS tracker,"However, outside of use in a vehicle, because they are updating all the time, their battery life is very short (or they use a massive battery to compensate)."
Best GPS tracker,"These sort of trackers are great for keeping an eye on your fleet of delivery vehicles to know where they are at every second, or for tracking your bike route across town."
Best GPS tracker,"There are some wearable trackers (watches, etc.)"
Best GPS tracker,which are mostly marketed for use with children that function in a similar way.
Best GPS tracker,"Again, battery life is the limiting factor and they typically need to be charged every day."
Best GPS tracker,"Many companies selling this type of tracker are looking to make a profit off the monthly subscription, and not the sale of the hardware."
Best GPS tracker,In the U.S. these subscription costs can range anywhere from $15 - $30 per month.
Best GPS tracker,"If purchasing this type of tracker, be wary of the low upfront prices."
Best GPS tracker,GPS Alert Beacons:The most well known brand in this category is SPOT.
Best GPS tracker,These trackers are designed to work practically anywhere and are a great lifeline for hikers and outdoors enthusiasts.
Best GPS tracker,The're usually designed to only send out an alert if a button is pressed.
Best GPS tracker,They can also send prerecorded messages.
Best GPS tracker,"Great for outdoor sports, not great for elderly parents who will forget to press the SOS button."
Best GPS tracker,"Expensive, but worth their weight in gold if you're hiking solo."
Best GPS tracker,"GPS Trackers with motion sensing and regular interval position updatesThis last category use the same 2G/3G/4G networks as the real time trackers, but either only activate when they sense motion, or send regular less frequent updates about their position."
Best GPS tracker,"These trackers are great for theft prevention and recovery, as well as tracking people."
Best GPS tracker,"You won't get the picture perfect map of every step your mother's taken throughout her day, but you'll get a ping every few minutes."
Best GPS tracker,The biggest advantage here is that battery life can be extremely good.
Best GPS tracker,"There are a handful of companies out there which make trackers like this, (disclaimer: my own included) and some are the right size/shape to be tied into clothing, slipped into a pocket or handbag."
Best GPS tracker,I think this is the category where you should be looking.
Best GPS tracker,"Are you based in the U.S. or U.K.?Some of our customers are definitely using our trackers to keep an eye on their elderly parents/grandparents and, from what we've seen, they're working well."
Best GPS tracker,"We didn't design specifically for this use, but I'm glad our products are helping families like this."
Best GPS tracker,"As I don't know this subreddit's rules, I'm going to avoid linking to anywhere, but feel free to DM me or google my company."
Best GPS tracker,Matt from Invoxia I came here to ask this.
Best GPS tracker,I want to help my step father.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,Tech recommendations for assisted living My grandmother is in an assisted living facility.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,I couldn’t say what stage of dementia she’s at but it has been ongoing struggling for family to communicate with her due to COVID.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,We aren’t allowed inside and it’s very hard to get the staff to make sure her phone is plugged in and on the hook.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,She has an echo show but sometimes unplugs it or turns off the camera/mic when trying to move it.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,"Her corded phone is the only other way to talk to her aside from shouting through the window, and she frequently forgets to put the phone back on the receiver."
Tech recommendations for assisted living,"Are there electronics like phones or other devices specifically designed for people with dementia or Alzheimer’s?I’m in Texas, we have a essential caregiver plan in place that allows me access to my father."
Tech recommendations for assisted living,I can even touch him.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,Please contact “Mary” with Texas Caregivers for Compromise on Facebook.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,Our group petitioned state government and gained the right for visits.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,Mary can guide you snd there is a wealth of information compiled by the group.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,"I wish I could suggest electronics  ,as my dad tinkers with clocks and phones ."
Tech recommendations for assisted living,I have the same problem.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,My mom does the same thing.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,She can’t use a cell phone and doesn’t remember to put the phone back on the cradle.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,Also can’t use a computer.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,Wish I had an answer but I don’t.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,Best wishes to you Set up a fire cube to her tv with a web camera mounted on top without her knowing and put either a Logitech harmony hub or broadlink rm mini 3 or 4 cant remember which number so that you can change the channel.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,"I haven't used the Logitech hub but in theory you should be able to say on your own phone, drop in grandma and everything will pull together for you to skype your grandma if you set it up to work that way."
Tech recommendations for assisted living,The rm mini is way cheaper and can let you control her tv too however alexa integration while there isn't as good.The fire cube can be hidden away so she won't touch it with just a tiny ir sensor sticking out which she can't see easily.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,"It needs to be plugged in but if you put the tv stand against where the outlet is, maybe she won't be able to touch it since heavy movement of the stand is required.I haven't tried this combo myself but the firecube is supposed to be able to allow drop in calls with skype."
Tech recommendations for assisted living,I do have the broadlink mini and it works great but I wish I had a harmony instead of being cheap now for the better alexa integration.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,"I actually hook up a desktop pc so I can do way more things than skype with my dad but that takes effort so not for everyone.Or just move the echo to the tv stand that blocks the outlet?Note, some assist ed living don't allow cameras but you'd be using a Webcam so maybe that would be alliwed."
Tech recommendations for assisted living,It's what an echo show has too really.Esit:  the harmony hub/broadlink mini is used so you can switch the tv on and to the correct hdmi.
Tech recommendations for assisted living,The firecube might be able to do this for you by itself but for some reason it doesn't work right for me and it won't switch back to the antenna inp u t after you turn it off.
Device around neck to alert of falls,Device around neck to alert of falls My mom is recently widowed and is nearly 80.
Device around neck to alert of falls,She wants to continue living alone where she is now but has asked me to research the devices that are worn around your neck and will alert others if a fall or accident.
Device around neck to alert of falls,Any suggestions or types or service plans to consider?
Device around neck to alert of falls,Thanks.I have https://www.bayalarmmedical.com/ for my dad.
Device around neck to alert of falls,Luckily he hasn't needed to use it.
Device around neck to alert of falls,The fall alert feature on it's own from what I was told by a few people is not worth it unless the family member falls all the time or has epilepsy or something like that.I do think LifeAlert is better becasue of faster response time.
Device around neck to alert of falls,He used to have that but cancelled his plan when he went to Assisted living for some time but they doubled their price so it's real expensive.
Device around neck to alert of falls,The cheapest might be to get a Wyze camera.
Device around neck to alert of falls,"Ask her not if she minds being spied on but if she would like a security camera, “for the living room”."
Device around neck to alert of falls,"$25 for the camera, plus any internet connection, no month to month fees."
Device around neck to alert of falls,With sound enabled a yell from anywhere in a small house should be audible by the camera.
Device around neck to alert of falls,You can even tell her for privacy reasons that you’re leaving the audio off unless you don’t hear from her for a few hours.
Device around neck to alert of falls,or if she’s really into privacy you could put it by the front door and just use it as a security camera but still have the audio enabled in case she needs to yell for help.
Device around neck to alert of falls,Just a thought.
Device around neck to alert of falls,"Only you and someone with an administrator password can login and view the video, it’s reasonably private, but of course do your own research."
Device around neck to alert of falls,Good luck.
Device around neck to alert of falls,"Wouldn't somebody have to be monitoring that, though?"
Device around neck to alert of falls,"I would feel terrible if we had a camera like that, and Grandma fell, but I was out all day running errands or something and missed it until I got back."
Device around neck to alert of falls,"Oh yeah, for sure, but I find it at least as likely that a fall would incapacitate such a woman to a degree she couldn’t push a button, even one around her neck, in which case monitoring would be the way to go."
Device around neck to alert of falls,"I think with all these things you have to weigh the pros and cons, and it definitely might not be for you."
Device around neck to alert of falls,That said there are motion detectors and if you know your mom regularly goes in and out of an area and that motion detector isn’t set off then you would get notified or not that she was moving.. there are also audible alerts.
Device around neck to alert of falls,Good luck.
Device around neck to alert of falls,"Yeah, I agree."
Device around neck to alert of falls,"Plus, a LifeAlert doesn't help if somebody has a stroke, as my aunt did."
Device around neck to alert of falls,Yeah this seems like a terrible idea.
Device around neck to alert of falls,My MIL has a Lifeline.
Device around neck to alert of falls,Touchy little bugger but at least we know it works.
Device around neck to alert of falls,It is less than $100 a month.
Device around neck to alert of falls,"She had a hard time wearing it in the beginning, but now she wears it all the time."
Device around neck to alert of falls,Insurance covered one for my Dad.
Device around neck to alert of falls,I am a retired paramedic.
Device around neck to alert of falls,We responded all the time to calls from life alert.
Device around neck to alert of falls,They stayed on the box with the person until we arrived and then would ask us to reset the box when we were with the person.
Device around neck to alert of falls,I am now at the age that I am looking for one for me.
Device around neck to alert of falls,I am still active so I need one with GPS.
Device around neck to alert of falls,"Don't have an answer for what is best, but I will say I have had lots of first-hand knowledge with life alert."
Device around neck to alert of falls,She may be more comfortable with a watch.
Device around neck to alert of falls,My dad had the necklace (inside) and the watch (outside).
Device around neck to alert of falls,I looked at a bunch of these for my mom.
Device around neck to alert of falls,I went with Great Call mobility device.
Device around neck to alert of falls,It can be used outside the house.
Device around neck to alert of falls,It's Verizon service.
Device around neck to alert of falls,"If it's lost or broken, it's the cost of the device (under 100) and sign back up for the service."
Device around neck to alert of falls,Some companies don't tell you it could be hundreds of dollars to replace the device.
Device around neck to alert of falls,It's easy to charge by laying it inside a charging untit.
Device around neck to alert of falls,You can set it up on the computer with lots of details.
Device around neck to alert of falls,I put a lockbox on the front gate with the hopse key in it.
Device around neck to alert of falls,The service has the pin number for it and instructrions about the dog.
Device around neck to alert of falls,We've stationed Ring cameras around my mom's place.
Device around neck to alert of falls,They have motion sensors and we can look in on her from anywhere.
Device around neck to alert of falls,Mom did not want to wear one of those devices.
Device around neck to alert of falls,She had one previously and didn't like it.
Device around neck to alert of falls,Mom also has an emergency cell phone like this:  https://www.wish.com/product/5cc8074dc36c9137ef09ece4?hide_login_modal=true&from_ad=goog_shopping&_display_country_code=CA&_force_currency_code=CAD&pid=googleadwords_int&c=6493229759&ad_cid=5cc8074dc36c9137ef09ece4&ad_cc=CA&ad_lang=EN&ad_curr=CAD&ad_price=34.00&campaign_id=6493229759&exclude_install=true&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6t6ABhDMARIsAONIYywJWTHkSUSXnICII9l9yAkX8d8HFZ9vxVcGkniGVeY8AnAFAB9r7rMaArYfEALw_wcB&share=webShe does wear that on a lanyard Apple Watch has this feature.
Device around neck to alert of falls,"Just FYI, my mother-in-law bought an Apple Watch just for this feature."
Device around neck to alert of falls,"It went off when she was making her bed, but then a couple of months later, she fell and broke her leg when she was outside with her dogs and it didn't go off."
Device around neck to alert of falls,She had to yell to her practically deaf husband to come get her.
Device around neck to alert of falls,It took a while.
Device around neck to alert of falls,She doesn't trust it now anymore.
Device around neck to alert of falls,"There are other smartwatches out there that have an SOS call function built-in, alongside fall detection."
Device around neck to alert of falls,I've not used any but have been researching it myself and seen a few interesting options out there.
Device around neck to alert of falls,"So maybe worth still looking down this route, OP."
Device around neck to alert of falls,MIL used the Phillips alert service for many years before she passed.
Device around neck to alert of falls,It worked very well in her rural area and was a reasonably priced monthly subscription.
Device around neck to alert of falls,But she had to remember to  put the necklace on every day.
Device around neck to alert of falls,"In this months issue of Consumer Reports, that I read last night, they have reviewed and rated many of the health alert services, I'm at work so don't have the issue with me, but you may be able to see the report on line."
Remembering to take medication.,Remembering to take medication.
Remembering to take medication.,My dad has very recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
Remembering to take medication.,He is 63 and has never had any health issues before this so has never had to take regular medication.My mum passed away 6 years ago so he lives alone and unfortunately I live an hour away.He is struggling to remember to take medication.
Remembering to take medication.,Any solutions?We have a monthly pill box (I can't get home weekly so this is the best solution).
Remembering to take medication.,We have Amazon Alexa with an alarm going off at 10am and he knows this is to remind him but he still doesn't go and take them.He's now changed medication and has to take one pill morning and evening which is now an issue as he doesn't remember the evening one.He won't accept outside help yet as he's literally only been diagnosed for 3 months and has barely even told his friends yet.
Remembering to take medication.,Also are there any groups or places you go to chat about your situation?
Remembering to take medication.,I think I would like someone to chat to about it all as its happened all of a sudden and it's a lot to take in.Thanks for any replied and apologies for the long post.We bought a round medelert off Amazon.
Remembering to take medication.,It has a lock and moves to the next section.
Remembering to take medication.,"When it moves to the section, an alarm goes off (it's loud) and it continues to go off until the unit is picked up and turned over or for 30 min."

Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Caring for Father Post-Stroke Hi AllI am writing to ask for ideas/advice about my father's situation.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Apologies for the wall of text/mind dump.My father (67) lives in his own about 60 miles west of my city in a semi rural area.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"In 2019 he had a minor stroke and was hospitalised for a few weeks for rehab, then after about 6 weeks he returned to his house (my parents separated 4 years ago - so he is on his own).Ever since then we have noticed a progressive decline in his abilities and in his health in general."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Falls are my biggest concern - he has spells of vertigo and needs to catch ahold of something to stop from falling over.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,This wouldn't be so bad - except that he has had falls and struggles to right himself.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"Despite his doctor not signing for him to renew his license, he drives his car to run errands (going to the shop to buy staples).Last week he fell while trying to close the gate after driving in to his property."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,He apparently had to crawl back to the car to pull himself up.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"While that fall itself annoys me (he goes grocery shopping with an assistant once per week), I am more concerned about the fact he could kill someone while being stubborn."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Oh and I could go to visit him and find him dead in the driveway.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"Of course, he ""forgets"" to wear the fall alarm that my mother had arranged for him.His nearest neighbour is 100 yards away and they too are elderly."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,I feel that he unfairly relies on them to help him out with basic stuff - for example he pays the neighbor $100 per week to clean his house.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"He is incapable/doesn't care about mowing the grass or tending to the gardens.Speaking of cleaning - left to his own devices, the man is a ""filth wizard""."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"When I arrive I never know how high the pile of unwashed dishes will be, how much spoiled food will be in the fridge, or if his bed will be covered in food stains.Yes, he eats in his bed."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"He will chew his way through a packet of biscuits, or a family sized block of chocolate."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,He might make the occasional sandwich (ham and cheese).
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"Sometimes he will use his air dryer to cook chips (fries) - the nutritional content of his diet is non-existent.In addition to the copious pills prescribed by his doctors (arranged in Webster packs), he also will drink Coke rather than water - which does not mix with his Type II diabetes.During the day, he spends his time sleeping in the air conditioning, and at night he is on his phone reading articles about the US election (he's an ardent Trump supporter, despite living on the other side of the world)."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"He also has his DVD collection, where he will watch movies in the ""lounge room"" or on the portable disc player in his bedroom.His back is constantly sore - hence is spends so much time in bed."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Due to talks he has a sore knee.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"His muscle tone is terrible because despite being told to exercise by the therapist (who he told to get out of his house), he has done nothing to help himself.A lasting side effect of the stroke is that he has trouble swallowing."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,He might drink a sip of coffee but be unable to swallow - so he will gag and gasp for air (and not in a good way).
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,This in turn has him afraid to drink water - at one stage my sister admitted him to hospital for dehydration.A recent symptom is urinary incontinence.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,My sister arranged some adult diapers for him - but he has given up on these.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"When he did have them, he would not take them to the outdoor trash."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"To do this involves a 250m walk down his driveway - or a drive as he would likely do, so they would pile up at his bedside.His toilets are diabolical."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,I'm not sure how anyone can take a crap at that angle - yet the place is disgusting.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,He does not do his own washing.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"He will wear all clothes until there is nothing left - then either his neighbor will wash some clothes or we will do it when we visit.He is of the opinion that ""it will get better"" (through wishful thinking apparently)."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,He is not actively seeking to improve his life - much to our families annoyance.I visited his doctor with him and noted that he would ask about his knee; but I believe he is too embarrassed to mention the incontinence.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,I personally think he should be checked out for Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (I have the high pressure version myself) - but it is extremely difficult for me to drive 2 hrs each way to go to these appointments.I feel that I have no choice but to take a more active role in his life.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"My logic goes that if he was NOT living on his own, and was in an assisted care facility (not a nursing home per se), that his quality of life would be better because he could get daily help to be more healthy.Today I bit the bullet and went to visit an assisted living (serviced apartment) to try to understand what options are available."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,I found a place that would give him a 1 bedroom apartment with ensuite - with 24 hour staff on site.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"Perhaps the most important thing for me is they have caterers on site - so while they might not serve the nicest food, it would likely be better prepared and better for him (especially given his diabetes)."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"It would mean relinquishing his car, but they have a courtesy bus which takes residents to/from the local shops."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,They even have a doctor who visits once per week and a pharmacy that delivers.I would certainly sleep better knowing that he is eating better and not on his own.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"That he isn't killing anyone on the road, or isn't lying in his back yard injured.Having said that, its his life."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,I can't force him to sell his 5 acres and downside to 500 sq ft!
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,I only want the best for him - but I know he will put up a fight.I was hoping to get an outside perspective (am I being unreasonable?)
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,How have you had the talk with your parents?Thanks for reading.You are absolutely being reasonable.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"Anyone who falls and cannot get back up, is incontinent, has trouble swallowing, isn’t able to cook or do his washing needs a full time aide or a appropriate facility."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,He hopes his health will improve but he’s not doing anything to make that happen.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,I also agree that getting him to agree is going to be difficult.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Does the Assisted Living Facility offer activities he would enjoy?
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"I would approach it from the social, food, fun side."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Take a virtual tour (or live if you don’t have COVID restrictions.)
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Let him see how nice and clean the rooms are.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Ask for sample menus to share with him.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Tell him you’d feel so much better if you knew he was having fun and eating well.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Maybe suggest he try it for a month and he can go home if it doesn’t work for him.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Good luck!
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Thanks.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,I came up with a plan to show him both places I visited yesterday in a very specific order.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"First show him the depressing OAC home, followed by the serviced apartment - he'll freak at the first but should be more relaxed at the second (my preferred option)."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,His situation sounds miserable.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Is it possible he's also suffering from depression?
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"And the incontinence, is it that he can't tell he's going, or he just can't get out of bed fast enough to get to the toilet?"
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"A urinal jar by the bed might be a solution if it's the second, then he could empty it when he had to get up for something else.My FIL was one of those old guys who just don't bother to take care of themselves or the house after the wife is gone."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"The solution he found was having a roommate, a younger lady who stayed in his house and cooked and cleaned instead of paying rent."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"She wasn't there around the clock, she still worked and spent time with her kids and grandkids."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,But it was good knowing someone was there sometimes.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,">The solution he found was having a roommate, a younger lady who stayed in his house and cooked and cleaned instead of paying rent.This is a great solution."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,In America (I can tell OP is not in America) there is an app called Nesterly that matches students with older people for no or low rent.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,For the water issue- my mother also had a stroke and has swallowing issues.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"There is a drink thickener you can add that is made specifically for this purpose, there are different levels of thickness depending on the severity of his issue."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Thanks - I think he had these after the stroke in the hospital.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Just need to make it easier to drink his than take a swig of Coke.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"First, you're not being unreasonable."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Would he even accept home healthcare to come in and assist him?
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"If he accepted help you could contact the Area Agency on Aging to find out how to apply for services like home health aid, physical therapy, wheels on meals, etc."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"Has he been assessed for his cognitive abilities or his mental health?If he doesn't accept help, and you're worried about his safety you can contact Adult Protective Services to come and do an assessment.I'm sorry that has to be so tough.edit:   I forgot to mention his driving."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Since he doesn't care if he has a valid driver's license I've read where many adult children resort to disabling the car.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Can you arrange for alternative transportation?
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Thanks.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"Where my parents chose to buy, a taxi or Uber will return him home - but won't do a pick up."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Short of a chauffeur service he is really stuck.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"It's not his life, sorry to tell you that, but either you assume the responsibility or they die in filth or kill someone (driving)."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"You need a patient care facility, DON'T tell them about the incontinence, or they will never admit him."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"Your father is a DANGER TO OTHER MOTORISTS and you may liable if he kills someone, the civil suit could bankrupt YOU."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Right now you need to do three things: 1) Get a durable power of attorney 2) liquidate your fathers assets 3) Admit him ASAP to a proper nursing facility and setup his social security and medicare so they are at least safe and direct deposited to the right place so if you become incapacitated his income isn't stolen.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"This will take about  3-4 months of your life if you work at it full time and start now, from my experience, but it will potentially keep your father alive with better quality of life."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,With your fathers liquidated assets set up a trust to cover his expenses.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"Go over the will if he has one at the same time.Also, be prepared to have your father throw every nasty thing at the book at you to get you to stop."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"You will do everything short of Tasing them to get them to comply, it can be hard, but they won't even know it happened in a year."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Wishing you the best of luck.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,What I see from your post is that he is not doing very well in terms of his mental space after losing his partner that too seperation and then living an alone life after retirement.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,My dad also became very stubborn after retirement as it's like till 1 day the person is capable of handling himself and next day post retirement he has nothing to do.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,It's just very difficult for many people to transition from one state to another and that's where the ego brings in stubbornness.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"I don't know how things work in your country but if I were you, I would rather ask him to shift near to his best friend or family (relatively younger and havinb time on their hands kind of family\friend) and work with him to get the best days of his life."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Yes.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Focusing on making the best of his time is the angle I'm going to take.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"An assisted living facility is not the place for him, for if he were able to get admitted, he would not stay long because they do not have the round-the-clock staff."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"He needs skilled nursing care, period."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Assisted living sounds like a great option.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Not sure where you are and how it will be paid for.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,If private funds its expensive but easy.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,If Medicaid/state funds you have less choices.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"Also, Medicaid/state funded means they take assets, something else to look into."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,"My mom was in a state funded/Medicaid assisted living and she loved it, she actually had more socialization with the people living there and less stress."
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,I had peace of mind.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Thank you everyone for your thoughts.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,We live in Australia - so we're relatively fortunate to have subsidised medical care.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,We WILL need to sell his house to buy in to the facility.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,So this is a one way street for him.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,It's time.
Caring for Father Post-Stroke,Wish me luck.
GPS tracker recommendations,"GPS tracker recommendations Hi all.My father-in-law has been diagnosed, it’s not too bad yet, but it’s progressing."
GPS tracker recommendations,My mother-in-law has tasked me with finding a GPS tag type of thing just in case he goes for a wander.
GPS tracker recommendations,I’m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for a service or product that could work.
GPS tracker recommendations,"Ideally, it’d be something with multiple tags, like it’d work on his phone and on some sort of pendant/keychain?"
GPS tracker recommendations,"It also has to be fairly easy to use, she’s not great with tech or English and they're in Hawaii and we're in the mainland US so I can't help with the setup.I’ve done some looking but there are so damned many things and services that just look like scams or a way to separate desperate people from their money I’m at a loss.And just randomly anything else we can get or set up to help them?Any help would be appreciated.They have them for dogs, but I have not found them for people yet."
GPS tracker recommendations,"My brother in law makes GPS trackers for wild animals, maybe he could hook you up."
GPS tracker recommendations,"Contact your areas Alzheimers .org or dementia .org, they know all the great info & resources & tips."
GPS tracker recommendations,"Often have 24/7 helplines, although I'm in Australia so I don't know about your place."
GPS tracker recommendations,Best of luck!
GPS tracker recommendations,My mom kept throwing away the wristband GPS and cellphone plan we got through Bayside.
GPS tracker recommendations,"She always wore a watch, so we thought she'd adjust, but she hated it and refused to wear it ."
GPS tracker recommendations,"It made it really hard as we couldn't find it and are pretty sure it went into the curbside bin, and returning it with that missing wristband was costly."
GPS tracker recommendations,"I think if we had to do it again, I'd just get Tile trackers and sew them into her shoes, pants, and jacket."
GPS tracker recommendations,Does she reliably carry a phone?
GPS tracker recommendations,"I was looking into Tile for the same thing a little while ago and they track location based on the phones location, so they just give the last location it was able to sync with the phone."
GPS tracker recommendations,Unless they have new products now?
GPS tracker recommendations,My dad was never able to get the hang of smart phones and now he won't take his normal phone with him even most of the time so the Tile didn't work out.
GPS tracker recommendations,I've struggled to find something that he'll keep on him.
GPS tracker recommendations,"No, but what Tile support suggested is that we could install the app on our phone and see last known location."
GPS tracker recommendations,"In the end, we didn't bother."
GPS tracker recommendations,She became paranoid that a neighbor was trying to kill her and didn't want to be in her house.
GPS tracker recommendations,We moved her into assisted living and quickly that changed to a lockdown Alzheimer's community as she escaped too many times.
GPS tracker recommendations,When I was looking these up I was told by a couple of professionals that these give a false sense of safety.
GPS tracker recommendations,My dad liked to walked off so we put bells on the door so we would know if he opened a door.
GPS tracker recommendations,We also did preventative measures like put those basic slide locks at the base of the doors that we nudged open with our foot but dad never noticed them.But!
GPS tracker recommendations,For backup I heard placing the tracker in or on the shoe is the best.
GPS tracker recommendations,Alzheimer's patients rarely forget to put on their shoes.
GPS tracker recommendations,"We have a special watch which notifies of a fall and you can track GPS for my dad.I think ours was called smartie watch Hey there werent good gps trackers when i had dementia people in my family, but from what it looks now, if your step mom is not tech or english savvy (my mom also isnt) it may end up that you or someone else actually has to do the tracking if need be."
GPS tracker recommendations,You may also consider suggesting she  sew personal info tags into his clothes.
GPS tracker recommendations,My dad took off/broke anything extra on him and lost his shoes when he went off wandering.
GPS tracker recommendations,Edit: in the off chance hes used to carrying a smart phone on him all the time you could turn on the google maps gps feature in the phone.
GPS tracker recommendations,Then multiple ppl can see where he is.
GPS tracker recommendations,"Also, am from hawaii, so i will share this additional info with you in case you find it useful: Alz assoc.https://www.alz.org/hawaii - free support groups, education, also trying to pass legislation to create more support for Alzheimer's ppl, such as requiring dementia sensitive training to people like first responders, in situations where folks wander off.Actually id call them and ask for recommendations or see if you could join one or all the support groups (all online in covid times) to ask for recommendations."
GPS tracker recommendations,"This is because theres a chance that services that work in places elsewhere dont work as well in hawaii, especially if they live in a rural area."
GPS tracker recommendations,You might luck out and find someone that knows her area and knows of something that will def work.
GPS tracker recommendations,Gov help.
GPS tracker recommendations,https://health.hawaii.gov/eoa/https://www.hawaiiadrc.org/site/459/hadssp.aspxAlso check out offices on aging by county.
GPS tracker recommendations,"Available help varies by county.. Stuff like free adult daycare 1 or 2 days a week, or assistance one day a week for example but its different by county."
GPS tracker recommendations,This is an example for honolulu county: https://www.elderlyaffairs.com/Legal help:https://www.hawaii.edu/uhelp/publications.htmhttps://www.hawaii.edu/uhelp/handbook.htmSenior information anf assistance handbook for hawaii: https://www.elderlyaffairs.com/site/449/publications.aspxLists services including nonprofit and volunteer orgs.
GPS tracker recommendations,Im no pro but if you have any questions for dementia in hawaii feel free to ask.
GPS tracker recommendations,"Hey u/SlipperedHermit, I'm sorry to hear about your father-in-law."
GPS tracker recommendations,While I'm late to the discussion but maybe I can help.
GPS tracker recommendations,I work for a company which makes these sort of trackers.
GPS tracker recommendations,"GPS tracking is definitely not a perfect solution, but it can be helpful as things progress."
GPS tracker recommendations,The one we make in the US might be a good fit for your family.
GPS tracker recommendations,"The app is pretty straightforward and you can set up geofencing alerts (so if he wanders off, your mother-in-law will know)I shared this already on another thread but I thought it fit here too."
GPS tracker recommendations,A few weeks back a customer sent us this story about finding her mom.
GPS tracker recommendations,Don't hesitate to reach out in DM if you've got any questions.
GPS tracker recommendations,"""It was an incredibly stressful day!"
GPS tracker recommendations,My parents are very independent people.
GPS tracker recommendations,Our (my sisters and I) original intent in purchasing the gps device was for peace of mind for us.
GPS tracker recommendations,My sisters and I all live outside of our home state.
GPS tracker recommendations,We wanted to make sure my mom never became lost when driving.
GPS tracker recommendations,She is becoming a bit more forgetful than we are comfortable with and is not a cellphone user.
GPS tracker recommendations,We placed the GPS in the glove compartment of my parent's car.
GPS tracker recommendations,My older sister linked it to her phone.
GPS tracker recommendations,"One day, my mom had been gone most of the morning."
GPS tracker recommendations,"My sister, out of state, looked on the GPS app and saw that she was not just far from home, but heading towards the neighboring state!"
GPS tracker recommendations,"My sisters, father and I did a group FT and decided we needed to call state troopers to locate and stop the car."
GPS tracker recommendations,With the help of your device my sister was able to give the troopers specific enough information that the vehicle was found within a half hour!
GPS tracker recommendations,And this is with the car driving on a freeway!
GPS tracker recommendations,The trooper called and let us know when he found her and was safe.
GPS tracker recommendations,"My father rented a car to pick her up and the first thing she said was """" How did you find me""""?"
GPS tracker recommendations,"She was absolutely stunned, surprised and grateful we found her."
GPS tracker recommendations,We hate to even think how our story would have ended had we not purchased your GPS.
GPS tracker recommendations,Happy endings indeed!
GPS tracker recommendations,It really worked perfectly!
GPS tracker recommendations,"Seriously, we have been singing the praises of your company ever since."
GPS tracker recommendations,We give it an 11/10.
GPS tracker recommendations,🙏😃”-Matt from Invoxia

(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Since she can't go to the gym anymore (and refuses ""home exercise""), she's gotten shakier on her feet, and in November she fell flat on her face."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Then explosive (and I mean, like, horrific) diarrhea in mid-December, and now despite our best efforts, a UTI, which has ramped up the confusion several notches."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Sundowning has gotten more and more of a problem for us as time passes.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"I've lived here for uh, almost 3 years, and it started gradually but now she gets anxious in the evenings/as it gets dark because she feels like she's forgetting something (yes, everything) or that she's supposed to go somewhere."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"We tried various calendar systems, but if she knows something is planned for the day, she will panic as she remembers something is happening but not what, and that panic will just follow her all day."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"(even if the event is detailed on the board, she will forget it / panic about it / forget the board is there and just continue to feed the anxiety loop.)"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"So we ended up with a whiteboard with a permanent little message that we update daily:  > Today is [month]/[day]> [weekday]> Nothing is happening today!> Love, [Grandson's Name]  And we moved a clock that shows the day/date in addition to the time to be directly beside this little board (so she doesn't get up to make sure the information on the board means today, because it can't mean today because isn't something happening today?)."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"When we had messages like ""Haircut at 3:30"" she would start getting ready every time she saw the message, no matter what time it was--getting dressed to go out, looking for her purse and checkbook, and sometimes just walking out the door to find her own way there."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Or ""Dinner with [Relative],"" she'd see that and wonder what I'm going to be doing about dinner if she's going out to supper, so she'll seek me out every thirty seconds to make sure that I know I have full run of the kitchen and liquor cabinet."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"It's really sweet of her, and it's become something of a ritual, where she insists that I help myself to everything, anything in the house, and I say, ""Yes Grandma, when you come home, we will have eaten everything!"""
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,And she laughs and goes along with whoever has come to pick her up.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,We have an Echo Show sitting on the dining room table.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Usually it's good for watching the news or something on YouTube.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"My grandmother tries to read the suggestions, but she never triggers Alexa."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,She says Alex or skips the name.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,She will ask me what story was just quickly displayed and is gone before I can look.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,She hasn't touched any of the buttons yet that I know of.BTW I loved watching Perry Mason and made it thru the available episodes before CBS All Access ended for me.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,[deleted] It's possible.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"She has five children--her grandchild and their spouse are her primary caregivers, but I moved in when it got to be too much for two people."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"I've known the family for more than a decadeShe never learned my name, but she remembers that I'm a friend."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"[deleted] Yeah, I believe it."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"And I do tend to respond to jokes literally on the internet, even with little smileys to suggest that it's not really a literal comment."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Because ...
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I'm just ... like that.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,+1 for the unplugging thing.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"My dad would call me every day to say the TV was broken, when actually he'd unplugged it and the Sky box and couldn't get it back on the right channel."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I lived over 100 miles away.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"I had to try to explain the remote control over the phone to his carers From this morning: if you must shit all over your hand because you insist poop isn’t normal and you had to stick your hand down there to investigate what was coming out of you, and you happen to actually remember to try to wash your hands (instead of coming up to me and waving your poop covered hands in my face like usual) can you PLEASE not turn the water in faucet on full blast and literally spray every inch of the bathroom with poop splatter that I have to clean up at 7 am, after the approximately 5 hours sleep you let me get?"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"That’d be great, thanks."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"We almost retired from the ""family caregiving business"" last month because Grandma had explosive diarrhea in the night and left a trail of poo prints down the hall."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,The mop will never be the same again.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Well probably not.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"We'll never know for sure, we got rid of it."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I have certain “lines in the sand” and what you just described is one of them.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I appreciate you.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I opened up the newspaper today and the huge front page picture was of my dad getting a haircut at the barber!
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,His caregiver took him but forgot to tell me.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,So much for social distancing.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Not using her walker, rolling walker or cane."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Insisting she doesn't need any of them, even though she's very unsteady on her feet and has had too many falls lately.Stubbornly refusing help when clearly she needs help at times with walking, standing, dressing, getting lost in the house, turning the volume/speakerphone on her cell phone so she can hear the caller.Not wanting to go to bed because she isn't home, but she will go through drawers and mail of this house that she thinks isn't hers.Trying to feed everything to the cats irregardless if it's something they would or should eat."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"My mom fed most of her meals to the cats and dog, or tried, but they weren't in on the plans and didn't always clean everything up, so she'd get caught and say she accidentally dropped it."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,We actually started putting all critters out of the room until she was done eating because of this and the fact that her border collie weighed around 75 pounds and could barely waddle.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,> Trying to feed everything to the cats irregardless if it's something they would or should eat.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,My cat was diagnosed with diabetes about a year after I moved in with 'Grandma.'
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"He never got terribly obese, he just had that bit of a pooch between his back legs, sort of like what female cats get after they've been spayed."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Welp, now he has to take insulin twice a day (and he hates it) and we set out a bowl of ""Decoy Catfood"" to help prevent Grandma from fussing with his food."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,But he's a ravenous starveling monster and he's taken food out of her hands.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Asshole cat, always has been more of a dog."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,One time my mother left her soiled adult diaper right on top of a very visible trash can in the women's bathroom of a restaurant.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Thankfully my wife came in right after her and was completely horrified to discover this.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Completely baffled why she didn't at least put it INSIDE the trash can.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,So yea people with dementia do some WEIRD stuff.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Why must you have dozens of wads of toilet paper and paper towels stuffed into your nightstand?
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Why do you insist on opening the blinds for light, even when it’s dark outside, letting the neighbors look in on us?Why do you refuse to change out of your dirty clothes?"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Why do you blame us for everything you don’t understand?
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I know the answer is always dementia.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"We live with my husband’s grandmother (with dementia) and disabled and deaf aunt, and I have 20 month old and a 2 month old-so it’s a lot of people to care for!-my baby is a boy."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,He is dressed in very masculine clothes.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Please stop calling him “she”.-if my children are crying please just ignore all of us.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Don’t ask them why they’re sad, or tell me that they’re crying, I’m already stressed and trying to handle the situation in an emotionally healthy way and your comments are very unhelpful and very annoying.also, my children’s names are not extremely common, you just think it’s the most popular name because you hear it every day because we live here with you.speaking of such; we live here."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Yes we’re going to sleep here tonight, yes we have a bed, no we didn’t just come into town, we’ve lived with you for about 9 months now.-all of the doors are locked."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"I promise.-please stop saying “yes I know” when I tell you to do things like use hand sanitizer before taking your pills, you obviously don’t know because every time I don’t tell you you don’t do it.and lastly Jane (grandma’s disabled daughter who lives here as well, and not her real name) is totally fine."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I promise I feed her/ she’s totally capable of getting herself her own breakfast and lunch.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,If you don’t see her in the chair right next to you then she’s upstairs in her room- but you should probably check the chair literally right next to you first before you ask.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,My MIL thought my home is a hotel at the beach.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,We live in the middle of a forest.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,The house is surrounded by trees.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,She’d sit on the upstairs deck and comment on how nice it was to see the ships go by.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I had no idea what she was looking at - because it’s a FOREST.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"She also thought I worked at this hotel, and that she was married to my husband - her son."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"So, she pretty much always wanted to go home (“It’s been so nice, but we really need to get back”), and would spend hours every single evening trying to bully DH into driving her home (the location of which changed constantly), and getting angry with me for stealing her husband."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Hahaha whoa.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"This sounds like a fever dream... Just, completely surreal."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I'd eventually start questioning my own sanity!
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Like, who am I to argue?"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Maybe I am just the bell hop in the Arboreal ocean hotel, and I've stolen this poor sweet cougar's luggage so that she can check in any time she like...but she can never leave...?!"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Or maybe I need some damn rest... 😝 Wow!
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"I feel like my mom is almost ""normal""."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Thank you for being honest about your day to day lives.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I really appreciate this insight.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"I'd like to add: why must you be convinced that you're having a heart attack or something major, when upon close observation, you are fine?"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,But thank you for waking me up at 2 am in a fright.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Why must you be obsessed with picking up things on the floor, yet you have a nest of crap around you that you are extremely possessive of and I'm not allowed to touch?Why do you insist that you are ""fine"" and that ""you can take care of yourself"" but you haven't made a formal dinner in years, eat very late at night (if I don't provide dinner), only do laundry if I say something negative, (ie gripe and complain) and spend your days being in front of the TV, reading a book or doing your dot to dot books?Why must you mess with my head and go through moments of ""normalcy"" followed by long stretches of being blissfully unaware of everything going on?"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,At the same time?
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Why must you argue with me over anything?
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Mom, your stories and memories from the 40's through the 60's are repetitive."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Mom, I'm getting burned out being responsible for you."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"I don't have the mental bandwidth to make sure you have mental stimulation, take care of your schedule, your finances, your health and hygiene, plus raise two teens (same issues with them), manage a business would a full caseload of clients, and care for myself emotionally and physically."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Something's has got to give.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,dementia is inexorable.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Oh my gosh, so true."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Why does the counter and table have to be completely bare... does dementia turn them into minimalists?
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"I'm glad Christmas is over because my grandma would always refer to the Christmas decorations as ""too much junk"" lolSame with the used diapers."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Always hidden somewhere, but WHY!"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,?I didn't realize the unplugging thing was common with others too.We just got an Echo show and are trying to work it into use.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"So far, getting my relatives to figure out how to drop in on video call has been difficult.I solved that problem of her miscommunicating to relatives what she did that day by emailing a regular report every now and then and updating the google photo album of daily life pics."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,It was really frustrating she would tell people on the phone she hadn't eaten anything that day when she just had a full meal.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"And then because the phone volume needs to be turned all the way up, I'd hear ""What's (my name) doing over there?"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"She's supposed to be taking care of you!"""
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"If I picked up the phone to tell them the truth I'd get judged badly for ""eavesdropping"" ...ugh Haha 'WHY??'"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"was exactly the underlying sentiment which caused me to start this post, and in this sub."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Because I knew y'all would understand /sympathize, and bc this is a question /frustration that our dementia-afflicted loved ones are not bothered by, not even a bit...At least, not anymore."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,They are not bound by our fetters of reason and logic!
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,They're not restricted by our earthly 'trash bins' or 'lids' (shout-out to u/boethius70 hahaha)!
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"They're free and their minds are clear and empty as a summer sky, and so are their countertops!"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,- PLEASE FEED YOUR CAT.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I buy food for it.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,The bowl is always empty every time I visit.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,completely empty.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"I ask and get 'the cat has lots of food' yes but you don't give it to it.I don't want to take your cat but im going to have to take your cat.I do have a billion vents but that's one I think about at home Gosh, I have the opposite problem, mum keeps feeding the cat all day, and way too much."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Cat was going on a diet every 6 months cos she'd start getting obese.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"I hid the cat food, then she'd get her hat & search for money to go buy some."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"I have to keep the main cat food stash in my room, just dole out little bits every few days, and a few times a day take it out of cat food bowl & return to tupperware."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Great post, good idea, thanks!!"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Waking up at 11pm & mopping the kitchen floor - 3 times - with liquid handsoap.

(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Picking up & using the bib always right next to your plate, and tucking your bib in firmly, so as to not spill food on clothing at every meal."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Tucking the bib in the first time I remind you rather than NOT tucking it in the 5 times I remind you, thus it falls in your meal, then you drop bits on yourself, resulting in then we have to go do the whole ""change clothing"" tiresome rigmarole thing."

(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Although my gripes aren’t nearly as bad as most of the others, living with them 24 hours a day is stressful!"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Here’s some of mine:the buildings we are passing in the car have been there for 30 years or more.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,They are not new.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,You have lived in this community for 70 years.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Please stop commenting every single time we go out about all the new construction please stop reading aloud EVERY SINGLE SIGN, bumper sticker, license plate etc ."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Just shut up!
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Please!Please stop using rags to wipe your ass.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,We have toilet paper and wet wipes.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I’m sick of finding these rags that you rip out of towels in your bathroom.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Also, please stop throwing your wet diaper across the room."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,We have a diaper pail for that - sits right by the toilet.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"for now, my entire life revolves around taking care of you, your shitty house and your shitty yard (she lived with my dad for 8 years in an assisted living facility before he died so the house and yard feel into disrepair)."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"You being nasty to me, as well as extremely paranoid that I’m taking advantage of you, is going to send you to a facility sooner than later no."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,You can’t live alone.

(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,(She is 96).
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,And never a thank you.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,why do you hoard?
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Why keep dirty tissues?
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Why insist on keeping all junk mail from 1980?
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Why do you keep old boxes, wrappers, etc?"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Why keep all the other junk?
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,She can no longer go in her daylight basement.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,There were rooms in the basement that had so much junk you couldn’t walk through the room.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"Since she can’t go down there anymore due to the stairs, I’ve emptied 70% of the junk into 3 dumpsters."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Another lesson I’ve learned - I will NOT expect my kids to spend their lives going through my junk!!
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I will downsize dramatically before I get too old.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"(I’ve moved 2 times in the last year, so I’m well in my way to doing that)."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,So many more frustrations.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,These are today’s.

(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Do you have kids now?
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,How do they fit into the picture..?
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,My kids are grown and live 4-8 hours away.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,They are much more worried about me than her as I’m alone all day every day with her.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,One of my daughters and one of my sons (I have 4 kids) stayed with her for a week each last year and it was a disaster.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,Never again  - they don’t deserve that!
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I won’t go into details about what she did but it ruined their opinions of their grandmother.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,MIL has a thing for folding up paper napkins.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,In fact her fridge was full of totally rotten food wrapped up in napkins.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,She's in a memory care home now.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"We took her fridge , yeah I cleaned it lol."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,You know what I found in there last week......a bit of food that would probably never be eaten wrapped up in a paper tissue.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I threw it out immediately.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,My husband is behaving weirdly enough as is.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,I was CREEPED out.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,THE SCREAMING!!
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,the all night screaming!
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"As soon as she’s out down she immediately starts screaming bloody murder, I cannot imagine how this woman’s vocal chords aren’t permanently destroyed.Also the banging of the walker all night long, she’ll hold her arm outside the bed and bang it on the ground in her sleep ALL NIGHT LONG and if you take it from her she screams as loud as she can ear piercingly for as long as it takes for you to give back Aaahh!"
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"When I was caring for my mom this was probably my biggest gripe - my mom had a whistle that she wore around her neck to call for help, and she would use it ALL THE TIME, for the smallest request, with no discretion and no regard for the time of day."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"The only thing worse than the fact that this shrill noise would invade my brain non stop, was the fact that if my dad and I were both home, he would ALWAYS pretend not to hear, even though that is literally impossible."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"He knew that my tolerance for listening to her suffer was lower than his, and that I'd eventually cave in and go help her first."
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,My god this dynamic drove me insane.
(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES,"For a while I'd take pennies out of my change jar and hurl them down the hall at his bedroom door, so hard that I thought they'd punch a hole through the door LMAO"

Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Thank you in advance!My grandmother is almost 90 years old.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I’ve been one of her primary caregivers for many years.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I cannot overstate how incredibly vulnerable your mother is and how predatory people are going to be attracted to her situation like flies.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I’m totally serious.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"I cannot take my grandmother anywhere without some stranger offering to come to the house and do work, or being overly nice and insert themselves into her life, or some other weird shit that they would never say or do to me (39/F)."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"We’ve had people over to do routine maintence at the house, or make deliveries, and I walked in and one was asking her for donations to his church... that he ran out of his house... and it got more inppropriate from there."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"🙄Granted, your mom is far from the 90 y/o category."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"And it sounds like she can handle herself, but I’m here to tell you that you cannot trust other people, especially if your mom is “well off.”PredTors start falling from the sky when people get old."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Don’t invite a stranger into your moms affairs.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"Wow, that sounds awful!"
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Thanks so much for the warning.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"I don't want to catastrophize, but I do think ""hey, we'd like to hire someone to run the affairs of an old woman with memory loss"" would draw the scam artists like moths to a flame!"
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I’m certainly not trying to be drama.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,But it’s a real problem that has gotten the worse the older she has gotten.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"I have 2 people that are regular visitors, a lady who comes to clean and a man who mows the yard."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Both have been working for us for years and came highly recommended.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I do not think for one minute that they would steal from her.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,But they have both asked her for money multiple times.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Her hairdresser of 20+ years has asked her for money.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,She is in a position at 90 years old and failing memory that she does not think she can refuse.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,So I refuse for her.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,She’s dependent on them.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"Sometimes I’m not sure if she’s giving them money that I don’t know about, even though we’ve talked about her not doing that."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,It gets complicated really fast.Edit: with covid it’s even more complex.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,The masks and not wearing masks.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Ugh I’m pulling my hair out.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I really feel what you're saying.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,It's SO much harder in the pandemic.I guess at some point you could try to get some kind of access to her accounts--at least emailed statements from the bank--so you know if she's giving away money that you don't know about.I totally get trusting longtime workers not to steal from her.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Asking her for money is not the same thing at all.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"But for me, it would be a betrayal of trust."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,It sounds like a manipulation of an older person who they know is likely to feel she can't refuse.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"But then the tough thing is if you let everyone go who asks her for money, who do you hire in their place?"
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,The next person might be less trustworthy.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,It's distressing.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,So im a caregiver.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I take care of peoples parents or grandparents and not all of us are looking for something to gain.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I would say it would be all about how incorporated you are.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I work in peoples homes and nursing homes.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,In nursing homes i generally make calls for residents suffering from Alzheimers bc they all hate the nursing home.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"Honestly nurses in nursing homes do the bare minimum and it is hard to track their abuse bc as one nurse told me not too long ago “they fell on purpose” so... i take videos, pictures of poor nursing, and i keep residents in contact with their families bc most hate it here and it keeps them level."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,As for in home - i have met many families who will work all day but come in to check on things.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,They handle the finances and i do everything their family member cannot.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,If you let someone in and just let them oooh and aaah over the family member this is what leads to manipulative behavior.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Don’t jusy pick nice caregivers but have higher standards.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Do they fill you in and know what they are talking about?
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Are the timely?
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Do they do this as a passion?
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,If you need help you need help - so just be participating in what you want Thank you very much!
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Those are excellent suggestions if we get to the point that she needs help in person or nursing care.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"As of now, she does not.What do you think of the idea of a ""remote"" assistant who only helps by phone and online (due to COVID risks)?"
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,This is what my brother is suggesting.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"This would be not be nursing care but more like a ""secretary"" to help with record keeping, remembering appointments, financial matters, etc."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Thank you!
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,It is an interesting idea.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I would say for DEFINITE - keep finances strictly for the family.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"Money can be a motivator for many and honestly, I would advise all families to keep finances personal - and even then it can be sticky but at least its much less torrential than a stranger."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Honestly i feel that once it is an established understanding the kind of appts and groceries and such needed that may not be a bad idea.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Good luck!
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Thank you very much!
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I appreciate your advice.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I would tell your brother since you want the remote assistant I get to choose who the remote assistant is.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Thats a fair compromise and not a hardship at all since your mom can afford it.Don't let that remote assistant take care of finances even if it is a friend.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"Also, I think you may be better off getting her a simpler phone or launcher on her phone."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"Other people have posted about them here where the buttons are peoples faces essentially.The hard thing is if people are helping her with electronic devices, sooner or later, they can probably gIn access to her devices so if they are the slightest bit tech savvy, can figure out all passwords to her bank accounts, etc.So yes, you definitely want someone you trust."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Thank you very much!
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,That's a great suggestion about a compromise.You make a great point about getting access to her passwords.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Thanks again!
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,>I asked my brother if the reason he wants a remote assistant is because her questions are becoming burdensome to him.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"He said no but I think he has backed away from that answer.I think your intuition is bang on here, sadly."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"It’s not unusual though, for siblings to struggle with responsibilities, point fingers, etc... With that said."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"Especially if your mom is well off, you’re right to be concerned about scammers."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Your brother is suggesting basically giving this “remote assistant” POA for financial matters (along with tech and other practical help).
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I would NOT go for that.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"No one outside the family should, in my opinion.You yourself could take the financial stuff on, your husband could help with tech (maybe find some more intuitive/easy/senior-oriented solutions)."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"You could hire a personal support worker  (who is bonded, through an agency) to help with managing meals, medication, and personal care."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Probably someone else would do cleaning.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,That would be ideal.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,As far as talking to your brother about this - he sounds like a bit of an inflexible autocrat.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I would try to reassure him that you’ve got things covered (seems like you’re trying this :/).
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Maybe a third party could mediate this.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"In my area, seniors are referred (by anyone but often through a hospital or doctor) to a government agency that manages care in the community."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,There is a coordinator to speak to.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Someone like that might be able to help with this conversation with your brother and come up with other solutions as well.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Thank you very much.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Your responses are super helpful.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,It has made me realize that maybe I should ask my brother again if her question are just too much right now.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,He has a lot going on currently in his personal life.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"He is also the one within driving distance, so he is the child of hers who checks on her in person."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,That in itself is a responsibility.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"I can tell him in more detail what I can take on besides financial and medical issues, including that I can be her iPhone tech help."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,We can try to shift to my husband being her primary help for computer and TV tech issues.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"The other things I can think of are recordkeeping issues--which if someone remote can handle them, I can--and household repair issues, which are more complicated."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,But I think most of the household repair can wait until after the pandemic.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"Once my husband and I are both vaccinated (and she is), we plan to drive up there."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"That will presumably be spring or summer, when it's easier to get work done on the house anyway."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"The main issue until then is shoveling snow, which a neighbor helps with."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I should mention that my mother has a long-time trusted cleaning woman.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"However, at the start of the pandemic, my brother and I urged my mother not to let in the house people who are not isolating in the pandemic."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,(My mother is very susceptible to viruses.)
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"Once my mother and her cleaning woman are both vaccinated, she would have cleaning help again."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"I believe she still pays the cleaning woman through the pandemic, and she is one of the people who brings my mother groceries (and actually some homemade food) regularly."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"> scheduling household repairs and maintenance, remembering appointments, and keeping track of medical issues."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"Like no, absolutely not... you can’t trust strangers to this."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,SO many mistakes and omissions are routine in these areas.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Your mom will need an advocate who cares.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to push for tests, question prescriptions (either with a doctor or pharmacist, even having them go over filled prescriptions that were wrong), double check that paperwork is correct... I’ve been at my dad’s bedside in hospital, witnessed adverse reactions and had to shout to get a nurse or doctor... had to force them to write what happened down."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I’ve had to reiterate an allergy every single time he’s gone even though it’s supposed to be in his chart.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Have queried EKG results and labs and caught errors... For the place - One of you is going to have to physically go and check on things.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,At least once a week ideally.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"For her appointments- that’s easy enough, Google Calendar is fine.Medical - no chance would i offload this to anyone else."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,Thank you again!
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,You sound like a terrific advocate for your dad.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I think having a family member as a medical advocate is so important.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,I don't know if Google calendar will work for my mom.
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"She doesn't always keep her  iPhone on her in the house (she has a land line, too)."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"Even when she sets a phone alarm for an appointment, she sometimes naps through it."
Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?,"Though, honestly, if she doesn't wake up for a scheduled call with me, I don't know why she would wake up for a call with a remote assistant or because an assistant reminded her."

Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"I hope that anyone else can chime in if I've missed anything.Thank you Beautiful, thank you!"
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"i would like to add >>  Care-Giver Focus by Truthful Kindness at https://truthfulkindness.com/2020/10/25/caregiver-focus/ ; This is a really wonderful post, thank you for putting this together."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"We are at the point now where we realize our LO's primary caregiver was never really told exactly what Alzheimer's Disease is, what it looks like and what to expect, and he's struggling to understand why her behavior is changing."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I may rely on this post again and again to try to communicate to him what to expect moving forward.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Thank you.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Thank you so much!
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,This is amazing.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Thank you so much.My mom was temporarily diagnosed with Dementia after the first wave of COVID, but after a hospitalization, in-home care, and months of improvement, it was downgraded to a mild cognitive impairment."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,She did improve a lot but I can clearly see how we will be back at that diagnosis stage again someday.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I'm trying my best to prepare for the inevitable and this is extremely helpful.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Thank you again.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Thank you >This is the point where we used to institutionalize our elders.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,It was very common in the 70's and 80's and even 90's to put them in Care Homes.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Now we know that they decline MUCH faster when institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home, where they get better care.This is bullshit, and induces guilt in caregivers who are already burned out and beginning to develop their own health problems related to long term stress.Many people thrive when put into a care facility."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,For many it's the increased socialization.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,There is an entire staff to watch out for and take care of their increasing needs.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Even a nice facility is cheaper than in-home care, which is often unreliable."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Fact.And IF somebody does decline, how do you know it's ""faster""??"
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,They are ALREADY declining no matter where they are.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Sorry but you are absolutely wrong on this one.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,It's obvious our experiences have been very different.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I'm sorry that my post upset you.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Would you like a sympathetic or solutions-based response?
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I've not finished reading yet; but would like to make a comment on your comment regarding most cases not being able to be specifically diagnosed until after death.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,This is absolutely wrong and I work with people who have many different types of dementia.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,All of which have had a specific diagnosis pretty early (a year or 2) into first getting diagnosed.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Interesting, my doctor told me differently."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"She said that it's very common to make guesses, even very accurate guesses, but that absolutely indisputable diagnosis is impossible without an autopsy on the actual brain."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Unlike other organs, one cannot do exploratory surgery on the brain."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I wish to his they really did revoke the driver’s license at time of diagnosis.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,You can advocate for it to be law where you are.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I am so tired from ass wiping that I can barely advocate for a cup of coffee.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I hear that This is a great post.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,May I add a couple of things?
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"In mid-to moderate dementia, financial issues become common."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Our elders forget they didn't pay a bill, and think they are being stolen from when the company asks again to be paid."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"They forget how much money they took out from the bank, and think the teller stole it from them."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,They become much more susceptible to scammers and fraud.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Unfortunately your bank cannot share details of their financial accounts with you unless you are a signatory on their account.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Before the dementia is too far along, try to persuade them to make someone else a signatory on their account - basically, you just go to the bank and they sign paperwork to allow you to access the accounts."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"This will allow you to monitor what is happening, pay their bills, and take care of them."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"If you are part of a family with issues, it can be wise to have 2 different people sign on to the account so you can watch each other and prove you aren't stealing from mom yourself."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"In addition, call the 3 credit monitoring agencies and have their accounts locked."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,This will prevent someone taking out a new loan in your elder's name without additional verification.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"It can still be done, if the scammer gets the elder to approve it over the phone or in writing, but will help prevent casual loans from scammers."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Lastly, make sure your elder has an account created for them on the social security website."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Not having an account has become a common way to steal tax refunds and identities.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,This was brilliant info and I incorporated as much of it as I could.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Thank you so much.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers Howdy, this is a master post of what I've learned about caring for a relative with Dementia."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"I'm not a health care professional, I've just been through this four times and want a post to give to those who are new."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,This post combines six other posts.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Constructive criticism is welcome.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"It's written without Covid in mind; it changes things, of course, but most of this is still applicable now and the rest will be again."

Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Dementia is a progressive, incurable disease that results in death."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Half of everyone who lives long enough will develop dementia.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"There are multiple types of dementia, but absolute diagnosis of the specific type usually cannot be made until after death."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Specific things will make dementia worse: infections, dehydration, surgery, radiation/chemo, hospital stays, changes in routine, traveling, broken bones, alcoholism, etc."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Most sufferer's progressions follow a similar pattern, but everyone's specific journey will be different."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Note that this progression can take months or decades.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"There are things that can be done, we think, to prolong or prevent the onset of dementia symptoms."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,A diet low in sugar and alcohol but high on plants and fiber like the Mediterranean Diet can help.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Exercise is essential.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Those who speak two languages are half as likely to develop dementia, and people with higher educational attainment develop debilitating symptoms much later than those with less educational attainment."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"&#x200B;Begin the journeyOnce you suspect dementia, get your elder the best Long Term Care Insurance you can find."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Use their most recent physical you can get; if it's too old, get a new one ASAP."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Do not mention to the doc your suspicions about memory issues; family seems to pick up on these 1-5 years before they show up on the actual diagnostics, and it'd stop you from getting good LTC insurance."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Read the contract and see how long you have to wait to get a dementia diagnosis after the policy goes into effect, so to not invalidate the insurance."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,This is the time to get your legal paperwork in order.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Get your Power of Attorney or equivalent, and get the different forms the different institutions require."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Your bank will usually have a notary on hand who can notarize things for you.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Speaking of Banks, consider moving finances to a Credit Union."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,CUs are non-profit: they don't make money off you by charging fees.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"This small difference every month can save a lot of money for later, when you really might need it."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Care homes are expensive.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Also, get your Long Term Directives in order."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,What does your elder consider important to her quality of life?
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"What daily activities does she consider necessary: if she can't do that, it's not worth it?"
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Does she want CPR?
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Life support?
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,For how long?
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,How does she want her body handled?
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Where to be buried/ashes to be scattered?
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Your Doctor may have a booklet that will help you go through all of this, which can be filled out, notarized, and filed with your doctor/hospital so they have to honor her wishes."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Then get a dementia diagnosis.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Many times a simple problem like a UTI or other infection can appear as dementia-like symptoms, so rule out other (solvable) problems first."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"If your relative is resistant to going to the doctor, offer to take them out to lunch, or ask them to keep you company while you get a prescription from the hospital's pharmacy, and then take them to their appointment."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Yes, it's devious, but nothing happens without a diagnosis."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Once you're sure of dementia talk with your resources both professional and family.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Your healthcare may have a Memory Care or Elder Care group that can help you understand what's going on and what's going to happen.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Bring your relatives, or bring them back the brochures."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"There will be a lot of very difficult questions from relatives/friends who are not in the loop, such as ""what can we do"" and  ""what's the cure""."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"The answers are ""take care of her until she dies"" and ""there isn't a cure"", which they won't like to hear, but will have to accept from the professionals."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,So having someone else answer those questions is usually a lot easier.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,If they know generally what the progression is you're less likely to come up against issues with them later.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"So many relatives think ""Oh, they're just hanging with Grandma, how nice!"
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,""", when the truth is so much darker."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Half of all caregivers will develop diseases or die while caregiving; it's often one of the worst, most stressful things we will do in our lives."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Get a support group going for yourself, early, while you're still able to find time."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Get a therapist if you can.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Look around for what help is available where you are.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,You go to alz.org and use their resources.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Out where I am we have a lot of local resources for home care and supplemental care, I hope you have the same or better."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"You can find this by Searching for ""Elder Care"" and your city, county, country, province, etc."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Day care, respite care, and other programs are, frankly, essential."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,This part is important and ongoing.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Start looking at where she is in the progression of the disease and make plans for the NEXT step.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Not planning for the future is the biggest mistake most families make.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,They're so incredibly busy just barely taking care of today's needs that they're not ready for the next step.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"My aunt was  literally hoisting my grandmother onto her back to get her from her bedroom to her chair in the front room, and then took care of her during  the day... and that was all she could do."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"When Grandma caught a cold, the coughing kept her from holding onto my Aunt's shoulders so she couldn't get out of bed."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"That led to the beginning of bedsores, so she had to go to the hospital."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Instead of letting it get to that point Aunt should have had in-home carers, lifts, equipment, supportive mattresses... so many things would have made life easier for both of them."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,But Aunt was too busy -- or overwhelmed -- with the massive job of caregiving.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Prepare for the next step while you can.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Apply for government-paid in-home caring/recompense/assistance now, because by the time your requests are approved, she'll probably need them."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Apply for a place at the best memory care facility you can find/afford now, because you can decline placement over and over and over, and just be put back at the head of the list for the next available spot."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"During Covid we found that the places with Union workers had the lowest numbers for Covid infections, controlling for many variables, due to the workers having access to PPE, so that's a consideration you might want to look for."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Your country/states' Department of Social Services will probably have a rating on all their care homes that might be helpful.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Many places are big enough that they provide multiple services, From Respite to simple Assisted Living to locked wards, often via different wings."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Respite is like checking your elder into a hotel for a weekend: the facility will take your elder for a bit to give you a break, and will help familiarize her with the facility."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,These facilities will be able to transition your elder from one stage to the other via professionals.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"This is very helpful because caregivers just compensate and compensate and compensate, burning themselves out far past the point where they should have transitioned."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Keep in mind that these places run from 60K to 200K per year.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"That insane price, along with the proof that elders are healthier longer at home, are why most people keep their elders at home with them for much longer than we used to."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,But sometimes a care home is just necessary.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"There are placement services which will take your elder's requirements (ostomy care, diabetes, hoyer lifts, meds, etc), distance from your home, and prices into consideration and get you a list of facilities."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,They're very helpful and usually take recompense from the homes themselves so they don't cost you anything.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Save what you can.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Talk to your mom and get recordings of her voice.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Get tapes of all the family histories and stories you'll ever want to hear.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Get her involved in alz groups as an aid or an assistant  so when she's a participant she'll still want to be there.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Find out what her favorite music is, download it onto an easy-to-play format for when/if she has bad days."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Get out the old pictures and see if she can identify the mystery faces.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"If you have access to it, look into high-CBD products to see if your elder has a good reaction to them."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Dementia progression typically includes depression and anger, and most patients also experience sundowning, sleeplessness, and/or agitation."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,CBD can help with all of these if it's well tolerated.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Please check with your doctor first, there are a few medications that interact very badly with Cannabis."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"I have personally had very good luck with Mary's Medicinals' ""The Remedy"" and a high-CBD edible but had to try a few things to find what actually worked."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,And boy howdy they really do help.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,These are things you can do instead of worrying.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"I do these things because not doing them is a bad idea, and they help me work through the grief."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Activity helps dispel fear and anxiety.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,&#x200B;The ProgressionThe sufferers and caregivers who do the best with this disease are those who plan for the future.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,They know what the next stage is and they've already done the research and signed the papers.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"The best prepared progression is usually:""Impaired  cognition"" noticed by family, usually in ""help me find my car, I don't remember where I parked it"" situations."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Electronic GPS like a Tile can help here.POA/Healthcare POA signed by suffererAll financials nailed down, local laws researched, support group/network for caregiver found and activatedDNR, ""quality of living"", death, corpse arrangements, burial arrangements discussed ahead of timeLong-Term Care Health Insurance attained (ASAP, the longer you wait the more expensive it will be)Shared home prepared for sufferer to live with caregiver (separate doors, ramps, extra rooms, extra baths, ADA furniture, doorways, hallways etc)Patient diagnosed with dementia, usually ""mild to moderate"" stageThis is usually when their driving starts to suffer."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Taking away their keys usually provokes horrible rages, there is another option."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Go to your country/state's Department of Motor Vehicles site to submit their form for retesting an elder's capability to drive.Medications to deal with side-effects prescribed, such as Sundowner's, violent tendencies, hallucinations, etc.Medications to help with actual Alzheimer's prescribed."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"They are usually not very effective, but are expensive and have serious side effects."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Some experimental treatments, such as specific forms of light therapy, are showing promise but these will not be available from HMOs for 7-10 years  from now.Driver's License revoked, usually automatically after diagnosis & medicationApply to state/fed/insurance for any assistance, from financial to in-home."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,This may take many tries and many years.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Talk to your hospitals' Elder Care Representative.If sufferer is violent, hallucinating, or wanders, talk to local authorities so they can be prepared."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,This may not be appropriate in certain jurisdictions or for certain families.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Get an electronic Tracker, bracelet, or other identifier for any wandering patient.Around this point a few sufferers take their own lives to spare their loved ones from dealing with a body without a mind."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"This is not common with Boomers and Silent Generations as they generally believe suicide to be a sin, but we're seeing it become more and more common in patients who are younger.This is the point where we used to institutionalize our elders."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,It was very common in the 70's and 80's and even 90's to put them in Care Homes.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Now we know that they decline MUCH faster when institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home, where they get better  care.In-home care becomes necessary during the day.24/7 in-home care becomes necessary or the patient needs to be admitted to a Memory Care Facility."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"This is a locked ward where trained professionals deal with hallucinations, violent tendencies, etc."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"This step is usually triggered by a tragic incident, such as patient wandering and being found by authorities, patient harming caregiver, patient injuring self, etc."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Memory Care Facilities are not cheap, they can run between $4,000 - $14,000+ a month."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"<< this is where  caregivers with insufficient preparation or insufficient healthcare access burn out... badly.Patient loses memories entirely, needs help with every daily activityPatient loses ability to feed selfPatient loses ability to swallow&#x200B;This will be posted to both r/alzheimers and r/dementia."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I hope that anyone else can chime in if I've missed anything.Thanks.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,That was right on the money.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Wish I had done the insurance thing.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Great stuff.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Thank you for corralling all this information.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"From first glance, you may want to mention if family members are in favor/or not of putting loved one on a feeding tube."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,And that hospice coming in to ease the transition to death is also a possibility.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Ah, good points."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Thank you.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Thank you for putting this together.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I wish I had this resource at the beginning of this journey.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I would have applied for long term care and I heavily regret that now.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"I don’t have it in me to read through all of it right now, but this seems really good and comprehensive!"
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"I want to have some tasks to do and some achievable goals, otherwise I’m just cataloging symptoms and occasionally spiraling Thank you so much."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"This is invaluable information, and helps me realize how very far along we are, and the steps we need to take from here on out."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Thank you, I have been guilty of denial and wish I had read this 5 years ago when My dad's symptoms started to become apparent."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"That's a very human response, you're in the same boat as a lot of good people."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I wish I had found this last year.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Never would have thought of that insurance stuff on my own.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Thank you for sharing!
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,What would you suggest for those that will eventually run out of money for a memory care facility??
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,We paid for a lawyer because of this.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"The local ALG.org chapter told us to call Agency on Aging, who told us to call the local ALZ chapter."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"That endless circle became too frustrating to deal with so we called the ombudsman who couldn't really help and told us to get a lawyer.My mom qualified for VA Aid and Attendance to help lower the cost, but we applied in November 2019 and are still waiting."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"We were told she would see her first payments in April-ish, but as of March when COVID hit, we've been passed from one person to the next and now they're ghosting us completely."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,We escalated it to our senators to try to get help.Medicaid is next.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,We were told to get into the system ASAP.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"They've denied benefits each month, but she's at least in the system."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I highly recommend that you choose a memory care facility that takes Medicaid from the start.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"No one told us that, so we put our mom in a great community that she loves, but money is almost out and we have no choice but to move her."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"Now because she hasn't lived there as private pay first, several places told us that they wouldn't accept her as their current residents have priority."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"We've waited six months and finally have a room in a place that's an hour away, but they first want to examine her records and see if she's a good fit."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"If they end up turning her down, we're down to two places left that would even put her on a waitlist."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,Then they go through the government-run system.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,"It's harsher, less care, worse outcomes."
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I think it's more appropriate to publish this as a blog somewhere (there are numerous free hosting sites) and link to it.
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers,I read about the first 3-4 paragraphs and then reminded myself I don't come here to read BOOKS.

My mom has cognitive problems. Is it dementia or something else? Should she get long-term care insurance right now? Any good book/resource recommendations?,Is she seeing a neurologist or psychiatrist?

My mom has cognitive problems. Is it dementia or something else? Should she get long-term care insurance right now? Any good book/resource recommendations?,"That said, definitely get the long term care insurance as soon as possible, as it is likely that whatever she does have is degenerative in nature and that she will need long term care at some point."

My mom has cognitive problems. Is it dementia or something else? Should she get long-term care insurance right now? Any good book/resource recommendations?,"Thanks, she has seen a psychiatrist for anxiety and depression only, and I forgot to mention that she did go to a neurologist before she retired a couple years ago and the neurologist said she didn't have dementia and that dementia would be much different (like going downstairs and not remembering how to get back upstairs)."
My mom has cognitive problems. Is it dementia or something else? Should she get long-term care insurance right now? Any good book/resource recommendations?,My dad kind of hinges on this when he minimizes it.
My mom has cognitive problems. Is it dementia or something else? Should she get long-term care insurance right now? Any good book/resource recommendations?,I would say it has progressed slightly since then and a second opinion is definitely needed.
My mom has cognitive problems. Is it dementia or something else? Should she get long-term care insurance right now? Any good book/resource recommendations?,She needs to get back into a neurologist asap and she needs to see a psychiatrist/neuropsychiatrist regarding these issues.
My mom has cognitive problems. Is it dementia or something else? Should she get long-term care insurance right now? Any good book/resource recommendations?,"If it is degenerative, which it likely is as you say it has progressed, it can hopefully be slowed and the symptoms mitigated by medication and therapy."
My mom has cognitive problems. Is it dementia or something else? Should she get long-term care insurance right now? Any good book/resource recommendations?,But that won't happen until she sees the appropriate doctors.
My mom has cognitive problems. Is it dementia or something else? Should she get long-term care insurance right now? Any good book/resource recommendations?,"Even if they can't find a diagnosis, they can still help more with the symptoms than her regular doctors can, so she definitely needs to see them soon."

"Anyone have any small trackers, for my mom","I thought this would allow me to lock out tinkering with the phone while still be GPS and phone functional.Cons:It behaves funny on WIFI networks and will provide some false positives when on the wifi network - you might get alerts that the watch has left the area because it connected to a cellular tower 1 mile away.Games - allows them to be distracted, but also can cause mishaps as they get focused only on the watch, even when walking.Configuration - you cannot lock out configuration settings on the device - so it can easily be changed."

I'm so scared,I'm so scared My mum (56) was diagnosed in February last year.
I'm so scared,I dont live with my parents anymore and every time I go and visit it seems to get worse.
I'm so scared,My dad works all week so she's left to her own devices most of the day and just sits there.
I'm so scared,I'm so worried for her.
I'm so scared,I want her to get more help but I dont know how and she doesn't seem to want help.I'm so scared and it upsets me everytime I think about it.Sorry for the ramble.I'd talk to your dad about maybe getting some homecare while he's at work so she has some companionship and someone that can make sure she keeps up on daily self care tasks.
I'm so scared,My dad took a sharp decline when he was left alone and once we got him someone to keep him on a schedule he perked back up.
I'm so scared,I agree with this.
I'm so scared,My dad also declined after lacking social interaction from quarantine but we recently started sending him to an adult activity center during the day so he stays engaged and has made new friends.
I'm so scared,Just another option to look into.
I'm so scared,Look about aging and disability agencies in your area - they might be able to help you find resources for your mum Same.
I'm so scared,"have her do crosswords or sudoku puzzles, it will keep her mind engaged and slow cognitive decline."
I'm so scared,also try to have her walk around and maybe spend some time outside.
I'm so scared,What is her medicine game?
I'm so scared,"If you are able to, you should visit her more or get family or friends to come keep her company."
I'm so scared,She will decline faster if she is not stimulated.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,My Dad has recently become more technologically challenged as he has aged.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"I am trying to find over the ear headphones that will be very easy and simple for him to use on his iPad and MacBook Pro over Bluetooth primarily for FaceTime/Zoom.He struggles with switching the Bluetooth connection between devices with other headphones that he owns, so I am trying to find something that would be very easy for him to use."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,Would something like AirPods Max be easy for him?
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"Or what suggestions do you all have that will let him easily communicate with his family and friends?Btw, he prefers headphones to using the speakers on his devicesThanks!Bose Quiet Comfort headphones remember devices and can have active connections to two devices."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,They will try to connect first to the last connected device and if not found move down the list automatically to try other remembered devices.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,So these may be worth trying.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"I use mine regularly with a macbook, ipad and iphone."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,I second this!
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"Honestly, for simplicity you really cannot beat any headphone which simply uses the 3.5 headphone port."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"Nothing to charge, no Bluetooth to connect, and it is super simple to know which device the headphones are connected to."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"Unless he has the very newest iPad Pro or Air, he should have a 3.5 headphone port on each.I would recommend spending $20 on a simple wired set, and perhaps get something else done the line if those really don’t suit him."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,Great idea!
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"Air pods are not over the ears, but I am shocked at how consistently they always pair directly to my phone.. even over riding my car pairing Thanks for the feedback!"
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,I am referring to the new AirPods Max which are an over the ear style headphone.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,I’d imagine you want something that is easy to use but don’t want him too insulated where he can’t hear the “outside” around him.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,Imo AirPodsPro might be the best thing.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"If he is suffering from hearing loss, hearing aids with Bluetooth built in exist now."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,I am going to look into this!
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,Thanks for the tip Np.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,We went with Starkey livio edge ones.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,It has some “artificial intelligence” built in that makes things extremely easy for dad.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,For example you don’t need to change settings based on your surroundings.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,Has other bells and whistles but you can explore further if you like.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"I will say though, it is a big investment."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"Good luck.Edit: just have to say, it’s sad hearing aids are considered “ cosmetic”."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"After further research, hearing loss can impact the brain and also speech."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"May be worth looking into his insurance and how much, if any, they’d help."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,I have the airpod pros and it automatically connects to your closest apple device.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"If you want to switch to a different device, it’s a fairly simple process."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"I’d recommend these but again, these are the only wireless headphones I’ve tried."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,Can the AirPods Max automatically connect between MacBook and iPad like they do on iPhone and iPad?
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,Yep!
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,Connects to my phone and MacBook automatically.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"I’m assuming they should do the same for iPad, but I don’t own one."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,That’s great feedback!
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,Thank you.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,I just hope he can figure these out easily if we go this route.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,It’s frustrating and saddening watching my dad over FaceTime struggle with his headphones every time we call.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"Yeah, it’s really useful."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,He just needs to put them in his ears and it automatically connects to the closest apple device.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"If he needs to switch, he can just click the volume button on the MacBook top toolbar and select “X’s AirPods”."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,Just chiming in here that the auto-pairing/switching can be a real challenge when an aging parent is trying to answer a call.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,Under the time pressure the pairing switch can be a significant frustration and hurdle.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,I'm considering getting setting up a separate phone docking station for my dad because currently the phone is right next to the Mac and at 82 years old the pairing anxiety continues to be an issue even 6 months out.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,/r/headphones might have some good recommendations.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,They love niche requests like this.
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"I tried to post there, but my question was removed as I was looking for purchasing advice."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,"I love these headphones -- they are a wire cutter pick for sound control, and work great when listening to music (or anything else)."
Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad?,They are comfy and easy to bluetooth.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NM3RSRQ/?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=xm2&ascsubtag=AwEAAAAAAAAAAcX5

Grandpa moments,Grandpa moments This is honestly just going to be me keeping track of the weird things grandpa says and does while I help with his care.
Grandpa moments,"I just need to tell someone, anyone.Told me my driving was going to get us killed.... we were parked and the keys were out of the ignition.Suddenly wanted to be dropped off right there and tried to open the door while we were driving...  lock buttons are wonderful.Gave me the sex talk about what happens when a man loves a woman(they have sex).... told me this twiceSaid I was a handsome man..... I’m a girlTold me young girls like me shouldn’t be trying to be with older men..... I’m not dating anyone."
Grandpa moments,"These are just off the top of my head but i needed to tell someone.That was his way of saying you needed to move the carhe was tired of riding and wanted to walk homeHmmm, should have asked him if a man and a woman can have sex if they don't love each other."
Grandpa moments,"In some cultures perhaps you'd make a handsome man, who knows?Tell him you're just trying to find a rich Sugardaddy to pay your expenses."
Grandpa moments,You should write them all down if you can remember em.
Grandpa moments,make it into a cartoon strip or a short TV series.
Grandpa moments,I get it from my dad as well.
Grandpa moments,makes it fun trying to figure out what he wants lol.best of luck.
Grandpa moments,"[deleted] That would be sooo helpful, would make counteracting their delusions somewhat straightforward instead of being 80% guessing game."
Grandpa moments,Hang in there!
Grandpa moments,Dementia is a nasty disease.
Grandpa moments,We have hit a wall after having my father in our house for the last 2 months.
Grandpa moments,"He is 82, a narcissist, low self-esteem, low self image and plain old POS!"
Grandpa moments,We offered our home to him instead of going to assisted living/memory care.
Grandpa moments,I had a horrendous relationship with him over the years and even worked with him for 30+ years.
Grandpa moments,But wife and I wanted to give him a little dignity before we were unable to care for him.
Grandpa moments,"Thought him being around his grandkids would help him, he's only been nasty towards them."
Grandpa moments,Saying he should have never told them how good Costco's ice cream was.
Grandpa moments,Wanting to keep it all for him.
Grandpa moments,"When caring for a family member with dementia, anything goes."
Grandpa moments,"He is old, cranky and always negative."
Grandpa moments,My wife just stated today that she has never heard my father ask how anyone is doing!
Grandpa moments,Pretty pathetic considering we've been married for 15 years.
Grandpa moments,I have never heard him he say he loves my sister or me and I'm 53 and sister is 57.
Grandpa moments,Just remember they have a disease and they will say anything and one has to try to separate is truth from reality.
Grandpa moments,My father has been studying a driver's pamphlet thinking he will get his license back.
Grandpa moments,NEVER!!!
Grandpa moments,But we let him study away.
Grandpa moments,Best wishes for you and you grandpa.
Grandpa moments,"Yeah, driving with Dad in the car is interesting."
Grandpa moments,Am thinking it's hitting his depth perception as he screams at oncoming cars which are at the other end of the parking lot from us.
Grandpa moments,"Does the same with cross traffic if we're waiting at a light, figures everyone is going too fast I guess.Had him try and bail out only once, but he was in the backseat at the time and still had enough awareness to know he couldn't fit out the window after discovering we'd child locked the back doors."
Grandpa moments,"That was a quick pull over, he managed to get roughly his upper quarter outside before we quit moving."
Grandpa moments,Understandable.
Grandpa moments,"It's a disease that affects people around the person affected quite badly.Mum said a lot of weird things before she passed away.That the pillow of her bed was a machine, and my brother looked like a machine.That she was sitting on a rock and saw us all under water below her.The hardest bit was demanding to see dad... he'd died a few years earlier."
Grandpa moments,"Every time my brother told her he's dead, she seemed to relive the grief of him dying again."
Grandpa moments,"I always tried to deflect her but he bluntly told her ""he's dead, we've told you this a million times""."
Grandpa moments,That was hard.She'd tell us she'd ran away from the home and gotten lost before they found her.
Grandpa moments,"Talking to the home, they had no record of her leaving.Once, she didn't recognise me."
Grandpa moments,"Then, moments later she did.The nursing home let her phone me."
Grandpa moments,All I heard was her screaming non-stop for five minutes.
Grandpa moments,I kept saying unless she said something I would hang up.
Grandpa moments,She eventually mumbled something and went back to screaming.I hung up.
Grandpa moments,"Later that day my brother told me she had no recollection of doing that.The rest of that day, I was upset and did little work.Both my parents are dead now."
Grandpa moments,I felt numb for quite a while.
Grandpa moments,We'd fallen out ages ago and were distant.
Grandpa moments,I remember the bad times more than the good.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do This is my first time posting on Reddit, and I apologize for the LONG post."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I’m on my phone, so hopefully the formatting is ok."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Thank you in advance to anyone who reads/comments!
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I’m a woman in my early 40s and the only child of a wonderful woman in her mid 70s.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","We live in two different states, about 10 hours apart by car."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I love my mom and am very grateful for her.That being said, Mom has changed a lot in the last few years."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","She’s gotten more judgmental and negative about some things, monopolizes conversations with others (interrupting to talk about herself or give an opinion, etc."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","), and when anyone says anything complimentary of me, she always takes credit for it, as though I have not learned or done anything on my own in 40 years.Mom is physically better off than many people her age, but her health has declined some, and there are issues she does not address at all that she should, including hearing loss and severe arthritis."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",She seems to be more forgetful and is constantly looking things up and writing things down.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","She has countless pieces of paper, sticky notes, and calendars in multiple locations."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I assume this constant note taking is a coping mechanism for not remembering things as easily anymore.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","She spends A LOT of time with her head buried in her phone or iPad either scrolling Facebook, reading something on the internet, or playing a game."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",She doesn’t really use Facebook to keep up with loved ones since she never posts or comments and rarely messages with people.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",It’s just mindless scrolling and game playing in my opinion.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I honestly think some of it is depression related, however she’d probably never admit that, and if she did, I highly doubt she’d seek counseling."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Medication is out of the question because she’s very anti-medicine.Here’s where we get to the tricky part.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Mom divorced her last husband (she’s had a few) a few years ago, and she kept the house, which was her first mistake."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","It’s beautiful, but it’s huge and requires lots of upkeep and at 20 years old, it’s quickly becoming a money pit."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Mom is a dog lover and has two small dogs who are 15 and 16 and in very declining health.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",They require an abundance of work and patience.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","My mom is very dedicated to the dogs and takes wonderful care of them, but she does yell and get frustrated at times because they can be soul sucking."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Her yelling is stressful and scares my dog, who is a rescue from an abusive home, and I have had to remind her multiple times not to yell.We have spent the last year together either in my home or Mom’s."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I have done a lot of the work for her dogs because some of it is hard for her due to her arthritis and skin issues.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",These dogs are each under 7 pounds and frail.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","They don’t have accidents daily, but when they do, it can be a nightmare."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",It’s not just a puddle that needs to be cleaned and sanitized (we both have tile flooring).
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","They step or fall in it, track it, have poop on themselves, whatever."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","It can become a whole cleaning process, often requiring a bath/shower for the dog and/or whoever is doing the cleaning."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",They make a lot of laundry.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Leaving them can be a nightmare.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I have tried to do the majority of the errands and shopping since the pandemic began since Mom is obviously more high risk.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","The dogs require a lot of proactive action in order to reduce some of the workload, and my OCD mind is always looking to the next step to try to avoid a problem."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Mom does not always listen to what I tell her to do to manage them, even though I’m usually right with my suggestions, and her stubbornness often results in a mess I end up cleaning."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",She will literally be lost in her phone and not paying attention when something avoidable happens.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I often come home to a problem.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","The dogs eat up a lot of her day, the rest is her shower, meals, and her phone."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Sometimes not a lot else gets accomplished.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Her house requires too much work for that.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","She isn’t a hoarder, but the house is full of lots of furniture and things, some of which she never should have bought, most of which she doesn’t use, and she admits that she wants to downsize and doesn’t want a lot of it."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I’ve made her clean out cabinets and get rid of old stuff.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","She had food in her pantry that expired years ago, cleaning supplies she hadn’t used in years, etc."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","There’s still plenty more she could get rid of, but she often finds reasons to keep things."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","She can’t find certain things, including a picture of my late father I have wanted for years, because this house is so full of stuff."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",One older person does not need well over 4000 square feet of large furniture and belongings!
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",The work that needs to be done to get her into a smaller house is something I don’t know how to accomplish.Today was the one year anniversary of a traumatic and life altering event for me.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I kind of just wanted to be by myself, think a little, and maybe watch something mindless on TV."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Mom of course wanted to do something on the other end of the house from where the dogs were napping.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",She took one dog with her and left the other one alone rather than ask me to keep an eye on him for a bit.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Of course he peed, stepped in and tracked it, and I had almost an hour of cleaning to do."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I spent Christmas Day bathing her dogs, cleaning poop, washing their bedding, washing her bedding, and making her bed."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","She did cook a small dinner, which I appreciated, but she wanted to do that, and then of course she got frustrated in the process."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I really didn’t want to clean anything dog related today after all I did yesterday.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I just wanted to take the day to deal with my trauma from a year ago.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",It’s hard not to get mad and resentful when some of the work I end up doing could be avoided if Mom would be proactive or pay better attention.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","If she wanted to leave the dog alone, she should have taken him outside first."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","This isn’t rocket science.Even before COVID, Mom really didn’t reach out to her friends much or do a lot of things socially."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I’m basically her only social outlet.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","This has caused problems for me socially over the last few years because when she comes to stay with me (usually for a few months at a time), I often feel guilty for leaving her to do something with friends, etc."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Her somewhat overbearing presence was an issue in one relationship I had a couple years ago, and it also prevented me from spending some time with the person I dated most recently."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I try not to get resentful about that, but it’s hard at times."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Mom recently told me she wished I could sell my house, move in with her, sell her home, and then move back to my state since the climate is better."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",That seems like a lot to ask of me.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I don’t want to move around and don’t necessarily want to live in her current location or with her.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Obviously if she needed care I would live with her, but as of now she could manage on her own in a smaller home.I’m getting ready to go back home, and Mom will be on her own for the first time in a year."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I am concerned about how she will fare emotionally, and I’m also concerned about the workload since I won’t be here to do the nitty gritty work with the dogs, wake up with them at night since she doesn’t seem to hear them, or do the planning ahead to avoid a problem."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I also think with no one around, she will sit and do even more mindless phone scrolling, and she’ll never get to a point where she’s ready to sell her home and move, which she should have done years ago."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I hate to think of the what ifs, but if something happens to her, I’ll be so screwed with the amount of work in her house, not to mention the associated costs while I try to sell it, which can take time in her area."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","If I had a child, I would never want to leave him or her in a situation like that."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Not to mention, why wouldn’t she want to simplify her life?"
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",She’s expressed that desire yet does nothing to get herself there.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","If it were me, I’d be rushing to get into a smaller home so I could actually have time to enjoy my retirement."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I know no one my mom’s age who lives the way she does.I try not to get mad but have certainly expressed anger and frustration on more than one occasion, and some of it hasn’t been pretty."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I’m trying to work on that because I know I can cut deep with my words.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I am at a loss on so many levels.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I guess what prompted me to finally post was the issue today that was so completely avoidable because Mom could have just walked the dog prior to leaving him alone, and he would have been fine."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I almost felt like she was sabotaging a day when I just needed to do some healing, and I felt very disrespected, although I don’t think it was malicious on her part."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I almost think she’s so used to me handling the problems that she doesn’t worry about them happening.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I’m not sure how to handle things as I prepare to leave her alone.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Any advice is appreciated!I know it doesn't fix everything but...Dog diapers.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",It sounds so stupid but I'm dead serious.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",They have disposable ones or reusable ones you just chuck in the washing machine.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","They're super helpful for older, disabled, and young/small dogs recovering from surgery."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","If the dogs won't leave them alone (which tends to be more of a young dog issue), my vet recommends dog pajamas or straight up baby onesies if your dog is small enough (carefully cut a hole for the tail)."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","The dogs will look stupid af, but you won't be cleaning up after them like before or stressing over them constantly."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","The dog diapers are a great idea, and I have discussed that with my mom because she used them in the past with another dog who passed away at an old age."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","The problem with her two is the dog who would need the diaper the most has some skin issues, and my mom really doesn’t want her to sit in a dirty diaper or need additional bathing because she already gets bathed enough."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","The other dog was a rescue and has misshapen back legs, we believe due to abuse in a previous home, and it’d be pretty hard to get a diaper on him."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Thankfully he is able to control his potty habits pretty well.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","So it just boils down to lots of supervision, and of course the dogs have impeccable timing and always need something when you’re in the middle of a task!I think one of those places you’re describing sounds great in many ways, however I’m not sure my mom is quite ready for that."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I also don’t think she’d pay the high prices.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I think she could swing a small home and yard on her own with someone to come and mow the grass for her.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",It’s just getting her into a smaller home that I don’t think she can tackle.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Downsizing and moving seems like an insurmountable task at this point, especially with me not being close by to help her."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I get frustrated because she should have moved years ago when the work required to do so wouldn’t have been as hard on her, but she was hell bent on remaining where she is until more recently."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","It’s like I’m still a child sometimes and can’t possibly make a valid point or two, lol."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","She is slowly getting better at taking my suggestions, but that has been a hard fight."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",You have every right to feel the way you feel.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I am also an only child to a 71 year old, widowed mom who was staying with me for a little and is going back home, so your guilt and feelings of obligation hit home for me."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Is she open to having someone come by and help with the dogs?
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","If so, and if you have the money, you could consider hiring someone to swing by every other day or however you feel comfortable to help with the dogs and whatever else your mom needs help with."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Might also help to have the doggos reevaluated by a vet if you haven't already, to make sure you're doing all that you can for them."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Thank you so much for your lovely reply!
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I’m sorry you are going through something similar, and I’m so sorry to hear about your dad (or maybe stepdad)."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","My father passed away when I was little, but my parents were already divorced."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",I miss my dad a lot.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",How is your mom’s health?
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Does she do alright on her own?My mom is not very open to having a lot of help with things.
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Other than her yard man (who hasn’t shown up in weeks, so I’ve been doing yard work), she has no help here."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","I doubt she’d want to spend money on a dog sitter, and quite frankly, I don’t feel it’s my responsibility to do that."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","In many ways, my mom is in a hell of her own making, and she doesn’t take suggestions well."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","And if she did have a pet sitter come by, she’d spend a lot of time chatting with them and wouldn’t use the time wisely to do things she needs to do while she doesn’t have to keep an eye on the dogs."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Time management is a huge issue around here.The dogs get regular vet care, and she has spoken with the vet multiple times in recent weeks."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","My mom is of the opinion that if they eat (she hand feeds both of them twice daily), drink, and go potty, they are living, and their quality of life, and hers, is secondary."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","The older dog can no longer seem to control her bowels, and my biggest fear came true last night when she had an accident in my mom’s bed."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","Guess I’ll be doing lots of laundry today!I’m certainly not trying to not take suggestions, I just know how stubborn my mom is."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","She is the person who spends money on things she never uses, and they sit around in bags or boxes forgotten about."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do","She says she can do this or that, but when it comes down to it, then she will struggle."
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do",Sigh.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"Bathroom etiquette for disabled people I live with my brother, who has a neurodegenerative disorder that causes physical and mental handicaps."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,He can barely walk and has severe balance issues.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Recently he has stopped closing the bathroom door and washing his hands.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,I understand why; he can't take his hands off his walker.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,But it's a bad scene for a variety of reasons.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,What can I do to make it so he can close the door and keep his hands clean?
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Is there a device I could build and install on the door?You can take the door off the hinge and put a small shower curtain up (with a collapsible rod higher than he can reach.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"Doesn't have to be fancy, but something that makes it private as far as walking past and looking in."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"At the very least, someone could follow behind him and close the curtain."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"Another option is splitting the curtain in several spots (maybe like 4 big parts) and attaching magnets that will ""let go"" when he pushes against them."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Or small garment/fishing weights.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Gives the illusion of privacy but isn't just an open area anyone can bother him in.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"For washing hands, maybe a dispenser - automatic."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Maybe just sanitizer.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Maybe a foam dispenser that can absorb into his skin.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Maybe just wet wipes he can run his fingers through.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,My dad forgets to wash but he'll wipe his fingers on a wet-wipe since he's already using that for wiping in general.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"If you have the money/space for a remodel of the doorway, you can look into a bathroom remodel for him."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Most people in the home health sector just give these inexpensive solutions because they don't cost much and are easy to implement.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Look online.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,You can get a cheap wire basket to hang on his Walker and put antibacterial hand wipes or gel in it.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"If this is at home, I’d shrug it off.If it’s in the public place, I would just stand nearby like parents do for their little kids.You could put a sign on the mirror as a reminder... there’s probably auto - closing hinges but you’d have to check and make sure (municipality wise) if this is up to code (if you’re in the US)."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"Just a wild guess, but I know in the US, local government can be picky about these changes inside a home That's a good idea."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,I'll look into local statutes.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,I wonder if a simple piece of cord could be tied around the door knob ... long enough the he can get where he needs to be then pull the cord to at least semi-close the door.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Or a cane or yardstick to gently push the door closed.Sanitary hand wipe cloths can be put into his walker bag so he can clean his hands when he gets back to the bed.I also wonder if part of his not closing the door is fear that if he needs help you won't hear him or won't come right away.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,In my house we got a pair of CallToU buttons that hang around the neck and buzz where every you put the receiver.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,The entire family seemed to relax after that because we all knew that at any time for any reason they could 'call me' for help.https://www.amazon.com/CallToU-Caregiver-Transmitters-Receivers-Attention/dp/B077SYPD5K/ref=sr_1_7?crid=1Q4KQF7FX8LU7&dchild=1&keywords=bell+for+disabled+person&qid=1608670393&sprefix=bell+for+di%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-7 Thanks for the advice!
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,I'll get somw wipes next time I'm at the store.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"I hadn't thought about that, I'll get some of those buttons."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,I had two in hospice at the same time - my Mom and my husband.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,You can set the bells to different ring tones so we always knew who pressed the bell by what it chimed.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"For me, as caretaker, it meant I didn't have to always have my 'ears' tuned tot hem."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,I could relax and trust that they would use the bell when necessary.After each of them passed I gave their bell onto our hospice nurse so that she could lend them to her other patients.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"The door closing is easy enough, there are door closers that are pretty inexpensive and install with a couple of screws."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"It would attempt to close on him as he is walking through, so make sure that it wouldn't lose a problem."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,An even cheaper alternative is to just get a long spring and screw it to the door and frame on the hinge side.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"Not a lot of closing power so it probably wouldnt latch, but it could maintain his privacy."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Hand washing would be more complicated.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Portable handwashing stations are big and intended for festivals and jobsites (at least the ones I could find).
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"There isnt a convenient option, but perhaps a pitcher of warm water poured over a basin or bucket so he can wash his hands when he can sit may be an option?"
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"Hand sanitizer could work in a pinch, but isnt as effective."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Hmmm.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"Sounds like somebody needs to be on stand by for when he is finished to insist and assist those hands being washed vs feces on hands, to walker and to anything else he touches."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Same stand by can close and open the door.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Hopefully he can actually wipe his bottom good but there are gloves to wear to help him with that.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,He needs to own up to where he needs help.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,"I would sanitize his walker too esp where he grabs it, once in awhile wipe it down."
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Likely he does other stuff without washing his hands properly.
Bathroom etiquette for disabled people,Coughing into hands etc.
"Our family is split over how to handle my grandmother's dementia, no one will listen to each other and the fighting is making things 100% worse.","Our family is split over how to handle my grandmother's dementia, no one will listen to each other and the fighting is making things 100% worse."
"Our family is split over how to handle my grandmother's dementia, no one will listen to each other and the fighting is making things 100% worse.","I don't really know what I can do at this point, I have moved to the UK from Aus 10 years ago and have slowly watched my grandmother deteriorate every time I go back to see them.She completely lost grip on reality when my grandfather passed 3 years ago, in the last 2 years since my last visit she has gone from someone who couldn't cook but would remember to eat snacks, remember who we are, walk around the shops - to someone who refuses food, is physically violent, and spends most of her time rewashing the same pile of laundry.This side of my family have never gotten along well but they have spent the last 5 years yelling at each other, winding my grandmother up to see who's side she will take and basically acting like children - and doing the worst things you can do around someone suffering from the disease."
"Our family is split over how to handle my grandmother's dementia, no one will listen to each other and the fighting is making things 100% worse.","They yell at her when she forgets things, they tell her she's losing it and that they will put her in a home (as punishment), they have massive arguments in front of her, and now they wonder why she has started to be violent.I have spent the last 12 months pleading with my mother to call a help line and start to learn more about the disease but even a few months ago she admitted to me that she didn't want to accept this was happening and the help line would make it too real.The worst part is that the stress of this is clearly causing my mum to deteriorate in the same way, she has always had a bad memory but now she has complete blanks, she struggles to use small devices like her phone, she gets completely disorientated and stressed in new surroundings."

I'm Just Exhausted,I'm Just Exhausted My MIL is about to turn 70.
I'm Just Exhausted,About 5 years ago she moved in with my husband and I as we were struggling financially and she was leaving her 5th husband.
I'm Just Exhausted,We had lived together previously and for a few years it was fine.
I'm Just Exhausted,Any issues that came up were resolved with talking and respecting each other.
I'm Just Exhausted,"Recently though, things have nosedived.The last 2 years have been a constant struggle and I feel like I can't even enjoy my own home."
I'm Just Exhausted,Things got so bad over the COVID crisis I am not sure how much longer I can do this.
I'm Just Exhausted,I work as a social service provider and feel like I'm failing at home.
I'm Just Exhausted,I'm the only one working as my husband is in school and 2 terms away from graduating.
I'm Just Exhausted,MIL is retired and even before COVID had limited activity.
I'm Just Exhausted,My MIL has basically stopped helping out around the house leaving me to do it in my spare time.
I'm Just Exhausted,My husband tries to help but his course load is very difficult especially with distance learning.
I'm Just Exhausted,There are so many behaviors I feel overwhelmed when at home or thinking about coming home.
I'm Just Exhausted,The most obvious behavior my MIL has taken on has impacted my husband significantly.
I'm Just Exhausted,Since she doesn't have social obligations she started losing track of the days.
I'm Just Exhausted,"We started to keep a calendar in the fridge so that's subsided but now she has begun to interrupt conversations, begin talking to my husband when he is taking a test in zoom even after he informs her he is starting."
I'm Just Exhausted,She had stopped reading social or physical cues and will continue to speak even if others are talking.
I'm Just Exhausted,She has lost a lot of social respect.
I'm Just Exhausted,"She needs constant guidance when out and about, like when she walks right up to other people in the store and starts coughing loudly!"
I'm Just Exhausted,We have had to physically guide her back while waiting in line as she stood about 19 inches behind the person in front of her as she didn't hear or heed our verbal reminder.
I'm Just Exhausted,She will ignore social distancing but openly complain when others do the same to her.
I'm Just Exhausted,A few weeks ago I had some really exciting news so I went to tell her.
I'm Just Exhausted,I explained then she completely changed the subject and basically ignored what I said.
I'm Just Exhausted,This is happening more and more and really hurtful.
I'm Just Exhausted,MIL choose not to wear her glasses when cooking which means there are incredible messes I have to pick up when I get home from work.
I'm Just Exhausted,"Every day I come home to the counters cluttered,  food stuck on ""clean"" dishes,  packaged food in the fridge needing to be cleaned up, and food and spills running down the appliances and lower cabinets."
I'm Just Exhausted,I have tried to keep up the common areas in my spare time but it got so consuming I would feel like crying whenever she went into the kitchen to make food.
I'm Just Exhausted,I want to get a cleaner for the kitchen twice as month but there is no way we can afford it.
I'm Just Exhausted,In my job I work with senior services and her they refuse in home assistance unless the senior is unable to wash on their own.
I'm Just Exhausted,We have talked with her many times about being more mindful as well as wearing her glasses when cooking but she doesn't seem to care about her impact on us.
I'm Just Exhausted,"Along with that thought, she has recently been causing me to feel very guilty about spending time with my husband."
I'm Just Exhausted,We will take time to talk alone in our room or go for a drive and will mention how she is always left out or alone.
I'm Just Exhausted,She has begun talking more and more about dying alone or how she doesn't have anyone to emotionally bond to.
I'm Just Exhausted,We have suggested on multiple occasions setting up socially distant meet ups with friends but she shoots us down.
I'm Just Exhausted,"Even after explaining that there is virtually no risk she refuses, however still insists on going to the grocery store."
I'm Just Exhausted,It feels like she now fully expects my husband and I to fulfill emotional needs that isn't on us to fulfill.
I'm Just Exhausted,We have stopped inviting her to watch movies with us or play games she used to like because she never said yes.
I'm Just Exhausted,She admits she had been depressed but won't talk to her doctor.
I'm Just Exhausted,We have offered to go with her or to set up a virtual meeting but again she doesn't seem interested in wanting to change anything.
I'm Just Exhausted,We talked six months ago about both her and I getting some counseling.
I'm Just Exhausted,I did but she chose not to even after agreeing.
I'm Just Exhausted,She has also developed some really irritating compulsions that continue even after speaking to her about them.
I'm Just Exhausted,I struggle with PTSD from childhood abuse and have misophonia.
I'm Just Exhausted,"She has had this compulsive nontinal whistle/ air blowing for about 2 years,  but after checking in with her about it she had only gotten worse."
I'm Just Exhausted,I don't want to think it's on purpose but it's EVERY time she's in a common space and I have to consistently leave the room which she takes great offense to.
I'm Just Exhausted,"Additionally, I'm sensitive to touch unless it's my husband."
I'm Just Exhausted,Recently she had taken extreme offense to me retracting when she walks up behind me to scratch my back or shoulder.
I'm Just Exhausted,"She will follow it up with ""I guess I'm just touch starved."
I'm Just Exhausted,"It's been years since someone hired me!"""
I'm Just Exhausted,"Well,  not only isn't that true but she is well aware that I've struggled significantly with PTSD."
I'm Just Exhausted,It's only been in the last year that she makes me feel guilty about this.
I'm Just Exhausted,My husband and I feel that we have to walk on eggshells around her each day.
I'm Just Exhausted,We feel that she is holding us responsible for not only ensuring she is physically taken care of but emotionally as well.
I'm Just Exhausted,In the next two years my husband and I plan to start the adoption process through the foster care system and there is absolutely no way we would be approved with her in the home.
I'm Just Exhausted,As the time draws nearer and home is less and less a refuge I find myself running out of mechanisms to cope with.
I'm Just Exhausted,At this point she has me feeling like I am the asshole in the home by not constantly providing all her needs.
I'm Just Exhausted,"Additionally, I'm sensitive to touch unless it's my husband."
I'm Just Exhausted,Recently she had taken extreme offense to me retracting when she walks up behind me to scratch my back or shoulder.

I'm Just Exhausted,"Well,  not only isn't that true but she is well aware that I've struggled significantly with PTSD."

I'm Just Exhausted,Is a senior living community an option?
I'm Just Exhausted,Especially if you are starting a family.
I'm Just Exhausted,Can she afford her own apartment near by?
I'm Just Exhausted,"If she is cognitive, your husband has to have end of life conversation now."
I'm Just Exhausted,What does she want in the future?
I'm Just Exhausted,I pushed the issue with my parents when they were about to retire.
I'm Just Exhausted,It has saved us alot of time and drama.
I'm Just Exhausted,My mom has since passed on her terms and my dad is in a senior home.
I'm Just Exhausted,I would definitely look into senior housing of some sort.
I'm Just Exhausted,She needs supervision doing basic things (cooking).
I'm Just Exhausted,And her refusal to see a doctor means she knows something is wrong and doesn't want it confirmed.
I'm Just Exhausted,And YOU NEED A BREAK!!!
I'm Just Exhausted,You are dealing with people's problems all day at work and then come home to more problems.
I'm Just Exhausted,"I'm sure your husband is busy, but he needs to step up more."
I'm Just Exhausted,"This is his mom, and he needs to confront her."
I'm Just Exhausted,Does your husband have any siblings who might be able to take care of MIL for a week or two so you can get a break?
I'm Just Exhausted,"You need a day at the spa, or just a couple of days away from MIL."
I'm Just Exhausted,Get some self-care!
I'm Just Exhausted,"She needs to be in her own place, supervised."
I'm Just Exhausted,It does not seem likely she's going to get better.
I'm Just Exhausted,"And if you want a child, the sooner you take steps toward finding her a place, the better."
I'm Just Exhausted,There is no reason to feel guilty about this.
I'm Just Exhausted,"She is either choosing not to respect you, or she is in mental decline and can't behave properly."
I'm Just Exhausted,"In either case, you are not at fault."
I'm Just Exhausted,"You can adopt a child, or you can allow your mother to be your child, but not both."
I'm Just Exhausted,Have you ever had her mental capacity tested?
I'm Just Exhausted,It could be that she is starting to suffer from the effects of dementia or Alzheimer's?
I'm Just Exhausted,I would ask her GP to perform a MMSE on her?

I'm Just Exhausted,She could have also suffered from a TIA or small stroke as that can cause personality changes too.
I'm Just Exhausted,There is also something called a Care Manager who does an assessment for services for people.
I'm Just Exhausted,We just went through this with my MIL and I have to tell you it's one of the hardest things we had to go through.
I'm Just Exhausted,"Once we got her diagnosed things got easier only because we realized that she wasn't doing things to be difficult, her brain just changed."
I'm Just Exhausted,She is now living in memory care but its still hard.
I'm Just Exhausted,"I know right now it may be overwhelming but in order for you not to get burned out, you and your husband need to think about changing things because it's probably not something that will improve that much."
I'm Just Exhausted,"Try to identify as many things you can farm out like grocery shopping, meal preparation, laundry, cleaning etc."
I'm Just Exhausted,I think it would really help your mental health.
I'm Just Exhausted,"On thing that helps us - don’t take things they say personally.- its the dementia talking, not the person."
I'm Just Exhausted,"I have seen the sweetest, nicest, most educated people say the most vile things - but it was the dementia talking, not the person the used to be."
I'm Just Exhausted,"Honestly, it sounds like you are taking on more responsibility both for care and decision making than your husband in this situation and that seems like a major part of the problem to me."
I'm Just Exhausted,It’s his mom.
I'm Just Exhausted,"If the situation is creating a dynamic in the home that is bad and escalating, he has to take a leadership role in the resolution."
I'm Just Exhausted,I’m sorry.
I'm Just Exhausted,I know how hard this stuff is.
I'm Just Exhausted,"Be kind to yourself, especially in your head."
I'm Just Exhausted,This was long so maybe I missed it but have you had her evaluated.
I'm Just Exhausted,These are not normal changes Call an elder-care attorney.
I'm Just Exhausted,The first consult is free.Have a pad and pencil ready; be prepared to get her out of your house and on her own (with carers)!Good luck!
I'm Just Exhausted,Time for a neuropsychological evaluation.

I'm Just Exhausted,"A couple of those can be signs of (probably unrecognized, unacknowledged) hearing loss:• continuing to speak when others are talking• “listening” to you, then changing the subject and ignoring what you saidIt seems like there’s little doubt she is going through other cognitive and emotional changes, too, but if hearing loss is in the picture, the reduced informational input caused by it can exacerbate the other changes."
My sweet honey,My sweet honey A few days ago I came home to find that my sweet honey had passed away.
My sweet honey,4 wonderful years we shared together.
My sweet honey,4 short years when we planned on having forever.
My sweet honey,When Dave and I met things were very casual and fun.
My sweet honey,We had both been hurt in the past and were not looking to rush into anything.
My sweet honey,We instantly hit it off.
My sweet honey,"I had never laughed so hard, smiled so much or been so happy before."
My sweet honey,Every second I spent with him the more I realized that what we had would be special.Dave was a type 1 diabetic for over 10years when we first met.
My sweet honey,He had his insulin tracked pretty well with the help of his ominipod and years of practice.
My sweet honey,I knew very little about the disease but quickly became quit the expert.
My sweet honey,Our relationship blossomed and we both realized that we would never be apart.
My sweet honey,It was so natural.
My sweet honey,We fit so well together and I told him he was my forever and he told me I was his “end goal”.
My sweet honey,He met my 4 year old son and the two of them hit it off and instantly became buddies.We were a little family.
My sweet honey,"As our relationship blossomed, unfortunately so did Daves illness."
My sweet honey,"His organs began to fail and he started dialysis 3 days a week while waiting for a transplant.Even with all the hospital trips, dialysis, and sickness we still had each other."
My sweet honey,And we made each other laugh.
My sweet honey,Even in the darkest times.
My sweet honey,We were going to get through it.
My sweet honey,"Last March, Dave got the call we had been waiting for."
My sweet honey,They had a kidney and pancreas for him.
My sweet honey,"Even though we were scared because the world was in the middle of a pandemic, we knew this was his 2nd chance."
My sweet honey,The surgery was a success and within 4 weeks he was home recovering with me.
My sweet honey,We spent a WONDERFUL 8 months living together.
My sweet honey,He grew stronger every day.
My sweet honey,It was so nice to not have to worry about sugars or dialysis.
My sweet honey,Unfortunately this took a turn for the worse about a month ago.
My sweet honey,He developed phenomena and spent the last 3 weeks in the hospital.
My sweet honey,His body fought off the illness but also started to fight the new organs that didn’t really belong there.
My sweet honey,The pancreas was able to be saved but the kidney was stubborn and would not wake back up.
My sweet honey,I picked him up from the hospital Wednesday and was so happy to have him home.
My sweet honey,"Even though he had to start dialysis again, we were positive that we would get through this together."
My sweet honey,Just another road block but we would get through it like everything else.
My sweet honey,We were so strong.
My sweet honey,So so strong.
My sweet honey,Never in 4 years did we fight or argue.
My sweet honey,We even talked about celebrating him being home by getting sized for rings.
My sweet honey,We planned on buying a home together this summer.
My sweet honey,So many plans..... and everything was just taken away.
My sweet honey,I came home from work Thursday and found him in bed.
My sweet honey,He was gone.
My sweet honey,His beautiful blue eyes were open but no light was left in there.
My sweet honey,I tried to save him.
My sweet honey,I did CPR until the paramedics arrived and they took over when they got there.... but he was gone.
My sweet honey,He had passed a few hours before.
My sweet honey,"Although he fought like hell, his body was just tired."
My sweet honey,My sweet Dave.
My sweet honey,I love you so very much.
My sweet honey,You are and will forever be my person.
My sweet honey,You made me so happy and although you are not here you will always be in my heart.
My sweet honey,Always.
My sweet honey,"I ordered your ring, exactly like you said you had wanted and will wear it around my neck until we meet again."
My sweet honey,I love you honey.
My sweet honey,AlwaysI'm sorry for your loss.
My sweet honey,Thanks for sharing your beautiful love story.
My sweet honey,My heart hurts for you.
My sweet honey,I’m so sorry you are going through this.
My sweet honey,"It sounds like you had a very full time  together, filled with so much love."
My sweet honey,I wish for you both that it could have been longer.
My sweet honey,Be good to yourself right now in the midst of all this grief.
My sweet honey,❤️ Thank you.
My sweet honey,He really will forever live in my heart.
My sweet honey,This subreddit helped me a lot.
My sweet honey,It was never easy being with someone who was so sick.... and at such a young age.
My sweet honey,He was only 34.
My sweet honey,But I’m so thankful I was able to spend the time I did with him.
My sweet honey,I'm so sorry for your loss.
My sweet honey,Sorry to hear that.
My sweet honey,Peace be to you.

"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","If his short term memory is poor you could try ""tricking"" him into thinking that he is about to do some of his old chores, prompting him to do them.For example, when he gets up for something you could prep his coat, put the lead on the dog, get your own coat on and say something like ""thanks for getting the dog ready while I got your coat."

"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","Try bowling, or tennis, or basketball, something where you only have to think about what is directly in front of you."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",Maybe go to a driving range?
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",No math and keeping score - just a basket of balls he can practice his stroke on.We do board games around the holidays and we had to do a complete overhaul away from strategy games to stuff he would enjoy.

"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",There was an immediate drop off in chores completed.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",Now there has been a radical escalation out of seemingly nowhere.

"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",Great!
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","But also, concerningly, he goes around shutting every door he can find, laundry get chucked in the machine without being sorted, dishes get put away in interesting places, and he will not stop turning off lights."

"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",He has always puttered and his thing has always been washing the dishes.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","Which is great, I have a dishwasher but what the heck, one less thing."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","He even dries them and puts them away.Except that I noticed that he doesn't actually use soap, or the sponge when he washes."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",Many times he'll barely run the dish under the water and then wipe dry.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",My dish towels are greasy and stained because he just wipes the frying pan instead of using soap.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","And he forgets where to put things away, so he just makes neat little piles of things on top of the stove."

"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","But I imagine the awareness that it's slowly slipping, or isn't quite all there, has to be debilitating.I love your descriptions of these activities."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",The potato made me laugh out loud.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","You've hit some of his favorites that I hadn't considered: driving range was on my list, but an overhaul of games and an exploration of hobbies would be awesome."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",He still has a lot of his book smarts so trivia is absolutely in.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","So are model kits from when he was younger, maybe Wii bowling.I think we're on the early half of the chore U, so for now we'll keep that small."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",Wishing the best for your guy (and your mail) over the holidays!
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","Thank you and you too!In what is surely unrelated news, I have noticed a drastic reduction in Christmas cards this year, so it seems my correspondence duties will be minimal."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",What an unexpected and pleasant surprise!

"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","He was a homebody before, but this has cut him off from a lot of his occasional outlets."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",Not being socially active is something I've worried about for years before the diagnosis.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",Your description speaks volumes.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","Unfortunately that dimension seems the least readily addressed--I'm not in touch with many of the people he used to know, and if I were I may not be the person to rekindle those relationships.I'll be thinking of your mom through this, wishing you luck."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",If you want to talk feel free to PM.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",It is possible to suffer from both depression and dementia.

"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","As others have said, it could be depression."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","It could be the short term memory loss interfering in his ability to make decisions to go and do things, then executing it."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",It could also be that being in a strange environment in terrifying.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","As my mother's disease has progressed, she grew more and more reluctant to leave the house."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","I finally realized that her ability to process and react to a ""new"" environment was failing - even if the ""new"" environment"" was somewhere she had been thousands of times before."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",This is a great point.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",I wouldn't be surprised if that played a role--the forgetting I think is a big hit on his confidence.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","He doesn't seem to be overtly afraid but the reluctance could come from a number of places, and he could be hiding the fear with indifference."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",I won't prod him on that and will try to leave that up to the doctor.

"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",Best of luck to you and your dad in this.

"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","I slowly realised what the problem was and have managed to take her to dinner at a restaurant occasionally, walks in the wheelchair ( she can walk but it’s more comfortable for her ) and short shopping trips to the malls and she really enjoys it."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",The most difficult part is convincing them that they will like it.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","For my gran, before a shower, I will get all her clothes laid out, the towel ready and I walk her through all the steps of getting herself out of her clothes, wrap herself in a towel and walking to the bathroom."
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",I will test the water temperature right before that so it’s at a comfortable range when it hits her skin.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?",She gives up easily at the moment so any discomfort will discourage her.
"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?","Before we go out for a meal or shopping, I try to get her when she’s in a good mood before even suggesting."

Got mom a Great Calls phone...,We’ve had to completely close my grandmother’s accounts and just this week we are looking at whether she’s compromised her account again.
Got mom a Great Calls phone...,Yeah..she gets over 60 calls a day.😐I did find a way to disable the emergency service button in settings.I will try to turn it back on once(if) she gets used to the device.
Got mom a Great Calls phone...,My mom literally called this on hers and somehow the number put her call through to 911.
Got mom a Great Calls phone...,Meanwhile—-she was at a rehab after coming out of the hospital so the police showed up at her apartment.
Got mom a Great Calls phone...,"The super called me asking what was happening and I told him to tell the police she was not there and was in rehab, and they were like “we have to answer the call; we have to go in”, so they crowbarred their way into her apartment with me on the phone and the super asking “who’s going to pay for this?” Why didnt the landlord go let them in?"
Got mom a Great Calls phone...,You’re right.
Got mom a Great Calls phone...,Just fixed that mistake.
Got mom a Great Calls phone...,Said landlord when I meant super.
Got mom a Great Calls phone...,I don’t think he has the keys.

"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System?","My grandma walked out the door, dragged her feet until bloody through rocks, then across the road and hugged a frightened neighbor."
"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System?",We all had to quarantine because of it.
"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System?","If he can't remember to tell you he's leaving, can he remember to socially distance and mask up when walking past a pedestrian?"
"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System?",Not a risk I'm willing to take.
"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System?",I had to get every door and window locked.

"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System?",Its just a matter of him forgetting to let us know he left for a walk.
"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System?","For example:  he will be in backyard, walk around a bit and then go to front yard and start walking around the neighborhood without letting us know."
"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System?","At some point it may be 24 hour care, locking doors, etc."

"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System?","As far as covid, yes, these days that's a concern."
"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System?",So we would either walk with him so we can make sure he is social distancing or remind him to just walk around backyard and keep an eye on him.

inpatient care housing coverage,inpatient care housing coverage Hello!
inpatient care housing coverage,"I'm not sure if this would really be the right forum to post this, so I apologize and mods please feel free to delete this if you find it inappropriate.I'm 20 and know almost nothing about insurance."
inpatient care housing coverage,"I've tried reading through insurance handbooks and coverage plans but are having a hard time understanding it, and I've also chatted with my aunt who was a nurse for 40-odd years and worked in hospices a lot and the things she tells me about insurance are things you can't find unless you find out through first-hand experience."
inpatient care housing coverage,"So, I figured I'd take to talking to real people.I'm gonna get wordy, as I'm not sure what details matter or not so please bare with me!The situation is that I have a sister (23), who is heavily disabled."
inpatient care housing coverage,"She cannot see, talk, or walk."
inpatient care housing coverage,She has brain damage from a viral infection contracted during childbirth from my mother's herpes.
inpatient care housing coverage,"I do not know all of her exact diagnoses, but I believe she has (on paper) cerebral palsy, and epilepsy."
inpatient care housing coverage,I'm sure more that I'm unaware of.
inpatient care housing coverage,"She is on one liquid medication taken twice daily for her seizures, I don't know the name of it."
inpatient care housing coverage,She also has a suppository on stand-by to be taken when she has her seizures.
inpatient care housing coverage,"Unsure if it matters, but her seizures aren't very frequent and usually happen while she's asleep (there's been maybe total 4 times where she's been awake that it's happened, and that's been during times she got overheated)."
inpatient care housing coverage,"She can't do much for herself, she uses diapers, is in a wheelchair, has to be picked up to be moved, and needs food prepared for her."
inpatient care housing coverage,"She can use a spoon and feed herself though.Currently, she resides in AL with my mother while I am in CO. My mother, without getting into detail, has progressively become less and less of a fit guardian for my sister, and since i moved out 3 years ago and are no longer there to pick up the slack I am looking into options."
inpatient care housing coverage,"I do not have the time or money to care for her myself, so I wanted to look into sueing for custody of her and then putting her into a home until I finish college, and have a good job to take proper care of her with an in-home nurse."
inpatient care housing coverage,"(which will be around 8-10 years, as I'm going into medicine)."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Though, I am open to avoiding the sueing and talking with my mother about other options and keeping my sister nearby her, and custody in the hands of my mother, as they are close, and it would just be easier on me."
inpatient care housing coverage,"The only way I can go a more cival route with my mother though is if I have everything worked out and squared away myself, and with the people I'd need to talk to before going to her, so, I'd still need to figure all this out myself.Inpatient care though, as I'm sure you're all aware, is horribly expensive."
inpatient care housing coverage,"And has a track record of being atrocious to patients, especially those who can't stand up for themselves like my sister."
inpatient care housing coverage,"My aunt told me that she needs 3 dianoses (unsure which, she didn't elaborate), and then approval to be taken in by a home where they will take her diability check (which is around $800, I believe), besides $30 that the family will get to cover general expenses for my sister.I basically wanted to just ask how true that is, if anyone here knows any more information about it, how to find a good home, any cheats to get better coverage, or better insurances for this type of situation that she would qualify for, and if there is a state that would be better for her."
inpatient care housing coverage,"She could stay in AL, CO, or OR (as I'm moving there for my masters)."
inpatient care housing coverage,Or just anything you think would be helpful or important to know.
inpatient care housing coverage,"I'm unsure if it matters, but I make around 11k/yr, usually around 18k/yr but with COVID I've been on unemployment this year."
inpatient care housing coverage,"My mother makes around 30k/yr I believe, and my sister is claimed as a dependent for her, however my mom has also been on/off jobless and homeless, so I'm unsure how accurate that is."
inpatient care housing coverage,"30k is honestly the highest point in what I predict she makes.I'm going to ask other forums that might be better for some other information in this post, so just answer what you're comfortable with."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Sorry it's a bit broad, and anything helps."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Honestly if you even just have a story of you dealing with a simular situation just so I feel less alone in it that'd be welcome too, haha.I strongly recommend you ask in /r/legaladvice you are traversing law, welfare and multiple state lines."
inpatient care housing coverage,I suspect the best answer will depend on how amenable to this change your mother is.
inpatient care housing coverage,While law and social work will be involved law might be more of a factor if she doesn’t agree.
inpatient care housing coverage,Good luck.
inpatient care housing coverage,You are a Saint.
inpatient care housing coverage,As a mother and somewhat young person I just want to say you are biting off too much.
inpatient care housing coverage,"I would never wish caregiving on anyone and frankly you are sacrificing your life... time, energy, and ability to spend what little you have left on anything other than your sister or school."
inpatient care housing coverage,You matter & you weren’t put on this world to be your sisters keeper.
inpatient care housing coverage,Thank you!
inpatient care housing coverage,When if it comes to having to sue her ill be sure to do that.
inpatient care housing coverage,"Im pretty new to reddit, so knowing forumns that are trusted is nice.You are very sweet, honestly the first time someones told me that and it felt genuine."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Sometimes i feel so awful for what i dont do for my sister, but hearing things like this really help me feel less bad and realize theres more options for me than working towards this one thing haha."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Thank you, really."
inpatient care housing coverage,I wish you the best.
inpatient care housing coverage,Wow.
inpatient care housing coverage,"Are you dead set on this course of action, or still in the research and development stage?"
inpatient care housing coverage,"What led you to this decision, when most would turn a blind eye if and when possible?"
inpatient care housing coverage,What a blessing to have a sister like you who is willing to spend what little resources she has on protecting a sibling who is not able to protect herself.
inpatient care housing coverage,"An angel among humans, you are.Don't answer if you're not comfortable, but on what basis would you sue for  custody?"
inpatient care housing coverage,How is your mom a less than sufficient guardian?
inpatient care housing coverage,"Sorry I'm all questions and no answers, just wanted to give my two cents and let you know you are heard Youre very sweet, thank you."
inpatient care housing coverage,I dont mind questions.
inpatient care housing coverage,"I am pretty dead set, but i dont want to do anything until I know I can keep her safe and continue to pay for everything she needs, not to mention know where I'm going to live as my education is going to require me to move to Oregon in about 4 years."
inpatient care housing coverage,"The basis i would sue for custody is if i had the resources, if my mother was 100% unwilling to compromise and/or isnt speaking to me anymore, and continues on the road shes going."
inpatient care housing coverage,"I think this has a pretty slim chance of happening, though."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Like i mentioned in my post if i had literally everything squared away and she wouldnt have to do anything, i think itd be fine."
inpatient care housing coverage,Even moreso if i could keep my sister in alabama.
inpatient care housing coverage,"My mother has had a lot of issues with substance abuse in the past, and its been getting steadily worse since she and her long term boyfriend split in 2016."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Shes coping the way she knows best, things havent been easy on her but shes not the nicest to her children."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Shes quick to being a bit violent when frustrated, not dangerously so but any amount i dont like."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Its fine when its me, not so much when its my sister, for obvious reasons."
inpatient care housing coverage,"I hear from my grandmother though that shes become a lot more gentle with my sister since i moved, which is good to hear."
inpatient care housing coverage,"However her living situation hasnt been consistent since the split up, we have bounced between homes and living with my grandmother on/off whenever we couldnt find anywhere else to go, and i worry about the day my mother cant figure something out and is actually homeless."
inpatient care housing coverage,"she also has a tendancy to neglect my sisters personal hygiene (bathing, brushing teeth, ect) a lot more, and now that shes working my sister can go upwards of 9ish hours without having her diaper changed (my moms now boyfriend cares for her, and is very sweet with her but my mother wont let him change her."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Worried about it being sexual, god knows why."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Hes not like that and my sisters in no position to consent nor be looked at in that light) Its moreso a case of will my mothers actions get her killed or jailed for an extended amount of time / get my sister taken from her in general, and can i avoid that before it happens because waiting till it does will be more difficult to fix."
inpatient care housing coverage,"I know though that my sister is in greater spirits since getting out of school / since i moved, and i dont think she really notices the neglect."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Doesnt make it right, but it does make the situation for me at least not need to be done asap."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Its a complicated situation im not happy with, but its the best i can do at the moment."
inpatient care housing coverage,"If i had my way id just buy my mom house and a personal nurse for my sister, then i wouldnt have to worry about what things my mom does in her free time affecting my sister while not having to split them up as im sure my sisters the last thing keeping her from going completely off the rails."
inpatient care housing coverage,"My mother loves her dearly, and isnt an awful person."
inpatient care housing coverage,"Shes just a bit difficult, and doesnt have the resources that would help both her and my sister."
inpatient care housing coverage,Also!
inpatient care housing coverage,"Id be her brother, not sister :-)"
Keeping track of the day,Keeping track of the day Hi.
Keeping track of the day,A family member of mine has early dementia and has a lot of trouble keeping track of the day.
Keeping track of the day,He’s still able to work and function but something that hinders this is he has trouble keeping track of the day.
Keeping track of the day,Every day we call him to make sure he knows to go to work and we have short arguments about the day.
Keeping track of the day,A calendar is too confusing to him.
Keeping track of the day,Even checking off the boxes is too big of a task.
Keeping track of the day,I’m thinking of developing an LED calendar that shows today’s date and doesn’t have any room for interpretation.
Keeping track of the day,He needs very simple instructions like:“Today’s date is Sunday November 29th.
Keeping track of the day,"You work at 11 AMIt is currently 9 AM”He should be able to press a button to see tomorrow as well, so he knows what time he has to wake up if he has to work."
Keeping track of the day,Thoughts?
Keeping track of the day,This may need to have two versions.
Keeping track of the day,One audible and one text.
Keeping track of the day,"He has trouble reading sometimes.I found with my mom, once her concept of time was gone, it only made her angry to remind her of it."
Keeping track of the day,"[deleted] I found with my mom, the more I could free up the need to make decisions, the more temporal ability she had available."
Keeping track of the day,My solution was eliminate multiple choices and make them 2 part.
Keeping track of the day,This gave her the freedom to choose without it becoming overwhelming.
Keeping track of the day,Hopefully this helps.
Keeping track of the day,"She had vascular dementia, concentrated in the prefrontal cortex."
Keeping track of the day,"He might be helped by a dementia day cycle clock or calendar day clock- available on amazon [deleted] We eventually got one for my dad who couldn't tell if it was 8am or 8pm, whether it was dark out or not."
Keeping track of the day,"He would go to bed at 6 pm and sleep 2 hours and see that it was 8, so he'd get up and try to eat breakfast."
Keeping track of the day,"The ""clock"" we got only said ""now it is Thursday morning"" or ""now it is Thursday afternoon"" etc and you can set it for however long you want it to say night or morning etc."
Keeping track of the day,It worked for a while.
Keeping track of the day,"It's funny how he wouldn't believe us when we said it was still nighttime, but he'd believe the clock."
Keeping track of the day,"We're slowly approaching that territory, too."
Keeping track of the day,Thanks for sharing your experience.
Keeping track of the day,You don't know how much it helps.
Keeping track of the day,We feel entirely alone in this and even others talking about their story and not offering advice helps immensely.
Keeping track of the day,"Smart devices like Amazon Echo (Alexa), Google Home, etc, can be set with Reminders like “Time to leave for work.” An internet or Amazon search of “dementia clock” gives variations of a picture frame clock that sits on a table or hangs on a wall, with a large display my mom with dementia can read (for now): MONDAY  Aftermoon  3:35 PM  November 30, 2020."

Tracking device Canada,Tracking device Canada I’m sorry if this has already been asked a bunch but I couldn’t find anything helpful.
Tracking device Canada,My grandmother now has severe dementia and often wanders off on her own to buy groceries and then gets lost.
Tracking device Canada,"I need some way of tracking her so if she does I can find her, for example a device that I can put in her purse or something."
Tracking device Canada,Do you guys have any advice?
Tracking device Canada,"I live in Ontario, Canada if that helps at all.Your local police department/Alzheimer’s society should have a program that comes with a GPS bracelet (in York Region it’s called Project Lifesaver through the York Regional Police)."
Tracking device Canada,It can be costly but worth it!
Tracking device Canada,"Check with a local search and rescue team, they might have sponsorship to set her up for free on Project Lifesaver."
Tracking device Canada,Tiles?
Tracking device Canada,Look on Amazon.
Tracking device Canada,"I’m getting my mom some for Christmas for her keys, wallet, phone, iPad."
Tracking device Canada,Also if she carries any devices around you can do find my friends and track her.
Tracking device Canada,You could put a tile on a bracket and ask her not to remove it.
Tracking device Canada,But I realize she might.
Tracking device Canada,I’ll look into it.
Tracking device Canada,Thanks!
Tracking device Canada,"Trackers like Tile, Chipolo, Cube, TrackR, etc, work while connected to a mobile phone or tablet."
Tracking device Canada,"I can track my mom’s car keys, but only if her phone is charged and Bluetooth connected."
Tracking device Canada,A person with dementia will eventually lose the ability to keep a charged phone with them.
Tracking device Canada,"Then you’ll need a GPS locator, which requires a monthly/yearly subscription."
Tracking device Canada,They can track continuously (typically more expensive) or set intervals every so many minutes.
Tracking device Canada,You’re still depending on the person with dementia to wear or carry it with them.
Tracking device Canada,"Even if the tracker is  in a purse, you’re counting on them to always remember their purse."
Tracking device Canada,Righto yeah at the moment she always has her purse with her and we are looking into getting some sort of care for her if things progress to worsen but just looking for something in the meantime.
Tracking device Canada,Thanks for the advice!

Caring for my mother with dementia.,He had a let’s give it a try and see attitude.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,This was a breath of fresh air and I started to get my hopes up again.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Two weeks later he left the practice and we couldn’t see him anymore.

Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Chain smoking a pack of cigarettes later, I realized I had created a false hope."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"When that hope was crushed, I just started to blame."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"After some deep soul searching, I remembered what I was taught growing up."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"My mother taught me, nothing is to be gained from anger but a battle fueled by rage."

Caring for my mother with dementia.,The second yearThe routine for this year stays about the same.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,As she losses the ability to communicate she becomes angry more often.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Around 5pm every night, she paces the house yelling and screaming for about an hour until she finally makes way to her room."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,The feeling of being totally helpless in this situation wears on you.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I tried everything possible to calm her down, my usual shenanigans or calm voice don’t work during these episodes."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,You just have to let it run it’s course and try your best to ignore it.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,If you get upset or try to stop it.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"She instantly shifts to complete sadness, full of tears."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,This very heart breaking to experience.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Being completely helpless is one of the worst feelings ever.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Work out gloves are the norm, she wears them everywhere."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,They seem to serve as a mental block.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,If she doesn’t have them she’ll obsessively look at her hands with confusion and sadness.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I assume her mind was trapped in a time where she was younger.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,The appearance of her hands seem foreign.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Simple stuff started to become too complicated for her to do on her own.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,The daily dress up was starting frustrate her.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Shirts are on inside out or half worn upside down.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"There was a morning where she came to me in tears saying, “this doesn’t go, this doesn’t go”."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,She couldn’t figure out what pants to wear.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I turned her sadness around by saying.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"“It’s ok mom, that’s just a stupid one,  we’ll go get a good one.”  Phrasing is simple now she understands, anything negative as “stupid” and anything positive as “a good one.” We hopped in the car and headed to the Mart of Walls."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I grabbed 10 pairs of soft sweat pants and 10 hooded sweatshirts in the smallest size they had.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Knowing small wasn’t going to be small enough, we went directly to the seamstress down the street."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,That lady was awesome!
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I paid a little extra, she had them sized perfectly and ready for pick up in a couple hours."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"When we got home, I cleaned out her closet and removed all the old clothes."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"My theory was, too many choices are causing confusion, she then gets very frustrated."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"The clothes she has now, all look the same and are the colors she likes."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"5 blue  hoodies, 5 purple ones and 10 pairs of grey pants."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Pants folded neatly in the dresser and tops hanging on the rack, purple on the left and blue on the right."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I had the nanny give her a bath and left her alone in her room.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"She came out 20 minutes later completely dressed, with a smile on her face, pointing at her clothes saying, “this is a good one.” This was a small victory."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Looking back on things, I should have done this the first day, it would have saved tons of stress."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"What I thought was fun daily dress up, keeping her mind occupied, was really just a game of confusion."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,That was the second year.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Wow.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"What a special experience, and a triumph for you for once to have been able to fix it, and cure what ailed her."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"You know, many people would have been too busy, distracted, self absorbed, tired, burnt out, lazy, too something to have even thought to do that -replace her entire wardrobe - let alone actually go through with it."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,That is absolutely amazing and so kind.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,She really raised you right It just seemed logical to me.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I'm here for part 3 if you still want to share Still working on it.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Hopefully here soon.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,The 3rd year.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"The dementia seemed to rapidly advance, cognitive function is almost completely gone."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,She has a hard time feeding herself and can no longer get dress on her own.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,She’s also extremely combative with everyone but me.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I ended up letting the nanny go, mom was getting very aggressive with her."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"She really doesn’t like other women, especially around me."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Days are filled with a roller coaster of emotions.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Mom will be sad, happy and very angry just seconds apart from each other."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,The angry spells usually lead to her storming out the front door and walking around the block.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"You have to let her go outside, if you try to stop her, she’ll stand at the front door screaming and pounding."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Letting her roam usually calms her down.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I usually follow behind, as to not be seen and let her find the way back home."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,She usually sticks to the same walking pattern we did daily in the first two years.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I watch to see if she’s  confused or scared, it’s easy to spot, her walking pattern will appear more erratic instead of purposeful."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"When spot this, I usually shout out a goofy comment to get her attention, something like, “I think the beach is the other way”."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Soon as she sees me, everything clams down and we walk back to the house with her holding my arm."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,This happens almost every day.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"She got out one morning while I was in the shower, I must have forgotten to pin lock the front door."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"The panic when I got out of the shower was real, she was gone and so was the dog."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Fortunately I passed out flyers explaining her condition a month before.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I received a call from the local PD as I was walking around the block looking for her.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I turned the corner as I got the call, the officers had her corralled at the end of the street."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"They were very polite, but seemed a bit confused by what she was saying."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Her jibber jabber at this time was a bit crazy, if you listened really close it almost seemed like she was trying to say something, it was just jibber jabber tho."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I had a family member watch her one evening and he had a nervous breakdown 3 days later.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,He saw Jesus in my basement that night and thought he understood exactly what she was saying.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"The jibber jabber was definitely enough to make a person crazy, if you listened to deeply."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"About a month later, I had a friend watch her for the weekend, she also ended up having a nervous breakdown."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"The combination of her emotional roller coaster and the jibber jabber, was enough to make a person crazy."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Looking back I have no idea, how I kept it together the whole time."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"After the great escape, I felt it was necessary to upgrade surveillance system in the house."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I put cameras inside main living areas, one in her room and a couple outside."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"The new system notified me when the cameras saw motion, and had a mobile app so I could look in when I was away."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,This was extremely helpful to have.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"With the new surveillance system working, I felt confident it was ok to take little breaks when she was in bed."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I could keep an eye on her from anywhere and get notified if she got up.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I would wait until she had her evening medication and was asleep.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,The Seroquel at night would completely knock her out for 4-6 hours.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I wouldn’t travel far, or for very long and made sure I could make it home in 15 min flat no matter what."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,This definitely limits what can or can’t do.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I found a regular spot close to the house, never drank more than two drinks, and was never gone for more than an hour."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Its a nice escape to have a place where you know everyone, and everyone knows you."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"And, was a very important component in maintaining my sanity."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"As time went on, I noticed how I was forgetting who she was before the dementia."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I think it started with, removing old pictures on the walls, and forms of digital media."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Eventually, it lead to me completely blocking out every past good memory of her."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I’m not sure exactly when it started, I just really noticed my disconnect in the 3 rd year."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,She had a manic episode and I didn’t feel anything when she started to cry.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I just remained calm and dealt with it as usual.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,This must have been my subconscious mind protecting itself.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"The pain of seeing her in this state and knowing who she once was, became too overwhelming."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I didn’t know until recently, that blocking out emotional attachments like this, would apply to every aspect of my life."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,This is definitely where everything started to become grey.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Her physical health was also starting to decline.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,One morning while giving her a bath she fainted.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"It was hard to wake her this morning, usually she’s alert by 6am."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,This time she had trouble walking bathroom.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I got her into the tub and keeping her awake was a challenge.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"After the bath, she couldn’t stand on her own."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I carried her to the bedroom and covered her with a blanket.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,It was time to take her to the ER.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I ran out to the car and got it warming up, leaving the passenger door open."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"After getting her dressed, I carried her over my shoulder wrapped in a blanket to the car."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,A call to the hospital on the drive and they got her in right away.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,They did a multitude of scans and blood work.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Turns out it was a UTI.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"The gave her an IV, some antibiotics and we were on our way the next day."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"This happened 1 more time this year, almost exactly the same way."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"It was in the middle of winter tho.It totally sucks, because she had no way of telling me she was in pain."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I remember feeling horrible, like I hadn’t done enough to prevent it or paid enough attention to subtle details."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,There’s nothing reasonable you can do to prevent the UTIs once you start using diapers.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I changed them frequently and always made sure she had enough fluids.At this point some people called me Stoic.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Looking back, I’m not sure if it’s was stoicism or not, I no longer had the ability to emphasize."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Fortunately, I had a good childhood and was given a solid moral compass."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,My strict moral code is definitely what kept me in the green when I could no longer empathize.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I drew hard lines within myself of what was and wasn’t ok, this was all based upon what I was taught growing up."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I owe mostly my mother for this, but also my father and grandparents too."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,They made sure I always knew right from wrong and through example taught me what kindness was.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,That was the 3rd year.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Wow, you have been through so much."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,What a brave person you are Thank you for sharing your story!
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Although my mother passed from a malignant brain tumor in March of this year, I can definitely relate."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"When you say, "" I find myself today, almost 7 years since her diagnosis, at a loss, unable to grasp who she was, or what she really meant to me."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I have become completely numb, totally incapable of love."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Not knowing how to feel things anymore.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I’m never particularly happy, never particularly sad."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Everything is just grey."""
Caring for my mother with dementia.,this is exactly what I am feeling now (covid isn't helping).
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"My mother was not in her ""right mind"" pretty much immediately after her diagnosis in January 2020 until she passed in March 2020."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,We didn't get to have a proper funeral and I haven't really mourned her yet.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Veteran's Day was her birthday and I think that was the first time I really cried.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I am having a hard time as the holidays are approaching though, and I know it will be hard."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Thank you for your thoughtful story.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"My mother also passed this year, in February."
Caring for my mother with dementia.,"I now care for two clients, one of whom has dementia and is slowly losing her language abilities."

Caring for my mother with dementia.,"Thank you OP, for reminding me to be compassionate and caring, to see her more as someone who could be my own mother."

Caring for my mother with dementia.,She was very lucky to have you.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,I literally have tears in my eyes.
Caring for my mother with dementia.,Thank you
Evaluate idea,Evaluate idea Hello everyone!Looking for some directly related opinion for something.
Evaluate idea,"The company I work for is pitching an app idea to help people that are suffering from Alzheimer's.We are pitching a memorization app - an app that can help people remember who they are by using their device’s data - photos, memories, messages or even music - either the family provides the music that the patient used to enjoy or maybe just the music that was very popular doing some important phases of his life."
Evaluate idea,"Just remind the person to take a short quiz, ask them basic stuff and correlate the data to watch for any progress, notify them from time to time to go through some of the quizes."
Evaluate idea,"We were thinking about splitting it into three phases - if the patient is at an earlier phase he gets notified to do them at himself, after the results are not as good, he can do it together with the family or nurse and in the end only someone else can do it for him.We are still at the phase of evaluating the idea but we would love to hear any feedback - would it be useful, would it feel too intrusive, is there something out there already that serves the same purpose, even furhter reading might be more than useful.Thank you and take care!Sounds too complicated."
Evaluate idea,My spouse can't handle much tech any more.
Evaluate idea,"So I get stuck with all the troubleshooting, reading fine-print manuals, etc."
Evaluate idea,"Even though I can do that work, I don't want to.How would your app improve upon a sympathetic and observant caregiver?"
Evaluate idea,"One issue I foresee is that my mom, even after years working in banking, stopped touching a computer when she reached the mid-stage."
Evaluate idea,She didn't even want one in the home.
Evaluate idea,She wouldn't touch a phone either.
Evaluate idea,"Google Home was far to foreign to her, even though the ease of just saying ""Hey, Google play X"" would have made it so easy for her to listen to music."
Evaluate idea,We ended up putting in an old-fashioned radio and she was much happier with that.
Evaluate idea,I'm wondering if the technology avoidance happens to a large number of people affected by the disease.
Evaluate idea,"We will try and make some inquiries to the alzheimer's association, check out if any of this makes sense .I don't know anyone with Alzheimer's personally but my father suffers from mental illness and during the stints he had in an institute he was heavily sedated and sometimes used to phone me asking me if I will be visiting him that day only minutes after getting home from the visit."
Evaluate idea,If an app can help you avoid such moments I think it's worth the try!
Evaluate idea,both my grandmas were never really into tech so  avoided it even more with alz.
Evaluate idea,"however, i worked for a retired business man in his late 80’s who loved doing the Magic Puzzle app on his ipad well into mid stages."
Evaluate idea,"My mum is the same, but I do wonder if that will change in the coming years."
Evaluate idea,"As the next generation ages, we’ll see more and more AD patients that have grown up with tablets and smartphones and I think they’ll be more accepting of the idea of an app."
Evaluate idea,Exactly our thoughts on this!
Evaluate idea,I really like the idea; my question is what is the app ultimately for?
Evaluate idea,"Is it to create an enjoyable experience for someone with AD, to reminisce about things they used to like?"
Evaluate idea,Is it something to improve their memory and brain function by testing them to remember things from their past?
Evaluate idea,Is it a tracker of a patient’s cognitive abilities so that loved ones can see how much they’re remembering on a week by week basis?
Evaluate idea,"From your post it seems like it could be any or all of those things, but I think the way the app would work could be very different for all of them."
Evaluate idea,"The idea is not fully fleshed out, at this stage it's just a proposal."
Evaluate idea,We're trying to figure out if the app can actually help with the memory and brain function so we're trying to gather more information on how/if it might help with the patient's memory My opinion costs money.
Evaluate idea,"You don't get advice for a for profit company for free That's fine, it makes sense."
Evaluate idea,Thanks anyway
Evluate idea,Evluate idea Hello everyone!Looking for some directly related opinion for something.
Evluate idea,The company I work for is pitching an app idea to help people that are suffering from Alzheimer's.
Evluate idea,"We are pitching a memorization app - an app that can help people remember who they are by using their device’s data - photos, memories, messages or even music - either the family provides the music that the patient used to enjoy or maybe just the music that was very popular doing some important phases of his life."

Evluate idea,"Thank you and take care!Maybe I have misunderstood your intention, but my experience with my mother with dementia is that she absolutely hates being asked questions that she knows she should know but cannot remember."
Evluate idea,This is a sure way to put her in a state of high anxiety.
Evluate idea,So would not recommend any quiz relating to personal details that may have been forgotten.
Evluate idea,"I would consider not making it like a quiz, but simply an easy to use app for someone with dementia to experience memorable photos, videos, messages, and music."
Evluate idea,Family members and approved friends can add to the data.
Evluate idea,Notifications of new memories and specified times to open the app could be used.
Evluate idea,My nonprofit currently has users load photos with descriptions onto our web apps.
Evluate idea,We then create Memory Books or Cards and send to their loved one with dementia free of charge.
Evluate idea,Your idea is  certainly an excellent expansion of that idea.
Grandfather wanders off frequently.,Grandfather wanders off frequently.
Grandfather wanders off frequently.,Hello everyone.
Grandfather wanders off frequently.,"My grandpa was recently diagnosed with dementia and every chance he gets, he sneaks out of the house and we are having a very hard time constantly going out to search for him."

I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"I have a swing set, and I had tried to  avoid it, but I couldn't slow down or move away in time."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"I had hit my side of my head on the metal bar ladder on my swing set, but I think my bike, and/or my hands helped not make the accident as painful.I didn't really think much of it, due to the accident not really being painful, but I think after the accident, after 2 weeks, I had started getting cognitive impairment, my memory loss was almost instant, but my typing and speech were declining slowly."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"My memory is getting slightly better, but my sleep schedule has been gone off track(I can easily sleep in the day, than at night in some days)."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"Time still feels slow and warped to me(the past is sometimes closer to the present than I realize, or further away), and I still have trouble with typing and speech, but it might be slowly getting better.My doctors and family weren't really useful, and I had to rely on the internet to know what the problem is, and I'm sorry if I annoyed you in any form.Listen-go see about your head injury."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,Your lucid dreaming posts and dementia posts all started around the time you say you had your injury.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"Before that, there are several posts along the lines of computer simulations and games."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,All of this put together suggests (to me) that you seem to have an obsessive type of personality to begin with.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"It's a good thing that you got a bike for your birthday so that you can spend more time outside, in reality."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"If you don't, this is a recipe for a future mental disorder that can become irreversible."

I think I found the reason for my dementia.,Research can be procrastination in disguise... go see a doctor Time is my biggest enemy right now.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"I would try and go to the doctor ASAP, but the appointments are always once a week, and I have no control on when to go to the doctors."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,I believe you could be on the right track with this.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,The way to get that behavior under control is to go on facts.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,You don't know all of the facts yet.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"The doctor will help you learn the facts, but you MUST provide the doc with the right information---only the facts."

I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"I'm kind of bad at finding the right words for some sentences, leading to mistakes like these.Some symptoms seem to just get worse on some days, location, or it could be worse depending on the time of day, so it's hard to tell if it's worse or better.I'm hoping it does show actual, clear signs of it getting better."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"[deleted] Here's my experiences with my doctors.My first doctor that I talked to, when I was talking about my possible b12 deficiency, and cognitive problems, he instantly said I didn't have it, without doing any forms of tests."

I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"Even with all these food, my stomach is like a blackhole, and I can consume food after food, and I would never get very fat.For school, it's quite easy, I'm failing a class because of the teacher's lack of knowing about technology, and my memory problems keeps causing me to forget about PE(I have to do it online), and how my teacher wants me to do attendance online during home school."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"I don't really try, I usually procrastinate, and I still do really well.My sleep, before, was always at 12:00 PM to 1:00 AM."

I think I found the reason for my dementia.,I have wondered about that since young people don’t often use a clock with hands.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"My daughter is in her early 20s and working on her PhD, yet I tease her about not knowing how to tell time."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,I can only imagine what she would do if she was told to draw the clock.

I think I found the reason for my dementia.,I was confused on the 11 after 30 part.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,Is it head trauma?
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,I had a concussion about 4 years ago.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,It wasn’t necessarily a bad one and my doctors weren’t concerned.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"At first I didn’t notice, but I began having trouble thinking."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,Things that I could previously quickly recall or grasp would take a concerted effort and far more time than I was used to taking.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,I would have to stop and think through a process to figure things out instead of it just happening automatically.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,This lasted about a year before clearing up enough that I stopped noticing.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"It was quite noticeable to my coworkers even, so I started telling people I was recovering from a concussion so they would think I was dumb."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"I hate to jump to conclusions, but I think this is what you are experiencing, except you are becoming obsessive about it and looking for explanations that are far worse than recovering from a concussion."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"As I was dealing with my concussion, I kept thinking about all the kids who get concussions through sports and how they have to go to school and learn new things each and every day."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"It must be frustrating and exhausting, but it will get better."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,I agree with you about concussion.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"The symptoms after 2 weeks appeared, and no matter how much I sleep, it doesn't go away, and it's been 3 months, so I believe it could be a concussion.Wouldn't concussion be a form of dementia if it affected your cognitive skills?"
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"No, a concussion wouldn’t be considered dementia because a concussion won’t continue to make your cognitive skills decrease."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,Dementia will continue until you can’t do anything.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,A concussion is going to temporarily impair your function.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,Dementia is so much more and so much worse than what you are experiencing because it gets worse over time and makes it so you cannot take care of yourself or function out in the world.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,My husband doesn’t even qualify as having dementia yet because it’s not bad enough yet.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"However, his condition will continue to decline so much that it will kill him."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,A concussion does not do that unless you’ve had so many or one severe enough that it leads to dementia (like what is seen with pro football players or soldiers who get bombed).
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,What about this post here?https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jqpaqu/dementia_can_be_caused_by_head_injury_and_isnt/ There is a big difference between a concussion and a traumatic brain injury.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"You’ve been seen by more than one doctor, if I’m remembering correctly."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"If you had a traumatic brain injury, they would have noticed."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,You wouldn’t have been able to pass that cognitive test for one thing.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"And even if you had barely passed it, you’d be making all sorts of excuses for why it was harder than one would think to try to explain your confusion about the test."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"Instead, you acted insulted that they gave you such a simple test."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,My previously intelligent husband thought he did well on the test but also was very defensive about how poorly the test was explained and designed.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,It was neither.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,He just couldn’t do it all well.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"My doctors don't seem to know a lot about the brain, doing very little tests and not saying what I could have, so I'm just very confused, but thanks for clearing it up more."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,[deleted] There is a huge difference in a combat vet getting dementia from something mine an IED and someone getting it from a hit to the head that didn’t even hurt.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,I realize this is a personal mission of yours to spread info about dementia from sudden brain trauma.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,I value that.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,Please be careful about who you could be affecting when you are on your soapbox though.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"It kind of did hurt, it was like a headache on the left side of my head that lasted for more than 10 minutes, it wasn't incredibly painful, but it was noticeable.I have a really high pain tolerance/threshold."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,so maybe it was the reason why it didn't hurt as much.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,[deleted] I did read it.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,You should go read his post history to get a better understanding of him and his intelligence.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,He’s smart.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,I cannot believe he has a cognitive impairment like dementia.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"[deleted] Look, this is a kid who is obsessing about all sorts of strange medical possibilities including dementia."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,He has been to see doctors.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,They say he doesn’t have dementia.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,I’ve checked out his post history.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,He says he when he hit his head it didn’t hurt.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,I would think if it were enough to cause dementia it would have hurt like a mutha.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,He became an atheist just because he listened to an album of songs about memory loss and Alzheimer’s.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"I’m an atheist, so I’m not judging that, but hearing that he no longer believes in god because he listened to an album about memory loss is further evidence of possible obsessive behavior."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,Other obsessions he has are with synesthesia (thinks he is blind to sound) and dreams.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,He also has a history of depression.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"Bottom line, you are not doing him any favors telling him he could have dementia from hitting his head when he said it didn’t even hurt when he hit it."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"I think I underestimate/overestimate everything, I did feel pain when I hit the bars, I even got a headache on the side of my head, but I wasn't really concerned about it."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,Are you hoping it's some type of dementia?
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,It seems like you are arguing in hopes that someone will agree with you that it's what you have.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"I'm just so confused on what's happening to me, it could be why I keep on going on different tangents, and mixing everything up."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"Also, almost every single thing I look up keeps bringing me back to dementia or relates to dementia is also confusing me."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,Half of the post on this sub are hypochondriacs self diagnosing dementia... Gets really annoying.
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"My doctors never diagnosed me with being a hypochondriac, even from earlier in life."
I think I found the reason for my dementia.,"I could be me being a cyberchondria, due to me always researching every single thing I have."

"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",This would not be a surprise.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",My father has stopped and started medications randomly as well as created scenarios around why he started/stopped the meds in the past.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","I went to him and told him that the refill may have been delayed due to a possible drug interaction, and that I would ask the pharmacist tomorrow."
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",This led to a long conversation where he asserted that he had already been taking this medication for 30 days and that it wouldn't make sense for the pharmacy to take issue now.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",I disagreed.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","I said that I was here 30 days ago, and that he did not have that medication in his medication bag."

"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",He said he must have thrown it away.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","I abruptly ended the conversation, as I felt like I was falling into the ""reasoning"" trap that caregivers are told to avoid so that the patient doesn't get agitated.I thought about it alone some more, and suddenly remembered that I DID see the new medication 30 days ago."
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","I had asked him about it then, and he told me who refilled it."
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","His story didn't line up in a few ways, so I checked the refill date and it was indeed recent."

"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",I weighed telling him.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","I need him to trust me, so I felt it really important to be honest."
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",But I also worried that this would make him more adamant about being correct when he truly does mess up his meds.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","The need for him to trust me won out, and I went to him and told him that I was mistaken, and that I do remember seeing the medication in his bag.He gave me a sort of sly smile that I have never seen before."

"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","I take those right."""
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",That stopped me in my tracks.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",Crap.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",He doesn't take his medications right.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","He takes the wrongs one/takes them improperly quite a bit, AND his mixing up of medications was the chief concern of his doctors when he was discharged from the hospital."
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",It was the reason why they said he needed a caretaker in the first place.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","I know caregivers make mistakes, but I think this one was particularly disastrous."

"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","(He has, and it scared me."
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",)I feel guilty and like I do not know what I am doing.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",I have probably just destroyed my chance at him cooperating with me regarding his medications long terms.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","It was so hard to even get him to stick to a medication schedule, use his pill box, and not take whichever meds he feels like.Sorry for the length."
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",I just feel so disappointed in myself and worried about how this will impact the future.

"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",You are being so hard on yourself.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","Whether or not telling him was a mistake, you did what you did out of concern for him."
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","You have nothing to feel guilty for because you have done nothing malicious, unthinking, etc."
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","Also, depending on how far his dementia has progressed, he may not even remember this interaction."
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",You are in a horrible situation and you are going above and beyond.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.","Be kinder to you.I don’t know if this could help, but I believe there are pill dispensers that only open various sections at specific times."
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",Maybe tied to an app?
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",Could getting something like that prevent him from picking and choosing his pills?
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",I feel your pain.

"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",He was a very strong-willed man who didn't want to admit that anything was wrong with him.
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.",He ended up blaming the doctors because the medication was never perfect.I'd recommend asking your pharmacist if they do custom medication management packaging.

Aging father,Aging father I live with my mother who is 65 and my father who is 74.
Aging father,"I’m 25 (turning 26) who graduated college and started working in a lab which involves and hour commute, while also trying to finish my last 4 credit class to enter a physician assistant program."
Aging father,"My father is noticeably declining, getting increasingly more lonely because me and my mom are always working."
Aging father,"My dad is left to his own devices during the day, which concerns me and my mom sometimes because he will forget where he put his keys or leave the stove on and go outside."
Aging father,We feel helpless because we need to work to support the three of us.
Aging father,"We do not think he has seen any of his doctors(besides his cardiologist, maybe) since covid started."
Aging father,"My mother tells me he is experiencing incontinence, and I’ve notice his lack of underwear going through the wash."
Aging father,I also noticed he is forgoing some other personal hygiene habits which makes me think someone needs to keep a closer eye on him.
Aging father,He attends to school board meetings at the local high school (no via zoom) and writes emails that half make any sense and are  disjointed.
Aging father,The house isn’t clean and whenever we touch surfaces they’re sticky.
Aging father,I’m thinking that even though this lab job gives security I should go back to my job that paid less but the drive was 15 mins instead of an hour.
Aging father,"I’m hoping to get into a program to care for both of them, or be able to hire a caregiver when I’m at work."
Aging father,My mom tells me that she doesn’t want me to be trapped taking care of them but I want them worry less about life overall.
Aging father,I feel like if I give up this lab job and I don’t make it into PA school I risk losing out on being able to support them but lose the time with them because of the drive.
Aging father,Lab= potential of 30$/hr(salary) currently $18 & benefits .
Aging father,Schedule is flexible 12-8.
Aging father,"(1hr commute) MMJ Product specialist= $15/hr, no benefits but retirement plan."
Aging father,(15 min commute) I was hoping to be offered a spot in a program so my friend who wants to work in a lab (who has a medical condition that hinders her capability to walk) could take my place.
Aging father,"Does anyone have any advice that could be helpful, I feel like I need to just buck up and clean and cook more but this class and full time job has really taken it’s toll."
Aging father,I only see my bf once a week which is my only time I feel like I get a break from my parents.
Aging father,"Too add to everything mention above, I lose my insurance in a month, happy 26th birthday to me.I take care of my elderly parents, I know how confusing and difficult it is."
Aging father,"But if your mother is only 65 and still working, she is fully capable of making the choices to care for her husband."
Aging father,"It's great you're concerned and keeping an eye out for him, but it's not your responsibility to do your mothers work of she is able."
Aging father,"If you really want to help, provide resources or support for your mother so that she can get help for him."
Aging father,Convince her to hire in-home care and so on.
Aging father,Maybe point out things that are happening with your father that she's not aware of and other such similar ways to help .There are ways to be helpful and supportive without taking on the actual work yourself.
Aging father,"Trust me, things with them are going to get far worse as they get older."
Aging father,Save your energy and enthusiasm for when things get really bad and even your mother can't be helpful.
Aging father,"It's also likely that at this point, he or both of them might not be accepting of changes or ""help"" and will be very resistant."
Aging father,It's also good your eyes are open to this kind of thing right now so you can prepare yourself for the future.
Aging father,"Talk to other people that have been through it, find some good online forums for research or support and know that there are no easy answers for any of this."
Aging father,Thank you this was really helpful.
Aging father,I’m trying to get to a point where I can take care of them by being able to offer resources.
Aging father,Is there any kind of elderly day care available?
Aging father,Sounds like this would be a solution for you.
Aging father,"By the way, when I lost my job (and therefore insurance) this past summer, I applied through healthcare.gov."
Aging father,I got a decent insurance plan at very little cost that will carry me over until I get a job that will come with insurance.
Aging father,Open enrollment starts November 1st but I think you can apply anytime.
Aging father,I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:healthcare.govI did the honors for you.^delete ^| ^information ^| ^<3

"Struggling as a caregiver, you're not alone","You don't know what kind of danger she puts herself in when you're not around, and you can't follow her everywhere like a puppy."
"Struggling as a caregiver, you're not alone",But it seems to me like that would be difficult to negotiate with your sis and Mum.But it would also provide you with some memories.
"Struggling as a caregiver, you're not alone","Thanks, yeh, sister doesn't tolerate cameras."
"Struggling as a caregiver, you're not alone","At least I've made the home & property safer, removed sharp gardening & other tools, mats & sharp-edged furniture, take the dials off the stove when I'm not there, etc.."
"Struggling as a caregiver, you're not alone",It's a bit like making a place toddler-safe.
"Struggling as a caregiver, you're not alone",I'm usually around anyways.
"Struggling as a caregiver, you're not alone","We take photies / selfies out, I print them out & make collages, go colour photocopy them A3 size, to put on the wall or fridge our adventures..."
Anti-choking devices,"Anti-choking devices My grandmother (late 90’s with Alzheimer’s) is showing signs of dysphasia- putting too much in her mouth, pocketing food or chewing it way to long without swallowing."
Anti-choking devices,She has had a few episodes where she nearly choked on food even with me closely monitoring her eating.
Anti-choking devices,"I sweep her mouth and clap her back and she has been able to cough enough to clear it, but that’s just lucky."
Anti-choking devices,Has anyone bought or used an anti-choking device?
Anti-choking devices,I’m looking at these two as an emergency option.
Anti-choking devices,"I would try the Heimlich if all else fails, but at her age and size (she’s like 4’6”) I also worry about injuries from that itself if I can even perform it correctly."
Anti-choking devices,LifevacDechokerIs she open to a swallowing test or feeding tube?
Anti-choking devices,"I'm a caregiver to someone with a feeding tube now and these devices were never options that came up when she was having trouble swallowing, which included two Heimlich maneuvers.Edited: she may not be able to do a swallow test with dementia because you need to follow instructions."
Anti-choking devices,"Before a feeding tube, you may also try PT exercises to make swallowing easier, changing her diet to pureed food or thickened liquids, changing liquids to honey or nectar-thickened liquids, and assessing which foods cause choking (it can be non-obvious ones - my patient needed the Heimlich for rice and muffin crumbs)."
Anti-choking devices,Same here!
Anti-choking devices,No one ever mentioned these products to us either.
Anti-choking devices,However it seemed the jump to NPO happened so rapidly for my mom.
Anti-choking devices,Something I was thinking about was how my mom never was counseled on the fact she will never be able to eat again.
Anti-choking devices,It took a huge psychological toll so find it interesting to hear how other patients handled not being able to eat anymore.
Anti-choking devices,Thanks for your reply and the suggestion for PT exercises!
Anti-choking devices,I had forgotten about that.
Anti-choking devices,"I will have to find out about the swallow test, so we will know when a feeding tube might be appropriate."
Anti-choking devices,"For now, she physically can swallow, but at times she seems to forget to do it or how."
Anti-choking devices,She still enjoys certain foods so I hate to take that away too soon.
Anti-choking devices,"I’ve switched to very soft only, allow one bite at a time and verify myself that it’s swallowed, so meals are taking 2-3 hrs now 😫 will probably start replacing more foods with  puréed."
Anti-choking devices,"If a feeding tube is an option for her medically, I wish we had done ours earlier."
Anti-choking devices,"It doesn’t have to be all or nothing - she could get 90% of her food and fluids through the feeding tube and still eat 10% for pleasure, which will be great for you as the caregiver."
Anti-choking devices,I remember the very long meals… Thank you for that info.
Anti-choking devices,Sometimes I use protein shakes or smoothies as a meal replacement when I really need the break.
Anti-choking devices,Dechoker is very good.
Anti-choking devices,Good to know!
Anti-choking devices,Have you had to use it for a rescue?
Anti-choking devices,Does the patient have to be able to do anything while it is being used?
Anti-choking devices,No!
Anti-choking devices,"IMO its best to use from behind, bc if they are choking they are panicking and may not understand that you are helping them."
Anti-choking devices,Using your breast bone as a support for their head while you get a suction around their mouth is super helpful.
Anti-choking devices,Thank you so much!
Anti-choking devices,"I hope I never need it, but I feel better having more options available."
Anti-choking devices,Don't be afraid to keep multiple of whatever choice you decide to go with!
Anti-choking devices,Wow what great devices!
Anti-choking devices,I didn’t even know they existed!
Anti-choking devices,Wish I had known about this sooner.
Anti-choking devices,Sadly my mom (PD) who also had dysphasia is on a feeding tube now.
Anti-choking devices,I’m sorry to hear about your mom.
Anti-choking devices,I dread my grandmother getting one if it becomes necessary.
Anti-choking devices,She’s a fidgeter and I just know she’ll not understand what it is and pull it out every chance she gets.
Anti-choking devices,Oh gosh that’s so tough.
Anti-choking devices,I know that has to be so stressful.
Anti-choking devices,I hope you can gain some insight on  if these products can help your dear grandmother.
Anti-choking devices,They sound promising.
Anti-choking devices,Thank you!
Anti-choking devices,Thickit helps.
Anti-choking devices,"Thank you, I'll keep that in mind."
Anti-choking devices,It makes it harder to aspirate.
Anti-choking devices,I like to use jello.
Anti-choking devices,"it has sugar, which they like, lots of water, is fun, familiar and comes in colors."
Anti-choking devices,Sending more love I was thinking I should start buying puddings and jello.
Anti-choking devices,Thank you ❤️ And applesauce!
Anti-choking devices,Sometimes I add emergenC to jello to increase electrolytes.
Anti-choking devices,And love Ahh good idea!
Anti-choking devices,"Rather than use a tool to fix choking after the fact, I would look into getting your grandmother evaluated by a speech therapist."
Anti-choking devices,Speech therapists work closely with swallowing disorders.
Anti-choking devices,It may be that your grandma requires a specific food texture to avoid aspirating.
Anti-choking devices,Thickened liquids can be beneficial to help avoid aspirating on beverages and pureed food or mechanical soft diets are also options for those with dysphagia.
Anti-choking devices,A speech therapist would be able to evaluate your grandmother and tell you which diet is best.
Anti-choking devices,Altering her diet will prevent choking and make mealtimes much safer.
Anti-choking devices,(I am an occupational therapy student so please let me know if you have any other questions).
Anti-choking devices,Thank you!
Anti-choking devices,I do plan on checking in with her doctor and doing the evaluation.
Anti-choking devices,How do they actually determine a physical issue vs cognitive impairment?
Anti-choking devices,"From my experience working with a speech therapist in a nursing home, it's a combination of evaluation techniques."
Anti-choking devices,They will probably give her a few different liquids and watch her swallow them and feel her throat to see how she is clearing the food.
Anti-choking devices,"In addition, they might conduct some type of cognitive assessment as well, such as the MOCA, to determine if any cognitive impairments are present."
Anti-choking devices,The combination of both of these will help a speech therapist see where the underlying issue is.
Anti-choking devices,"As others have mentioned, there definitely is the swallowing test with an ultrasound that can be utilized."
Anti-choking devices,My dad got this when he was admitted to the hospital with aspiration pneumonia and that was how his swallowing difficulties were diagnosed.
Anti-choking devices,"I think they only did that because he had pneumonia, though."
Anti-choking devices,Hope that makes sense!
Anti-choking devices,Yes that’s super helpful.
Anti-choking devices,Thank you 😊
Damn you Apple!,Damn you Apple!
Damn you Apple!,I wish Apple would let caregivers install a senior package for an iPad that allowed caregivers to operate their care receiver devices remotely.
Damn you Apple!,"My mom uses her iPad for a few puzzle apps, Netflix, email, texting and occasionally answering Face-Time if she is having a good day and can figure out how to answer."
Damn you Apple!,I wouldn’t care if I had to travel to an authorized Apple store to verify with my POA that remote access is for my mom’s devices.
Damn you Apple!,"But I’m sick of the two-factor authenticator and other update bullshit that skyrockets her anxiety and it never fails, it happens after the regular assisted living staff have left for the evening."
Damn you Apple!,Yes I have auto updates enabled which works consistently for apps but not software updates.SNL was spot on with their Amazon Echo Silver skit!
Damn you Apple!,Rant over!Agree!!!!!
Damn you Apple!,I also want an iOS-Senior.
Damn you Apple!,‘Dumb’ down the apps.
Damn you Apple!,Streamline choices.
Damn you Apple!,They can do this!!
Damn you Apple!,One of the Residents at the nursing home where I work has a PC laptop that sits on her desk.
Damn you Apple!,Her grandson has remote access to it.
Damn you Apple!,"Total game changer, especially during COVID where visits are limited."
Damn you Apple!,Would love this to be a reality for more people.
Damn you Apple!,"Yeah, remote access to my mom's desktop is fantastic."
Damn you Apple!,I’m using Splashtop and it’s been invaluable.
Damn you Apple!,"No matter how vague her explanation of what she’s seeing or having trouble with, I can just see it myself and fix it."
Damn you Apple!,If only I could do the same with her phone.
Damn you Apple!,"People say iOS is easy and intuitive, but my mom very easily gets stuck."
Damn you Apple!,I completely relate.
Damn you Apple!,My mother was very disappointed to discover that I do not have remote access to her phone.
Damn you Apple!,[deleted] This would be awesome!
Damn you Apple!,"No one could reach my mom for several days, because she had turned her phone to vibrate and no matter what I told her to do to fix it, by the time we finished our call, she forgot."
Damn you Apple!,I was finally able to tell one of the aids to do it for her.
Damn you Apple!,"Meanwhile, her VM is completely full and she has no clue how to listen to them or clear them out."
Damn you Apple!,"Fortunately she learned to use Siri at some point and no matter what, she seems to be able to remember to use it to call me and my brother."
Damn you Apple!,I’ve had to buy (and learn how to use) and Android for just this purpose.
Damn you Apple!,"Now my grandmother has an auto-answering Skype device, so I can chat with her via video."
Damn you Apple!,Confused about the updates part.
Damn you Apple!,Can’t you just turn off auto updates?I feel you tho.
Damn you Apple!,I so wish my dad used android phones but he can’t handle the change.
Damn you Apple!,"I can’t go into her living facility and perform the iOS or app updates (still restricting visits in apartments) and when she sees the red circle notifications for an update she won’t stop texting or calling about the phone until those notifications disappear.- it says it needs an update, did she break it, will she break it, why does this happen, “they” are trying to drive her crazy, can she still use it, did I know the phone needed an update, why can’t this just be updated without her having to do it, will it stop working...Repeat these questions, or add others, in no particular order at least three more times over the next few hours during a work day and that is your answer to why I have it set to automatic updates."
Damn you Apple!,:)I even put together a few pages of step-by-step instructions for how to update using screenshots (in a three-ring binder for easy access) but with her dementia I think she had a hard time recognizing what she is seeing.
Damn you Apple!,"I first noticed that, pre-pandemic, at the grocery store when she couldn’t identify a product she was looking for and it was literally right there in front of her on the shelf."
Damn you Apple!,"I think with teamviewer either teamviewer support or just teamviewer can’t remember, you can see her screen in real time even if you can’t control it."
Damn you Apple!,Could you tell her what to do that way?
Damn you Apple!,It’s still painful I’m sure but better than nothing.Maybe there’s a simple UI for Android that matches the iPhone?
Damn you Apple!,I haven’t looked for that tho.
Damn you Apple!,Maybe.
Damn you Apple!,Thanks for the suggestion!
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury My dad (69) fell and broke his leg a couple months ago.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,And during recovery his cognitive abilities have taken a sharp decline.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,"At first we thought it was the pain meds, but now he is off of them and he is still having a lot of confusion.He has a hard time learning the exercises he needs to do."
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,"And also struggles a lot with expressing himself, keeping track of time, telling people what happened to his leg, knowing the plan for the day, and so on."
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,At night he even has forgotten my name several times.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,"And will get really vague complaints like “my shoes aren’t right” but he says he isn’t in any pain or discomfort.Keeping him entertained is tough cause he’ll get frustrated that he can’t do something or can’t keep up with a show and want to do something else, but can’t think of anything to suggest.One really weird thing is that my mom got him to do a puzzle, but he just mashes the pieces together fitting them any which way until he gets bored."
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,"He seems to like it though, so we let him do it.We end up watching him most of the day cause we are worried he’ll forget and try to do something dangerous.I’m staying with him as a caregiver while my mom is out of town and it is just heartbreaking."
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,"We are all hoping he will regain some once he is walking again, but he is just struggling so much."
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,"And I think when he sees it getting to me it makes him more confused and starts blaming himself.I’m open to advice, but mostly just wanted to get this out there and share.One simple but overlooked thing to check would be if he has a UTI."
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,"When people get new mobility issues they sometimes dehydrate themselves because bathroom breaks are a hassle, and UTIs in older people sometimes have seemingly unrelated cognitive issues that aren’t often attributed to that."
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Worth checking before the doctors escalate it to more serious long term issues.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Good luck!
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Came here to say this!
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Came to say it too!
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,When I finally got my mom back to the hospital & couldn't stay with her due to COVID19.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,The doctor called & asked how long she'd had such severe dementia!
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,She had never been diagnosed with it!
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,In fact 6 months ago was living independently & driving!
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,UTI's at that age really do a number on them.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,"Hopefully once treated is completed, he will recover back to his normal self!"
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,"[deleted] Have you heard of Jelly Drops?I don’t have any personal experience yet, but it seems like a brilliant idea, and a great way to keep someone hydrated."
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Have you taken him to see a doctor?
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,"It could be an infection, a stroke or a myriad of other things."
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Start with a full medical workup.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,All I know is that falls often proceed cognitive decline (when the caregiver looks back on the pattern.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,").And also that injuries lead to inflammation, and systemic inflammation could affect his brain."
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Falls for the elderly are usually the beginning of the end.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Not trying to be unkind here so please do not misunderstand.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,As to why this is (an internal rhythm winding down?)
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,but it is so hard to deal with!
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,"Rehab is a chore in younger years, but imagine being older and all the issues that come with it.God bless you and your pops."
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,He is lucky to have you.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,What precipitated the fall?
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,The above comment to pursue a full medical work up is a good one.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Not to be alarmist but maybe a brain injury when he fell?
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,My mom has a subdue also hematoma and it really affected her.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,She already had dementia and apparently there’s a lot of empty area in the skull and stretched veins and older people’s brains can get knocked around easily even with a small hit.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Or maybe he is just in pain and cranky.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Or a UTI.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,But if it’s a big behavioral change it may be neurological.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,A neurologist and a CT scan would be able to tell.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,"If they have ANY assets, talk to a local elder care attorney."
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Local government should be able to find one.
Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury,Try the Bar association.

Medication Devices,Medication Devices Does anyone use automated pill reminders?
Medication Devices,I’ve see a bunch out there but I wasn’t sure how well they work.
Medication Devices,I’m considering something that’s a bit more secure because my dad has been taking more than his normal amount and I’m worried it’s going to continue.I used this one for my husband.
Medication Devices,It has a clear lid so you can see when they have missed a pill time.
Medication Devices,It rotates so you can set up a week or two depending on how often it’s set for.
Medication Devices,It doesn’t ensure they take the pills but it will beep until it’s turned over letting the pills fall out.
Medication Devices,I gave him a special bowl to dump the pills in and put bottled water on the counter next to it to make sure he had no reason to leave of get distracted.
Medication Devices,I even used it when his dementia progressed beyond the point of being able to medicate himself to make sure I remembered to give him meds at the proper times.
Medication Devices,"LiveFine Automatic Pill Dispenser, 28-Day Electronic Medication Organizer with Alarm Reminders, Flashing Light and Safety Lock - Dispenses Prescriptions Up to 6 Times Per Day - Clear Lid https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FL620B0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_EFLvFb33AGEJR We used a similar model (might even be the same one but I can't remember) for mom up until she needed to go to Assisted Living."
Medication Devices,The beeper wasn't very loud so if she was in another room she wouldn't hear it until someone passed through the room it was in and made sure she grabbed her pills.
Medication Devices,It was well worth the money.
Medication Devices,I'm not sure how tricky it was setting it up because the home health care nurse did the set up for us and continued to refill the pills.
Medication Devices,I think the one I bought had a second tray so you could fill it ahead of time and swap them out but we never used it.
Medication Devices,Don't get the version with the opaque lid - it's harder to tell when it's time to refill.
Medication Devices,Yeah it beeps for like half an hour.
Medication Devices,A beep that was grating to me but my husband needed to be in an adjoining room at least.
Medication Devices,It also flashes.
Medication Devices,I had a spare tray as well to make refilling it easy.
Medication Devices,I just got a Hero for my mom who I think has MCI and has a staggering amount of medication to take daily.
Medication Devices,https://herohealth.comIt comes with an app so you can see when they dispense the pills.
Medication Devices,They have to push a button to get them to go into the cup.
Medication Devices,It holds up to ten meds and can also do a reminder for meds not in the Hero - like an aspirin.
Medication Devices,So far it’s working pretty well.
Medication Devices,She lives alone so the Med dispense notification is like another check in for me.
Medication Devices,"It doesn’t lock, however."
Medication Devices,I had seen one of these.
Medication Devices,I’m curious: do you buy the machine and also pay the monthly subscription?
Medication Devices,Or does the machine come as a lease as part of it?
Medication Devices,The machine is a lease.
Medication Devices,It’s 99 dollars down and then 30 dollars a month for the service and app.
Medication Devices,I got the Tab Time one for my Mum.
Medication Devices,It was really helpful for a couple of years to enable her to maintain her independence.
Medication Devices,Stopped using it when she didn’t seem to notice the flashing light and loud alarm anymore.
Medication Devices,"Think they also did a SIM card one that would let you know if it had been tipped up to remove the pills, but it was quite pricey."
Medication Devices,We got one for my mom.
Medication Devices,Pills released AM PM.
Medication Devices,She smashed it one day to get the pills out of it.
Medication Devices,She was was sure she needed them.
Medication Devices,So now the aide does it.

PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety,Alexa to the rescue.
PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety,I’ve been showing him how to play all kinds of music and he seems to enjoy it.
PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety,And I set it up so if he says “Alexa Call For Help” it texts and Calls me and I can talk to him through the device.
PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety,One device covers 90% of his house but I will probably get him one for the bathroom as well.
PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety,"And best of all, no monthly monitoring fee.Our house is blanketed with them for a similar reason, but for my wife."
PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety,"The little Flex aren't great but we have one in each bathroom, and a dot or show in every room where she ever spends time."
PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety,"At this point our problem is the wrong Echo answers sometimes, not that we can't be heard.If you get the night-light add on for the Flex, you can put it in place of a night light and not lose any plugs, or if you don't, there's a USB port on the bottom you can use for charging a device.They're on sale for $17.49 right now, $32.48 with the night light."

PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety,I can't count how many times I've had to do that and it gives me  so much peace of mind.
PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety,I truly don't know what we would do without it.

PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety,"I’m late to the thread, but my mom is a fall risk so she has an Apple Watch that detects if she falls and sends a message to pre-selected contacts."
PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety,"Of course this necessarily depends on her wearing the watch constantly, but it’s definitely helpful."

Incompetent Nurse,Incompetent Nurse Let me start by saying I have huge respect for the nursing profession.
Incompetent Nurse,"I’m a little frustrated with a particular nurse I work with and I hope it’s okay I vent for a moment.This nurse is a sweet person, an older professional who’s been with my company for years."
Incompetent Nurse,She interacts well with the woman she supports in our group home and manages our delegation for this person’s diabetes management.
Incompetent Nurse,At one point I was having a problem with my clients catheter and called her.
Incompetent Nurse,She had no idea what to say and told me to call the urologist which I did.
Incompetent Nurse,This resulted in a flurry of communication and documentation between the urologist and my coworkers.
Incompetent Nurse,Our director of nursing replied to a note I made and let us know the issue I was dealing with was pretty common and not something to worry about if it only happened once.
Incompetent Nurse,I felt like if I’d called the nursing director in the first place I would have for the information I needed and that would have been the end.
Incompetent Nurse,Why is my on call nurse not knowledgeable enough to handle this issue?Then there is her track record of answering and responding to phone calls.
Incompetent Nurse,Pretty often I’ve called her with urgent issues and not gotten an answer or call back.
Incompetent Nurse,She called me the day after this happened once and didn’t even acknowledge my voicemail and asked me for different information.
Incompetent Nurse,"I said to her, I never got a call back yesterday."
Incompetent Nurse,"That’s the second or third time in the last few months this has happened, what’s up?"
Incompetent Nurse,She said she was doing yard work and that’s why she didn’t have her phone on her.
Incompetent Nurse,"Okay, but aren’t you my on call nurse?Generally I really enjoy working with this nurse but her shortcomings cause me a lot of stress and problems sometimes.I would let your DON know the problems you’re having, but come from a point of concern about the patients rather than frustrations in your dealings with her."
Incompetent Nurse,"An on-call nurse not answering her phone could be deadly in the wrong situation, and there is no point to a calling chain if one link does not answer reliably."
Incompetent Nurse,You really should look at getting this addressed.
Incompetent Nurse,I haven’t filed many complaints but one of the few I did was because I took my grandmother to a doctor appointment where the nurse taking her vitals and verifying the med list told my grandmother that honestly she probably didn’t need so many pills.
Incompetent Nurse,I was furious because my grandmother had Alzheimer’s and that is the last thing I need put in her head.
Incompetent Nurse,"My husband was in a long term care facility and we loved the nurses, then it came to a holiday weekend and they had a traveling substitute nurse."
Incompetent Nurse,"She told us that he was getting too much pain medicine and ""they'd never do that at MY hospital!"""
Incompetent Nurse,This after an amputation and other severe trauma.
Incompetent Nurse,"He had already been worried about ""getting hooked"" and was trying to tough it out, it took the head of the hospital to explain he was ok and needed the meds for him to settle down!"
Incompetent Nurse,She's the only nurse I complained about in 3 months!!
Incompetent Nurse,One other issue that really triggered this post: she was delegating someone to give insulin and came to saying she couldn’t remember if she was supposed to give the insulin on the opposite side of the body from the finger she pricked.
Incompetent Nurse,I told her I didn’t know because no one had ever told me that (I worry more about alternating which finger I prick) but that it was really her call consider she was the nurse.
Incompetent Nurse,"Like, I literally have a high school diploma and have been in the field a decade."
Incompetent Nurse,I know what I’m doing but I’m not qualified to tell the nurse how to do something she trains us on.

Medical Alert Devices,Medical Alert Devices My mother is 90 and still living on her own.
Medical Alert Devices,"I live next door to her, so I'm able to get to her within a minute if there's an emergency."
Medical Alert Devices,"She had a minor fall last night, just a couple of bruises, but it made me think that she needs some kind of medical alert device.Is there anything we could buy that would allow her to have a pendant around her neck that would dial my number if she needed help?"
Medical Alert Devices,"I don't know that she needs a service, just a device that would plug into her landline and dial me with some kind of message."
Medical Alert Devices,"Is anything like that available?The lift alert pendants that are available do not automatically dial 911, they can call you if she presses it unless she asks otherwise.VTech does have a phone system for seniors that has a pendant that will dial a series of preprogrammed numbers, if you don’t want a service."
Medical Alert Devices,The issue is the “pendant” is very large and heavy and really not designed to be worn around the neck.
Medical Alert Devices,"It can be attached to a walker, or if she can remember to always keep it in her pocket so she has it."
Medical Alert Devices,"The model of phone is SN5147 I believe, and you need to buy the pendant separate."
Medical Alert Devices,"Unfortunately the total cost with tax was over $130 for us.Another option: you could possibly buy one or more Echo or Google Home devices for throughout the home, which she could tell to call you as long as you’ve programmed your number in as a contact."
Medical Alert Devices,"The issue is you have to rely on the voice processing for it to understand her correctly, and if she were significant distress, she may not be loud enough or speak clearly enough for it to execute what she wants them to do.Another edit: I should clarify that at least the life alert pendant that we have does not automatically dial 911."
Medical Alert Devices,Some services may.
Medical Alert Devices,Some of the medical alert systems will call a dispatcher for that particular system.
Medical Alert Devices,"From that point, the dispatcher can either summon emergency help or call a family member."
Medical Alert Devices,I'm not familiar with product brands.
Medical Alert Devices,You might look some up online that are available in your area.
Medical Alert Devices,"My grandmother had a necklace, but she she refused wear it."
Medical Alert Devices,"How ""next door"" are we talking here?"
Medical Alert Devices,"Next door means next house, maybe 50 feet from her house to mine."
Medical Alert Devices,"Get a tile attached to your phone small enough to be a necklace I am a retired paramedic, have dealt with Life Alert ALOT!"
Medical Alert Devices,"With them, they would call 911 and the number of families also."
Medical Alert Devices,"You get the call, go to your mom's and then have life alert cancel the ambulance."
Medical Alert Devices,We got those often too :) I've been thinking of one of the newer smart watches with fall detection for my mom.Right now she has a simple cell phone ( https://www.wish.com/product/5cc8074dc36c9137ef09ece4?hide_login_modal=true&from_ad=goog_shopping&_display_country_code=CA&_force_currency_code=CAD&pid=googleadwords_int&c=6493229759&ad_cid=5cc8074dc36c9137ef09ece4&ad_cc=CA&ad_lang=EN&ad_curr=CAD&ad_price=34.00&campaign_id=6493229759&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhIP6BRCMARIsALu9Lfk2lB6HNZwyex96-FiCBk2-KyoWYdixQAW7WCz8uvNZoqtYbihOl7AaAoTxEALw_wcB&share=web )and I've put a lanyard on it.
Medical Alert Devices,But she still has to remember to 1) put it on  2) put it on the charger by her bed at night.
Medical Alert Devices,Plus she completely forgot there was an emergency button on the back.
Medical Alert Devices,"I've got it programmed to phone family, who can then decide what to do next."
Medical Alert Devices,"If you're close enough, another option is a baby monitor (sound)."
Medical Alert Devices,"Also, and this is a real pro-tip IMO, get her a cane (if she uses one) that makes a noise when it taps the ground."
Medical Alert Devices,This way you know when she's walking around.
Medical Alert Devices,"I recently gave my 94 year old mother a new cane that turned up in the trash somewhere, but when I realized it didn't do that tapping, I went right back to her old one."
Medical Alert Devices,Whoa!
Medical Alert Devices,Can you share a link to one of these?
Medical Alert Devices,One of what?
Medical Alert Devices,Her cane just so happens to rattle.
Medical Alert Devices,I bought a visonic alarm system years ago.One option was a pendant alarm you could give seniors.
Medical Alert Devices,Also had an option for motion detectors to set up if no motion was detected in an often used room like a bathroom or kitchen in a set number of hours.
Medical Alert Devices,Could program to call a number and leave a message.Didn’t require a subscription.No idea if they’re still around but I’m sure it’s not a hard option to find.
Medical Alert Devices,I recently got the Bay Alarm Medical system for my mother in law.
Medical Alert Devices,Very similar to life alert.
Medical Alert Devices,"Initial fees were about $100 for the necklace, bracelet, alarm speaker that connects to her landline, and even a lockbox for the back door that holds a key so first responders can enter easily."
Medical Alert Devices,Bay Alarm gives the code to first responders so there’s no guessing.
Medical Alert Devices,It’s a $20 a month service.
Medical Alert Devices,She’s 87 & 45 minutes from me and it gives me peace of mind.
Medical Alert Devices,That and a WiFi camera looking at her front walk ($20 and I can listen to the audio at her place if I felt like i needed to) and most recently an echo dot.
Medical Alert Devices,She’s losing eyesight so I’m really hoping to keep her independent as long as possible.
Medical Alert Devices,Two other things I happened upon were the Flipper remote for TVs- it only has 5 buttons.
Medical Alert Devices,And a phone with giant numbers.
Medical Alert Devices,It has two preset buttons (my husband & I are programmed) and a big orange 911 button on it.
Medical Alert Devices,My next purchase will be a smart watch so I can track her.
Medical Alert Devices,The last thing I want to do is eavesdrop on her life but the first thing I want is to keep her as safe as possible considering the distance.You are so lucky she’s right next door!
Medical Alert Devices,My mother in law has a good community and the little old ladies still snap peas together on their front porches.
Medical Alert Devices,"You can get an Echo Show in both houses and set it to ""drop in"" if she's ok being on video you can see from your house.If you had multiple cameras you could literally look in on her from home.There's an article Senior Home Central."
Medical Alert Devices,Let me know if you can't find it.
Medical Alert Devices,Take a look at the amazon alexa dot.
Medical Alert Devices,It sits on the table.
Medical Alert Devices,My mom can call me by telling alexa to call me.
Medical Alert Devices,you could try it out to see if it works.
Medical Alert Devices,There are also bed pads and fall pad alarms (for the floor) which can either alarm or call.
Medical Alert Devices,They can be adjusted for either sound or alarm so you're notified any movement.

Elderly Tracker,Elderly Tracker Good afternoon!
Elderly Tracker,I am writing to see if anyone has advice on a tracker or something that I can make sure my grandfather has on him at all times so he can feel safe.
Elderly Tracker,He can’t remember anyone’s phone numbers or our home address and he’s worried that he will be forgotten somewhere.
Elderly Tracker,The likelihood of this happening is extremely rare since he is not mobile and basically wheelchair ridden.
Elderly Tracker,He says that he’s worried his caretaker will forget him on a walk (this would never happen either) I printed multiple business cards with emergency phone numbers and our home address for him to carry.
Elderly Tracker,"He also has an iPhone and he can tell Siri to call people but he doesn’t think he’ll have his phone on him for whatever reason since it’s basically just to yell at Siri and ask her questions😋 Thanks in advance!The problem isn't preparing for him getting ""lost"" (which will never happen), the problem is his anxiety."
Elderly Tracker,Is he on anxiety meds?
Elderly Tracker,Do they need to be adjusted?
Elderly Tracker,"Does he want you to be able to track him down, or just someone able to call his contacts?"
Elderly Tracker,"If it's about just having phone numbers, an emergency bracelet would work well and be very visible/reassuring to him."
Elderly Tracker,"If it's more about being found by you--this is going to sound weird, but they make dog tags with GPS."
Elderly Tracker,You could put it on his keychain?
Elderly Tracker,What are the chances he'll ever wander off without the wheelchair?
Elderly Tracker,You could get a GPS tracker/logger like trucking companies use to make sure their drivers aren't at the strip club during their shift.
Elderly Tracker,"I don't have time to find the best option right now, but ideally you'd be able to find one that doesn't require the use of a manufacturer's tracking website subscription and you can just pop a 3G simcard in and call it, or configure it to check in to your own website, or something."
Elderly Tracker,It'd probably be worth seeing if there's a subreddit that knows more about these kinds of devices (r/spygear or r/stalker etc.
Elderly Tracker,";).Anyway, strap one onto the bottom of the wheelchair and you'll always(?)"
Elderly Tracker,know where he is.
Elderly Tracker,":) Furthermore to his anxiety about being left somewhere, you could tell him that the tracker is on the wheelchair and that you'll always know where he is as long as he's in the wheelchair could do double-duty in motivating him not to wander off without the chair (memory issues aside)."
Elderly Tracker,Hi OPHave you contacted your local Office on Aging and Disability Services?
Elderly Tracker,Look up the phone # for the office in your county—- ours offers a free tracking bracelet.
Elderly Tracker,You have to inquire and qualify and get approved for this.
Elderly Tracker,"(it’s connected to the sheriff’s office— if and when they go wander off, and it’s serious, you can call 911 and police who are trained in the program know how to locate the person)I doubt every county has this, but it’s worth asking!"
Elderly Tracker,"I haven’t used this but it looks great to me, I believe another redditor posted this recently - it’s an in-home monitor for folks who don’t want to wear one."
Elderly Tracker,"Link I know this sounds odd but if he's more worried he will be forgotten maybe a GPS tracker of some kind would do the trick, if there is more concern about him falling or getting hurt and having no way to reach the phone something like life alert."
Elderly Tracker,I bought my grandma a Relay Go.
Elderly Tracker,Red Cross have a teleassistance service in my country.
Elderly Tracker,I had to pay 12€ a month.
Elderly Tracker,It is basically a red button he can press at home and contacts directly with their call center for any emergency.
Elderly Tracker,"I think they got a mobile version.But as it has been said, probably his issues are more anxiety related."
Elderly Tracker,"I think he might keep pressing the button again and again if not able to understand the system.Well, on the other side the service works well."
Elderly Tracker,"Nobody like you know the situation better, so you get to decide if that would reduce the anxiety problem or would be a button he will keep pressing."
Elderly Tracker,"We all lean over and inspect David’s card and Price quietly says, “That’s really nice.”A brief spasm of jealousy courses through me when I notice the elegance of the color and the classy type."
Elderly Tracker,"I clench my fist as Van Patten says, smugly, “Eggshell with Romalian type...” He turns to me."
Elderly Tracker,"“What do you think?”“Nice,” I croak, but manage to nod, as the busboy brings four fresh Bellinis.^(Bot."
Elderly Tracker,Ask me what was on the Patty Winters Show this morning.
Elderly Tracker,|) ^(Opt out) Bad bot.

Tech to help with dementia,"Tech to help with dementia Hey guys just found this sub, my grandfather has had dementia for a while and is deteriorating.In a recent bus ride into the city with my gran he missed his stop as my gran got off and has now been lost for about 36 hours in the city, the police are on it and there have been some sightings on cctv and such, while we await his hopefully safe return we have all been thinking about things that can help prevent this in the future.So to my question: We we’re looking to get gps trackers potentially for both my gran and grandpa to prevent this kind of thing happening again, does anyone have any recommendations for reliable easy to use and convenient ones?"
Tech to help with dementia,"We want to get my gran a phone that she can use in emergency’s, she’s 80+ and not very tech savvy but knows how to use a tablet, any recommendations on something with a long battery life and easy to use, I don’t know if there’s anything aimed at the elderly here.Not exactly a tech question but if anyone else has any advice on how to help prevent any situations like this without moving him to a home I’d be really appreciative, just trying to stay productive and not worry.Thanks for any help!"
Tech to help with dementia,This is in the uk btw if that mattersHey there - that's super scary about your grandad.
Tech to help with dementia,I hope he's found soon!I'm a bit of a tech skeptic when it comes to folks with dementia.
Tech to help with dementia,"This doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to find a solution, but I guess I'm here to urge a little caution unless you have very deep pockets..."
Tech to help with dementia,Here's why:GPS trackers are amazing.
Tech to help with dementia,Truly.
Tech to help with dementia,The trick is getting your loved one with dementia to consistently wear/carry the tracker.
Tech to help with dementia,"My mum started disappearing before I moved in to be her caregiver, so I moved to GPS trackers to try and keep tabs on her."
Tech to help with dementia,"Thing was: she never wore watches or jewelry, so even when presented with beautiful trinkets she would take them off in less than a day, never to put them on again."
Tech to help with dementia,"I tried adding a tracker to her fancy cigarette case, but she recognized the square fob-like device as foreign to the case (without remembering that it was important or its purpose) and so would diligently pick at it until her case was restored to her memory of what it was meant to look like."
Tech to help with dementia,"I found some neat shoe-lace trackers, but she entered a phase in which she would hide her own shoes around the house and so wouldn't wear the same pair day to day."
Tech to help with dementia,"I got her a new wallet (she was in the habit of carrying a wallet) with a tracker, but she never recognized the new wallet as hers and wouldn't carry it."
Tech to help with dementia,"A long list of examples to say: if you're going to find a GPS tracker for your grandfather, think carefully about what he's likely to actually carry/wear with him every day."
Tech to help with dementia,"You're going to have more luck, at least based on my experience, if you can find a way to add a tracker to something he already knows and carries in a way that he won't know it is there."
Tech to help with dementia,(Does he use a cane?
Tech to help with dementia,"Unless he has many, that might be a good thing to explore?"
Tech to help with dementia,")Regarding a cell phone for your grandmother, and also to perhaps open you up to other assistive devices, I'd encourage you to check out the Alzheimer's store."
Tech to help with dementia,"Here's an example of a simple phone that they sell:https://www.alzstore.com/RAZ-Memory-Cell-Phone-for-Seniors-p/0039.htmI know that your grandmother doesn't have dementia, but if you're looking for easy to use devices..."
Tech to help with dementia,They have some really great options.
Tech to help with dementia,You'll find some other good simple cell phones on Amazon.
Tech to help with dementia,"I'm in Canada so the options you have available to you may be different, but I've heard good things about the jitterbug flip phone."
Tech to help with dementia,"On the Alzheimer's store, you might also find some other things there that your grandfather might have some use for."
Tech to help with dementia,"Again, though, I'd urge caution about new tech for your grandfather... Learning how to use something new can be really difficult...Hope this helps."
Tech to help with dementia,Best wishes.
Tech to help with dementia,"I really appreciate the comment, I’ll definitely have a think about where we could possibly put one thank you for the ideas!"
Tech to help with dementia,I’ll also definetley check out that store and phone thank you so much for your help and support!
Tech to help with dementia,In US I think the elderly phone is called the Jitterbug.
Tech to help with dementia,My dad had it.
Tech to help with dementia,It has big buttons and very simple directions.If you get one get a Tile for it.
Tech to help with dementia,Tiles are little squares you stick to thinks that you can track from a computer if lost.

"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",Instead I find myself just wanting to scream at him.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I feel so much guilt and selfishness.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",Like I am a horrible person.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I have even considered an affair but I love him so much.

"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",We used to be super social.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",Not anymore.

"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",One day/moment at a time.I sent that heart because I was in my car..but I've been doing this for 17 years and I am convinced nobody knows what caregivers do but other caregivers.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I've likened it to a secret society.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I've run into other caregivers and we can damned near spot each other before we even talk.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","And our wives don't understand, our husbands don't understand,our friends don't understand ,only WE understand each other."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","The isolation, the loneliness, the sense of duty that we ALL possess."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I only half jokingly put forth the idea of a dating/friend service JUST for we caregivers.

"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","Know that you are not alone in this, we are here to support you."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","We are going through the same emotions, and we understand how how it is to be a caregiver, to feel alone, and sad."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I feel this way too sometimes.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I found this subreddit a few weeks ago and I'm glad I did.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","I found that a lot of caregivers feel this way, and they always listen (read) with an open mind.About your well-being, I think it is a good idea to keep in touch with you physician about your mental health as well as you weight."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","I have the exact same problems, so I relate to what you said."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",Sport helps a lot with mental health.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","Before covid, I started to go to the gym for the first time and it felt really good."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I think it might help you.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","Plus, you'll have the occasion to have time for yourself, and not always being a caregiver.Try to reach out to a local caregiver support group."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","You might find some support, and maybe some friend to have a walk?"
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",:) they would understand your situation and not be mean like your friends...Try also to see if you could have help at home taking care of him.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",Having someone helping you on a daily basis might relieve some of the stress of you shoulders.I'm curious about what people in relationship advice have said.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",How could they be mean to you?
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","You are obviously in a dire situation and need help.Forget what they said, they are not in your shoes, or the shoes of a caregivers, so it is difficult for them to understand.Stay strong."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",You are not alone.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",❤️ People unfortunately have strong opinions on situations they don't have experience with.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","I was the caregiver for my mother during the last few yesterday if her life, and it was grueling."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",One thing I wish that I'd known about is the availability of respite care.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",When I was checking my mom into the rehab place there was another family checking their mom in for the weekend because they had a trip to go on.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","You could check into the availability of that in your area.Soon after my mom died, I started getting sick."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",Now I'm the patient and my husband is my caretaker.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",Nobody signed up for that role especially when you have energy and vitality.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I'd venture to say he feels like crap about it.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",You took the best first step.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",There are resources available for caretakers.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",Take advantage of them all.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",You deserve every ounce of help there is to be had.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",You are going through caregiver burnout(Please google it).
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I went through it too.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","After a while, everything they do just gets on your nerves and you turn into a ruthless monster."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","And you wish for it to end, but when it does finally end, there's no relief."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","Yeah, you have more time and you get your life back, but your loved one is a major part of your life."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","And when they go, a part of you dies with them."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","Trust me, no matter how bad the situation is, when they die, you will wish hard for just one last day of it.Try to remember that your loved one isn't themselves anymore."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","The illness is what's driving you crazy, not them."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","They would not act out of character and put you through so much if they were feeling alright, would they?"
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","Try to treat them the best that you can and don't take the frustration out on them.I know you are tired of therapy suggestions, but it really does help."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",Letting it out will help you in the long run and will help you understand the situation better.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",It doesn't make you weak or bad or something.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",Thank you for this information.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I am going through this now.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I care for my mom and I love her but I am feel like I am going crazy and losing control of my emotions.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",I live in a somewhat remote area with a lack of support especially now with the COVID but I did look up caregiver burnout and at least I know where to start.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression",It's even worse when you are the only person who is helping out.
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","Without those breaks, you never get a chance to cool down and all that stress has nowhere to go."
"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression","Sending you love, I understand❤"
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,Online shopping and mystery order fun.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,"My elderly family members, with various degree of cognitive issues, have discovered online shopping, and in the past few weeks I have disputed hundreds of dollars in charges and spent hours returning they insisted they did not order but only ""looked at""."
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,"Most of these orders were through the Amazon app so things were pretty straight forward, but some of the other items only show up as debits from their bank accounts with cryptic identifiers from distant lands, and they can never remember where they actually ordered the items from.Today I spent the morning trying to track down a charge on my mom's boyfriend's bank statement for which he has an e-mail receipt that only indicates being from some non company in China."
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,"He does not recall placing the order, only looking at the item, but does not recall from which website and has mild paranoia."
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,"This leads him to the conclusion that he has been hacked and that the hackers have taken elaborate steps to collect his bank information, shipping address (different from home address), cell phone number and new e-mail address."
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,I know this is actually not the case because I recall him talking about having ordered this thing a month ago.Unfortunately the item hasn't arrived yet and I have no way of determining if the website was legit because it is not showing up on or around the order date in his browsing history and it has proved difficult to file a claim on the charge because the banks and paypal are short staffed due to the virus.Fun times.Do they have one click ordering turned on for amazon?
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,That would probably be the easiest way to stop the ordering since it would require them to input the info to continue to check out.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,I would look for Wish orders for the unmarked Chinese debits.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,Wish is the new go to for chinese knock off drop shippers.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,They don't have one click ordering turned on.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,"What they were doing was placing things they wanted to save to look at later in their cart, forgetting about them and neglecting to remove the things they did not want and review their order before placing it.We thought maybe the mystery order of the day was through Wish but have not been able to confirm yet."
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,That sucks.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,I hope you can get things figured out with the bank.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,MIL looked at a laptop once and only once.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,She managed to lock out the keyboard somehow while only having to flick through a few pictures.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,It took me 30min to finally unlock it.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,Thank god she was old enough to be completely computer illiterate.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,Good luck.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,Did you know that Apple permanently locks you out of your iPhone if you guess the passcode wrong 10 times and to gain access again you have to do a factory reset from an iCloud compatible device?
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,My mother discovered this the hard way and before I could even do the reset I had to update Windows.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,It took 8 hours to regain access to the phone.
Online shopping and mystery order fun.,"Thankfully, I serendipitously had the thought to save backup copies of some important things she had on it that we could not save to the cloud a few days previous to this.In her defense, she was on morphine at the time and hallucinating slightly, but Apple should really find a better alternative to the perma lock out."

Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Any advice would be great!We’ve had great results using the Apple Watch.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,The series 4 & 5 version has fall detection & will alert the house and call us if my dad is down for more than a few minutes.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Thanks so much!
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,"My mom was saying if there's any tracker he'd prefer, it would likely be one that looks and feels a lot like a watch."
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Is there a specific app you like to use?
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Or it's just part of the in-built watch?
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,"Depends on his mental health whether he can manage anything tech, so I can’t comment on that."
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,And it depends what safety issues you are worried about.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,"For tripping and falling: night lights everywhere—some are LED and motion activated, grab bars in bathrooms and handrails for steps."
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Sturdy dining chairs with arm rests.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Various grab bars for couches and beds.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,No throw rugs and a cleared floor.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,For monitoring: cameras to send images to your cell phone.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Seems invasive but if you see him on the floor you can get to him.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,"‘I fell down and I can’t get up’ buttons, state may pay for the service."
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Meals on wheels so someone checks up on him once a day.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Got it!
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Thank you!
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,"He already has grab bars/handrails/a pretty well-optimized living space, and this would just be supplemental!"
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,"The most immediate reason for some extra safeguards is that awhile back he fell out of bed while he had a fever, and (we think) because of the fever wasn't lucid enough to press his emergency button--his fall detector can't be worn while sleeping because normal movement while sleeping will set it off."
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,"(If it happened again, I'm sure the family would look into something to add to his bed, but I think that hasn't come up yet!"
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,")Re: tech: he could probably manage, but after talking to family who interact with him on a daily basis, it would likely be a pain for him to have to sync a tracker.The camera idea seems like a great alternative--do you know/prefer of a specific app?"
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,"Unfortunately meals on wheels in his area is on a break during the pandemic, but I'll definitely keep that in mind for later!"
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,We got something called d-link a few years ago to monitor our cat while on vacation.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Maybe new products out there now.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,We could see the camera views on an app on our smart phone.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Some of these monitors have motion sensors that will alert you when there is movement or noise.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Now we’re not traveling and my mom moved in with us so I have non-web baby monitors in my moms bedroom and office and I have volume turned up so I can see if she’s shifting in bed or restless.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,The video monitor has a battery and I carry it around with me or plug it in next to my desk and bed.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,I can keep an eye on her without getting up or disturbing her.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,I am also most concerned about falling out of bed.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,She’s done it twice—once breaking her cheek and once landing upside down and having.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,A heart event from being stuck.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Old people also fall on the floor and get hypothermia and can die.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,This happened to my grandma.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,"She fell on the weekend, laid on the kitchen tiles which were cold and wasn’t discovered until Monday morning when her helper arrived, then died shortly after in the hospital."
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,So it won’t prevent falls but can help recover the person to safety more quickly.
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,Thank you for the tips!
Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives?,"That's exactly what we're afraid of, and I'm glad you have a good solution for your mom!"
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,Hello!
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"I'm not sure if this topic has been discussed in this subreddit, I definitely haven't found anything searching."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"My grandfather has Lewy Body Dementia and sometimes leaves home abruptly, leaving my grandmother worried (specially when it happens in the night)."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"At the moment I'm home and can follow him right after he leaves, but most of the time they're on their own.This had made me wonder if anyone is going through the same and how they manage the situation."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"The ideal solution would be to get a GPS tracker to slip in his clothes or something he takes with him at all times, but he's not even taking his phone or face mask with him anyway.How would you manage this situation?"
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,Do you know any good quality GPS tracker we can use?
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,Do you have any other tips that could help?
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"Thanks to everyone in advance!We’ve found the best option for my mum is the GPS insoles that slip into shoes, which is fairly foolproof."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"The only problem is that they are V expensive in terms of trackers- around gbp 250-300, so it does depend on your budget."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"We’ve also made sure to be VERY nice to local pubs, shops etc as when mum turns into an escape artist, they’re often amazing at calling us if she appears."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,Good luck!
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,Do you also have the lo tech option in place: A not-easily-removable bracelet with contact info on it.
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"https://www.medicalidfashions.com/beginners-guide-alzheimer-s-awareness-medical-id-braceletshttps://www.medicalert.org/products/everybody/classic-medical-id-bracelet My dad was obsessed with his wallet and always had it on him, so we bought a Tile and put it inside wallet."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"You can buy them at Target, etc."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,https://www.thetileapp.com We use Tracki.
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,There’s a monthly subscription fee for the internet (required to ping to a satellite).
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,It’s pretty good.
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"The app is good, bit fiddly but once you learn it it’s ok. Maps the history too."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,The issue with trackers is the battery capacity.
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"Which is related to 1) size (bigger = longer charge but harder to hide on someone’s person,clothes, etc) and 2) the refresh rate (how often it pings the satellite) - more frequent pings = faster battery drain, less frequent pings = less good idea of where people get up to."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"That said, if your person doesn’t walk around all day (like my dad) you could set it to refresh every 30 minutes and then refresh within the app to see where he is just at that moment."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"We have it set for a refresh every 10 minutes, usually get 10-13 hours that way."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,The tracki is about 2x2”.
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,It’s ok on a keychain... idk about sewing it into clothes...
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"Accuracy isn’t 100%, depends on the location (signal strength) and its good within a few blocks."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,Tracki supposedly “learns” location with use but it might be off by a building or too.
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,Being in a rural vs urban area might make a difference one way or another too.You can set a geofence too to let you know when they leave.I think ours works on a 3G network btw.
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"Have seen some products that operate on 2G, I believe that’s going to be phased out where it isn’t already."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,Overall This is better than the last tracker we had Thank you!
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,I will have a look at it.
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,"Really appreciated :) My small care home installed an alarm at each doorway that would announce loudly if it was opened, example: ""front door opened"" that way care staff knew if residents were trying to escape out of immediate supervision."
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,They recommended we installed a bed alarm under moms care home bed if mom got up at nighttime.
GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia?,That may be helpful as an alternative for your grandma that doesn’t require technical upkeep.
Life Alert or ??,Life Alert or ??
Life Alert or ??,"Hello, Is there some type of device like life alert that will alert when an elderly person falls and they’re alone?"
Life Alert or ??,"My father is in his mid 80s and he is alone for some time at home, but we are worried about him falling while he’s alone."
Life Alert or ??,Any device works and price is not an issue at the moment.
Life Alert or ??,Thank you!We have a Life Alert it's fine but definitely has some flaws.
Life Alert or ??,"For example, if you accidentally press the button your loved one will need to verbally communicate with the speaker to yell them they are ok and provide a security code."
Life Alert or ??,My grandmother often times can't hear te alarm go off and has alot of trouble communicating the code to the operator leading to more false alarms than appropriate use.
Life Alert or ??,"On top of that a landline is required , so if you have one great, if you don't I dont think it's worth another bill (on top of the LA service)."
Life Alert or ??,"Accidentally pressing the button is a common issue with such devices, regardless of company or manufacturer."
Life Alert or ??,The idea is that it's better for the button to be super easy to press rather than too hard to press - they don't want someone not being able to press the button when they need to.
Life Alert or ??,A landline is not required.
Life Alert or ??,There are ways around the issue you're experiencing.
Life Alert or ??,Pretty sure some smart watches can have apps that detect falls.
Life Alert or ??,"Might be worth looking into, as they can also be used to call for help Seconding this."
Life Alert or ??,They have watches specifically for elderly people.
Life Alert or ??,"They have a lot of different options depending on what your priorities are.There's heart rate, fall detection, auto call answering, geo fence (for wandering) and other options."
Life Alert or ??,https://www.wearable-technologies.com/2019/07/the-5-best-fall-detection-wearables-in-2019/ hope you'll find a good one My mom is limited to her room and bathroom 90% of the time so Amazon Alexa works well.
Life Alert or ??,I also have devices placed around the house when she does move around.
Life Alert or ??,So far so good.
Life Alert or ??,"She can intercom, call and play her favorite songs by using her voice.Helps both of us by tracking her meds and diet too."
Life Alert or ??,She likes to hear her calendar for nurse visits and exercise times.
Life Alert or ??,Shopping list is a big plus too she tells Alexa and I will see it on my phone while at the store.We have been using the Alexa system for about a year now.
Life Alert or ??,"I actually just joined to ask for advice on this matter, but maybe I can help you with what I've found so far.One thing to note, for those not aware, I purchased a life alert for my mother a few years ago,  without discussing this with her (life alert specifically asked/recommended if I had discussed this with her), and when it came in the mail, my mother was upset, and felt I was spending too much money, also felt as though she didn't need it."
Life Alert or ??,She demanded I ship it back.
Life Alert or ??,"Life alert will ship the unit, then schedule an appointment to get it set up."
Life Alert or ??,"Because it wasn't set up, (3 year contract fulfilled), they allowed me to ship it back and only pay the nominal fee you agree to when it gets set up, as any company typically does.Discuss this with your loved one before proceeding.I went down the rabbit hole of trying to find a solution, and they all seem to offer 8 out of 10 options, with it staggered between some offering some solutions, and others offering other solutions, but no-one offering and all-in-one solution.Some offer bulky watches that are not water proof, some offer lanyards that don't have a microphone, some offer all of the above, be require a specific carrier.The big deal is the middle man."
Life Alert or ??,You may pay 40 dollars a month for a lanyard connected to your home wi-fi.
Life Alert or ??,This contacts an individual who will respond to the alert.
Life Alert or ??,"They will initiate a call back, and further contact emergency medical if there is no response."
Life Alert or ??,"For 80 dollars a month, they will set up a stand alone modem/router using their own router and include an extra gadget, such as a button to put in the shower.For the full 120 they will include many gadgets, such as watches, lanyards, stand-alone network  routers, etc.We always just call 911 for emergencies."
Life Alert or ??,The apple watch has the capability of initiating a 911 call during a fall detection.
Life Alert or ??,"When a fall is detected, it sounds off a bell/buzzer for a minute or so to cancel the call."
Life Alert or ??,"If the user doesn't cancel, it will alert medics."
Life Alert or ??,It will then also alert contacts that you have set up.
Life Alert or ??,I wish it would contact the contacts prior to the 911.
Life Alert or ??,I'm still trying to get it set up.
Life Alert or ??,"Maybe others could help?She happened to get a bit wavy with the hands the other day, and I heard it go off, on her wrist, and she ignored it until I grabbed her wrist and said ""It's asking if there is an emergency,"" so take that with some salt and tequila.User needs to be within range of the iPhone, through local wi-fi connection, unless you get a stand-alone network on the watch, which is extra phone service (30 dollars a month roughly).Because my mother lives with me, I have also bought a bunch of local CallToYou bell chimes that are placed around the home, that she can use to alert me if there are any issues."
Life Alert or ??,They are just some remote buttons that sound a chime.
Life Alert or ??,"Easy to set up, probably many others on the market that do the same thing, not trying to push them specifically.The apple watch allows medical information to also be included with the 911 alert, I've got some of that set up, such as medications, but I can't link to her medical group.I've also heard of options/apps that you can put on the iPhone, that will contact third party before calling 911."
Life Alert or ??,"This might be an option, but I haven't investigated too much yet.A combination of the above, and a consistent check in time might be best.Thanks for listening.If anyone would like to add to this, please do!"
Life Alert or ??,I could use the assistance.
Life Alert or ??,"I guess my point was, if your father won't wear a lanyard in the shower, get him a decent waterproof watch."
Life Alert or ??,"If he's not wearing it, it does little good."
Life Alert or ??,"I have cameras in the house, set up in places that my mom is most likely to fall."
Life Alert or ??,I can check on the live feed via an app whenever I want.
Life Alert or ??,"You can buy cameras individually online for about $40 each, and the livestream via app is free."
Life Alert or ??,"I have one under my Mom's bed so she can't see it (she hates the cameras) but it's great because I just need the floor view to see if she fell, so I can rush over."
Life Alert or ??,She has a life alert but refuses to wear it.
Life Alert or ??,"I work for Life Alert, a lot of elderly refuse to wear it unfortunately ._."
Advice on getting my mom help?,Advice on getting my mom help?
Advice on getting my mom help?,"I am writing this because I’m taking on trying to help my mom’s mental health/cognitive situation sorted out and, frankly could use some insight and support.About five years ago, my family started noticing that my mom was repeating the same stories, seemingly forgetting conversations she’d had with us and having some issues recalling names etc."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"She’s 69 now so my sister, aunt and I didn’t think much of it at first, that maybe she was just experiencing some age-related decline but  that it was likely nothing to get too worried about."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"We also noticed, independently of one another, that her already volatile moods (her side of the family has a history of bipolar disorder and we’ve long suspected she’s got some of those traits) started getting worse."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"She has stormed out of family gatherings for no known reason, had screaming fits where she has rolled on the front lawn because my sister didn’t appreciate her babysitting my nephew enough and had multiple episodes of that nature."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"The trouble is, because we’ve all had difficult run-ins with her and we have all had very busy lives far away, we have had only occasional contact with her."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"Mom, who has essentially lived alone on a mountain for the better part of a decade, hasn’t worked, had hobbies or done much of anything for almost all of that time because she got a good deal when my parents divorced and hasn’t had to worry about money."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"She really has not been good about keeping herself occupied, and because of her sometimes cruel and manipulative demeanor, she has been pretty isolated."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"She is a histrionic person in terms of personality, but fails at close relationships because she lashes out those closest to her all the time (and always has).About a year ago, after speaking with her on the phone a few times, I started to feel like things had taken a turn."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"When I asked her, she didn’t have recollection of basic things (when she’d last been out, what she’d eaten that day, when she’d last taken the dog for a walk)."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"I was concerned enough that I found time to visit her and, when I got to her house, I was shocked at just how bad things had become."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"It was clear she was starting to not take care of basic things like hygiene, feeding herself etc."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"Her dog was both severely overweight and seemingly ravenously hungry I later found out that it was because she would forget to feed him for days at a time and then, alternatively, forget she had fed him and over feed him some days."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"When I had conversations with her, she would repeat the same story/anecdote, often within a few minutes and then completely forget everything we’d talked about moments later."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"Whenever I mentioned that we were going over something we had just discussed, she lashed out and accused my of gaslighting her."
Advice on getting my mom help?,It was shocking and I felt terribly guilty that I’d distanced myself enough from her to not notice how bad it was getting.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"On the drive home from that trip, I called my sister and aunt together to get their input on the situation and find out what they’d noticed."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"Like me, they had each been distancing themselves from her due to episodes of cruelty and hostility."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"I should also say that my mom has, until recently, been very cunning and sharp in her interpersonal relationships, which I think did a lot to cover her decline effectively from everyone around her."
Advice on getting my mom help?,She is sharp in many ways but her memory is rendering that cunning part of her less and less effective.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"On that call with my sister and aunt, I found out that she’d gotten lost multiple times on familiar drives, gotten in major fights with each of them multiple times after seemingly small memory lapses were acknowledged, had major mood swings and even made half-hearted suicide threats with them.Cut to a few months ago."
Advice on getting my mom help?,I had a contract job come to an end and managed to arrange some things so I could come live here in NC with my mom in her house for the time being and hopefully get some treatment figured out.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"It hasn’t been easy and I’m met with constant resistance, but I’ve managed to get her to see her primary care doc, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, have a neuropsychological exam (as referred by her primary doc), got her a CT scan and, as of late week, finally got her to a neurologist."
Advice on getting my mom help?,The primary doc had apparently expressed concerns about her memory to her in September of last year but my mom never followed up or told anyone.
Advice on getting my mom help?,The neuropsych testing showed severe short-term memory loss of an unknown cause and also revealed a lot of the ways she guesses/fabricates to cover those memory losses.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"According to the testing, she retains virtually no information (of different types) minutes after learning it which tracks very much with my experience of conversations with her etc."
Advice on getting my mom help?,The CT scan was clean but the neurologist ordered an MRI which will happen Monday.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"The psychiatric nurse practitioner, her primary doc and neuropsych tester all also brought up mood lability and histrionics, so much so that the tester put “suspected bipolar disorder” in his written test report.So far, everyone thinks we are probably dealing with a mood disorder and some form of dementia, both of which are feeding each other."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"She was prescribed 2 mg of abilify but hated taking a drug for a mood disorder and demanded to go off it, and then was prescribed Aricept yesterday to hopefully curb some of the memory loss and associated mood issues.I realize this is a wall of text, but I needed to let it out and hopefully hear some encouragement."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"Right now it feels like I’m fighting against my mom to try to get her help and, really, without getting her declared incompetent (which I really don’t want to do unless I absolutely have to) I am powerless to actually mandate anything."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"I should also state, she doesn’t really have a valid powers of attorney for either medical or general duties."
Advice on getting my mom help?,My mom thinks she’s fine and continues to think it’s everyone else making it up.
Advice on getting my mom help?,I know that there is a part of her that’s terrified but she covers it with meanness at almost every step.
Advice on getting my mom help?,I’m frustrated/fried and feel stuck with what to do next.Hey.
Advice on getting my mom help?,Just want to say that you're doing amazing work so far.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"It can be so difficult to get medical attention for a person who has cognitive problems, and that you've had your mom see several doctors is already an accomplishment."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"I know it doesn't mean much, but e-high-fives from an internet stranger."
Advice on getting my mom help?,I don't know if I can offer specific advice as you will know your mom better than anyone.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"I can share my experience, though...I'd encourage you to think about having your mom declared incompetent."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"It 100% was a difficult day for me when I did as much for my mum, but it barely phased my mum."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"I got caught up in what it meant, but my mum just thought a rude lady came to visit and forgot all about it by the time we finished supper."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"In spite of my misgivings, what the declaration allowed me to do was to get my mum the care that she needed."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"At the end of the day, that was worth it."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"I don't know your mom, but I feel reasonably confident in saying that if she is resisting diagnosis and treatment now, she's not going to have a Eureka moment later on."
Advice on getting my mom help?,Taking care of the legal stuff asap means that the distance between you and your mom's care gets much shorter.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"At the end of the day, if her care is your biggest priority, well ..."
Advice on getting my mom help?,It might be worth considering.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"(Depending on where you are in the world, there are likely other steps to getting authority to make decisions for your mom."
Advice on getting my mom help?,You may wish to contact the local Alzheimer's Society for guidance on this.
Advice on getting my mom help?,)Best wishes.
Advice on getting my mom help?,Thank you very much for this response.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"With my mom, because she’s good at faking, I’m not sure she would be declared incompetent, at least not at this point."
Advice on getting my mom help?,But it’s very helpful to have your take on it.
Advice on getting my mom help?,My mum was very good at faking too.
Advice on getting my mom help?,I think that it's pretty common in early dementia.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"I'm sure that it's different everywhere, but for us the process included several in person visits and written reports from people who knew my mum."
Advice on getting my mom help?,The woman who visited was a nurse who spent her career specializing in dementia.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"The nurse could see right through my mum's dodges, usually just by staying relentlessly on subject."
Advice on getting my mom help?,Anyway.
Advice on getting my mom help?,I really do wish you all the best.
Advice on getting my mom help?,It's a tough road.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"Out of curiosity, are you in the UK?"
Advice on getting my mom help?,Just noticing your use of “mum”.
Advice on getting my mom help?,I’m wondering how different the legal protocol would be here in the states.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"If you are here, NVM."
Advice on getting my mom help?,And thanks again!
Advice on getting my mom help?,I'm in Canada.
Advice on getting my mom help?,I think we split up here on the mum/mom thing.
Advice on getting my mom help?,Gotcha.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"Well, I like “mum” myself but, being from Wisconsin, feel too pretentious saying it."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"I had a teacher in grade 2 teach us that if we pronounced it ""mum"" we should spell it that way."
Advice on getting my mom help?,"For whatever it's worth, I don't think most of the world would bat an eye at using the u if you feel bold one day."
Advice on getting my mom help?,This sounds a lot like my mom.
Advice on getting my mom help?,She has tried many things including Zyprexa for the mood disorder which helped but had too many side effects.
Advice on getting my mom help?,She’s now on Gabapentin to help with the mood and Aricept for memory and Ativan as needed (which is bad for dementia but she has major panic attacks).
Advice on getting my mom help?,She’s still not okay.
Advice on getting my mom help?,We’ve tried so many meds.
Advice on getting my mom help?,When we get her calm her memory worsens.
Advice on getting my mom help?,It stinks.
Advice on getting my mom help?,"It does stink, that’s for sure."
Advice on getting my mom help?,I wish you the best with your journey in this.
Advice on getting my mom help?,And thank you for your insight.

My mom needs a medical alert “something”,We used to use a life alert like system supplied by a local ambulance company.

My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"The two big things are ""fall detection"" and the ability to press a button on a desk or a button on a necklace."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,The calls are placed via a cellular/mobile phone network the user doesn't need a cellphone.There are a few scammy companies that do not have medically trained staff answering the phone.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,You'll know they are poor quality because they are the ones who advertise the cheapest price.Health insurance may cover the cost of an alert system.In the end we didn't get one but of the ones I saw I think any with fall detection are the best option.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I'm using the Lively medical device through Great Call.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"I don't think any system has everything I want, but this hit most of my check boxes and we have been happy with the service so far."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,It's not terribly expensive and they are very responsive when it detects falls.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,We had a couple of false alarms and a couple of misfires when we first got it and their response time was fantastic.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"One of the big complaints is that for some reason the device flashes, you don't see it in the light, but when it's dark it is something you notice even when your eyes are closed."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I've been looking at getting a fall detection watch for my dad.

My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"https://www.medicalalertbuyersguide.org/best-medical-alert-systems/ please look at this article and we can discuss.This is by far one of the most difficult problems, and is easy now that we have voice command devices.My mother used to keep her alert on the toilet, because if she fell, in her logic, that'd be where she fell.It was infuriating.Definitely use a voice controlled smart device , I know some people who could help you more than I can if that interests you, i'll email them.https://seniorhomecentral.com/four-outstanding-ways-to-use-alexa-for-the-elderly/ I have Ask My Buddy set up on Alexa for my mom."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"Alexa will call anyone on a list you set up, she would just have to say ""Alex ask my buddy to call "" ""."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,It works really well!
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,Here's the info:  https://www.askmybuddy.net/ Hi.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,Thanks for this.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I’ve been researching all of these answers and I believe smart tech is the way to go.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I am having trouble getting a straight answer about whether a cell phone is needed for this to be operational and make phone calls with a voice command.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I can certainly use MY cell phone to set this whole thing up but does it work after that without one?
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I thought I had a handle on this with the help of “echo connect” which makes landline a viable option but apparently they no longer make them.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,If you have a minute ... what’s your situation/set up?
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,We have an Echo Dot and added the Ask My Buddy skill and then added the contact names and phone #'s of people my mom would need to call.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,The program will call cell phones and/or landlines.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I can't remember all the steps I took to set it up but I do know it was pretty easy.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"This should tell you all you need to know about that and they do have Support also:  https://www.askmybuddy.net/quick_start.php Once its all set up all she had to do was say ""Alexa ask My Buddy to alert (name of person) "" It can also send text messages and emails."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I hope that helps!
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,Let me know if you have any other questions.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I am a retired paramedic.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I suggested life alert often to people in the same situation as you are.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,We would respond at least 1 time a day to life alert calls.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,Life alert stays on the line with the person until someone shows up and then they verify we are there and ask us to reset the system.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"No I don't work for them, but I sure have worked with them a lot."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"When it is time for me to get a system, I will be getting them."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,">Looking for insight or experience with any device for essentially summoning  911 or, if we’re getting fancy, a family member."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,My mom recently spent 10 hours in the bathtub because she couldn’t get out by herself.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"Is willing to get something but everything about it needs to be as easy as possible otherwise she won’t do it, understand it, charge it, etc."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,She doesn’t have a cell phone...I wondered if an Alexa or google home might work?
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I know zero about these systems ... or is “life alert” the answer?
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,">Many thanks, and good luck out there!I'm not sure if this will work for her, but I have an Alcatel GO FLIP."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"I have Alexa set up, but parents tend to forget it's there or how to use it to contact me."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I can check in on them with the Echo Show devices in a couple places though.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"There's a company called Senior Safety Alert, that's what we used for my grandmother."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"It has a base with a big red button, that needs to sit in a central location in the house."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"It plugs into an outlet, and also into the phone line."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,Then you get either a watch or a necklace with a button that they wear.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,Pressing the button connects a person who will ask if everything is okay.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"If they can hear you, you say what's wrong, they send help."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"If they can't hear you (you're in the bathroom, it's too far away, etc.)"
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,they send help anyway.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"It's all very easy, there's nothing to charge."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,"The only thing to remember is not to wear the watch/necklace in the shower or bath...lay it nearby so you can reach it, but don't get it wet."
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I am in a similar boat I have narrowed my search down to 1) Medical Guardian or 2) Bay Alarm Medical.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I have combed hundreds of sites and reviews and these are consistently at the top but I am astounded at the lack of in depth fair comparisons out there...
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,The trailing third place would likely be Phillips HomeSafe with AutoAlert and very last of the top 4 would be LifeAlert because I have seen many post from EMT related people saying they get calls from it all the time.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I worked for Philips Lifeline for 13 years.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,It’s a great service.
My mom needs a medical alert “something”,I’m happy to answer any questions about the service that you have!

App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"Since I am a mobile developer my trade, I spent the last year and a half working on an app to help remotely care for an elderly individual- especially one with cognitive impairment."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"Not sure if this is of use or interest to anyone here, but I sure hope so!"
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"I realize this is a Dementia subreddit, not Alzheimer's, and I did share my app in the Alzheimer's subreddit as well- but I was hoping this would be of some use or interest to the community here."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"Would love to get some feedback!Basically: you pair your app with your patient's (grandparent, parent, uncle, etc), and get real-time updates and visualizations about their safety, health, and wellness.This is not your ordinary location tracker: it is chock full of advanced activity and behavior recognition like stress detection, sleep detection, extended inactivity, extreme weather, fall detection, etc."

App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"While there are premium (paid) features, the goal here is not to make any money- just hoping not to lose too much on server related expenses, which are quite high for this app."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"Sincerely,CareerMammal89At least in the case of my loved one with dementia, when an app like this became useful was about the same time she would constantly lose the phone and have difficulty using it."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"I think there is probably limited utility for a smartphone app with many dementia patients because of this.If something like that could be incorporated into a smartwatch app and a caregiver put the watch on the person with a non-removable band, then I could see a lot of utility."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,It would even be useful in institutional environments.
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,That is great feedback.
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,Thank you!
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"I should clarify that this is not an app for Alzheimer's patients- it is broadly an app for tracking elderly, that I hope could be applied to some segment of the elderly population with early stage Alzheimer's or Dementia."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"It may not do much good for an individual who requires round the clock in-person care and supervision already.To your point about smartphone usage in the affected population, I believe there are a couple form factors that might work."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"For example, there are some lanyard-style ways to carry phones I have seen- or a little leather pouch around the waist, for example, if the pocket is not convenient."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,But I completely understand that it will not work for most individuals.
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"If you have any other questions or thoughts, please don't hesitate to reach out."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"In my case, we tried various ways to keep the phone on my sister (I had a tracking app installed), but they all failed."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"Unless they can understand that they need to have the phone with them, then it's not going to work."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"That's one reason why memory care facilities (where my sister now lives) utilize non-removable wristbands that trigger alarms near exits.For non-dementia people, I think it could be a great tool."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"Thanks for the feedback, I totally understand!"
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,I am considering a smartwatch port for android os.
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"Obviously you would have a tracker of some type on the patient, what exactly is it?"
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"Demetia patients lose everything, phones watches, glasses."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,Thanks for the comment.
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,Right now its just a mobile phone app.
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"The mobile phone could be worn in a variety of nonstandard ways, such as around the neck or on the waist, that I hope could help."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"However, I fully realize this will not work for everybody."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,The app was not necessarily designed solely for alzheimer's or dementia- but my hope is that it can serve some purpose.
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"Where does that data get stored during app usage, when it's closed and after it's deleted???"
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,"It is stored in a fully encrypted database, with no personally identifiable information: totally anonymized."
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,Great idea!
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,My mother would def be prying off the cell phone.
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,She’s taken apart and destroyed  many “unbreakables” keep working on it.
App for remote health monitoring of seniors,It will work for some people and is a great idea.

App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,Thank you.Any plans to port this to iOS?
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"If you need help on the (iOS) design side, let me know."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,Thanks for the encouragement!
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,I am looking into an iOS port.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,The first thing I need to figure out is if the iOS operating system allows background processes in the same way Android does.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"Otherwise, tracking would be quite challenging."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"You can request background location services; if the user allows, the system will give you location in the background."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"Otherwise, most processes are permitted in the background, assuming you follow guidelines and get user permission for the private items that require permission."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,Can you elaborate more on how this works?
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,Is the Alz patient supposed to have a smartphone and enter in all that info constantly?
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"I don't get it.My dad is 81 and his tech skills stopped at about the year 2001, he can barely turn on his  flip phone, let alone carry a smartphone around at all times."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,I'm not sure how this app would help me?
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,Thanks for your comment!
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"First of all, I should clarify that this is not an app for Alzheimer's patients- it is broadly an app for tracking elderly, that I hope could be applied to some segment of the elderly population with early stage Alzheimer's or Dementia."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"It may not do much good for an individual who requires round the clock in-person care and supervision already.There were several themes in the design of Peace of Mind:- First, no manual data entry."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"As you correctly point out, many elderly individuals would not do well with self report."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"Those who could, would rather not."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"Therefore, the entire app is automatic AI-based activity and behavior recognition algorithms: no manual data entry required."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"Its quite possible with today's wearable sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"- Secondly, this app is not just for making you aware of emergencies: its also tailored to allowing you to check in periodically and confirm that everything is OK."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"Hence the name ""Peace of Mind""."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"To your point about carrying a smartphone at all times, I believe there are a couple form factors that might work."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"For example, there are some lanyard-style ways to carry phones I have seen- or a little leather pouch around the waist, for example, if the pocket is not convenient.The app would regularly report location, location change, fitness history (daily steps, extended inactivity), stress, fall detection, and a host of other things."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"I'm happy to provide elaborations of how these things work in further detail if anyone is interested.If you do decide to check out Peace of Mind, DM me and I am happy to give you gold membership for free, so you can try out the premium features (goal is not really to make money, but I had to add some monetization features because my server costs are sky high)."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,Thanks for clarifying!
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,You've got some good ideas.I am trying to think of how an app like that would work for me and my situation.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"My dad has mild-moderate dementia, but is still fairly independent (he drives, is ok with all personal self-care such as dressing, etc.)"
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"but lives with me and I help him with a particular health issue and track all his meds, etc."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"He has a flip phone, though mostly it's just for habit because he rarely uses it, I think it is mostly a symbol of his ""independence"" by this point to have it clipped to his belt."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"I have tried many times to teach him what a smartphone is, with limited success."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"I have a gps tracker that I put in his car, and even though the battery is not great, at least it helps me be assured he is not lost."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"It requires a pricey yearly subscription, so if it was already built into another app that would definitely be a plus.I would definitely be interested in giving it a try."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,I could get him one of those very basic smartphones for seniors and talk to him about carrying it around for safety.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,He's gotten lost a few times and I know it kind of scared him so this would give us some peace of mind.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,Does the app have a way to set medication reminders?
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"""Did you take your morning medicines?"""
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,With a big yes/no button.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,That would be super useful.Another would be to have a way for me to set a calendar with automatic reminders of upcoming medical appointments.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"He likes to know about what's happening in advance, so something like ""Reminder!"
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,You have an appointment with Dr. Smith tomorrow at 11:00am!
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"Sally will be by to pick you up at 10:30am."""
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"With additional reminders closer to the time, say 30 minutes prior, or something.How does the app measure stress levels?"
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,Can you expand on that?
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"'Anyway, sure, I'll DM you."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,I'll give it a try.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,">I have tried many times to teach him what a smartphone is, with limited success.I totally understand the struggle!"
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"If you could get him in the habit of carrying a smartphone around with him and charging it nightly, he would not need to interact with it in any other meaningful way for Peace of Mind to work."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,The app is very simple in its interface and really just runs in the background.> I would definitely be interested in giving it a try.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,I could get him one of those very basic smartphones for seniors and talk to him about carrying it around for safety.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,He's gotten lost a few times and I know it kind of scared him so this would give us some peace of mind.That's great to hear!
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,Hearing about someone interested in this (after all the world involved) is a huge morale boost for me.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,I'd love to keep in touch with you through the process to learn more about how your experience is going.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"When selecting an Android phone, please make sure it runs at least Android 7.0 or higher (almost all new phones do, but just double check)."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"Also, Huawei on some occasions does not play well with background processes to save battery, which can be annoying."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"I believe Motorola phones are a good choice for this app, though it should work on almost everything.> Does the app have a way to set medication reminders?"
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"""Did you take your morning medicines?"""
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,With a big yes/no button.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"That would be super useful.As far as medication reminders and appointments, unfortunately, no such functionality yet."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"I decided for this app to go with all automatic behavior monitoring, to distinguish myself from the other apps on the market (lots of them do alarms, reminders, medication, but very few are holistic behavior monitoring solutions)."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"However, I am definitely open to expanding the app functionality in the future."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"I assume your yes/no button would be on the patient side of the app, encouraging them to manage their own medication, correct?"
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,Rather than reminding the caregiver to administer the medication on the caregiver app?
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,> How does the app measure stress levels?
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,Can you expand on that?
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"'Current methods of stress assessment with wearables use heart rate variability, or galvanic skin response (usually the former, since the latter is overly noisy and requires special sensors)."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"Since Peace of Mind is an app for phones rather than watches, in this case I do neither."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"Instead, I am estimating stress with several different metrics including (but not limited to) the following: - The number of times the phone screen is turned on and off recently - The number of times the device is picked up and put down recently - Any pacing behavior observed recently (transitioning from walking to idle rapidly, multiple times in the last few hours).In addition to fusing this data into a single stress score that is graphed over time, I also provide a breakdown so you can observe individual metrics: fidgeting, restlessness, inactivity, etc."
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,"Of course this is by no means perfect, but my hope is that it adds another layer of actionable information into the app dashboard.Thank you for your interest!"
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,Really appreciate your support.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,My MIL couldn’t operate a phone or a radio.
App for caring for someone with Alzheimer's,But she could talk to Alexa and ask Alexa to play music & ask Alexa about news & weather.

Attractive medical alerts,Attractive medical alerts Hi guys— my father recently passed away and now my mom lives alone.
Attractive medical alerts,"I’m looking for a medical alert bracelet/necklace/watch that looks like jewelry, not a medical device."
Attractive medical alerts,I’m not sure if she wants monitored or unmonitored.
Attractive medical alerts,Google hasn’t shown anything.
Attractive medical alerts,Anyone know of anything?
Attractive medical alerts,"I’m thinking of the Apple Watch, but my mom is pretty scared of tech, so I’m reluctant."
Attractive medical alerts,She does have an iPhone tho.
Attractive medical alerts,TIA!What do you want it to do?
Attractive medical alerts,Call 911 if she falls?
Attractive medical alerts,Measure her heart rate?
Attractive medical alerts,Just have her medical info on it?
Attractive medical alerts,I want it to call 911 or a family member at the press of a button or using a voice command.
Attractive medical alerts,Thanks!
Attractive medical alerts,"Oh dear, so sorry to hear of the loss of your dad."
Attractive medical alerts,"For full disclosure, I am a founder of a comprehensive global medical alert and emergency ID system called iCE Angel - ID."
Attractive medical alerts,"We use two ""trigger"" points for an emergency alert: (i) app panic buttons on Apple and Android phones and watches that are good to use if your mum is conscious and able at the time; and more significantly (ii) QR codes that can be scanned with any phone by any rescuer or passer-by if your mum is unconscious or unable to self-help."
Attractive medical alerts,"From an aesthetic point of view, our panic button is an app on the phone or watch; while the QR code is given to you in two downloadable template formats (a) as an emergency ID card on a wallet-sized template that you can self-print and laminate as many as you want (I leave them in my wallet, on the back of my phone cover, on my bike, and in each of my backpacks) and (b) as emergency ID photo image to place on your phone’s lockscreen."
Attractive medical alerts,"In addition, you could also (c) create your own wearable IDs by printing the QR code on anything else, for example, I’ve engraved mine on an army-type dog tag."
Attractive medical alerts,"FYI, all medics worldwide are trained to look for medical alerts in wallets, wristband, necklace, and phones."
Attractive medical alerts,"The two aforementioned trigger options – panic button and QR code - are independent of each other, meaning you can use either or both, but in all cases, phone numbers will automatically be exchanged between the person initiating the trigger (in this case - your mum, or her rescuer) and the emergency contact persons (in this case - you) so that a call can be initiated by either party."
Attractive medical alerts,"In all cases, you will also receive emergency text notification via various channels like email / app push message / FB messenger to ensure you SEE the emergency alert because incoming voice calls alone can too easily be missed or unanswered during our regular busy lives – whereas emergency text messages are very “in your face”."
Attractive medical alerts,Once you open the alert you can also see the pinned location point of where the alert was triggered.
Attractive medical alerts,"All the above is free forever for a single user (one account, one user)."
Attractive medical alerts,"We have a premium upgrade option that enables the account holder (for example you) to add an administer up to four additional “dependent” members via your account (for example mum, grandpa, and two young kids) who are not tech-savvy enough or too young to administer their own accounts."
Attractive medical alerts,"And you are able to upload and securely store a very comprehensive “Rescue wallet” for every member that includes insurance details, medical history, living wills, organ donor status, and other emergency records."
Attractive medical alerts,"For security and privacy, the Rescue Wallet is only ever shared with the member’s nominated emergency contact person(s), and only when an alert has been triggered."
Attractive medical alerts,It is up to the emergency contact person to then use their discretion and to when to on-share the Rescue wallet and with whom.
Attractive medical alerts,The premium upgrade is only USD 15 per YEAR – and right now we’re in the midst of a 3-month #TWOL campaign where we’re giving away 100% of our revenue to several amazing organisations around the world that leverage the funds to sustain starving daily wage workers.
Attractive medical alerts,Wishing your mum well... feel free to pm me if you have any questions.
Attractive medical alerts,Thanks— this sounds like a great product but not what I’m looking for.
Attractive medical alerts,I need something independent of a phone or watch as she doesn’t always walk around with her phone and an Apple Watch is too complex for her.
Attractive medical alerts,"Just looking for a simple, good looking device with a button or speech recognition for calling 911/ a series of emergency contacts."
Feel like I'm losing it.,Feel like I'm losing it.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"Alright this is a bit of a doozy, I'm going to preface this by saying I have crippling social anxiety, I can't handle confrontation- At all-, and I'm a shrinking violet when things get bad i just fold into myself and take it."
Feel like I'm losing it.,So this a first for me but I'm desperate to get this off my chest or at least vent a bit.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"When I turned 18, my mothers sisters daughter (think my cousin?)"
Feel like I'm losing it.,"moved into our home after a bad breakup (it involved her having a husband and a fiancee at the same time, wonderful drama that) she took my room and."
Feel like I'm losing it.,I ended up moving in with my grandparents to take care of them as they were no longer able to drive/do things themselves.
Feel like I'm losing it.,(my grandfather had just gotten his license revoked for driving 15 on a 45 street) It was originally mutually beneficial I took care of what needed to be done around the house and for them and I had a rent free home.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"Year 1 was great, I was going to college and feeling good about where I was in life."
Feel like I'm losing it.,After the first year or so however things changed.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"My grandfather was a very demanding and old fashioned man, he was the Man of the house and anything he said was law, that was fine."
Feel like I'm losing it.,However he decided that both me and my grandmother (his wife of 60+ yrs) didn't need to know he was dying of cancer.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"All the sudden doctors appointments went from two or so a week to almost every day most with long drives and waiting hours in waiting rooms, I've waited all my life however so it didn't bother me too much, I pulled back from being a full time student to a class at night."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"(honestly I didn't need to pull back so far but I was using all the extra work at home as a pleasant excuse to avoid school, more on this later)."
Feel like I'm losing it.,Year three to five were rough.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"I dropped out of college completely to be at home in case I was urgently needed (it happened frequently) My grandfather slowly lost the ability to eat or speak all the while he would tell us he was fine and forcefully move the conversation on, I honestly don't know how I didn't fully pick up on it (I had suspicions but would never have guessed it was as bad as it was.)"
Feel like I'm losing it.,"He lost most of his balance, and became unable to properly care for himself, so I started bathing him, cleaning up when he soiled himself and such."
Feel like I'm losing it.,His skin was also paper thin and he would fall attempting things he knew he shouldn't leaving me to try to bandage what looked like someone took a cheese grater to his arm or w/e he fell onto and sloughed off a massive chunk.
Feel like I'm losing it.,(this happened monthly with me eventually learning how to treat it myself without the ever fun trips to the ER).
Feel like I'm losing it.,Anyway It was wild for a while until the cancer eventually took away his ability to eat and he had to go into hospice.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"(""The Family""tm decided my mom would stop by to help out when possible which I'm eternally grateful for) I just wasn't in me to watch my grandfather pass so, I hid myself up in my room and only came out rarely however I did speak to him before he passed and got everything off my chest in the end making a silent vow to take care of my grandmother fully until the end."
Feel like I'm losing it.,And so 3-4 days after he initially couldn't swallow he passed on.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Now is where things start to get bad.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"my grandmother I guess the best way to put it is ""knows her place""."
Feel like I'm losing it.,(when referencing the old timely women take care of the house and kids and NOTHING else.)
Feel like I'm losing it.,so once my grandfather died I had to deal with a woman lost in the world who now got to make her own choices it's sad but she only really started living once he passed and she was in her late 80s.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"So dealing with the grief and trying to take care of her was a bundle of joy (for the first two to three months she would just sit watching the recording of the funeral and cry, all day."
Feel like I'm losing it.,Probably not the healthiest thing ever but I wasn't sure what to really do so I just let it be.)
Feel like I'm losing it.,"Anyway, I'm now taking care of a grief laden widow of 65\~years who would have panic attacks if I left the house for too long."
Feel like I'm losing it.,As more time passes she becomes more and more controlling.
Feel like I'm losing it.,She gave all financial responsibility to my uncle and wouldn't let me really help with paying bills or anything like that for her.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"I'm not allowed to leave the house, If i visit family or go anywhere I have to call and check in with her, I have a 9pm curfew(established after I spent too much time talking to my brother and lost track of time coming home to a sobbing and hysterical grandmother), she follows a step or so behind me in the kitchen when I try to make her food, she constantly CONSTANTLY tells me shes alone she has no one while I'm standing next to her, (because of where I live i use baby monitors around the house so if anything goes wrong I'll hear if she calls for me) she tried calling me once, but due to my mothers earlier visit (she accidently changed the com channel) I couldn't hear so she called the police."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"(That was a fun one, open up the door and EMT+firemen standing there asking if I needed help) Came downstairs to hysterics again."
Feel like I'm losing it.,anyway it goes and goes and goes.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"So here I am now almost a decade later (9ys) I go to bed, have a nice horrifying night terror that transitions into what I can only vaguely express as waking from a fugue state, all the sudden everything that didn't bother me came rocketing back to me."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"It was like something grabbing hold of my chest and just wouldn't let go, each time I tried to calm myself a new horrifying revelation would strike."
Feel like I'm losing it.,Something snapped and I sat in bed crying for the next 15 hours until I forced myself to get up and at least cry in the tub so I did that for a while.
Feel like I'm losing it.,All the while non stop back to back all I can think of is that I have nothing at all.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"I have no real education (I had to get an adult school diploma and then only got through about two years worth of college credits) I have no money, I'm not being paid to take care of my grandparents."
Feel like I'm losing it.,I have absolutely insane social anxiety to the point where it's crippling and just the idea of trying to go out and apply to jobs / meet new people physically makes me ill.
Feel like I'm losing it.,I lived an extremely sedentary lifestyle and gained almost 30 pounds due to doing nothing and stress eating while staying here.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"I tell all this to my grandmother and she tells me that she also worried what I would do when she passes, however she ""wants me to understand I need to make my own money so she won't be paying me for taking care of her"" I brought up some of the programs to get state aid and possibly be paid through them however she flat out refused."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"(I'm also not going to be inheriting anything it all goes to my father and his brother for them to split 50/50)  So I just agreed with her and then went to my moms house and just spent the entire day crying, now three days later and I just don't know what to do."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"I feel broken, I feel like what I do isn't enough, I'm not nearly good enough to do anything, I feel like my memory is failing me, that it's getting harder to remember things that should come easily."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"My anxiety would selfdestruct any chance of employment(interviewers dislike panic attacks), I have no idea how to be an adult, I can't leave the house to work, I can't leave the house without her going into a meltdown(before covid and especially after), I'm not intelligent enough to go for any of the STEM jobs that would let me work from home, I've turned into a fat wet noodle, I used to be fairly active and loved swimming now I can't even walk up two flights of stairs without going out of breath and sweating."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"I don't have any real work nor world experience, and it's unending."
Feel like I'm losing it.,So after a day with my mother(Quarantine be damned I needed her so I went) I've now signed up for school again and am trying to get a degree (in what I have no idea because unfortunately I have no real interests but I'll probably sort it out through trial of elimination of what would I rather do less.)
Feel like I'm losing it.,but it's adding to the crushing feeling of anxiety knowing I'm going to have to go back to school and be around more people and all the damned interaction that's required.
Feel like I'm losing it.,compounding that is this new fun undercurrent SCREAMING into the back of my head to DO MORE NOW MORE NOW and it just hurts.
Feel like I'm losing it.,I'm just so damned tired personally I don't see myself having lived a hard life.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"I've never been materialistic, I've always enjoyed just being alone somewhere so the isolation was pleasant for me, I've had everything I needed to survive I've never wanted for food and I don't believe I've ever truly struggled but I just feel so old and tired and worn down that it's hard to see a reason to keep going."
Feel like I'm losing it.,So here I am just kind of putting some of it into writing.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"honestly any advice would be truly appreciated I'm just in such a bad place right now that my entire mind feels like an exposed nerve, errant thoughts twinge like biting foil and I can't seem to sleep well or calm down."
Feel like I'm losing it.,There's honestly so much that it's daunting to write it all out and I'm giving the barest of overviews there's just so much that trying to write it down would be an exercise in futility.
Feel like I'm losing it.,but i Need to do something to calm down and this was one of the only things that I thought of after reading a ton of how to be an adult stuff.
Feel like I'm losing it.,I apologize if this reads like a shotgun blast of just stuff but I'm emotionally compromised exhausted and just so tired and burnt out that It's the best I'm currently capable of.Here’s my piece(s) of advice for what it’s worth.

Feel like I'm losing it.,"I do need to be my grandmothers live in caretaker, there's so much I left out of the main post but she is fully blind in one eye and losing her sight and I'm expecting her to be fully blind in the next year or so, she was injured when she was younger and has two herniated discs + horrible arthur so she can't move her head and is in constant debilitating pain but refuses to take any kind of pain medication."
Feel like I'm losing it.,(it took me over five years to convince her to swap from asprin to norco and even now she takes the lowest dose possible and cuts it in half) and of course she also has horrible anxiety.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Anyway If I leave she'll worry herself to death and I don't think I would be able to handle that.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Not to mention the guilt of going back on my word to my grandfather on his deathbed.
Feel like I'm losing it.,It just isn't an option for me.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"If you won't move out or insist on being paid then insist on them hiring a caregiver for daytime so you can go to work and school and you can be the night shift for your grandma.Also, instead of super big steps (like demanding pay for services or insistingthey hire a caregiver), start small like I did to take your life back..."
Feel like I'm losing it.,I started walking.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"Just a little at first, then more."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"When I reached 5 miles a few times a week, I got a cheap bike."
Feel like I'm losing it.,I found I love riding.
Feel like I'm losing it.,I started that 5 years ago after a long challenging spell with my husband.
Feel like I'm losing it.,I am making huge strides in my personal journey to not keeping myself a caregiver-doormat.
Feel like I'm losing it.,You can too.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Start small.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"Just get up, right now and walk around the block."
Feel like I'm losing it.,Then do it again tomorrow and the next day.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"When you feel ready, go for two blocks, then three."
Feel like I'm losing it.,Taking that time will help you sort out your thoughts and the exercise will kick out those fabulous endorphins.
Feel like I'm losing it.,You will start to see more clearly and more completely what you need and how to make it happen.You've got this.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"(((hugs))) Well, you've got me crying again but I took your advice and went out for a 15 min or so walk there was the stress of having my grandmother home alone and all the horrible things she could be getting up to but it did help and it's something I'll strive to continue."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"As for the daytime caregiver, We initially had one come in but that ended after my grandfather died and my family decided that because I was only taking care of my grandmother now we no longer needed the help, they were also reluctant to have her spending so much money on help when free labor was here."
Feel like I'm losing it.,it's not something that's pleasant to bring up and because of my fears and insecurities not something I would willingly bring up myself :/.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"It's fairly disturbing how much I'm praised as self sacrificing, how it's such a great thing I'm doing, how few people could actually do what I do when in truth I'm just resigned."
Feel like I'm losing it.,anyway enough maudlin I really do appreciate all the help from you and everyone else here.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"The pure feeling of relief that I've gotten today from all of you, of learning that I'm not alone that there are and will be more in the same place as me even if we're different our core responsibility is the same it's made me feel like I might be able to get through this."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"It hasn't gotten better, it isn't going to get better and it's going to get a whole lot worse but at least I'm not alone, and I never really knew how much that meant until I was directed here."
Feel like I'm losing it.,So really thank you all from the center of my being and I'm getting emotional again so I need to stop rambling but yea.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Why are you the only one who can take care of your grandmother?
Feel like I'm losing it.,She has other family members.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"She is also eligible for paid aides to come in, through her insurance or Medicare or Medicaid."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"It may not be what she wants, but she doesn’t get full control of this situation, or of you."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"So don’t cave and let things be, you need to fight to get some freedom and some air - so you can breathe and start the kind of life you want to live."
Feel like I'm losing it.,Stand up and insist changes be made.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Start by talking to your Mom about it all.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Best of luck.
Feel like I'm losing it.,There are a slew of reasons why I got the job and why we don't have paid aides mostly family pressure and expectations that I can't really argue against.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Generally if I do bring it up I'm told I don't have to pay rent so it's not in her benefit it's in mine.
Feel like I'm losing it.,(my grandmother is good at turning things around on me like this to make my problems actually her problems) she also gas lights me to relatives where she tells them all I do nothing at all when I'm not around to defend myself so they turn against me.
Feel like I'm losing it.,My mom knows though and has been my support through it all but I'm fairly sure my uncle hates me even though my mom tells him so I've taken to avoiding him when he visits which exasperates the problem.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"I don't fight, I'm all fought out, I just take it, and wilt, and crumble, and break down."
Feel like I'm losing it.,It's happened before but never to this extent.
Feel like I'm losing it.,I just woke up and everything was different and it will never be the same and it will never be ok again and it's terrifying.
Feel like I'm losing it.,but I have a little light in the dark now so I can at least pretend to be alright even if I feel like I'm dying on the inside and maybe I might make it to the light and find out it isn't a cliff.
Feel like I'm losing it.,I do appreciate the advice and am truly thankful for it.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"Also, you have job-related skills but don't realize it."
Feel like I'm losing it.,You're a faithful caregiver and demonstrate excellent writing skills.
Feel like I'm losing it.,I go to these reality recap websites where someone blogs/recaps a reality show and people subsequently comment on it.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Sometimes they look for new writers.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Maybe you could find a little side-hustle like that?...not a full time job but something that will boost your confidence.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"Also, volunteering somewhere can help boost your confidence and isn't too stressful."
Feel like I'm losing it.,It's something that could build-up your resume also.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Seems like both you and your gramma need to be treated for anxiety/depression.
Feel like I'm losing it.,It's crippling and has paralyzed you into thinking you can't get out of a hopeless situation.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Can you scrape up enough money for a doctor's appt?
Feel like I'm losing it.,"I know it's expensive but the doctor could prescribe you an effective, generic anti-depressant."
Feel like I'm losing it.,There's so many helpful anti-Ds now that have lost their patents and so are cheap now.
Feel like I'm losing it.,You'll need to explain to the doctor your insurance/financial situation so they prescribe something generic and affordable.
Feel like I'm losing it.,A good anti-depressant and appropriate dose can help both your depression and anxiety.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"I've taken Effexor for 20 yrs and it has really helped me manage my generalized anxiety, more so than depression even."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"Once you get in a good place with your mental health, you can be in a better place to manage your gramma and her mental health and unreasonable demands."

Feel like I'm losing it.,"It's something to think about for sure, I'll try to see what I can do about getting to a doctor."
Feel like I'm losing it.,Out of curiosity is it something a therapist would be able to prescribe?
Feel like I'm losing it.,At the moment I might have to decide between going to a therapist or a doc at least until Jan. most therapist can't prescribe meds unless they're a therapist/medical doctor.
Feel like I'm losing it.,you'd probably really benefit from therapy and they can assess whether you need to see a doctor for meds.
Feel like I'm losing it.,good luck!
Feel like I'm losing it.,"Hey, i’m really moved by your predicament and i commend your efforts in doing the best you can."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"Caring for someone is inarticulably exhausting, yet its not always visible and easily acknowledged  (like your relatives).Unfortunately other stuff is out of my depths but if i had one advice, it would be to leave yourself a nugget of time everyday or even every week."
Feel like I'm losing it.,"Im also very conflict averse, and thus have trouble setting personal space, but in your case it seems to have made you a sponge soaking up other people’s problems  without having time to take care of yourself."
Feel like I'm losing it.,This ‘self-time’ can be as simple as taking a walk everyday.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Communicate with your grandma and slowly allocate some time of the day for yourself.
Feel like I'm losing it.,I think walks can help build up some social confodence over time (e.g can progressively build towards greet stramgers with a nod or simple hello )i hope my outsiders take isnt too arrogant but You need to help set some borders and boundaries for your grandma.
Feel like I'm losing it.,Its what she needs in life - shes swimming with no direction after the passing of your grandpa.
Feel like I'm losing it.,"This is is in a way also what you need to do for yourself, so its both you and your grandma working together rather than just you tolling away."
Feel like I'm losing it.,Your life is VALUABLE.

Controlling TV Remotely?,Controlling TV Remotely?
Controlling TV Remotely?,"Hello All,Has anyone had experience with getting a TV set up so that it can be controlled entirely remotely?"
Controlling TV Remotely?,"I'm interested in getting this done for my Grandma who can no longer figure out how to operate hers by herself (we have a remote with large buttons, she's constantly dropping it where she can't reach, trying to operate it backwards, pointing it at the ceiling, etc...).She doesn't have WiFi currently as she's never needed it, but I'd have it set up if it could solve this problem."
Controlling TV Remotely?,"I would get a WiFi hotspot as a temporary solution, but I'm assuming the streaming services would eat up the data allowance on those pretty quickly."
Controlling TV Remotely?,"That said, I've never used one so maybe it's an option.I feel like there has to be a way if I got her internet access and a Roku or Amazon Fire to turn her TV into a ""smart"" one, but I don't know if that would allow me to actually see the TV to know what I'm doing?"
Controlling TV Remotely?,"Also, only vaguely related, does anyone have a Portal type device set up so that they can easily video chat with their parent/loved one without them having to do anything to answer?"
Controlling TV Remotely?,Basically I can just connect on my end and we can see each other?
Controlling TV Remotely?,"I'm looking into ViewClix, which seems to be the only option."
Controlling TV Remotely?,"Seems incredibly overpriced but other than that, exactly what I need.Any advice would be welcomed!"
Controlling TV Remotely?,"!I saw a comment a while ago about how to use the Alexa Drop In feature for parents in nursing homes that I thought was super helpful: https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fv3one/mom_locked_down_in_nursing_home_gift_ideas/fmgpg7n/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf If you have Comcast, you can download a remote app on your phone to change channels I bought the Flipper remote for my moms TVs."
Controlling TV Remotely?,$40 eachOne in her family room operates the TV w/ cable.
Controlling TV Remotely?,Her bedroom TV is on an antenna.
Controlling TV Remotely?,They are both older TVs so I had to try remote codes till I found ones that worked.
Controlling TV Remotely?,"https://flipperremote.comIt’s a 5 button remote (power, channel up, channel down, volume up, volume down)."
Controlling TV Remotely?,"There is a panel you can open (not easily, so mom doesn’t try - in fact she doesn’t realize it’s there) and you can set it up, program which channels to cycle thru, program what devices to turn on/off, etc.I also put in Internet at $60 a month, 50 Mbps download, 3Mbps upload and installed 2 Amazon Shows so we can drop in."
Controlling TV Remotely?,She loves them.
Controlling TV Remotely?,I turned off all the options I could on the Show and in standby mode it runs thru photo albums.
Controlling TV Remotely?,Also put in a Nest Hello video doorbell I can answer on my phone and 4 Nest indoor cameras so I can check she is OK.  She knows about all the cameras & I’ve showed them to her and the video I can see on my phone.
Controlling TV Remotely?,"None point into bathrooms but do point down hallways, etc."
Controlling TV Remotely?,All the cameras have helped my anxiety over her being OK. It’s also nice to see if she is awake before I drive over.
Controlling TV Remotely?,"In fact, I find I’m spending more time there now.Anyway, we have all this technology available so why not use it."
Controlling TV Remotely?,I know the situation is fluid and will be changing but I’m more comfortable with her aging in place right now & willing to put off moving her in with me.Good luck finding a solution to your current TV issue!

Advice re parent getting lost.,Advice re parent getting lost.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Thank you for taking the time to read this.
Advice re parent getting lost.,My mother has Alzheimer’s and lives alone in an apartment.
Advice re parent getting lost.,She’s been managing okay (with me doing everything for her).
Advice re parent getting lost.,Her life is pretty limited.
Advice re parent getting lost.,"She walks to a nearby supermarket, restaurant and GP all of which are within 50m north place."
Advice re parent getting lost.,Last night I took her to the local gelato place — 50m south of her place.
Advice re parent getting lost.,She was completely at a loss to where we were or the direction home.
Advice re parent getting lost.,This is a big shift and concerning.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Does anyone have any advice on managing getting lost?
Advice re parent getting lost.,She’s not ‘wandering as such—ie randomly walking off—but seems inevitable she’ll get lost soon.
Advice re parent getting lost.,All the tracking devices I’ve come across seem to have terrible reviews and also short battery lives.
Advice re parent getting lost.,I can’t see her everyday to recharge a tracker and she won’t remember to do so.Would love any advice.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Thanks in advance.
Advice re parent getting lost.,🙏🏻I bought something called iTrack on Amazon.
Advice re parent getting lost.,It's a little tracker that can be clipped to a belt or attached to a lanyard around the neck.
Advice re parent getting lost.,"The device itself is inexpensive but you pay for a subscription, it can track worldwide (which I'll need in a couple months so it's worth it to me)."
Advice re parent getting lost.,"The battery is pretty good, depends on how often you have it ""ping"" to report where it is."
Advice re parent getting lost.,It's got a way to set a perimeter around your home and it'll send an alarm when it goes through it.
Advice re parent getting lost.,"Aside from that, I guess what you can do is make sure your mom carries with her some sort of ID with her address in case she gets lost and asks for help."
Advice re parent getting lost.,"They make bracelets you can order that you can customize with her name, address, medical info, etc."
Advice re parent getting lost.,Will check it out.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Thanks!
Advice re parent getting lost.,Check with your local law enforcement.
Advice re parent getting lost.,There’s something called Project Lifesaver in my area that provides a tracking bracelet or anklet.
Advice re parent getting lost.,"If your loved one elopes, you contact them and they use their device’s radio frequency to track them down."
Advice re parent getting lost.,Yes good idea.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Will do.
Advice re parent getting lost.,In conjunction with the devices the others have suggested would some kind of daily/ every other day in home support be an option for you?
Advice re parent getting lost.,"With that, part of their regular duties could be ensuring that the device is charged and on her person when they leave."
Advice re parent getting lost.,"I would also suggest some sort of door alarm so that, at the very least, you could be notified when she leaves."
Advice re parent getting lost.,There are also locks that can be operated remotely so that way she has to notify you of her intentions when leaving.
Advice re parent getting lost.,"I can understand if that would feel uncomfortable, but her safety is paramount."
Advice re parent getting lost.,"Lastly, even in the absence of a special program, you can contact her local police station, make them aware of the situation and provide them with her information, possibly including taking her for a livescan for ID purposes, so that if they find her without ID lost, they can identify her easily, return her home and notify you."
Advice re parent getting lost.,Best of luck to you and your mother.
Advice re parent getting lost.,I understand what you are going through and for what it’s worth you have my sympathies.
Advice re parent getting lost.,The charging is the problem with all of these.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Battery capacity is linked to size.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Anything that would last a week would be the size of a brick.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Unobtrusive ones that could fit on a keychain do need to be charged every 1-2 days.
Advice re parent getting lost.,"(It does depend on the refresh/ping rate, but we’ve had two trackers, and even at the slowest setting, on a 2G network, we couldn’t make them last longer than that.)"
Advice re parent getting lost.,If you can see her every other day it could work.
Advice re parent getting lost.,We’re using Tracki right now and it’s decent.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Costs 20 or so a month (you need to subscribe to get wifi access to do the tracking).
Advice re parent getting lost.,"The other issue for me with these was getting my mom to wear it, and charge it."
Advice re parent getting lost.,My dad couldn’t keep up with it either even though he was just aging and didn’t have dementiaHe basically went everywhere with her.
Advice re parent getting lost.,"One time i remember she got lost and called, we found her , but it scared dad and I."
Advice re parent getting lost.,Hope you find an answer.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Thanks everyone for the great ideas.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Lots to think about.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Much appreciated!
Advice re parent getting lost.,If people around the neighborhood know her you could talk to them explaining the situation and asking then to keep an eye on where she goes.With my mother-in-law we attached address tags to her outdoor clothes while she was still living alone.
Advice re parent getting lost.,That helped a couple of times and total strangers helped her get home.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Thanks :) I’ve done this—although she keeps removing them lol But I put them back and she’s starting to not notice them.
Advice re parent getting lost.,Same here.
Advice re parent getting lost.,"We've put up notices around the home with directions to things like the toilet, and she kept ripping them off."
Advice re parent getting lost.,"We kept putting them up and eventually she stopped ripping them off, and now only rarely asks about the whereabouts of things."
Advice re parent getting lost.,Persistence and patience seem to do the trick.

Mom keeps losing her key,Mom keeps losing her key My mom is in assisted living and her memory is deteriorating.
Mom keeps losing her key,Lately she keeps losing her room key.
Mom keeps losing her key,"I attached the key to the strap on her purse, but she removed the key and wore it on her wrist (wrist coil with key ring)."
Mom keeps losing her key,"Staff has replaced the key twice already, and she lost it again today."
Mom keeps losing her key,"The facility is secure so there is no problem with leaving her room unlocked, but I don't know how I can help her keep track of it."
Mom keeps losing her key,"Any suggestions?Can you attach a Tile to it so it can be located with a phone?Also, a lanyard that goes around her neck might be less likely to get mislaid."
Mom keeps losing her key,Hopefully the tile that sticks.
Mom keeps losing her key,The one on the keychain didn’t work for my dad because he kept removing it.
Mom keeps losing her key,Thank you for the suggestions!My kids suggested a lanyard too.
Mom keeps losing her key,"It's bigger than a wrist coil, and a really loud color like hot pink would be very conspicuous if she leaves it lying around.I wasn't familiar with the Tile so I googled it."
Mom keeps losing her key,"Unfortunately Mom does not have a smartphone so I don't think a Tile would work for her, but it looks like a really cool device!"
Mom keeps losing her key,"Is she friends with a neighbor, that she can keep the key there instead of carrying it with her?"
Mom keeps losing her key,Or in her bra if she is able to um ... still carry things that way?
Mom keeps losing her key,Thank you!
Mom keeps losing her key,"She has very nice neighbors, but the residents are elderly and many have memory issues themselves."
Mom keeps losing her key,I hadn't thought of carrying it in her bra... Maybe she can pin it there or a little clip.
Mom keeps losing her key,"I had the key on a ring attached to the strap of her purse, but she took it off and started wearing it on her wrist."
Mom keeps losing her key,"She takes it off her wrist to sleep, and then it ""disappears""."
Mom keeps losing her key,"So, I could see the same thing happening if she pins it to her bra or anywhere else."
Mom keeps losing her key,"She also tends to put things away for ""safekeeping"" and then forgets where she put them."
Mom keeps losing her key,Have you asked the employees?
Mom keeps losing her key,I bet they’ve had this happen a lot.
Mom keeps losing her key,They may have a solution.
Mom keeps losing her key,Will do.
Mom keeps losing her key,Thanks.
Mom keeps losing her key,Would it work to leave her room unlocked?
Mom keeps losing her key,It might remove a frustration for her.
Mom keeps losing her key,Thank you!
Mom keeps losing her key,"That would be the simplest solution, but I think Mom just wants to have a key because she thinks she lives in a hotel and ""I'm paying for my hotel room so the hotel should give me a room key."""
Mom keeps losing her key,"Sometimes she says ""the hotel never gave me a key when I moved in."""
Mom keeps losing her key,"All the rooms open to interior hallways and the facility is secure, so it's very safe."
Mom keeps losing her key,"She seems to be without a key most of the time now, so the room is unlocked anyway."

Mom keeps losing her key,Are the staff okay with that?
Mom keeps losing her key,Thank you!
Mom keeps losing her key,"Yes, the place is very safe."
Mom keeps losing her key,All the rooms open to interior hallways and the facility is secure - there are always staff members 24/7.
Mom keeps losing her key,"If I don't get her a big lanyard to wear around her neck, another possibility might be to hang it on the back of her door."
Mom keeps losing her key,"The doors have dead bolts only, so she can't lock herself out."

Mom keeps losing her key,"My apartment has deadbolts, that helps me, too."
Mom keeps losing her key,Just wanted to say this is normal.
Mom keeps losing her key,"Mom always worries she'll lose stuff, so she'll put it somewhere she can't forget, then forgets."

Mom keeps losing her key,I had to laugh when you said your Mom hasn't outgrown vanity.
Mom keeps losing her key,"Do you get her a replacement key every time, or does she just leave the door unlocked?"
Mom keeps losing her key,LOL to the hidden purse!
Mom keeps losing her key,Mom does this too with anything she deems important - from throat lozenges to her wallet.
Mom keeps losing her key,"And of course she doesn't do it, nameless other people break in and hide her stuff."

I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,I asked everyone to step out for a few moments.
I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,He doesn't realize that his words indicated he believed by mother was killed by the hospital and he's threatening legal action.

I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,"The overwhelming smell was back immediately and again generated a phone call from management.Three years ago, he placed a corn bag in the microwave to warm it."

I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6mpocu/a_short_and_simple_screening_test_for_early/ Thanks for posting this !
I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,Neuropsych intern here.
I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,He likely will be referred to a neuropsychologist for an assessment.
I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,"It’s hard to say if he will be cooperative in the testing based on what you’ve said, but I hope he is."
I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,Neuropsych assessments are able to provide nuance that brain scans can’t always and help determine exactly what might be going on.
I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,Hope all goes well!
I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,Oh my word.
I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,"My heart goes out to you because the lack of insight into their situation is so difficult to manage & it really can feel like, in terms of mitigation, you ""solve"" one problem, only to uncover 50 more."

I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,"The tests that will be done, neurologically, SHOULD reveal enough to the physician, but I would also make a list with approximate dates with the type of things you've mentioned here, & give that to the Dr. (out of view if this will upset Dad) to give them a much more well rounded history of what's been going on & for how long."
I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,"You could also call in advance & ask to speak to the Neurologist yourself, to give them a heads up."
I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,"Not sure what the POA situation is with your Dad, but in my personal experience, it doesn't get better than it is currently, so if he's struggling with knowing if a bill is indeed a bill, it's time to look at ways protect him, & his finances, so that you know that his needs will be met, safely & it removes the responsibility & worry from him."
I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.,I know this is scary & overwhelming but you're not alone.

Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"At this point, it's a long and fairly slow decline."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,Recently I ran across a photo from about 20 years ago and emotionally was slammed with the realization that the guy in it bears no resemblance to who he is now.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,I guess the daily slog sort of masked the magnitude.He has difficulty word-finding.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"He will stand in another room and yell ""what is this?"""
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,and if I don't know (because I'm off in another room) he'll get furious and demand to know why I don't come look.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"Or he'll say, ""you know, when you're that person who is doing that thing, but like, famous"" and if I can't mind-read, he'll slam his fists and accuse me of ""gaslighting"" because ""obviously"" I know."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"In particular, he seems to be losing nouns."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,He is also falling victim to inertia - has trouble initiating activity.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"For example, he'll say that he ""always"" does the dishes."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"He's at home during the quarantine, and occasionally does them, but the spatial understanding of the device seems lost to him."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,I'll find dishes & glasses shoved together so tightly that it's a miracle nothing shattered.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"Or, he'll empty it half way, then start adding dirty dishes in with clean."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,Or run it half full.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"I never know what I'll find.Also, and this one really troubles me, he ""remembers"" things that I did, but thinks he did them."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,It's making me constantly check & question myself.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"Or he'll meld different memories as if they were simultaneous, even though the actual events were years apart."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,He has some paranoia.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"Any conversation I have with our adult children, he assumes we are talking about him in a gossipy way."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"If there's any word play (puns, references to memes, movie quotes) he thinks they are directed at him."

Potential early dementia - please share experience.,He has had a medical doctor witness a major episode - one so wild we took him to the ER.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,He's had SO MANY scans & exams & blood tests.

Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"Like, basically I have to just watch & cope because nobody is taking it seriously."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,Where can I turn for recognition & intervention?
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"(In the US, by the way.)"
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"And if you've been through this, what timeline & prognosis & outcome have you experienced?I'm replying to myself - just so I have the details recorded."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,He has just recently started 2 new behaviors.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,First is assigning long-term meaning to a single incident.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"For example, I arrive home exhausted and he asks if we can grill out for dinner."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,I say that I'd rather not tonight.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"Then, day after day after day, he says ""I know you hate cooking on the grill"" or ""you're the only person I know who doesn't like steak on the grill"" - or to our adult child, ""your mom hates the grill, so maybe the next time you're here, you'd cook for me?"""
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,WTF?And - being unwashed.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,He's always been meticulous about hygiene.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,Now he can be obviously filthy and not care.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"But beyond that, he's often outright defiant - like refusing to bathe."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"Oh, I feel for you."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"I am in a similar situation, except I'm his adult daughter (25)."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"For the diagnosis, I felt something was wrong about six years ago."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"Everyone I talked to about it would shrug it off, saying that he's always been forgetful."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,It took losing his job and NUMEROUS talks to get him to the doctor.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"Even then, I had numerous doctors brush me off without a proper diagnosis."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"First his primary physician and then, a strongly recommended neurologist."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"The second neurologist brought him in for a PET scan (insurance agencies want every single test done before this, because it's pricey) and we finally received the diagnosis the week that our state went into shut down."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"If there's anything this journey has taught me, it's to trust your gut."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,You know him more than any doctor who spends 1 hour doing a simple memory test does.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,Find a doctor who listens and respects you.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,It will make all of the difference.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"&#x200B;If you're curious about my journey:Call and ask primary care physician to do memory test during physical, don't receive feedback, says he's fineSix months later, receive concerned call from employment saying they cannot have him on a job site any longerCall primary physician again, do exact test but demand referralGet blood test immediatelyGet MRI testAfter waiting three months, finally get in to see a psychiatrist and wait for a 6 hour intense memory trainingAfter waiting two more months, receive feedback and spend 40 minutes talking to psychiatristGet referred to Neurologist, wait at least two months for appointmentMeanwhile, get recommended another Neurologist, get in within 1 monthSpend 40 minutes doing very similar memory test primary physician did, get told it's nothing but a fluke and get recommended sleep studyGo to sleep study, do take home sleep study, find out there's some minor sleeping problemsWait a month, do an overnight sleep test."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,He can't sleep with the equipment on.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"That entire ordeal is a wash and I choose not to go forward, knowing he won't wear a sleep mask.Finally get an appointment with the original neurologist, get assigned another MRI, another blood test and never-done-before PET scanDo all three, takes about two months to fit inReturn for proper diagnosis, turns out the PET scan wasn't sent to neurologist, entire appointment unnecessary since neurologist can't make a diagnosis.Drive home, find out on drive home what the diagnosis was and cry in the car for 20 minutes.I didn't even mention issues regarding accounting, law, employment and general every day life things."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"It's a very challenging job, although with you being his wife, you don't have to jump through as many hoops as I have had to in order to even begin aiding with his medical journey."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,I chose to share this info with you because I desperately needed an outline of what to expect.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,I strongly recommend you find a support group near you.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"If not, groups on Facebook and Reddit have been extremely helpful answering questions, sharing information and giving me a place to connect and not feel alone."

Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"Once you have a diagnosis and learn to communicate with someone with alzheimers, things will ease up."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"They're difficult, but you will treat him with the same leniency you would give a child."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,You'll feel more forgiving.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"And to clarify timing, I noticed things in 2014."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,The journey for the diagnosis took from July 2019 to March 2020.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,Thank you so very much.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"Honestly, based on real-world experience, it would actually be easier if he were in the ""pleasantly confused"" stage of AD."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,What I suspect is vascular dementia.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"In working with people with dementia, the AD patients were often odd but very manageable as long as everyone was gentle & soothing."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,The vascular dementia patients were totally unpredictable.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,There are also language components of FTD (frontotemporal dementia) as well as some of the other situations you’ve described.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,You may want to do a bit of reading about that to see if fits the behaviors you are seeing.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,Thanks.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,I do indeed see some similarities.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,Helpful clues.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,This should be a magazine or newspaper article.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,People read about some promising new treatment for dementia and it probably seems like some progress is being made.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,The reality is quite different as far as effective diagnosis and treatment.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,"Other people I've spoken with have had the experience of being told that it's ""probably normal changes associated with aging"" until they reach the point they cant draw a clock face on the mini mental exam or name 3 animals that start with the letter F. Then its apparently too late."
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,I've never understood  when exactly is the window of opportunity where treatment is beneficial?Can you imagine if this was the current state of cardiac medicine?
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,Have you seen a neurologist?
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,He refuses.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,Because: Nobody does anything for me.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,They just want my money.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,You're gaslighting me.
Potential early dementia - please share experience.,I'm not crazy.

"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","Recommendations, new diagnosis."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",So one of my future in laws parents was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's  his wife is fine and in decent health but she us caring for him.
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","They live in the middle of no where with no phone service, I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a tracking app for him that he might not notice?"
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","He is in denial and repeats himself every few minutes, so something really noticable, he might RIP off."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","I feel really bad about it because the closest relatives (us and we are 3 + hours away) is there anything that would work for them, they do have a land line but no internet service."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",Also what would be the best way to get needed information to his wife without upsetting her?
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",I thought maybe sending her a reliable book?
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","I am a CNA and have had lots of experince with dementia and alzhiemers patients but I am no doctor and the only doctors close to them said yep, its alzhiemers gave them a medicine to slow the progression and promptly brushed them off.... so I was able to correctly respond to most of her questions, but once again..."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",I'm not a doctor and I know she is scared and wants to be informed.
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",Suggestions please?
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","Thanks in advance !Rural services can be few and far between, but still, the first stop would be an agency for aging."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",There might be resources they can hook the wife up with.
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",How tight is money?
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",Can you tell us an approximate location?
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","(at least country) United states, money is tight older couple in thier late 80's I will have to look up an agency like that for sure."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",Not sure the exact money situation but I know they don't have a lot of it.
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",Satellite internet would be useful and is available everywhere.
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","But that old a couple, I kind of doubt how quickly the wife could pick up Internet skills."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","They ideally should move into town for the sake of emergency services, but it can be very hard to convince old homesteaders to do that."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","If the husband does wander, that is very much scarier in the country than in a city, especially in winter.But I still recommend looking for an elder services agency for their area."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","Start with Human Services or Alzheimer's associations for the state, and then drill down to the county and physical address."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",Thank you you've been very helpful!
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","I've taken care of my grandmother that had cancer, and I've taken care of alzheimers patients at care facilities but taking care of a family member who has alzheimers is a little different I appreciate it :) Each county in each state has their own office, which is good."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",They will be familiar with the rural life.
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","> They live in the middle of no where with no phone service,  >>they do have a land  line but no internet service."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",Which one is it?
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",It might be possible to get the house a router and him a fitbit-like watch to get health recordings and track him if he wanders.
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","Sorry I should've been more clear, theres no cell phone service but theres a land line."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",And that's a wonderful Idea i never even thought of that.
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","A router, a tablet pre-loaded with zoom or other conferencing sw, and then ""weekly/monthly dinner night"" where everyone gets food delivered and eats together would probably help everyone feel more connected?"
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","I like that too :) I dont mind to stay and help when I can, I was going to do weekly visits just to see how hes progressing too?"
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","That would help a lot I think the wife is feeling pretty sad, scared and lonely right about now."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",Thanks!
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",Usually caregivers feel pretty overwhelmed too.
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","Weekly ""afternoons off"" may be just the ticket."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","Regarding a book, The 36 Hour Day is like a Bible for dementia/Alzheimer's."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",It's about $5 on Amazon.
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",I can't recommend it enough!
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",Awesome!
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",I was waiting for a good book recommendation ❤ If they can swing it i strongly recommend a lockable perimeter fence.
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","You can have alarms and tracking stuff, but in my experience if all you have are alarms but no meaningful barriers its possible primary caretaker will become jumpy and paranoid about every little thing that vaguely sounds like a maybe alert."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",This is how it was for my folks anyway.
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",Thanks!
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","I forgot to mention, if the gentleman ever served in the US armed forces in any capacity, and received any discharge other than dishonorable, he is entitled to a slew of services including lower-cost (or free) drugs and clinic visits."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","In addition, the VA has a program to support the caregiver to take care of the veteran at home."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","Their social worker contacts me by phone monthly just to check in with me, and that's very nice (and free)."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","They also provide free or low-cost respite care, which can be either at home (someone comes in) or at a facility (overnight or day treatment)."
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","If he's a veteran, his wife should definitely look into this!"
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.","He is veteran that's awesome, that's not even something I thought of!"
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",That would help out a lot!
"Recommendations, new diagnosis.",Thank you!

"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia. I feel like I'm in way over my head.","The police said they couldn't admit him to the ER, as his vitals were good, but he refused to go back into the house, and then drove to the local gas station and started having a fight with an invisible person in his car, and the police were called again, and so I drove up the 3 hours, and took him all the way back home with me, where after a good deal of sleep and some discussion about the possibility of hallucinations (he was an ER nurse and understands the concept very well), he calmed down and seemed to go back to himself, though I could notice a considerable disruption in his normal cognitive abilities."
"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia. I feel like I'm in way over my head.","We took him to a psych facility the following day, and they told us they weren't going to admit him because he wasn't a danger to himself and he was getting belligerent about not being allowed to smoke, and with the virus they thought he'd be better off at home, and the symptoms were mostly gone by then anyway."
"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia. I feel like I'm in way over my head.","So they set us up with an outpatient appointment the following week, and we set dad up in the guest bedroom."
"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia. I feel like I'm in way over my head.","We've since had the outpatient appointment, and the psychiatrist basically said that he thought dad had a mini stroke, and it caused an onset of dementia, and he didn't think dad should live by himself anymore based on how he answered the questions."
"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia.

"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia. I feel like I'm in way over my head.","It's heartbreaking to see him futz with his seatbelt for 3 minutes, or with the AC knobs, or the TV remote we got him which only has about 6 buttons, BUT I used to work in mental health, and patient care isn't something I have a problem with.My problem is this: How do I begin dealing with all of his stuff?"

I feel like I'm in way over my head.","The first thing I did was get all of his bills paid up, and I'm trying to deal with his finances, but I've found so much stuff I'm out of my depth on, like that he never made any claims on my stepmother's life insurance or anything, and he gets money through investments but he can't really tell me how that works tax wise or anything.Here's where I am right now:I've got his bills paid for April, and I'm working on May's."

"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia. I feel like I'm in way over my head.","The other car is so old I don't think it'll make the trip.I got his neighbor to cut his grass for the time being, after getting dad's permission to tell him what's going on.The current tenant of his rental house wants to buy, so I guess I need to figure out how to sell a house without a realtor, which I've never done before.I've gotten the name of an Estate Sales Agency, to maybe go through and sell all dad's other stuff, which is the only thing I can think to do to deal with all the stuff we can't keep, and I've gotten the name of a junk remover for whatever is left.Dad's house will bare minimum need a major landscaping overhaul (he's let his land grow up significantly, and there are trees down in the yard), and possibly a new roof and definitely new flooring if we're going to sell the house."
"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia. I feel like I'm in way over my head.","He owes $100k on it, but maybe we could sell it as a fixer upper regardless."

I feel like I'm in way over my head.","I don't know.I've gotten a family friend who is a lawyer to send me information on wills and power of attorney, but dad doesn't want to sign anything and doesn't have any active paperwork, and I'd really rather have him sign willingly than have him declared incompetent, if I'm going to survive living with him for the next however long.I let Dad manage his own meds (and double checked him) for about two weeks, and he just couldn't do it himself, so now I'm managing them for him.The whole time this is going on, all I can think is am I doing the right thing?"

Resources for long-term care,My dad was a 9/11 first responder and is part of the long-term study so I've asked my mom to mention it at his next check-up.

Remotely controlled electronics,Remotely controlled electronics Hi everyone!!
Remotely controlled electronics,Cross my fingers this gets seen 🤞🏽🤞🏽 Just a little bit of info about me: my mom was diagnosed with early-onset dementia -  she’s 58.
Remotely controlled electronics,I recently moved out but still visit her every weekend.
Remotely controlled electronics,She lives at home with her mother and my godmother goes to her house a few  times a week so she’s never alone.
Remotely controlled electronics,"She still likes to do things for herself like cooking, cleaning, and laundry but still needs occasional help."
Remotely controlled electronics,Where she really struggles is using electronic devices.
Remotely controlled electronics,I’ve started to teach her how to use her Samsung tablet so she can  listen to music even when I’m not there to help her navigate the tablet.
Remotely controlled electronics,"I’ve been searching but haven’t really found much, but I was wondering if there are any electronic devices out there that can be remotely controlled on my end even when I’m in my own place."
Remotely controlled electronics,"Like her tv, tablet,  a radio?"
Remotely controlled electronics,Any suggestions and alternate solutions are appreciated!
Remotely controlled electronics,"☺️Hi hi!So, I don't know about devices that are intrinsically built for remote access, but there are certainly loads of programs out there that allow you to control one computing device with another."
Remotely controlled electronics,"(This is to say: you can work with computers, phones, tablets, laptops, etc.)"
Remotely controlled electronics,"Which program to use depends a bit on your level of proficiency and on the kinds of devices your mum and you have (Android, Windows, Mac, etc.)."
Remotely controlled electronics,A bit of googling should get you pretty far in finding a solution.
Remotely controlled electronics,Non-computer devices (like radios) are trickier.
Remotely controlled electronics,I'm not aware of any way to operate these remotely.
Remotely controlled electronics,"This isn't to say that options don't exist, but just that I've not seen them."
Remotely controlled electronics,Something you may want to look into are devices custom-built for folks with dementia.
Remotely controlled electronics,"I've seen one-button radios and simplified tv remotes, for instance."
Remotely controlled electronics,There are great phones which you can program with the names or photos of loved ones so that using the phone is a one-button project.
Remotely controlled electronics,"You'll have to do a bit of digging around because they have so much on offer, but check out the Alzheimer's society store: https://www.alzstore.com/And ..."
Remotely controlled electronics,"If you're able, loop your grandma and godmother into how to use these tech."
Remotely controlled electronics,The grim truth is that everything you teach your mom now is likely to fade away.
Remotely controlled electronics,"Having several people who can use the tablet, for instance, saves you being on call all the time, which I'm sure you're willing to be, but it can become relentless.Good luck!"
Remotely controlled electronics,Thanks so much!!
Remotely controlled electronics,I’ll look into that store The previous poster nailed it.
Remotely controlled electronics,I just wanted to reiterate that you’ll have to teach others in her life because she won’t retain most of any of what you try and teach her.
Remotely controlled electronics,"Also, you might want to consider a device along the lines of an echo or Alexa."
Remotely controlled electronics,Thanks!
Remotely controlled electronics,Awesome!
Remotely controlled electronics,What kind of TV does she have?
Remotely controlled electronics,There are apps that you can use to control the tv remotely.
Remotely controlled electronics,I’m actually on the market to purchase her a new tv.
Remotely controlled electronics,Any recommendations are welcome I’m not buying my dad a new tv so I’m just attaching a windows pc to it (a cheap raspberry pi or android tablet could work too).
Remotely controlled electronics,I could also get one of those smart plugs to turn off and on the tv but he seems to be able to handle that p.  I’m also going to buy him an android tablet to play with and control it using the same apps which may be helpful for you since you are already getting a new tv.
Remotely controlled electronics,Could you post which tv you choose if you find one that can do remote stuff?I’m using the programs parsec and teamviewer.
Remotely controlled electronics,Both free.
Remotely controlled electronics,"You can control android tablets, raspberry pis, Mac and Windows PCs with these apps."
Remotely controlled electronics,The only thing you can’t control is an iPad though you can still see the screen with teamviewer.
Remotely controlled electronics,You can use teamviewer on your own iPad though to control her windows pc.I like teamviewer in that it’s easier to transfer files from my pc to hers with it.
Remotely controlled electronics,"And if for some reason your pc is logged out, you can log back in."
Remotely controlled electronics,"But with parsec, it’s like your computer is her computer."
Remotely controlled electronics,So the things I do with the tv now that I have a pc connected to it are that I can start up Netflix and watch something with him.
Remotely controlled electronics,I’ve got a chrome browser that is set up to three pages.
Remotely controlled electronics,The first is YouTube saved with my playlist of exercise videos I can exercise with him on.
Remotely controlled electronics,I might karaoke with him through YouTube as well.
Remotely controlled electronics,I’ve got another page saved to my comcast xfinity stream.
Remotely controlled electronics,And then another I’m thinking about setting with some online games like wheel of fortune or something.
Remotely controlled electronics,The last page is to my Flickr album so I can share photos and videos with him to talk about what I’ve been doing.
Remotely controlled electronics,I guess I could give him a Bluetooth gamepad and play games with him too but that might be too complicated for him.
Remotely controlled electronics,Maybe I’ll do a playlist of music videos for him too for YouTube.I’ve got Skype setup on the pc so that it automatically answers when someone calls him so I can Skype with him so he sees me on the big screen tv.
Remotely controlled electronics,I gave my sisters the Skype number as well.
Remotely controlled electronics,I gave him an old junky desktop though so am going to buy a webcam for the tv or take an old cell phone and use that as a webcam.The android tablet will let me play touch screen games with him.
Remotely controlled electronics,I might use the Facebook instagames as there are so many easy games lumped there.
Remotely controlled electronics,Not sure yet as I haven’t tested this out.
Remotely controlled electronics,"In general, I find bowling games to be easy as all you have to do is flick your finger."
Remotely controlled electronics,Soccer goalie games too.She will need decent upload speeds and you will need decent download internet speeds for this if you want things to look good on your end.
Remotely controlled electronics,"Without it, since it’s all playing on her devices, she can still get great visuals but I’m not sure if you will have problems seeing a movie or something streaming off her pc."
Remotely controlled electronics,"Also, streaming uses a lot of data FYI though unless you are already using tons, I don’t think it’ll be too bad if you have a decent amount of data.Another option if this is too tech for you is Amazon echo show or google nest hub."
Remotely controlled electronics,Those can allow automatic video call pickups.
Remotely controlled electronics,I prefer Facebook portal for its big screen or tv setup but it doesn’t have automatic call answer so that’s a fatal flaw for me.
Remotely controlled electronics,These devices can’t do nearly as much as my pc with teamviewer and parsec setup can do but it’s simpler (I find teamviewer and parsec to be easy too but it does require some work).As far as her chores..  there are a ton of smart household devices out there.
Remotely controlled electronics,It’s just a matter of how much control you want to take and how much money you want to spend.Edit:  here’s a smart remote too that sound like it can control anything that uses ir input.
Remotely controlled electronics,Not sure how well it works though as I haven’t tried it.
Remotely controlled electronics,Reviews seem mixed so I personally hesitate in using it.
Remotely controlled electronics,https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-915-000194-Harmony-Control-Smartphone/dp/B00ZYIFXSM/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=Smart+remote+control&qid=1588425806&sr=8-8 Wow thanks so much!
Remotely controlled electronics,You really provided a wealth of information for me.
Remotely controlled electronics,I ended up getting her just a regular Insignia tv with a roku device.
Remotely controlled electronics,"As far as the smart plug goes, can you control turning the tv on and off from your phone even if you’re not at your father’s home?I actually tried playing around with teamviewer last week on her Samsung tablet and my iPhone but I noticed I could only screen record."
Remotely controlled electronics,Would I be able to control it via my iPad or would I have to purchase an android tablet for myself?I also downloaded Skype for both of us last week as well and set it up to automatically answer my calls.
Remotely controlled electronics,So far so good!

Remotely controlled devices,I recently moved out but still visit her every weekend.

Remotely controlled devices,"She still likes to do things for herself like cooking, cleaning, and laundry but still needs the occasional help."
Remotely controlled devices,Where she really struggles is using electronic devices.
Remotely controlled devices,I’ve started to teach her how to use her Samsung tablet so she can listen to music even when I’m not there to help her navigate the tablet.
Remotely controlled devices,"I’ve been searching but haven’t really found much, but I was wondering if there are any electronic devices out there that can be remotely controlled on my end even when I’m in my own place."
Remotely controlled devices,"Like her tv, tablet, a radio?"
Remotely controlled devices,Any suggestions and alternate solutions are appreciated!
Remotely controlled devices,☺️This hits different!

Remotely controlled devices,"I would try an amazon dot, she will need to get use to speaking with the queue phrase "" Alexa, please do... or play..."" but after she gets the hang of it."
Remotely controlled devices,Thank you!

Update on sweet by overspending MIL,She does have enough to live on plus a modest amount of spending money if she watches it.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"This proved a problem as she kept forgetting about our agreement and spending money anyway.Kind commenters suggested in a previous post ways to gain control of her finances, such as taking over her bank account and giving her a monthly allowance on a gift card."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"This proved difficult as my BIL is her POA, not us."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,Everything I have done with her finances I did with her in the room to give consent and passwords (when she remembered them).
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"BIL lives a few hours away, while we are the ones to care for her daily."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"He and my husband do not always get along well, especially when it comes to who knows best about their mom."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,Last week was pretty rocky.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,MIL asked for help from both BIL and us about her finances.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"We each made separate plans, which she forgot herself so she couldn’t keep the other party informed."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,BIL gained access to MIL’s bank account.

Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"(Later) Me: MIL, why can’t I buy deposit a check to cover your rent at the ATM for you with your debit card?MIL: It’s being replaced.Me: Why?MIL: I don’t remember.This obviously was unsustainable, so after great reluctance from the brothers, I GOT ALL 3 OF US ON THE PHONE AT THE SAME TIME to discuss MIL’s finances."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"Pardon the caps, it was a real victory."

Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"It involved some swallowing of pride on both sides, but I was very proud of how it went overall."

Update on sweet by overspending MIL,Some of these steps are the ones commenters suggested in my previous posts – thanks!
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,Both households are monitoring her account regularly.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,BIL is willing to take control of the account and put her on an allowance if needed.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"He doesn’t want to take the step yet as he already had to block QVC and some other spending outlets she has, and feels it would be too much at once."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"As long as she is compliant with spending, we’re ok just monitoring her.The victory came with a price."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,My husband was helping MIL sort her magazines.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"She gets around 20 magazines a month, which adds up to $100 a month."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"We asked her if she was willing to whittle these down to maybe 2 or 3 a month, at least until her debt is paid off."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,OR even just let us temporarily suspend delivery.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"When libraries open back up, I can check many of these out for her for free."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,She was resistant and started sticking her tongue out at us playfully and saying we wouldn’t let her have any fun.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"I recognize this is her coping mechanism, and didn’t mind."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"Husband however reminded her should take this seriously, because she was in debt."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"She remembered the debt only vaguely, so we gave her a brief summary."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,She insisted she was doing all right financially and didn’t need help.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"I reminded her that although her bank account is above 0 now, she has bills due of over $2600 in the next couple weeks, so we have to still be very careful."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"When we mentioned we had discussed her finances with BIL (we’d told her multiple times the conversation would happen), she felt we were ganging up on her and being tyrants."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,“Why does everyone had access to my accounts?” she asked.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,She forgot she herself had asked BIL and us to be involved and had given us access to her various accounts.Things got worse when we took her to the bank to get her new debit card.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"We stopped at the grocery to pick up a few items she needed, since it was right next to the bank."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,MIL wanted to go inside.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"Due to the current health situation, we knew that would be unsafe."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,It was a busy time of day.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,Then MIL was mad we wouldn’t let her go inside Dollar Tree.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,We asked what she needed from there.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,“I just want to look around.” I am very empathetic to how stir crazy she must be.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,It was the first time she’d been near a store herself in a month and half.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,I explained she was in an at-risk population.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,She remembered part of the news about the virus.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,I think she half understands how serious it is.“I am tired of people telling me how to run my life.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"I don’t think you understand I do just fine living independently and taking care of myself and my finances on my own!” she said, as upset as I had ever heard her."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,I felt for her.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,It must be extremely hard for her kids to tell her she can’t do certain things.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"But the truth is, she is at the point she can’t take care of herself on her own."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"Without our “interference,” she would have been evicted."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,And it’s in large part because of her memory issues with finances.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"Two days ago, she had to ask my name so she could write me a check for her medications."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"I feel like this week we made the relationship between my husband and BIL a lot better regarding this issue, but took a step backward with my MIL’s feelings."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"The truth is, she will probably forget she was ever upset, just as she forgot she ever asked us to get involved, just as she forgot she was ever in debt."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"I know she will get upset at us again sometime in the near future, when we remind her about the budget again, and tell her she can’t spend something."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"I am not angry at all with her, as she can’t help it, and this must be extremely difficult."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"We tell her we love her multiple times a day, and are there to help her."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"I do feel like we are controlling her to some extent, but I KNOW we are acting for her safety."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,I wish it were easier.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"That was long but it’s helpful to write about it, so thanks.TLDR: MIL spends too much and forgets, we took big steps getting on the same page with BIL to work together to help her, but now she feels we’re ganging up on her.That’s great that you all got on the same page!"
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"QVC & HSN are like morphine to the elderly, I swear."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,We used to call my Mom “The Queen of QVC”.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,They would have her on the air all the time.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,She had a bedroom just for her purchases from those two places.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"No way you could sleep there.Your MIL will eventually hit the point where you can take all of her finances away from her; debit card, check book, all of it."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,Then you can get it all straightened out.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"Until then, I bet you’re going to continue to have these battles again and again."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,I wish you perseverance and courage.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,Take lots of deep breaths and drink lots of wine if you have to 🙃 Thanks for the empathy!
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,Wine for us both.
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,"Congrats on getting the bros on the same page, no small victory."
Update on sweet by overspending MIL,Thanks for the encouragement.

She wanted me to send an Uber to her house in a small town 1.5 hours away from me so she can get here to drop off some candy she doesn't want to mail and some other stuff for my kids.I have a family tracking app on our phones and she and her husband have joined in, so I see them out at the shops every 2-4 days.Well, apparently her husband finally said no to SOMETHING and refused to drive down here with her to drop off Easter candy so she wanted me to call an Uber for her.I gently reminded her that we are staying home except for essentials."

technology,technology Hi there!
technology,I am very new to this sub.
technology,We are about a 3 years into my father in law's diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer's.
technology,"While we absolutely love the time we spend with him, things are extremely difficult."
technology,He is at the stage where he is still lucid enough to understand that he is confused... if that makes sense.
technology,So really it comes down to frequent arguing and paranoia.
technology,"It is difficult to determine if he is confused, or if he just wants to hid things from us."
technology,"Currently, we are struggling with electronics."
technology,He lives in an independent living facility- so basically the only thing they assist with is housekeeping and meals.
technology,"He very much enjoys having his phone and apple watch, and is able to understand facebook, etc."
technology,The problem is he is continually changing his passwords.
technology,"He changes his apple account, facebook, phone login, email login... EVERYTHING... almost daily."
technology,"He then calls us to see if we can help him because ""facebook is broken"" or ""something is wrong with Apple"", when really he just keeps changing things."
technology,"I don't know if this is Dementia, paranoia, or what?"
technology,We very much cherish our time with him and we 100% want to maintain his independence as long as possible.
technology,I am just curious how others have handled similar struggles?
technology,Do your loved ones have phones and internet?
technology,"Are there ways to ""lock"" the phone so he cannot change settings?"
technology,"Do we just let him keep changing things because it is ""his"" phone?"
technology,We spend hours on the phone with him trying to walk him through steps of how to change things back.
technology,"Apple is also frustrating because once he changes his apple account, it logs him out of all of his other devices- so he has to repeat the process with everything."
technology,He is under my brother in law's plan right now so we could have access if we needed.
technology,We are just unsure of the right move!
technology,How do you handle their paranoia?
technology,We are frustrated and could really use any words of wisdom and guidance.
technology,Thank you so much!I'd set all of his accounts to two-factor auth and set the phone to mine.
technology,Then the password can't be changed without talking to me.
technology,"He wants to change the PW, I get an alert, I wrap up whatever I'm doing and call him."
technology,"Then you can be the ""hero"" and also find out what the new password is."
technology,Man that sounds frustrating.
technology,"I remember having issues with gaining access to my Dad's email early on, but technology isn't really in his wheelhouse anymore."
technology,I just asked my mom and she said we just kept having to reset his password.
technology,You could try contacting apple or facebook but I'm not sure they're able to lock in a password or something.
technology,Good luck!
technology,Wish I could help more.
technology,We got my mom a very bright password book and have been able to reinforce that she always write down any password in it.
technology,I had to make a specific page for each account like apple or her bank because she kept just writing down random passwords.
technology,It doesn’t always work but it sometimes it does.
technology,We went through similar with my husband.
technology,"He is almost at the end of his journey now, but we downgraded him from an android phone to an iPhone because it was easy-to-use."
technology,But then he lost the ability to use even that.Your father in law will also get to the point where he can no longer use technology.
technology,Keep that in mind.Setting up two-factor is a great idea for now.
technology,Change the settings so that you receive the email for password confirmations and such.
technology,"Just remind yourselves that he isn't going to remember what he did, or why.Feel free to PM me if you want!"

Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Doesn’t like to talk on the phone more than a few mins.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"Very little to say.forgets recent events and namescan’t keep track of days of the weekforgets birthdays (completely)has stopped cookingsays off-color thingstells long, meandering stories from many years agowatches the same repeat episodes of SVU over and over."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,She will literally just watch that 24/7scored about 50% on one of those Alzheimer’s quizzesSo my sister and I asked our dad to get her checked out.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,He just emailed us:“ Good news.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,The CT scan came back normal.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"Still has cognitive issues but not to the point of needing medication”How can that be?I'm no expert, but I would think she would need a thorough neurological evaluation, not just a CT scan, to confirm or narrow down a degenerative brain disease.Do you know what questions were asked of her during the meeting?"
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Did she meet with a neurologist specifically?
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"Was your dad present throughout the meeting?On a side note, I understand people who are afraid to get themselves or a loved one evaluated for dementia-like symptoms, but I wish they would realize that forgoing a diagnosis doesn't mean they don't have the disease."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Gerontologist here.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,A ct scan isn’t going to show the plaques related to Alzheimer’s.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,I would question the doctor doing that and not a neurological test.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"I would also check if she’s hydrated enough, check for any signs of a UTI and lastly check her medications."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Are there any overlapping drugs?
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,The mix of certain meds can also cause delirium and dementia like symptoms.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Good luck.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Silly question: why a UTI?
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,UTI’s can alsoMimic the symptoms of dementia in older adults I had no idea.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Could that last for months and months?
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,If left untreated yes.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Again I don’t know all the circumstances but I would have a doctor do a full diagnosis.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,I’m not sure what other testing other than the cognitive quiz.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,She’s 69.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,They have only been speaking to her family doctor and I have a feeling my dad isn’t giving all the info and/or might be downplaying symptoms.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"There are simple screening tests but also more comprehensive evaluations, generally performed by specialists."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"I don't know how it works in Canada, but my sister (who is 66 and has FTD), was initially screened by her primary care physician."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,She was then referred to a neurologist for brain imaging and to a memory clinic for cognitive testing.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"Her primary care doctor also ordered testing to eliminate other potential causes, such as UTI or other acute conditions."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"After all that was done, the neurologist was able to make the FTD diagnosis."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"And in my sister's case, the brain imaging was pretty definitive in showing a significant mass loss in the frontal lobes."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"That isn't always the case.Again, I don't know how things work in Canada, but a primary care doctor should not be diagnosing dementia, it needs to be done by a specialist."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Is a CT scan the only testing she had?How old is your mom?
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Older people can have age-related cognitive decline that isn't dementia.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,See other reply.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,69.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"That’s so frustrating, OP; I’m sorry."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Those were almost the exact same symptoms my dad first showed.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,He’s now late stage and in memory care.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Alzheimer's?
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Dementia I think a neuropsychological evaluation (cognitive testing with a neuropsychologist) would be warranted to see what's going on and where she's having difficulties.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,(In Canada) is that something their family Doctor needs to set up as a referral?
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"I'm not sure as I'm in the US, but here's a good resource to figure out your next steps in Canada for cognitive testing and screening for dementia."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Good luck!
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Thanks!
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Where in Canada are you?
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"Often there's a senior's program or assessments running out of a clinic, usually in a hospital."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Often calling the health line will get you further info.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Let's break down what he said.

Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"This means no masses or strokes or other obvious problems, that is good news."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"&#x200B;>Still has cognitive issues So her problems were evaluated, at least using the gold-standard Dementia test and maybe other tests."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"That's good, that's at least one big ol long doctor's visit and they're already starting testing."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,&#x200B;>but not to the point of needing medication” So some symptoms have been ID'd and they're looking for ways to treat it.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"&#x200B;When you look at what he said overall, he appears to be doing the Typical Manly Man thing and avoiding interacting with it, which means minimal information for you."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"I'm sorry, that's got to be torture."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,But it does sound like she's in treatment and things are proceeding.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"I help take care of my boyfriends grandmother, and her MRI report said “no signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s, only typical signs of aging.” For reference... I’ve taken care of her for 10 months now and she can’t recall my name (ever) and thinks it may be 2012 (she’s never sure) and can not recall her children’s names."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Her cognitive exam at the neurologist’s office finally gave us the dementia diagnosis and a medication (which doesn’t help at all but she’s very far gone at this point and 83 years old).
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Moral of the story is to definitely follow up for an in person oral-type exam with neuro.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"My mom had all of the same symptoms, she has FTD."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,When she first got scans doctor said they were fine too.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,But her diagnosis is rock solid...
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,I'm so sorry about your mum Could I please ask how old your mom is and what were her symptoms ?
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"and how she is doing if you don't mind My mom is 44 years old, and her symptoms have definitely evolved a lot over the years but I’ll try to list some of the early stuff.- wanting to go on walks constantly, at first about twice a day but then every hour or so.- in the beginning she re watched a lot of friends episodes, eventually she stopped watching any tv at all."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,- Spending a lot of time on facebook but never posting or crafting coherent thoughts.- telling the same handful of stories over and over again like clock work.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"It seems like her stories have a backward progression too, like the more time that passes the older her stories are i guess?"
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"At first it was like the same handful on repeat everyday, but now she will tell the same story 3 minutes apart without even realizing.- definitely had issues with off color remarks, mostly as part of her stories.- this is a weird one but she has no sense of shame?"
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,No guilt or embarrassment at all anymore.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Extremely apathetic.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"As of lately one of her stories is about how she accidentally soiled her pants at work once a long time ago 😂- she never could tell that she was acting different and she still cant :(That was by no means a comprehensive list, sorry."
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,"Im sure i could think of 20 more things throughout the day but i should probably stop for my own sanity lol.A little over a year ago now we moved my mom into a memory care facility, as it was the best choice for our whole family."

Something doesn’t add up with my mom,Im glad that my mom’s story can help others ❤️ I am worried about mine as well.
Something doesn’t add up with my mom,She is constantly forgetting what I tell her....other people aren’t worried but I suspect something is wrong...she refuses to see a Dr and does spend no more than 10 minutes via phone call....

I want terminally ill brother to die,"Of course money is an issue with my mom cashing in some of her retirement to help pay for expenses that insurance doesn’t (which isn’t like we’ll be homeless, but she won’t have the “golden” part of her golden years anymore)."

I want terminally ill brother to die,I’m so good at my job (sorry not getting too specific here because I don’t want my mom or brother to find out).
I want terminally ill brother to die,"But what I’m saying is - I really I love my life.But now I gotta keep coming back every time he’s in the hospital because of a choking fit, or I see on Skype that my mom’s burnt out, or a new worsening happened that’s literally unmanageable by my mom and the caretaker."
I want terminally ill brother to die,"And there I go again, leaving my life, job, girlfriend I’m really so excited to marry one day (almost 2 years), fitness, income, etc - and there I go leaving it all for God knows how long... a few weeks here, up to 2 months!"
I want terminally ill brother to die,"Last year I spent over half the year at home.That was half a year I lost income, borrowed to pay my rent, had a strain in my relationship because WE JUST MET a few months before this shit happened."
I want terminally ill brother to die,"When I do return to my life - I’m tired and exhausted and feel fat and have low sex drive - but more troubling, I’m not “the same” person my girlfriend met years ago."

I want terminally ill brother to die,"My boss and colleagues really appreciated my work, really respected it, which was leading to private consulting jobs because of how good I am in my job (and how I love it too).My fitness was on point, eating healthy - going to the gym, taking care of me and standing on my own two feet.Now I’m almost chubby, have little money, am constantly waking up to help reposition my brother or help him wit a coughing bit or anxiety attack."
I want terminally ill brother to die,"I love him a lot, but I can’t do this anymore - I’ve given up my life to care for him, and refuse to move back home and give up on my dreams and the path I was on."
I want terminally ill brother to die,"I work really hard to take care of myself and go to therapy, an open with my girl, attempt to eat healthy (but that’s impossible when I’m back at my mom’s home)."
I want terminally ill brother to die,I really try - I’m just so effin exhausted.My brother wants to really live.
I want terminally ill brother to die,"He thinks he will beat this - we just had his doc’s appointment recently, and I pulled the doc aside to ask about his prognosis."
I want terminally ill brother to die,The doc said if my brother wants a trach he could live for years.I had an anxiety attack after that.
I want terminally ill brother to die,I can’t do this anymore.
I want terminally ill brother to die,"I feel like he’s being selfish putting my mom and I through this, something we didn’t sign up for."

I want terminally ill brother to die,"If he wants, he can live for years as a vegetable."
I want terminally ill brother to die,"No one can help him, so why do we have to suffer because of him being scared to die, or his stubbornness to hang onto a pathetic future?"
I want terminally ill brother to die,"He’s optimistic, has no problem scolding me and my mom for not feeding him right because our limbs get exhausted from holding his head."
I want terminally ill brother to die,"He doesn’t see what his declining state is doing to us, and I’m not gonna tell a terminally ill brother to consider our fate too."
I want terminally ill brother to die,"I don’t care that he expresses his appreciation, but we sacrifice everything because he’s the sick dying one.Everyone talks about how great we are, how lucky he is to have us, etc etc."
I want terminally ill brother to die,"But I hate those comments, like it’s selfish for people to say think “oh man he’s so bad, it makes me feel bad, but look - they’re taking care of him really good so that makes me feel good”."
I want terminally ill brother to die,If that makes sense.
I want terminally ill brother to die,"Idk guys, I really will miss him."

I want terminally ill brother to die,"I know I sound like a terrible human, and an even worse brother - but I wish he’d die already so I can care for my life and what’s left of my mother’s.Yes I do talk about this with my therapist, who assures “this won’t last forever.” But after the ALS doc said he could live for years, I just lost it.Just venting here."
I want terminally ill brother to die,"If anyone has any advice, that would be appreciated."
I want terminally ill brother to die,"Again, I’m sorry how bad this sounds, I’m not saying all sick people should die - but I can’t give up my life anymoreThe thing is,  you don't have to give up your life?"
I want terminally ill brother to die,"You do have to make a choice, though."
I want terminally ill brother to die,You are either there to help caregive with your mother or you aren't.
I want terminally ill brother to die,Going back and forth will give her expectations you may not want to fulfill - i.e.
I want terminally ill brother to die,that you will always bail the situation out.
I want terminally ill brother to die,Hard talks are needed.
I want terminally ill brother to die,"Your mother, you, your brother, and the doctor (or an intermediary like a therapist for the family or social worker) need to discuss what happens if your brother does get the trach and is total care for everything."
I want terminally ill brother to die,ALS is terminal and you are right to belabour that point.
I want terminally ill brother to die,Everyone in the picture of the terminally ill patient needs to be realistic (yet also positive) about the situation going forward.
I want terminally ill brother to die,"Yes, your brother can live with a trach for an indeterminate period of time."
I want terminally ill brother to die,What quality of life does he desire?
I want terminally ill brother to die,Is he enjoying his life currently?
I want terminally ill brother to die,"How about your mother, is she getting days off and does she feel comfortable with the knowledge that when it is her time to be taken care of, she may not have that nest egg nor the family caregivers (you) around her to aid her in her own ill health?"
I want terminally ill brother to die,What happens if you get sick or injured while you are unemployed and helping family?
I want terminally ill brother to die,All of these things are important.
I want terminally ill brother to die,Your therapist is right - this won't last forever.
I want terminally ill brother to die,But it can go on for several years up to two decades in some cases - the trach just takes over breathing until the muscles of the body finally give up.
I want terminally ill brother to die,"I don't think you are wishing death to your brother but I do think you are going through a grieving process of your own right now - the life that could have been had, the stress on your family, and the prospect that this could go on for years."
I want terminally ill brother to die,"Decide what you are willing to do for your mother and brother first, talk it over with your therapist, talk it over with them, then help your mother plan for extra assistance - stuff like another caregiver, extra tools in the home to aid her in caring for your brother, a weekly housekeeper, a respite day off."
I want terminally ill brother to die,Get your brother into long term care.

I want terminally ill brother to die,"Although she was very hesitant to go into care at the time, it is her home now and she likes the companionship of other residents."

I want terminally ill brother to die,"I’m not entirely sure, but can you guys talk to the hospital social worker about care options?"

I want terminally ill brother to die,You’re not a horrible person- this is very difficult to deal with.

I want terminally ill brother to die,"Consider this: if you can get through school to a degree and move on to a career that allows you to make decent money, you could then provide for him monetarily and support your mother in a way that does not impede your ability to lead the life you want.If he could live for years, that might mean five but it might also mean twenty-five!"
I want terminally ill brother to die,Or even more!
I want terminally ill brother to die,He could potentially outlive your mother.
I want terminally ill brother to die,You are in a crap situation where trying to stand your ground and work for your future (which could also benefit both brother and mom) will cause a lot of bad feelings all around.What you can do is square away help for your mom while you are in school.
I want terminally ill brother to die,"There are possible resources that you can harness to make this possible, though it will take effort on your part to make it so prior to leaving."
I want terminally ill brother to die,In case you have not checked out this possible resource for volunteer in-home help and apply for grants to assist your mom financially while you are in school.I do not envy you and I'm so sorry you and your mom and brother find yourselves in this position.

I want terminally ill brother to die,And then do it!
I want terminally ill brother to die,He won’t like it at first and will probably kick up a fuss.
I want terminally ill brother to die,But stick it out and he will see that they know what they’re doing.
I want terminally ill brother to die,That will be a major milestone for both of you.And I’m not sure why you come home every time he’s hospitalized.

I want terminally ill brother to die,Best of luck to you & keep at it...I know you're tired of hearing it but your family IS lucky to have you.
A tribute to caregivers,A tribute to caregivers The whole concept of caregiving was completely foreign to me; the idea of someone making huge personal sacrifices to provide ongoing care for another adult was something I’d never encountered in my 29 years.
A tribute to caregivers,"All that changed when my friend Sal was diagnosed with Glioblastoma, a deadly form of brain cancer."
A tribute to caregivers,"I was with him throughout his battle and witnessed first-hand the stress, chaos and exhaustion experienced by his younger brother and primary caregiver."
A tribute to caregivers,"Sal’s many friends were quick to offer help, and some even took the initiative to bring food or to visit, but even these acts of kindness ultimately became another source of stress because they were so difficult to manage."
A tribute to caregivers,"Always a creative thinker, Sal knew there had to be a better way."
A tribute to caregivers,"He’d say “There’s got to be an app for this.” What if you could bring your friends and family together into a private app and use it to share important updates, messages, or requests for a helping hand?"
A tribute to caregivers,"Friends could volunteer to help out with meal delivery, giving a ride, or just stopping by to visit, making these acts of kindness much easier to coordinate."
A tribute to caregivers,"He even came up with a name for the app: Friends Indeed.Unfortunately, Sal lost his fight to GBM, but his passion for Friends Indeed was not forgotten."
A tribute to caregivers,I decided to carry on Sal’s vision and build the app in his honor.
A tribute to caregivers,I’m proud to announce that Friends Indeed is now available for free on Apple and Android devices.
A tribute to caregivers,I truly believe Friends Indeed will make life easier for family caregivers and give them some well deserved relief.
A tribute to caregivers,"If you’re a caregiver, or you know someone who is, I ask that you please give Friends Indeed a try."
A tribute to caregivers,Here’s a 60 second video that shows how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjUwL6l6cVs&t=I think this is a lovely idea!
A tribute to caregivers,"Having been a secondary caregiver, I would have lived to have had this app to help coordinate care."
A tribute to caregivers,This is a great idea!
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,My father is in assisted living but he still goes out for walks on his own.
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,"Lately we've run into some problems (too complicated to get into, but he isn't getting lost) and the home wants me to get him a GPS tracker so we can know where he's going.I looked it up on Google and it looks like there are lots of services that you can buy a wearable GPS tracker that uses mobile data and pay a monthly fee and you can track people no problem!"
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,"Unfortunately my father will not wear any of these items (necklace, bracelet, he won't even wear his medic alert bracelet, I've literally put it on him, begging him to keep it for his own safety and he just gives me a dirty look and removes it) and even the sneaky shoe sole trackers are a no go because he wears flip flops anytime the weather allows it."
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,"However he always has his phone on him, and he even keeps it charged!"
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,"Yay, I was hoping that since he already has a device that can be tracked that the phone company would offer a service for GPS tracking, but apparently they dont (why not?"
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,"Other companies are using the exact same tech and charging $60/month, why wouldn't the phone company want to get in on that?"
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,").So I suppose I'm stuck using a GPS tracking app installed on the phone, so I figured I'd see if anyone else here has anything to say (good or bad) about apps or services that they've used."
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,I'm happy to pay as long as it's going to get the job done.Checkout life360.
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,I haven't used it but it gets brought up on parenting subs a lot.
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,It looks like you can location share recent and current location as well as receive alerts about low battery.
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,Ditto on life 360.
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,Until my relative could not go anywhere on his own we used it to track him to the library and back.
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,Very good service.
Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services?,Thanks looks like it has a trial so I'll give that a shot.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,Vascular Dementia - Possibly?
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"My dad has not been diagnosed with dementia, but he is in his early 70's with type 2 diabetes and has been around 300-350 lbs (at \~6' tall) for a few decades."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,He had a double bi-pass heart surgery about a year ago (should have been a triple but they did what they could).
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"He's had some simple memory issues for quite a few years (like repeating himself often) which I didn't think was a good sign, but had chalked it up to aging."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,I now suspect that he may have vascular dementia as he recently (in the past 3 weeks or so) has been very confused and paranoid with intense delusions and visual/auditory hallucinations.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,It started one day when he left the house in his car.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"He got about a block away, got confused, turned around and went home."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,He knew something was off so he called his GP and my mom took him to see the nurse practitioner that day.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,They did blood work and didn't find anything unusual.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"They also did a CT scan and didn't see any signs of stroke, but the report noted diffuse atrophy with nonspecific white matter changes most likely indicating microvascular disease."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"The report advised that he see a neurologist immediately, but the NP wanted to get his psychosis under control first."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,About a week or so after the initial appointment they prescribed him Seroquel - 25mg/day.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"I don't think the 25 mg was very effective, so about a week after that they upped it to 50 mg/day."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,His mental capacity has taken a rapid decline in the last 3 weeks and he fears that most of his friends and family are plotting against him.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,He believes he is being recorded or being listened to through all of his smart devices.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,He wants to cut the cable and destroy his cell phone and bluetooth speaker.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,His emotions are severely heightened.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"Also, I've noticed a significant change in his ability to text."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,Three weeks ago he was texting me full sentences and now he's only capable of 1-2 word choppy texts with a ton of emojis.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,In the middle of the night last night he sent me about 50 texts in total in a span of 2 hours (I didn't respond to any of them as I was sleeping).
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"None of the texts made much sense, but he seemed agitated with my sister."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,Is this typical of someone with vascular dementia (or dementia in general)?
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,Has anyone else here experienced this with a loved one?
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,How do you navigate texting with someone who is suddenly mentally impaired?
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"I obviously love him and want him to know that, but I also don't want to upset him accidentally."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"I live about 2 hours drive away from him, so I can't visit as often as I'd like."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"Also, as of recently, he will not answer the cell phone when me or my mom call him even though he's aware that we're calling.As a side note, I just learned yesterday that his father (my grandfather) was schizophrenic, but died of cancer in his 50s or 60s (before I was born)."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"How likely is it that this is late-onset schizophrenia or a possible adverse medication interaction?My dad is seeing a geriatric psychiatrist this Thursday, but any input is appreciated!"
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,He's also seeing his urologist on Tuesday since he had a UTI in December (in case this is relevant to anyone).
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,Thank you for any input/responses!
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"This sucks :(Gosh, that sounds rough."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"I'm so sorry.I think most people here aren't in a position to say ""yep, that's dementia."""
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,Reddit isn't a great diagnostic tool.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"However, I can say that I saw (and still sometimes see) lots of those behaviours in my own mum who struggles with vascular dementia."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"And yet, the rapid onset of your dad's symptoms strikes me as peculiar (hers developed over a much longer period)."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"Also, there are loads of things (as simple as an infection that can clear up with some antibiotics) that can create those kinds of symptoms."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"So for now, it's tough to say."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"Make sure you ask lots of questions when he sees his doctors, and don't be afraid to reach out to them in confidence before or after your dad visits."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"Although doctors won't be able to give you info about your dad without his explicit consent, you can certainly give info to his doctors.On the journey to my mum's diagnosis, and also in seeking help for care after she was diagnosed, having really detailed accounts of her symptoms was helpful."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"While you wait for your dad's doctors to do what they need to do, maybe you can concentrate on doing this work?"
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"You could also confirm that your dad has a POA set up so that if you and your family do need to act on his behalf, you're in a position to do so."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"If he doesn't have a POA set up, look into your legal options ASAP."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,Some things become impossible after diagnosis.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,I'd also suggest checking in with your mum.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"For every worry you have, she likely has just as many that are exacerbated by being with your dad full time."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"Encourage her to reach out to pals, and volunteer to hang out with your dad while she's away so she doesn't have to worry about him."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"If she doesn't have close friends or family she can talk to, see if you can help connect her with a support group."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"A lot of people feel the need to tough it through the hard stuff in life, but self care is really important, and will become exponentially so if it turns out he does have dementia."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,It's really hard not to fret when the possibility of dementia is on the table.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"Of course, we are all different, but focussing on what I could do (rather than simply worrying) helped me be the best I could for my mum."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"I'm sure there are other things you can do, beyond what I've just suggested, so if you find yourself stuck in worry then I'd encourage you to think about how you can act.And do come back here to talk if you feel the need."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,Worrying and feeling alone sucks.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,We can all listen and offer ideas when possible.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"Good luck, and hugs."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"This is a perfect reply, OP."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,Seconding this & sending love & support to your family during this difficult time.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,Xo Thank you both so much.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,I will take definitely take your advice and kind words with me as I move forward.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,Just know that we're here....if you need anything.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"Xo Well, quick update.. my dad was Baker Acted today since he was threatening suicide."
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,He was taken to the hospital in hand cuffs after fighting with the police.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,I feel relieved that he is being monitored and I hope they can figure out a diagnosis and some sort of treatment.
Vascular Dementia - Possibly?,"Thanks again for your support, kind people of the internet."

Early onset dementia? I have MCI. My husband and teen daughter’s (and MY) concerns. Thoughts?,:(
Help her watch tv,Help her watch tv My mother has dementia and can’t work the television.
Help her watch tv,"Usually my dad is around and can help her find something to watch, but he does all of the errands so he is sometimes out."
Help her watch tv,She panics when he is out and it would help her a lot if she could watch tv and relax a bit.
Help her watch tv,"She doesn’t watch tv often and she’s quite old-fashioned, so she doesn’t like much of what’s on."
Help her watch tv,My husband is incredibly patient and has created a very detailed sheet of instructions for her.
Help her watch tv,"At this point she should be able to turn it off and on, check specific channels that he wrote down the number for, and sometimes channel surf."
Help her watch tv,"This is a real struggle, but as long as we review it with her often, she can do it."
Help her watch tv,"However, most of the time she can’t find something to watch."
Help her watch tv,She can’t use the guide.
Help her watch tv,"Because the shows she likes aren’t usually on when she tries, she thinks the tv is broken and quickly gives up."
Help her watch tv,I can’t believe there is nothing to help with this.
Help her watch tv,"We have them on our Netflix account and my dad uses it to watch shows with her when he’s around (she loves Hallmark Christmas movies and he watches one with her every single night), but she definitely can’t use it herself."
Help her watch tv,I would love for her to be able to use it because then there would always be something she could watch at any time of day.
Help her watch tv,Is there any way to set it up to just play a list of shows we program in for her?
Help her watch tv,Or get an Alexa or something to help her find something to watch?
Help her watch tv,"I just feel like there has to be a way to do this.TLDR: Is there any program that can be used to help a senior with pretty severe dementia watch tv?I'd burn a few DVDs with a series of her favorite shows, connect it to the tv, and set it to repeat play."
Help her watch tv,"When Dad comes home, he could change the TV to whatever he wishes."
Help her watch tv,"When he goes, he could set it to that input and it would just cycle through those episodes for her."
Help her watch tv,That’s probably the best option.
Help her watch tv,"She really wants to be able to do it herself, but it sounds like that won’t be possible."
Help her watch tv,"I just wish that Alexa or something could do this for her, so she could feel like she was in control without having to navigate to the right menu, etc."
Help her watch tv,This is her doing it for herself.
Help her watch tv,It's just a different feed.
Help her watch tv,"On, off, volume, all of that is completely controllable."
Help her watch tv,A simplified tv-only remote might be called for.
Help her watch tv,I’m just re-reading these now and noticing that I didn’t even thank you.
Help her watch tv,I’m sorry.
Help her watch tv,"I really appreciate the advice, thank you."
Help her watch tv,"You're welcome, and no worries."
Help her watch tv,This is a rough road to walk.
Help her watch tv,My dad has a universal remote called Flipper (available on Amazon).
Help her watch tv,"It's very easy to use and only has six buttons (on/off, mute, volume up, volume down, channel up, channel down)."
Help her watch tv,You can also program it to select favourites so she can skip a bunch of channels.
Help her watch tv,I also made a guide and printed it in colour with an image of the remote and arrows and text pointing to each button to describe what each button does.
Help her watch tv,I made sure to use one or two words for each button to make it easy to read.Hopefully that will help.
Help her watch tv,"She’s good with this remote currently, although I will keep that in mind for sure."
Help her watch tv,She has a guide like you describe.
Help her watch tv,It’s just multi-step processes aren’t really an option.
Help her watch tv,"She can’t track time anymore, so even though we’ve written down “Dr."
Help her watch tv,"Phil on channel 3 at 5pm,” she expects it to always be Dr. Phil if she goes to channel 3."
Help her watch tv,"She can get to that channel (using the guide like you describe), but she can’t understand why it won’t be playing the show she wants."
Help her watch tv,When I came back to read through the suggestions again I realized that I never thanked you.
Help her watch tv,"I’m sorry, my mind has been elsewhere."
Help her watch tv,"Thank you, I really appreciate your help."
Help her watch tv,No problem.
Help her watch tv,You're going through a lot and I can relate.
Help her watch tv,There's also a clock that might help her with time: https://www.alzstore.com/day-clock-with-reminders-p/0045.htm.
Help her watch tv,You can probably find it on Amazon for less.
Help her watch tv,This website has lots of products that look like they could be really helpful!
Help her watch tv,Thanks for sharing.
Help her watch tv,My husband could no longer handle a remote or navigating menus.
Help her watch tv,I took a iPad and locked it into the Netflix app.
Help her watch tv,Even though he had never used an iPad touching what you want became very easy for him in about a week.
Help her watch tv,"Oh that’s a great idea, thank you!"
Help her watch tv,I use Netflix and it automatically plays the next show after.
Help her watch tv,You could also use YouTube TV or create a playlist of movies on YouTube.
Help her watch tv,The issue is that she can’t navigate to Netflix or YouTube.
Help her watch tv,"Dad can set it up for her and leave it to play, but I’m trying not to add to his tasks (he already does everything, he’s amazing)."
Help her watch tv,Unfortunately I live five hours away.
Help her watch tv,I’m just noticing now that I didn’t even thank you earlier.
Help her watch tv,I’m sorry.
Help her watch tv,Thank you so much for your suggestion.
Help her watch tv,I have a Google Home Mini and it's connected to a Chromecast on the living room TV.
Help her watch tv,I can tell Google to play something on YouTube or Netflix (though I don't usually do this option) on the living room TV.
Help her watch tv,It turns the tv on and starts plays video.
Help her watch tv,"For YouTube, I think you can tell Google to skip to the next video.I got it originally to help my grandmother, but she's never been big into tech and doesn't try."
Help her watch tv,"She knows the Google Home Mini can tell the weather, so she'll ask me to ask Google the weather etc.Looks like for Netflix, I had to specify what show exactly for Google to start on the TV."
Help her watch tv,"I just tried Hallmark movie or play Netflix, but it didn't like those commands."
Help her watch tv,"And it may all be connected thru my phone, so if your mother doesn't have a smart phone, I'm not sure if it'd work, but it may."
Help her watch tv,"At Christmas time, Walmart had a $35 set of Google Home Mini and Chromecast together."
Help her watch tv,I know I paid more for that for the original 2 I had.
Help her watch tv,"She doesn’t have a phone, but I will look more into this."
Help her watch tv,Thanks so much.
Help her watch tv,[deleted] That’s a really good idea!
Help her watch tv,"My dad just got a new tv and now is using the older big screen as a monitor for the computer, so she could definitely watch on that."
Help her watch tv,"My husband has Remote Desktop set up on their computer so he can help fix any issues, so I think we are basically all set up for this."
Help her watch tv,"I wish there was a way she could control the tv on her own because she so wants to, but I think I need to accept a different solution."
Help her watch tv,I love this idea.
Help her watch tv,Thank you.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"Grandfather with Alzheimer’s This is a long rant/plea for advice/comfortMy moms father, my grandpa, has been a huge part of my life since well before I can even remember."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"Him, and my grandma (who recently passed away due to cancer) were always there for every event."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"Every soccer, basketball, track and field event, band event, you name it they were there."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"They lived quite close to us in town, only about 10 minutes away, on a farm they built themselves."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,They were always incredibly independent.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,My grandpa was diagnosed in 2013 and my grandma passed away in 2018.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"Since her passing, things have gotten increasingly difficult."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,He lives full time in my families home.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"Comprised of me, my dad, my mom, my younger brother, and now my grandpa."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"He attends an Alzheimer’s day care during the week, from 8 am to around 4 pm."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,VTA offers rides to and from usually.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"But whenever he’s home, the stress in the household sky rockets."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"My dad isn’t very supportive of my mom, and does the bare minimum in relation to help around the house, helping my grandpa, or helping my mom with emotional support."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"My younger brother and I are left to pick up the slack, but we’re both in school most of the time."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"My mom does most of the care now, and his care is getting harder by the day."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,The only things he does on his own now are using the restroom and eating.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"He needs help with everything else, including drinking."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"He has to be forced to drink, it’s at least a 20-30 minute process for a small glass of water or juice."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,He doesn’t do anything without prompting or assistance.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"He has to ask where the restroom is, where he’s supposed to sit (we’ve built a “game room” of sorts where he has access to our large backyard, puzzles, couches, a TV, etc) if the food placed directly in front of him is his, even down to hygiene like changing his undergarments."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,All of this has taken such a toll on family dynamics and life.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"There always has to be someone with him, we have to schedule our entire lives around his care."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"It’s round the clock, there never seems to be a break or a moment where we’re not doing something, either working, going to school, and then caring for him at home."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,The only person who doesn’t help out for the most part is my dad.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,I love my grandpa and I know the reason I “blame him” isn’t because it’s his fault or that’s where the blame should lie... I’m just frustrated that this is where our lives have ended up.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"My mom makes comments about when he’s going to pass, and “hopefully in the next year” and about putting him in a home."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,I know to some extent these are just “jokes” but it’s painful.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"My grandparents were always there for us, but when, out of the 5 years we’ve had such a high level of burden, between my grandmothers illness and my grandfathers, does the stress go away?"
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Does it ever?
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,His behavior as of 3 years ago encroached on being completely inappropriate.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"At my grandmothers chemotherapy appointments, he started to make fun of those who had cancer in the room."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,He makes racist and derogatory comments in public.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"He makes sexually suggestive comments and behavior toward my mother and occasionally me, and does so to strangers as well."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"His offensive behavior is always called out and he’s told that it’s inappropriate, but he just laughs, because he thinks everything is a joke."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,I’m at my wits end and so is my mom.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,(I’ve taken up the mantle of emotional support for my mother).
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"We’re not ready, emotionally, to put him in a home, but we also don’t want to throw his behavior onto someone else."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"We’re also terrified of possibilities of abuse, either done to him, or him being sexually suggestive with women of all ages, nurses or other patrons of care facilities."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,At this point I just don’t know where to turn.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"My boyfriend, nor my friends, fully understand where I’m coming from because they’ve never experienced anything like this."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"And talking it through with my mom just brings more stress and anguish on her part, something I try to avoid."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"I just don’t know what to do, or what to suggest, or how to help myself through any of this."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"We’re still grieving my grandmother, and it feels like we grieve for my grandpa every day, day in and day out and caring for him has been nothing but a reminder of that pain."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Has anyone else gone through this?
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Does anyone have an idea on how to handle any of this?
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"What were the emotions surrounding putting your family member in a home, if you ever did?"
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"How did you emotionally support yourselves, while also supporting others?"
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"I know therapy is an option, but it’s not something my mom will participate in, let alone my dad, and my younger sibling has turned to other means of “therapy”, and not in any appropriate ways."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"It’s also time and monetarily consuming, which id feel guilty for."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,I just don’t know what to do or where to turn.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"Any advice, personal experiences, or comfort is more than appreciated.I’ll start by saying your mom’s comments are a coping mechanism."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Everything else you are feeling is perfectly normal when you are under stress like this.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"Don’t argue with your Grandfather, try to deflect and change the subject when he says things that are inappropriate."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Hang in there.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,My kids went thru the same things when my mom lived with us for 5 years.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,I think they regret not being kinder to their Grandma.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Good luck.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,We are in almost the exact situation with my grandma and it exactly is a coping mechanism.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"my boss told me the other day ""i feel bad for laughing at the stories of your grandma, but you just make it sound so light hearted""."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"Well, if we didn't laugh we would be crying."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"it's devasting she isn't the person she was, but we are trying our best to give her the care she needs."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,my mom stays home full time with her and my aunt and I provide relief.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,it's a constant balancing act of schedules to make sure someone is always with her.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Is there any kind of Alzheimers support group in your area?
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,They gave us the idea to get my father's doctor to refer my father to the local health authority and they assigned a case manager social worker who gave us information on a lot of local resources.We have hired nurses part time to help with my father and we also have someone visit him daily to take his medication.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,The case worker said that my father will have to go to somewhere with memory care very soon.The sad reality is that the brain is dying with Alzheimers and that things will keep going downhill.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Please reach out to any sources you can get for help.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"It sounds like you are reaching the limit of your capacity to deal with this yourselves.Take care of yourselves, too."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,This is an awful disease.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,My dad is currently in late stage alzheimer's and he lives in a memory care facility.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"Dementia, sadly, is so common now that there are facilities who cater only to residents coping with dementia."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,My dad was very flirtatious and often inappropriate with care staff.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"But they are trained to manage those behaviors, which are not uncommon with this disease."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"I promise you that no matter how bad or embarrassing you perceive his behavior to be, caregivers have seen worse!"
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,My siblings and I are all about the TEAM approach to our journey with this disease.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,We ask for help any time we are overwhelmed.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,And currently we are working with a social worker ourselves.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,She is helping us find resources to help our dad be the best he can be and she is also helping us manage our health/emotions.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,I am sure there is some sort of local 'healthy aging' agency you could look into.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,I would also say that there is no shame in asking for help and at least contemplating finding a care facility for your dad.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,My dad has been in one for about 3 years now.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,He ADORES the people who take care of him and I have seen so many residents move there quite sad and isolated at first.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,But they blossom with the energy and attention they receive.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,They join social activities and make new connections.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Send me a pm any time if you'd like to talk more - this is really hard stuff.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,But sharing our experiences helps us all.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,You are not alone.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Hugs.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"Your Grandfather’s inappropriate behaviors are part of the disease, not something your Grandfather has any control over."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,So he couldn’t stop doing it even if he tried.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"But, as the disease progresses, that behavior will stop."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,This is an ever changing disease.It sure sounds like your family could use some help.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Contact your local Area on Aging (every county has one).
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,They will send out someone to evaluate your Grandfather and then make recommendations on ways to help you guys.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"They may recommend an aide come in to help, or they may recommend him going into Memory Care."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,They will also help explain financial help available.I’m glad that you’re able to help your Mother cope with all of this.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"It is a big big task taking care of someone with Alzheimer’s, once their disease progresses past a certain point."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Let her read what you wrote and the responses.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,I’m sure she’s proud of you!
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Educate yourself about the process.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,You Tube  Teepa Snow vignettes are very helpful.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Very short .
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Watch as many as you can .
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Not all will be relevant to you today .
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Your grandfather will go thru stages.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,I had great relief when I learned to enjoy each of my Mom's personalities.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,As a young woman yourself you need to have a respite regularily and just be a teen.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Not everyone is capable of dealing with this disease.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Try not to think harshly of your dad.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Not everyone can be a caregiver.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"It ""ain't""  easy and somecare afraid of what they don't understand."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"As to placing your grandfather in a care home,  your parents need to evaluate the cost."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,If your grandfather has the resources you should definitely  consider.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,You can visit.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,My Mom is in a care home has not been able to feed herself for 4 years   not walked in 3 years.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Left arm contracted last year.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Both arms contracted the last 4 months  .
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Cannot move head from left to right.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Blind.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Sorry to describe this to a young girl .
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"It is the physical side of alzheimer.Remember your grandparents would want you to live your life well Two short comments:The behaviors your grandfather is exhibiting (inappropriate comments, sexually suggestive) are caused by the disease."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"Alzheimer's is a disease that destroys brain cells, which often causes someone's ""filter"" to drop."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,I'm sure he doesn't want to be that way.Putting a loved one in a nursing home is emotionally taxing and a decision not be taken lightly.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"But making the decision to put him in one doesn't make you or your family bad people, nor does it mean any of you have failed."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,The reality is that his needs have become greater than what can be cared for at home.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,A good nursing home (one with a dedicated memory-impaired wing) is equipped to handle those needs.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,These are a tool for hydration for dementia patients that hopefully will be on the market soon.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Just posting a link for you to follow if you’re interested.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,https://blog.thealzheimerssite.greatergood.com/jelly-drops-release/ You are doing a very tough thing and it is admirable that you are looking out for the well-being of your Grandpa while smartly recognizing that the current setup is not sustainable for your family.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,Talking to others who have been in your shoes is an excellent first step toward relief.Some great advice has already been offered for how to enlist some experienced help outside of your family and get some respite from the stress - follow it.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,It’s so important to carve out some time to participate in the activities that restore your own well-being so that you have the strength you’ll need in the marathon ahead.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,All of the symptoms you’ve described for your Grandpa sound exactly like what we experienced with my dad in his last 4ish years.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,It was so very hard to see him in that state (knowing he had no control) and exhausting to always be on guard trying to protect him from hurting himself while buffering his constant inappropriate behavior toward others (especially everyone trying to care for him).
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,My dad also had very scary paranoid delusions for a time and it was awful to think that he was living in such fear.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,It helped a bit to get educated on how to best communicate with a person who has dementia and finally accept that it was okay to use “therapeutic fibs” to comfort & redirect his worries.There did come a time when we could no longer manage caring for Dad at home.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"By this time, he could no longer walk on his own, was on 24/7 highflow oxygen (which he would forget to wear and then pass out), and was totally incontinent."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,We were fortunate to find a “personal care home” near us with just 5 other patients and a rotating staff of loving professional caregivers who could help him without being devastated by the experience (as we family members now were).
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,This allowed us to visit daily and return home afterward with peace of mind knowing he was in great hands.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,We also had great daily communication with the staff so we knew what was going on throughout the day even if we weren’t there physically.Paying for this type of care is very expensive and difficult for most families.
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"We were fortunate to have enough savings available to afford this place for the 6 months until he passed at age 86, but our plan if he had lived beyond the savings was to spend down until he qualified for Medicaid and do the best we could with those benefits (likely requiring a move to a larger memory care facility that would accept Medicaid rates)."
Grandfather with Alzheimer’s,"He was also a veteran with full military benefits for service-related disability, so we had another option to pursue there (our state’s nursing homes for veterans), if it came to that.Wishing you strength & comfort."

Question RE: Elder Care Alert Buttons,"Something that isn't quite a phone, but like those medical alert buttons, except something which instead of calling 911 would alert me in an App."

Question RE: Elder Care Alert Buttons,"I just need something she can press like a Bat Signal to me, and not to 911."
Question RE: Elder Care Alert Buttons,"Gotcha- I just thought we’d get a flood of help on here for both of our needs 🤷🏼‍♀️ never used this, but found this app by searching ""panic alert app"":   https://silentbeacon.com/safety-app-and-emergency-alert-app-with-panic-button/ The Costco medic alert service lets you specify a phone number (yours) they will call before calling 911."
Question RE: Elder Care Alert Buttons,"However, one time my mom fell and they called 911 first, so you’re taking your chances."
Question RE: Elder Care Alert Buttons,"If she has a smart phone, this looks like it might work:https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07KPWT4TB?tag=amz-mkt-chr-us-20&ascsubtag=1ba00-01000-org00-win10-other-smile-us000-pcomp-feature-scomp-wm-5&ref=aa_scomp_srdg2&th=1 Dementia people lie the ability for tech early."

Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),"If he says he was robbed, just tell him you're sorry and that must have been awful, and then introduce a new subject to try and redirect him, like ""Have you had dinner?"
Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),"What did you have?"""

Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),The two are different.
Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),Lewy body and Parkinson's are both due to misfolded alpha-synuclein.
Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),Alzheimer'sis misfolded tau.

Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),She’s gross.
Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),"He doesn’t ask to go home and he doesn’t about her anymore, which leads me to believe he’s forgotten about her."
Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),"For the best, really."
Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),She’s toxic as hell and obviously does not love him.Sometimes he thinks he’s in a hotel.

Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),"I haven’t been able to reach him as easily, which has been difficult, but I’ve been able to call and routinely check in with the nurses, who say he is doing well.Right now, his unit is divided in half between residents who have covid and those who don’t."

Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),I’m hoping that will continue.
Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),He is resistant to wearing a mask when leaving his room.
Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),For the most part he likes to sit in his room and watch the birds and turtles in the courtyard from his window.
Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy-Body/Alzheimers),He told me before all residents were quarantined to their rooms that his favorite part of the day was when they played music.

Advice Please,Advice Please So I have been caring for my husband for a little over 3 years.
Advice Please,"He has a seizure disorder, BPD, and other mental health issues."
Advice Please,Honestly there are days that I just want to walk away.
Advice Please,I never thought it would be this hard.
Advice Please,This is not what I signed up for.
Advice Please,I love him more than anything in the world.
Advice Please,"However, I feel like I've lost myself in caring for him."
Advice Please,How can I care for him as well as make time for myself?
Advice Please,I struggle with feeling guilty any time I leave him to his own devices to do anything I need to do.
Advice Please,He's extremely dependent on me to the point that he insists on riding with me even to the gorcery store.
Advice Please,It gets annoying and difficult to do things on my own.
Advice Please,Any advice on how to do that without making him feel slighted or abandoned?Does he have family nearby?
Advice Please,I'd ask someone or a few someones to commit to regular visits so you can get some away time.
Advice Please,Some ins will pay for adult day care or home visits.
Advice Please,"Don't feel guilty, that's not what anyone expects in life."
Advice Please,You deserve to live too!!
Advice Please,"We do, his parents live about 5 minutes away but he doesn't get along to well with his dad (bad history) and being alone with them makes him anxious."
Advice Please,Our best friends live about 10 minutes away and I've tried to plan a girls day and let them have a guy's day but he always gets anxious as the last minute and we end up cancelling.
Advice Please,I feel like I almost have to just say well you're going to have to deal with it while I have this time but his seizures are increased by anxiety... UGH depending on where you live there might be social service or non-profit programs that could help.
Advice Please,Check with NAMI.org and the local disability office too.
Advice Please,Seizures and anxiety... are you in a Medical Marijuana or Legal state/country?
Advice Please,Yep.
Advice Please,Currently saving up to get both of our cards!
Advice Please,Okay.
Advice Please,"So if your state has laws like California did, he can get a card and you can sign up as his Caregiver, which means you can purchase, transport, prepare, and administer, but not take any yourself."
Advice Please,"That's usually cheaper.You'll want to look up studies (Doctors like Pubmed studies, but using a pot website to find the studies themselves might be easier because some of the studies are written very med-speak-ish) to print out and bring to the doc."
Advice Please,"This isn't to get a pot recommendation, this is to ask the doc if there's any contraindications with your husband's current meds."
Advice Please,"To keep the doc from immediately getting all defensive, the conversation should go something like this: ""Here are husband's meds."
Advice Please,"I've found all these studies on how Cannabinoids reduce anxiety and seizures (hand them over), so I need to know if there are any possible negative interactions between his meds and cannabis, please, before we try them."
Advice Please,"""About Cannabis: we don't know enough about it yet."
Advice Please,"We do know that pot has a boatload of different things in it, some of which are good, some which do harm, and some of which could go either way."
Advice Please,"For instance, CBD is great at managing my dysmenorrhea and anxiety, but we know that THC actually accelerates HPV tumor growth."
Advice Please,"Additionally, the first six or a dozen times you try it, you'll get bigger reactions than the twentieth and all those after that, just like alcohol."
Advice Please,"With those things in mind, go slow with this drug.Start with whole leaf if you can, it'll have all the stuff that might be helpful."
Advice Please,"Derivatives from whole leaf (edibles, tinctures, vape, etc) will have less of the chemicals that might do the job."
Advice Please,Just a simple pipe (tobacco pipes work fine) and microdose.
Advice Please,"Take a few leaves (not a whole bowl, that's for bigtime smokers, not small fries like me and most noobies) and smoke 'em."
Advice Please,"Microdosing means you're taking such a little tiny amount that there's barely any noticeable smoke, and it certainly shouldn't make you cough."
Advice Please,"You'll feel the effects in 1-10 minutes, and then it'll wear off in 1-4 hours."
Advice Please,"There shouldn't be much, if any, feelings of being ""high"", though it should reduce anxiety."
Advice Please,"Like pain meds, it's not that you suddenly feel happy, it's just that the bad stuff has gone away."
Advice Please,"If you don't feel anything after 30 minutes, take another puff.Edibles: edibles are usually dosed out in 5mg pieces."
Advice Please,That's a dose for a regular user!
Advice Please,"If you want to start with edibles, nibble a corner."
Advice Please,"1mg or less is usually plenty, and they'll last 4-24 hours, averaging 6-8 hours."
Advice Please,"Take a little, wait 8 hours (yes really), and then try it again with a larger dose until you get a good reaction."
Advice Please,"Honestly ""good reaction"" can be as simple as ""reduction of the pain/anxiety/yelling/number of seizures""."
Advice Please,"Some folks never feel ""high"", just less awful."
Advice Please,Good luck!
Advice Please,"well honestly we already use it daily for medicinal purposes, his doctors are aware we just don't have the cards yet."
Advice Please,lolIt helps a lot with the depression and anxiety as well as the pain from the seizures.
Advice Please,He still just really struggles with being without me.
Advice Please,"I work from home everyday except Monday, typically he will have seizures off and on all day while I'm gone and sometimes will have them Sunday knowing I'm going to be gone."
Advice Please,He gets very lightheaded and dizzy easily so I feel like I can't leave him alone without him getting hurt.
Advice Please,"He has fallen down the stairs several times and pretty much lives with a constant concussion, which doesn't help his mental health issues."
Advice Please,I just feel like I can't leave the house alone without causing him issues.
Advice Please,"He always tells me to go and do stuff, I'll make the plans and then when it comes down to it he gets anxious and I end up cancelling, causing issues with friends and making me feel slightly resentful."
Advice Please,Then his anxiety is the issue.
Advice Please,Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may really help him not be so reliant on you.
Advice Please,It's time to look for fixes for this because... what happens if you break your ankle?
Advice Please,Catch the flu?
Advice Please,"Yeah, his psychiatrist has recommended it several times."
Advice Please,"That is our other issue, I bring up therapy and it causes issues, he doesn't think he needs it."
Advice Please,I have no clue how to make him see that he needs it.
Advice Please,I just want an hour or two out of the house without feeling guilty.
Advice Please,":( So you need advice on how to either get your husband to therapy for his anxiety, or advice on how to get some alone time without guilt."
Advice Please,So... you need guidance (AKA therapy).
Advice Please,Therapy can help you figure out solutions for exactly these things.
Advice Please,Yep.
Advice Please,It's been advised by my primary.
Advice Please,But the whole feeling guilty about leaving him alone thing.
Advice Please,But I think that this is one thing I need to do and it'll help.
Advice Please,Just gotta suck it up and go.
Advice Please,"Ok if by BPD you mean borderline personality disorder, DBT therapy can definitely help!"
Advice Please,It reduces perceived abandonment depression which looks like triggers his seizures.
Advice Please,This level of dependence is neither healthy nor sustainable.
Advice Please,Schedule some therapy sessions for yourself.
Advice Please,"When it comes time to go, if he gets anxious, rather than cancelling, tell him he’ll just have to go too!"
Advice Please,Win-Win!What type of seizures does he have?
Advice Please,Grand mail?
Advice Please,Have you seen the seizures yourself?
Advice Please,"I’m wondering about his several seizures, at home alone, while you’re gone."
Advice Please,That's the goal.
Advice Please,I like the idea of having him go if he's anxious.
Advice Please,He has Psychogenic Non-Epileptic seizures (pnes).
Advice Please,They are caused by a variety of things.
Advice Please,Head trauma and psychological trauma mainly.
Advice Please,They started about 3.5 years ago.
Advice Please,Triggered by a falling out with a friend and financial issues.
Advice Please,"They are sometimes absence seizures, sometimes small convulsions, sometimes grand Mal."
Advice Please,He has them a little as a few times a week and as much as dozens in one day.
Advice Please,Hi!
Advice Please,Sorry to hear how you're feeling...
Advice Please,I've been there myself to some extent.
Advice Please,"I've posted about this before, but my advice is to be open to talking."
Advice Please,The fact that you can recognise there is a problem is a good start.
Advice Please,Going on to such forums is a great starting point.
Advice Please,I myself have used https://healthunlocked.com/.
Advice Please,They are such a supportive group of people - extremely kind.
Advice Please,Now all else I know is from what I've read online: https://www.guardiancarers.co.uk/care-information/feelings-being-carer.
Advice Please,Carer guilt is so common and it's nothing you should be ashamed of.
Advice Please,"As much as you love your husband, you need to look after yourself too."
Advice Please,I suggest you take some time for yourself.
Advice Please,"For me, meditation in the morning worked."
Advice Please,"(To be honest, I did not live in the same house as my grandmother, but it was still very demanding caring for her almost every day)."
Advice Please,Try to meet some friends for even one hour or speak on the phone to whoever you're close to and might understand.
Advice Please,"Also, if you feel like your husband is too dependent on you, have you given any thought to getting a carer to come in for a few hours per day?"
Advice Please,Or even per week?
Advice Please,This would also offer you some time to focus on yourself and your health.
Advice Please,I'm sorry I just saw this today.
Advice Please,Haven't been on in about a week.
Advice Please,Unfortunately I don't really have any friends really.
Advice Please,It's hard to find people who understand the demands.
Advice Please,I spend a decent amount of time online conversing with people to get human contact lolI have suggested getting a carer/thought about it.
Advice Please,I struggle with that as well.
Advice Please,I feel like since I can adequately care for him that I'm taking away from people who don't have someone who can care for them if that makes sense.
Advice Please,The thought of having a stranger in the house is difficult for him as well.
Advice Please,"It's kinda a mess over here lol.I think I need to just start with little things, maybe meditation like you suggested to help myself and once I help myself maybe I can help him more."
Advice Please,Oh wow.
Advice Please,I'm so sorry to hear.
Advice Please,"And yes, I do understand the caring part."
Advice Please,"Whenever you feel like it's time, I think you should opt for that."
Advice Please,"People do need it, but you and your husband will need it too."
Advice Please,Meditation really does help.
Advice Please,It has helped me too.
Advice Please,Try to simply start with some breathing exercises.
Advice Please,"Sit in a place which is comfortable for you (on the floor with your legs crossed, on the bed, etc) and breathe in and out counting to 8 with each breath in and out."
Advice Please,Just clear your mind.
Advice Please,"Open the window and focus on what you hear outside (birds chirping, children laughing)."
Advice Please,I think it'd be a good start.
Advice Please,If you have some time to go out by yourself I suggest museum open nights.
Advice Please,It's full of nice people and it's a nice way to socialise without any stress.
Advice Please,You can get involved in talks and all sorts of activities there.
Advice Please,Thank you so much for all the advice!

Tracking devices for dementia.,Hi all.
Tracking devices for dementia.,"My grandfather is  beginning to show the first signs of dementia, and he’s always been sort of...difficult as it is."
Tracking devices for dementia.,Let’s leave it at that.
Tracking devices for dementia.,He still drives.
Tracking devices for dementia.,"Is there a good app I could put on his phone that is reliable, hidden, and always on so that we could keep track of his whereabouts?Google maps for android and find my friends/find my for apple!"

Tracking devices for dementia.,"Yeah I get you, I’d agree with another poster and go for Find My Friends (if iPhone)."

Tracking devices for dementia.,I've never turned it off and it's provided me peace of mind Are you sure you’re not dealing with MY daddy?
Tracking devices for dementia.,He was sure that “they” were doing things to his computer so it didn’t work.
Tracking devices for dementia.,My daughter was able to get his phone and install life360 on it and hide the app.

Tracking devices for dementia.,"My mom, and a few other older folks I know only turn on their phone when they want to make a call or are expecting one."

Tracking devices for dementia.,Like for a cow.
Tracking devices for dementia.,I laughed.
Tracking devices for dementia.,I'll share the downvotes with you.
Tracking devices for dementia.,"This kinda applies -- an Apple Watch is good for tracking, but I found out today that the Series 4 and up has fall detection!"
Tracking devices for dementia.,"If Apple Watch Series 4 or later detects a hard fall while you're wearing your watch, it taps you on the wrist, sounds an alarm, and displays an alert."
Tracking devices for dementia.,"You can choose to contact emergency services or dismiss the alert by pressing the Digital Crown, tapping Close in the upper-left corner, or tapping ""I'm OK."" This seems like a game-changer for older folks."
Tracking devices for dementia.,I can see getting my dad one -- although he is fearful of some tech.
Tracking devices for dementia.,But he's also fallen a couple of times (when no one was around) so it might be something to consider.
Tracking devices for dementia.,"If you have iphones, set up a family plan and add him on."
Tracking devices for dementia.,You’ll always be able to get his location without any apps installed and it won’t notify him.
Tracking devices for dementia.,Does he happen to have a vehicle with onstar capability?

Video calling device recommendation?,Also if it can be tamper proof as we set up laptops with skype auto answer before but she accidentally changes the configuration of the laptop or turns off wifi.
Video calling device recommendation?,The CNAs try to help but arent as tech savvy.
Video calling device recommendation?,Mom has difficulties speaking due to parkinsons so voice activation is not needed.
Video calling device recommendation?,"Thank you all!Amazon echo and google nest hub both have drop in features where you can call in without the other person answering.I wish facebook portal devices had drop in calls as they have the largest screen by far and the camera does a better job following a person around but unfortunately, last i checked thry didn't have that feature (maybe they added it by now but I doubt it)."
Video calling device recommendation?,"Thank you for this information, i was also looking into the facebook portal but in the end the echo show seemed a bit easier.The screen is a bit small and sometimes i can only see part of her face depending on where shes sitting but still seems to help :) also during these times where we cannot visit, its really helped making daily check ins easy."
Video calling device recommendation?,I hope you and your family and safe and well.

Need Advice - early stages of care,Need Advice - early stages of care My mother in law was diagnosed with psuedodementia about 3 years ago.
Need Advice - early stages of care,She has refused to acknowledge it and gets pissed when it is brought up.
Need Advice - early stages of care,Her husband died and she has declined very fast since.
Need Advice - early stages of care,So badly that we are going to move in with her.
Need Advice - early stages of care,But we are at a loss for how to handle it.
Need Advice - early stages of care,My husband has power of attorney over medical.
Need Advice - early stages of care,We aren't sure how that works exactly but we were able to obtain her past medical records and look at them (she is very tightlipped about it all).
Need Advice - early stages of care,We want her to take a test for dementia but have had issues getting her to agree.
Need Advice - early stages of care,A nurse told me that we could call adult services and they would have someone determine if she is in need of anything ...and we could have them order a forced evaluation.
Need Advice - early stages of care,Had anyone ever had to have someone forcibly evaluated?
Need Advice - early stages of care,I just can't imagine that going well.......She is hiding Twinkies and shit in her room after we got rid of them.
Need Advice - early stages of care,"She has diabetes and high cholesterol, etc."
Need Advice - early stages of care,"She doesn't cook anymore, we have started supplying her with healthy meals and she eats them with little complaint."
Need Advice - early stages of care,Should we push the hidden Twinkies?
Need Advice - early stages of care,"Confronting her would go over badly, we could just take them out and check periodically and keep removing them but idk would that fuck with her mentally?, should we let it go if she continues eating 3 actual meals a day?How do we get through dealing with her?"
Need Advice - early stages of care,We also have a 2 year old that makes things difficult because she is particularly interested in him and very judgemental towards my husband and I.
Need Advice - early stages of care,"Not even for any particular reason it seems, just seems like shes old and insecure about all the ways parenting seems different nowadays or like she's super jealous because she truly enjoyed her time as a mother and seems to wish she could have it again (her other son died relatively young ☹ so a lot of emotion there)."
Need Advice - early stages of care,I see this as being the hardest thing to deal with.
Need Advice - early stages of care,Any tips?
Need Advice - early stages of care,"We figured we could track her phone using the Google find my phone thing so we would always know where she was (if she had her phone)  Anything that could make this easier?Hey there, sounds like you've got a lot going on!I'm not from your area, so not sure what your process is for diagnosis and stuff, but getting  support is important for her, and you."
Need Advice - early stages of care,First step should be your doctor - call them and have a chat to see what they suggest.
Need Advice - early stages of care,"It may be you discuss it with her head on, or maybe a sneaky trip out and call at the doctors 'to pick something up' while you're out..  speaking with the doctor first will help figure out how to approach it.Social services should be able to advise on what support's available in your area."
Need Advice - early stages of care,Worth a chat even if it's just that for now.
Need Advice - early stages of care,"There may be advice and support you can use now, and it's worth knowing what help you can get if and when things get more difficult.Great that you're doing her meals so she's eating healthy."
Need Advice - early stages of care,Where's she getting the twinkies from?
Need Advice - early stages of care,Can you just stop buying them?
Need Advice - early stages of care,"The main thing is her health, so if eating them is causing a risk for her diabetes, then they need to stop."
Need Advice - early stages of care,"If it's not causing a problem, it's probably not worth the argument."
Need Advice - early stages of care,Hard to say what to do if they do need to stop - you could 'clean her room and find them' and bring it up gentley?
Need Advice - early stages of care,Or offer healthier snacks for if she's getting hungry?
Need Advice - early stages of care,It's not uncommon though for people with dementia to gain a sweet tooth!With your child?
Need Advice - early stages of care,"Eek, not even a parent my self!"
Need Advice - early stages of care,"with dementia, it's easier to try and avoid confrontation, so either let things slip if she's just being critical, or if she's telling you to do things a particular way, maybe reply 'that's a great idea, I'll try it later', or that your child's sticking to a routine for now, and hopefully it'll go forgotten?Good luck with things!"
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Aging Parents and helping their adult children My parents are in the late 60s and 70s and have never been able to manage their finances well.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"About 3 years ago I managed to convince them to sell their massive house, buy something smaller, pay of their debt and save the rest of the money for travelling and/ or unexpected life expenses.My sister who is financially a mess has been trying to get my parents to pay off her car and used multiple reasons."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Last year she quit her job and didn't work for 8 months or so.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,During this time she tried to get them to help and I stepped in and handed out my money so that my parents won't be affected.Last week she decided she wants to buy a place after having worked again for about 5 months and convinced them that if they pay off her car she can get a bank loan to buy a place.Obviously she doesn't understand how finances work and getting a place will put her into debt with no savings and with her track record I can see them to help out till they are dead.I'm sitting here not sure what to do as I have power of attorney and all funds etc go through me.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Normally I let them make decisions and give my opinion, however in this case no one is listening to me and I don't know what's the right move.If I say no to the transfer of funds I'm sure my sister will stop talking to me and then try and go around me.If I let this happen my parents are going to lose 4000USD and likely have to help her out again in the future when she realises she can't pay the bond, levies and rates."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,My parents have all there mental faculties however have never understood how to handle money or say no to my sister.When should I step in?This same thing happened with my MIL and SIL.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"At that point in time, it looked like my MIL could afford the $10,000 but my husband was worried that down the road giving it to my SIL would prevent my MIL from obtaining the correct services that she may need."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,So that's what he told my SIL that he didn't know what the future would bring and that at some point my MIL may need that money.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,My SIL wasn't happy but my husband felt that his first priority was to his mother and making sure that she would be taken care of appropriately.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,I wouldn't let your parents pay off your sister's debt because your parents could still be around for another 10 to 20 years and that money could make a difference to them.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,If your sister is like my SIL the asking would have never stopped if my MIL continued to bail her out.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,So she may be pissed but your priority is to your parents.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,It's really hard being the only adult in the family.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Thanks for your thoughtful response, the more I think about it the more I agree."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,It's a lot of money that they could put to good use for themselves down the line.Going to have a stern conversation with all involved and hopefully they listen to reason.Thanks again!
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"I'd caution you to at least be aware of the (very likely) fallout that this conversation might have on your family, although I do think it's the right thing to do."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"My brother is an alcoholic and when my parents divorced several years ago at the ages of 70 he nearly manipulated our mom into giving him her entire retirement savings (worth around $700,000)."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"My other brother and I had to step in, and although we were able to block a lot of it he has still manipulated her out of over $100,000 in vehicles, etc."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Our family, which used to be close, is completely destroyed over this.Hopefully your parents are mentally still with it, my mom started drinking a lot around her divorce which left her even more vulnerable and she defends my alcoholic brother even though he has significantly contributed to destroying her relationships with my dad, her sister and niece and my other sober brother and I. I wish I had some advice that if I had it to do over again it would've fixed the situation and protected my mom while still keeping our family intact, but I still don't see how I could've done it differently unless I just butted out and let him take her money and left her struggling.Just be cautious, maybe consider talking to a trusted financial advisor (maybe someone your parents trust too?"
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,is there a financial advisor they've had for a long time that you could talk to as well who could give some respected input?).
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Situations like these have destroyed many families which is maybe inevitable, but if there's a way to do it that keeps your family intact then make sure you're considering all angles and taking it slow beforehand so there's less regret down the road."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Good luck.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Talking to a financial adviser would be great, my family don't have one but I'll see about speaking to my friends and finding a good one.Just spoke to my mom and she seems to be in a tizz about the whole thing and my dad apparently doesn't care and just focuses on his readings and wants everyone to be happy.I appreciate the caution and will take it slowly with them."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Personally I don't care if I don't have a relationship with my sister and to am extent my parents.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,At this point I'm just trying to do right by them because they raised me as best they could and I owe it to them to make sure they are comfortable or atleast know they have some future to look forward to.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Agreed, you dont know what the future may bring and its much better that they be able to handle what Life may throw at them."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,My dad is 93 and seems to spend money at times needlessly because it makes him feel normal again.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,he thinks he should spend it all and i just cant seem to convince him to hang onto it in case something else happens.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,There may be another operation or he may need to enter a care facility and he wont listen to either caution.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"I agree, don’t let them help your sister, because it will never stop."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"We helped a family member buy a place, because she could not get finance."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Also someone who has no idea of how to handle money.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Within 3 years she couldn’t pay the loan any more.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Within 5 years we had to pay all her levy/building management fees.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Now it’s at a point where she just emails me the repair invoices.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,And I can’t do anything about it.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,It was really a huge mistake.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"But we did it, because she was genuinely about to become homeless."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,It’s been a 10 year ordeal (nightmare) so far and we no longer speak.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,:( Ouch sorry that this happened to you and it's a big fear that the same will happen between my parents and my sister.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,It's just shit always having to be the reasonable one...
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Strength to you and hope you somehow get away from having to 'help'.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Thanks for that.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"I’m going to make sure I sort out my own old age, that’s for sure!"
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,>It's just shit always having to be the reasonable one...I hear you.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Being the one fiscally responsible person in a family full of people who cannot manage basic financial planning is AWFUL.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,I don't know whats worse: continuously watching them fail and mess up their lives; or the knowledge that they'll be coming to YOU and begging for money when they're broke and facing homelessness.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,I think the latter is worse because it affects us more than just watching people make mistakes.After a long drawn out conversation my folks decided to give the sister the money with the full understanding that I will not support them financially ever if they did it and that they can no longer ask me for financial advice as they don't take it.I'm going to have lunch with my sister tomorrow and let her know my feelings and that I don't want her in my life.Family is important but your own sanity is more important >I think the latter is worse because it affects us more than just watching people make mistakes.Agreed.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,I watched helplessly as both my parents pissed away a large inheritance from my grandfather that could have been put away and/or invested for their retirement.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Now I have to work very hard to turn off my emotions and maintain my boundaries so they don't suck my wallet dry I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good Perhaps purchase the car from her but allow her to continue to use it?
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Or give the 4K as a personal loan with no interest (paperwork required), and a declaration of intent to pay back, so that she will have documentation of owing it back to the estate, when the time comes?"
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Or suggest that you think this is a terrible idea, but will agree if you all go sit down with a licensed financial advisor to discuss sister's finances, and that advisor agrees that now is a good time to buy a house and that paying off the car is a good move to facilitate that."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Then you can offer it as a loan.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Ya we tried the loan thing and then she stupidly said she won't pay them back because a brother loaned money 15 years ago and never paid it back.At this point I'm likely going to absolve myself of power of attorney and go no contact.Thanks for your input :) oh, wow."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,You're just done.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,alright.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"If that's what you want to do because they're that dysfunctional, it's probably for the best for your quality of life."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,I'm really in 2 minds about things after talking to my mom I think I need to find a solution to protect them.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"well, there are ways to protect them, such as having yourself on the bank account and requiring your signature on any checks (the check should indicate this) and your signature for bank withdrawals.If they are easily manipulated, you might talk to them about signing something that prevents them from managing their own finances."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"I know there's a term for this, and I don't know the term, but basically, they aren't legally competent to sign contracts and such - you would do it for them."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"If they're not willing to sign but they really can't make good decisions for their future, you can get it through a court."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"This would protect them from not just your sister, but from phone scammers and such."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Then you manage the bills or put them on auto pay, and they get a card with like $200 limit that you pay off every month.You could also just play hard ball and decide that you're willing to protect your parents at the cost of the relationship with your sister - and say that you will not agree to the gift of $4K."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"It will only be a loan, and if she doesn't pay it back, it will come out of her portion of the inheritance."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"If she's in real need of the money, she might finally agree."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"If she's not, then who cares?And then, you might want to consult with a lawyer about how to protect your parents specifically from your sister."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Because financial abuse is a thing, and since they're old they might have special legal protections and you might, maybe, be able to get a legal order to prevent her from trying to go behind your back to get money from them.Also, this other brother who took a loan from your parents 15 years ago and never paid it back?"
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Make sure that's listed as a debt owed to the estate and consider legal action to get a judgement on it if he won't even pay payments toward it.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"If they're just using your parents as a piggy bank, then be their protector."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"If they care about your parents, then they should be willing to pay it back.&#x200B;Edit: (forgot to add) you can also sign over these responsibilities to a 3rd party like a financial manager who is legally obligated to act in your parent's and their estate's best interest."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Many banks offer this as a service for a fee.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Pretty sure the word you're looking for is Conservatorship.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,thank you!
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Please try to talk some sense into your parents.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"My parents have been ""helping"" my brother his entire life."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"My brother is now 58 years old and my 88 year old parents still ""help"" him all the time (like EVERY month!)."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"I'm not looking forward to the day when my parents are no longer around to ""help"" my brother cause there's no way I'm going to do that!"
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,This is what I fear my parents will die penniless and then my sister will want help from me...Sorry that you going through this I'm really frightened of the same thing!
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,My parents are at the stage where they need additional in home care or assisted living.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Not sure if they can afford it due to giving my brother all their savings.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,I’m in the exact same situation.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Parents in their 80s, older sister in her 60s who has been terrible with money her entire life."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Over the course of her life, my parents have either bought or outright given her a vehicle FIVE separate times, and they’ve been sending her money every month for years if not decades."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"I’m talking sometimes $1,000/month.When they die, her share of the inheritance is technically enough that she shouldn’t ever need to beg money from me, but I know it’ll run through her fingers like water."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"But when she comes to me begging for money once she spends all of her share, she’s in for a rude awakening, because my reply will be a firm NO."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"A lot depends on the scope of your power of attorney, I think."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Every POA is different, and the exact wording is very important in determining what you are allowed to do, and when."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Keep in mind that power of attorney CAN be revoked - if your parents still have their wits about them and decide they aren’t happy with how you are managing the money, they can have you removed as POA and still give your sister whatever she wants.Others have recommended you speak to a financial planner, which isn’t a bad idea, but I would also suggest you consult with an estate planning attorney."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,How will your sister qualify for a home mortgage without a down payment?
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,She may be counting on your parents helping her with that.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Many parents help their children with a down payment for a home,  I know my parents did, and if your parents ever helped you with money, your sister may be thinking it would only be fair if they helped her as well.My suggestion would be to convince everyone that if your sister pays off her car on her own, your parents can contribute $4000 (or whatever amount they deem appropriate) to the down payment for a home."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"She will have help from her parents - she is their daughter, they love her and want good things for her - but she will have a better chance of making this work.In the end, if they are not convinced, you can choose to be the ""bad guy"" and not allow them to pay off the car, and in your place I'd have no problem doing it."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"The idea of paying off the vehicle is that then she will qualify for a larger loan for the apartment.After varsity I never asked my family for money and had to learn the hard lessons of working with money and making the right decisions which took a lot of trial and error.I suggested that she pay off the car herself and when she finds a place my parents can help her out, that way they get to make interest from the 4k in the meantime and she learns a valuable lessons in terms of debt.I have no problem helping her out under reasonable terms my fear is that this won't be the last time and the when they have no money left they going to ask me for help."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Thanks for your input :) your parents are lucky to have you taking care of their moneyin my family, both my brothers had all their studies paid for, numerous cars, one brother had help buying 3, count them 3!"
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,properties.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"I got some help for school, but nothing compared to room, board and tuition as they did, and they would not even co-sign a loan for a vespa for me so that I did not have to ride my bike 11 miles to school...."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,So things were uneven and probably it was because I was not particularly obedient.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Once I married and had a child they seemed to start to feel the guilt and helped me out with buying a house.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Still, the scales were totally skewed."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,It's ok though because I tend to land on my feet...  Those 22 miles of bike a day were also really helpful for long term muscle building.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,I think there is always one in the family that gets a raw deal (or feels like they are).If my parents had the money to help my siblings as yours did I'd have no issues with it.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,I think it's important for one to separate financially from their parents early on to learn independence and become self-sufficient.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Otherwise you have the potential to never actually grow up, but ya that's from someone who doesn't have children and likely will never."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Since you have power of attorney, my suggestion would be ask about this in /r/personalfinance.What I'm thinking is maybe there are trust arrangements you could put in place that would protect the bulk of their money."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"I know vanishingly little about such things, only that they do exist.Anyway, if you could get their money locked up in a trust, it wouldn't be a matter of you having to say ""No, I won't allow this"", but instead, ""No, it's not possible, it's out of my hands, the trust won't allow it""."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"This may cost a bit upfront, but maybe make an appointment with a personal financial planner -- for the WHOLE family."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,Let the PFP know in advance what you are there for -- that the WHOLE family needs to understand the implications of loaning/giving money to each other.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"This way you have an impartial person giving the advice to the WHOLE family, and it isn't you being the bad guy."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,"Sounds like your sister needs to talk to a PFP anyway, and it could help your parents out as well."
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,I didn't know you could have a financial planner meet with the whole family like that.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,That's handy to know for the future... My folks did the same thing.
Aging Parents and helping their adult children,One of my siblings and his kids got monthly checks.

I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,Those services exist for a reason.
I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,"You have not failed.If anything, that doctor failed.You can’t put your own life on hold for her.Find her an assisted living or similar help."

I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother.

I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,"Granted, this was a gradual thing (but comes back to herself needing to alert you when things go awry), but the older she gets, the more the only way to be reasonably sure nothing bad ever happens would be to not only live there, but also never be absent for any length of time."
I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,That's just not feasible.
I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,You moving away only made sure that you don't fall into the gradual trap of taking on more and more of her care and not noticing when the time comes where additional care from outside is needed.In a way you could see it as a blessing in disguise.
I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,"Your mom isn't well right now, but it doesn't sound like it's irreversible."
I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,And what happened did alert you to the fact that it has come to the point where she needs more oversight than either of you expected.
I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,"Now you can take care of that before something bad and more time-sensitive, and with more irreversible effects can happen to her.It's so easy to take on the blame, and so easy when living with or close to someone that needs care to let your own needs gradually take more and more of a back seat."
I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,"But you need to earn money to support an aging parent, and you need room for your own life so taking on the care can't take over your whole life and swallow you up like it often happens."
I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,"You moving away was a necessity, and one that actually will give you more financial options when making decisions about care and visits moving forward, and one that somewhat protects you from the gradual swallowing up that otherwise can happen."
I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,"You can't set yourself on fire to keep anyone else warm....Self care-first, care taker-second."
I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,You have gotten some great advice here.
I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,"I would add that if you are not quite ready to put her in a facility you can try hiring someone to come in and work with her at specific times of the week, so they can take care of her needs and alert you to anything she might need."
I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,"If money is an issue, and your mother qualifies, Medicaid can help pay for this."

I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,You have gotten very good advice here - you have to live your life.

I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,"There are many ways to help your mom that don't require you to sacrifice your future, find out what resources are available and start bringing them in."

I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what?,"Basically, if you are on FMLA, you wouldn't be penalized for absences related to your mother's medical condition - for the employer, this is a legal obligation."

"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult Hi All,I'm (M early 30's) a caregiver for my chronically ill partner (F late 20's)."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",We've been together for nearly 5 years.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","A bit over 3 years ago, she had a life changing car accident."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","She walked away from that accident thinking she was okay, but it has changed our lives in so many ways."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","2 surgeries and a whole lot of other issues later, we're still experiencing the effects."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","She can do a lot, even dance sometimes, but the chronic pain and the chronic fatigue regularly pop up in our lives on an almost daily basis."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","For a while, recovery was always right around the corner, and it just kept moving further out."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","She's scatterbrained, tired, and stressed."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",I end up performing a lot of routine tasks for her.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","She can't keep track of her belongings very well due to the pain (I bought her some tile trackers, but they can't track everything)."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",I clean her room and make her bed.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",We split time between our parents houses.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","90% of the time we're together, we are at her mom's place and I really wish this was 50/50."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","I do spend a few days at home alone, but it has not been a lot lately."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","When she comes over to my place, I have to meet her in the driveway and help her carry all her stuff in."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",She always has bags of meds and other stuff and I feel like we're carting around duffel bags.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","We can't do many of the things we used to do like hike, play sports, walk long distances, or have penetrative sex (this is periodically possible, but can be difficult and requires a lot of prep and work to make it happen, even other sexual activities rarely happen due to fatigue and mood)."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","Our life right now consists of us sitting around talking for a few hours after work (usually about how bad she feels or how bad her day was), eating, then going to bed."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",Lately I've been trying to triage our arguments once a week or so.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",We've come close to breaking up a number of times.I know this sounds so mild compared to what many of you are going through.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","My partner isn't terminal, I'm not dealing with feces or urine, and mentally she's still sharp as ever (despite the fatigue)."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",I lost my mother to cancer a few years ago (not helping my mental health due to the similarities) and I saw my father give 110% as a caregiver.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","I'm lucky to have such an amazing role model, but it still hurts.I've been experiencing pretty bad burnout lately."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",The pain has changed my girlfriend's personality somewhat.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",We fight a whole lot more.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",For her I think it's the pain making pebbles into land mines.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",For me I think part of it is due to the lack of intimacy.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",She's tried to make this easier for me.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",Our relationship started open and I have her permission to take care of my needs elsewhere if I need to.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","I haven't acted on this, but I may."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",We've been fighting more lately.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","As an introvert, the caring I do and my customer support job are all the human interaction I can tolerate and I so desperately want some time to recover and be by myself and I never seem to get enough of it."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","I care about her more than anything in the world and I hug her and tell her it's going to be okay, but inside I'm crying because everything has changed."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","I try to cheer her up and be positive, but I end up listening to endless angry rants about doctors and work (we work at the same shitty company full of narcissists and idiots) and it can be overwhelming."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",Recently I admitted that I was overwhelmed.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","I did so at a bad time, when she was flaring up (which contributed to my overwhelm) and I had to work really hard to fix things after I tried to ditch out and take care of myself  as soon as her mother came home."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","I had promised to spend the day with her, but just needed to get away and be alone for a bit."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",I didn't communicate it well at the time.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","I don't think she understands why I'm overwhelmed and how overwhelmed I am, and I'm scared to even bring it up because I don't want to hurt her even more."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",I'm not blameless in this.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","I haven't always communicated my feelings well for fear of overburdening her even more, and because it often hasn't gone well when I did."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",I asked for a reduction in caretaker type tasks and she has told me that she can't separate out her life like that.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",I can't be the perfect caregiver for the rest of my life.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",She also feels like a burden for needing so much help.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",I can't run two people's lives.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","I may be young, but I can't constantly fetch lost objects, listen to endless stories of people going through similar stuff that she has found online, stand still and repeatedly ask her to talk to me when she's emotional, non-verbal (panic attacks and PTSD), and is upset with me for not handling a situation right."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",I'm frustrated when I try to offer solutions but she doesn't want them and just wants to share about how hard it is or how bad she hurts.I get it.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",Being forced to rely on others is frustrating and would upset me too.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",Pain can change people and would change me too.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","It's hard to stay positive and I would be depressed too.I want to make this work, especially since she is still slowly improving and getting better, but I'm having trouble communicating my caregiver fatigue and what I need."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","It's not fair of me to ask her to stop telling ""depressing"" stories about real suffering."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",It's not fair of me to ask her to pretend she's okay when she's not.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",I'm always in trouble for making assumptions or communicating poorly and I'm not sure if these things would be as big a deal without the pain.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult",I'm an incredibly self sacrificing person and have overextended myself.
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","I'm going to start seeing a therapist for all of this ASAP, but I have already put it off for way too long.That's not to say we don't do fun things, eat good food, watch good movies, etc."
"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult","We have definitely had our fun together and she was incredibly supportive when my mother died and continues to be an anchor when I'm struggling with things.I feel lost, overwhelmed, and depressed."

What is your experience with alert devices for falls?,"It’s a peace of mind for us tho knowing help is close by My dad is a veteran and got his for free, no monthly charges either."

What is your experience with alert devices for falls?,I am interested for sure and would love the information.
What is your experience with alert devices for falls?,That sounds like a good service.
What is your experience with alert devices for falls?,Was the watch just for triggering the service or did it also tell time?
What is your experience with alert devices for falls?,I guess I wonder if it could replace the spot of a normal wrist watch.

Looking for recommendations,"Looking for recommendations Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice."
Looking for recommendations,My grandma who has dementia/alzheimer’s ( not exactly sure)  lives with my grandpa alone together.
Looking for recommendations,"He is her main caregiver, although she doesn’t recognize that he is her husband ( she thinks they WERE married at some point but not now ) and that she isn’t in her home."
Looking for recommendations,She will try and walk out the door to “walk and find her house”.
Looking for recommendations,"My mother and I don’t live with them but we are close, we use a ring doorbell to see when she tries to leave and go over to help intervene although grandpa is usually able to handle it."
Looking for recommendations,My fear is that one day nobody will notice that shes left and we won’t be able to find her.
Looking for recommendations,"The thing is that she always takes her purse with her, does anyone know of a GPS tracker that doesn’t need to be charged too often and works well, maybe that is compatible with an app."
Looking for recommendations,All suggestions are welcome.
Looking for recommendations,Thanks in advance!TILE works well.
Looking for recommendations,"It's up and running 24/7, works for a year."
Looking for recommendations,"It does work better in heavily populated techy areas, you might want to get a few (they're cheap) and see if it works as you'd like."
Looking for recommendations,"I strongly recommend a perimeter fence you can lock, if you can afford it."
Looking for recommendations,"We have definitely been looking at that, my fear is that if she feels caged in if she could get violent."
Looking for recommendations,She never has before though.
Looking for recommendations,"Trackers and alarms are good but there may come a point where paranoia over whether or not the alarm is working, or ""did i just hear it"" in the middle of the night, can be a source of unending stress."
Looking for recommendations,Putting trackers on them might be an issue if they tend to take things off.
Looking for recommendations,"My dad and grandma both always took off their id stuff, breaking them to get it off."
Looking for recommendations,Tile wasn't around then though so maybe it would've been different?
Looking for recommendations,Maybe it could've been sewn in to places they wouldn't notice?
Looking for recommendations,"At some point for my dad, you really couldn't dissuade him once he decided he was going to leave, and he was mostly physically healthy and stronger than me and mom so he could get far in the middle of the night, and it would be hard to stop him."
Looking for recommendations,At some point the fence wasn't just an option anymore.
Looking for recommendations,:( He did seem to feel caged but..
Looking for recommendations,The option was to let him go for a walk into the highway.
Looking for recommendations,Its can definitely be tricky to try to balance everyones comfort and safety.
Looking for recommendations,Good luck!
Looking for recommendations,I noticed one of these... :( So here take this... :D Oof.
Looking for recommendations,I think the GPS tile type tracker is a good idea.
Looking for recommendations,"I don't know where you guys are and what the climate is like, but a missing senior with dementia is an emergency where I am, due to the snow/ice and extreme cold."
Looking for recommendations,"The potential for falls/fractures/freezing to death is there.That said, on top of the GPS tracker, can you install a door alarm or something so that there is an alert when she is leaving?"
Looking for recommendations,Does she have a medic-alert type of bracelet or something to help ID her (and her medical conditions) if she were to go missing and be found by a stranger or EMS/police?
Looking for recommendations,"When she ""walks to find her house"" where does she go?"
Looking for recommendations,Is it always the same route?
Looking for recommendations,Does she have a particular place she is trying to get to (even if it isn't a 'real' place) location wise?
Looking for recommendations,"Do you have recent photos of her, as well as a good description of coats/hats/scarves etc that she might wear if she wanders?"
Looking for recommendations,"I'm sorry you guys are dealing with this, and hope that you are able to find a solution to help keep her safe."
Looking for recommendations,"After my Nani tried getting out of the house in the middle of the night, our family decided to get 2 motion-activated cameras that send a notification that there is either a sound/motion or the door being opened or closed."
Looking for recommendations,That way we can get notified via an app if the door does open at an odd hour and it is also a great way to show her that the door is locked or nobody's home because she does have anxiety now over the door being unlocked or people in the house while they're out.
Looking for recommendations,Medic alert works too.
Looking for recommendations,Also notify local police just to make them aware.
Father keeps wandering the streets,"Father keeps wandering the streets I want to get an Apple Watch for my father to be able to track his whereabouts when he wanders off, which is happening way too often now."
Father keeps wandering the streets,My concern is that he will simply take off the Apple Watch and leave it at home.
Father keeps wandering the streets,Does anyone have any solution for this?

Father keeps wandering the streets,It’s a GPS bracelet that only comes off if the band is cut.
Father keeps wandering the streets,Have you installed locks on the doors?
Father keeps wandering the streets,Sometimes people living with dementia can get busy and figure out the locks so installing it at the base of the door may help deter that.
Father keeps wandering the streets,If wandering is a concern though it may be time to look into a secured care home for his safety.
Father keeps wandering the streets,Good luck to you- I can only imagine how scary that is.
Father keeps wandering the streets,Thank you for the suggestions.

Father keeps wandering the streets,"if you're interested in a good day program or hiring private caregivers, feel free to PM me for local resources!"
Father keeps wandering the streets,Hi and thank you.
Father keeps wandering the streets,He goes to a day program.
Father keeps wandering the streets,The issue is nighttime when everyone is asleep.
Father keeps wandering the streets,We’ve done a latch at the top of the door but he easily defeated that obstacle.
Father keeps wandering the streets,My mother is retiring in a year and looking to sell the house to get a smaller condo so watching him is easier.
Father keeps wandering the streets,They currently have three floors.
Father keeps wandering the streets,There are GPS locators you can put in their shoes or hide in their clothes.
Father keeps wandering the streets,You might be successful in finding a solution by searching for gps trackers for autism.
Father keeps wandering the streets,Therein lies the problem.
Father keeps wandering the streets,Today he left the house at 1am wearing thermal pants and a tank top in the middle of winter.
Father keeps wandering the streets,"He didn’t wear his winter jacket, which would be the perfect place to hide a tracker."
Father keeps wandering the streets,if he takes a wallet or keys or something every time get a TILE tracker He has an iPhone but never takes or charges it.
Father keeps wandering the streets,He also leaves his ID and everything else at home.
Father keeps wandering the streets,"I have tile trackers though, I may try putting one on his shoes or in his pockets."
Father keeps wandering the streets,Thanks for the idea.
Father keeps wandering the streets,😊

(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,Since I had my son shes loved being able to care for him as well and it's one of the few things I see her really light up about.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"She's never really been a hugely passionate person, she loved cross stitches and puzzles but her eye sight makes that hard, social wise she had my dad - both of them are just each others best friend and rarely socialise outside of the odd couple friend they have, so she doesn't have a lot of hobbies and she stopped driving years ago and is now too nervous about it to take it up again (and more recently she's got really anxious about the bus) she's almost voluntarily housebound weekdays."
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"She cares for my son a couple days a week (And she is fantastic at that, although I am starting to worry slightly but it's like with him she switches back into old habits and has it together) and we're always over at the weekend (I love my mum to bits and the running joke is I never left home XD) so she's no where near as bad as my nan was - but it's still heavily reduced and very little mentally stimulating activities or things that really keep you on your toes yanno?"
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,It's to late for her to go back to work (her career credentials have expired and regaining would be like starting from scratch as it's changed so much in childcare) she has very basic IT skills (As much as I love her I wouldn't wish her on the office of my worst enemy!)
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,and frankly she's just to nervous about everything to be of any use doing much.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"I'm worried the window for keeping her mind active and working has passed....And whilst I'm glad my son can help, the second I think he's in any chance of danger I'll send him to nursery full time (and my mum totally agrees, her biggest fear is accidentally hurting him)  I firmly think, regardless, she needs counselling for anxiety but getting my mother to understand MY problems with anxiety and depression has been a long up hill struggle that only really achieved her acceptance that /I/ think I have a problem."
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,I suggested she may need to talk to a professional and she just sort of brushes over it.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,My dad is only marginally better.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"She absolutely does not want to admit this is a problem, she may have a problem or that that problem may not be solvable with a course of tablets or similar."
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,And all of this is made harder by the fact all of us have full time jobs and I have a child to run around after as well.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"We will absolutely figure something out to run her where she needs to be if we have to, but regardless of intention and desire the fact remains we're all adults with families that also need care and time - luckily we all live about 3 miles apart!"
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,I'm also aware we lose our patience with her and that makes it worse.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"My parents have always been sort of low key bickery but recently it's like every weekend is them snapping at each other and with the best will in the world, even knowing she might not be able to help, some of the stuff she does is maddening - i guess sometimes it's akin to asking my kid to get something and him getting distracted by a penny half way through - like I get it!"
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,but also dude come on!
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"I asked you to go get your shoes!I try and help by cooking but then she loiters in the kitchen looking lost and helpless and I feel bad because now I feel like I'm taking away the things that made her feel useful ><  I'm so sorry for the huge ramble, I am so so scared this is early onset like my nan and there's nothing we can do except watch it get worse."
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"I don't know where to ask for help, I don't know how to get her to come get help, I can't even talk to my dad and sister properly because we're all skirting round the issue hoping the gel will work and she'll start getting back to 'normal'."
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,And I'm looking at my dad who's so far the opposite you'd probably peg him as early 40s and just wondering what the fuck he's going to with my mum over the next decade and then the rest of his life if this does go 'worst case scenario' .
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,I'm hoping to find some information about how I could approach an appointment to discuss this - should I make one for me alone (can I even discuss someone else in an appointment for me?)
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"Should I take her with me and ask to speak to the DR alone for a moment, should I just straight up mention it in front of her?"
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,Does anyone have any HRT experience that could tell me I'm just being an impatient twat and to let it work or adjust it?
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,Is it better for my dad (as her husband) to try and seek help?
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"Are there any UK counselling services for this, or is going through the GP the best?"
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,Are there any things we could passively encourage her towards that might help her mentally in terms of activities/hobbies/clubs etc without her feeling to 'old' or 'helpless'?Take her to neurologist.

(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,She is now 66 and it took us a while to learn coping skills etc.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,The first thing is to take her her GP.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,It's important to go with her and have a list of the things you've noticed as you have here.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"The GP needs to refer to a memory clinic for memory tests and scans that can confirm whther it is dementia and, if so, what kind."
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,Once they diagnose what is happening they will put you in touch with different resources.

(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"I struggle with things have to be done in a certain way and it helps me to ask myself, does this really matter?"

(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"You want to wash every single bauble with shampoo before you put them on the tree - sure, go for it."
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"Anyway, GP and contact the Alzheimer's society, they should be able to put you in touch with other resources, even if the diagnosis is not Alzheimer's."
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,Try not to panic and catastrophise too much.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,"Take it a day at a time, talk as a family (we have boozy 'strategy meetings') and be as patient and accepting as you can (it takes practice), but don't beat yourself up when you are not!"

(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,I know logically she has to go see someone to be assessed and best case they tell us nothing is wrong and we were just being paranoid.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,I am worried she will see us suggesting it as an attack though... we're a close family and nothing would permanently hurt that.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,But it would upset her.
(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?,I want to make sure we don't let it go so far we regret not speaking up sooner...

Dad needing tracking,"Dad needing tracking Hi, I hope this isn't too long- I am new to reddit and just had the thought to search for dementia and ask for advice on my dad here.He is 64, has had vascular dementia for 3 years."
Dad needing tracking,He can no longer work or drive.
Dad needing tracking,"He is depressed and has never had many hobbies or much interest in social life or picking up new activities so it's very difficult to keep him entertained- I worry about him all the time, as he lives with my mum and I live a few hours away."
Dad needing tracking,"He goes for a lot of walks every day, to the shops but also just around their neighbourhood."
Dad needing tracking,"We are thankful because it keeps him physically healthy, but he has more and more issues as time goes on and I'm more and more concerned."
Dad needing tracking,"He has heart issues now too, and will occasionally have severe chest pain which leaves him basically stuck to the spot in agony."
Dad needing tracking,He was attacked by a dog recently while walking.
Dad needing tracking,He has not yet got lost but we worry about that too.
Dad needing tracking,"I got him a tomtom gps watch because it was waterproof and meant to have good battery and be quite resilient, but it only showed where he was whenever I could plug it into my laptop later- I couldn't find him if I ever decided to open the app and look."
Dad needing tracking,"The watch broke within a year too because he's quite rough with watches I think.He's never been a phone guy but I purchased a phone for him and a band to wear it like a belt, a shockproof case, etc so that I could just keep the phone connected to my account and track him plus we could call or he could call in an emergency."
Dad needing tracking,"But he never announces when he will leave for a walk, so my mum can't remind him to take the phone with him, and when I have tried to test by calling it or have tried to get him to attempt calling with it, he's forgotten how to answer or make a call (I made it as simple as I could by having only the Call option on the first screen for him but it still didn't work, I suppose because touch screens are a foreign idea to him)."
Dad needing tracking,"Walking is still one of the only things he enjoys, one of the things that's good for him, and I just need to lessen some of my constant anxiety about him by knowing that we can find him if anything happens."
Dad needing tracking,Does anyone have any ideas?
Dad needing tracking,Bonus points if you can help me with any other activities to suggest getting him into that he could do around the home- he often potters about in the shed or garden but just sort of pulls weeds or gets big stones out of the driveway because he doesn't like gardening itself.If your Dad obviously has trouble managing the UI of a smartphone.
Dad needing tracking,"Forget the smartphone and get him a cheap flip phone.At least with a flip phone, when it rings and/or vibrates, all your Dad has to do is physically open it  to receive a call...Not navigate the UI of whatever smartphone app/OS he is at the mercy of remembering."
Dad needing tracking,"At least that way, you have a better chance of him answering an incoming call.Plus, the long battery life makes it more forgivable than a smartphone if your parents occasionally forget to charge it."
Dad needing tracking,"Your Mom should manage the flip phone for your Dad: Dropping it in his pants pocket every morning (much less obtrusive than a smartphone glass slab,) retrieving and charging it up every evening."
Dad needing tracking,"Make it a routine, just like making sure he has his wallet and house keys before breakfast.The dumbest/smartest trick I learned: Setting the ringtone to an old timey telephone ring...Responding to that sound is deeply programmed into anyone around your Dad's age.&#x200B;> He has not yet got lost but we worry about that too."
Dad needing tracking,"&#x200B;>Walking is still one of the only things he enjoys, one of the things that's good for him, and I just need to lessen some of my constant anxiety about him by knowing that we can find him if anything happens."
Dad needing tracking,Let go of that anxiety for now.
Dad needing tracking,Your Dad probably navigates the same old worn paths that he's familiar with and has liked to walk for years.
Dad needing tracking,"As long as he's doing his usual walk thing and not wandering off aimlessly, and you at least have a simple incoming flip phone line he can easily answer, that's all you can really do for now.All of my best wishes to you and your Mom and Dad."
Dad needing tracking,I’ve installed Life360 on my Dads phone.
Dad needing tracking,He’s pretty good about taking it and I always know where he is.
Dad needing tracking,He should no longer be taking walks alone.
Dad needing tracking,Apple series 4 or above smartwatch - battery can  last 24 hours.
Dad needing tracking,Can act as a phone - very simple phone to use too.
Dad needing tracking,Let it be your mom that charges it.
Dad needing tracking,She's the only one that takes the watch off him and the only one that puts it back on him.
Dad needing tracking,The watch is waterproof so he can shower with it.
Dad needing tracking,It will detect falls and also monitor heart rate for irregular heart beats (though apple doesn't say it will detect heart attacks or anything) - and then send you or your mom an alert.
Dad needing tracking,You can use apples find my friends to locate him with your phone.jiobit- Does he always wear the same jacket or belt?
Dad needing tracking,"If so, You can put this device in a pocket he doesn't usually use or attach it to his belt."
Dad needing tracking,He should never be the one that is responsible for charging it or moving it in any way that way he doesn't misplace it somewhere.
Dad needing tracking,The battery lasts 3 days to a week so your mom can just be the one who charges it at a set time and then put it back right afterward.
Dad needing tracking,The cost of subscription is cheaper than a phone plan.

Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"Just have to stand by watching it unfold Mom probably has dementia.She says people broke into their home and stole things (including jewelry she puts in baggies and stashed everywhere, SOME of her grandmothers silverware but not all of it, and her marriage certificate), then broke in again and returned the certificate.She loses things constantly, or I should say can never keep track of her things."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,Not a visit goes by without her calling back to ask if we have seen this or that which she thinks she has left behind.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"It could be an earring, a book, or a package of over $500 worth of fast food gift cards that they buy at the grocery store in order to rack up fuel discount points because they drive between multiple counties for their grooming, doctors, pet grooming, or to check their mail."

Just have to stand by watching it unfold,Was it really snatched in an instant?
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,Maybe.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,Did she possibly forget she set it down and walked away?
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"Probably.Her multiple credit cards were in there, who knows how much cash, most likely some gift cards, and her social security card."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"There is no reason she needs to carry all that around with her, but she has probably always done this and she is a creature of habit.My step-father will never tell her no or make her do anything differently."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"He is a giver by nature and just wants to keep the peace, so I don't feel like he will ever take control of the situation."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"She has always been a little bit of an emotional bully as soon as she feels she is being questioned or denied whatever she wants.And so, since they are both grown adults and she can hold a quick conversation without her shortcomings revealing themselves, this is now how it is.He has gone from strapping 6' man to barely able to walk with a cane (or two) over the past 3 years due to a sudden back problem which shows no hope of improvement.Their homes are both 2 story and he has ended up in the hospital due to falls on more than one occasion, once leaving my mother to have to drive towns away to retrieve him after an ambulance took him in the middle of the night."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"(She knows she shouldn't be driving, gets lost and/or scared when driving, yet does drive on occasion!"
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,)I never hear about anything until later.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"Their main house is an hour or two away depending on traffic, the mountain home is easily 4 hours away, so with a full time job and 2 small children, I cannot be there.My only brother passed suddenly 3 years ago after an opioid overdose and she has been in an accelerated downward spiral since then.Apart from mentally and emotionally distancing myself from them, what coping strategies could I have?"
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"I am very strong willed, but still cant help feeling guilty that THEY moved away from the metro area we live in 9 years ago and being unable to do anything to ""fix this."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"""It beats me down and any time someone mentions them or asks me how they are doing, I spiral into waves of pity for them, self pity, and resentment  (As in most cases, there are a few other mitigating factors in this family dynamic, but that's pretty much a given with anyone's story, so I'll leave out the gory details."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,")When my grandmother was going through her final decade, she moved across state lines to live literally next door to my mom."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,My brother and I were grown and out of the house.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"Mom worked full time, but Grandma didn't have dementia until her last couple years maybe, and that was probably due to cancer spreading to her brain.Meanwhile, MY mom moved farther AWAY when I was pregnant with my second child, to a town with FEWER resources for geriatric patients."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"I cannot be there for her, but she assured me that when the time came, everything would be taken care of and they have plans for everything.Plans for everything...She has been filing extensions on her taxes for decades because she cannot find her paperwork to complete them 100% accurately."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"This probably involves getting as many write offs for a percentage of their phone bill or mileage they want to claim for my stepfather's ""consulting"" business where he does maintenance on some friends' and acquaintances' machines.Oh, and there are hoarding issues on both of their parts."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"One picks up things, the other hangs onto information of all sorts."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"It's a perfect storm, and apart from the 2 homes, there is another facility that probably cannot even be walked into judging from the last building I saw that housed the objects of this profession.What do you do?"
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"It doesnt feel right to ignore it and push it all aside, but I am powerless to help."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"They do not want help and are dancing on the fine line between perfectly competent and questionable decision making.TL/DR: how do you cope with feeling responsible for parents when they want to live life differently than you would see fit, puts them at risk, but does not quite count as incompetent?I don't know the answer to this, but I feel your pain."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,I struggle with it daily.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"I hope for the best, help out as gently (and sometimes firmly) as I can."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,And I try not to drown.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,Take good care of yourself.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"If they are competent (kinda) to make their own decisions, there is not much you can do."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,You just have to wait for something bad to happen that will change their dynamic.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"And something bad will happen, it always does - financial loss, dementia, whatever."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,They will be fine until they are not.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"In the meantime, don’t let it drive you crazy."

Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"My mine is 92, legally blind, with Parkinson’s - should not be living alone - just waiting for a big enough catastrophe to change his living arrangement."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,Hang in there!
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"It usually does not work to argue with someone who has dementia, so I used to use go-arounds."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"I used her concerns about someone breaking in to offer to take some things that might get stolen and place them in ""a safety deposit box."""
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,This strategy worked to get one of her guns out of the house.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"I also used an auto theft in the neighborhood to convince her to let me put a gps tracker on her car (so we could find it if stolen, when really it was to make sure we could find her if she got lost)."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,I also convinced her to let me put security cameras in the house.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,These were ones that I could see using an app on my phone.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"That way, I could check everyday to make sure that she hadn't fallen, and I could also watch anyone coming into the house (since they become vulnerable to scammers)."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"Also, when she started having trouble with food, I ordered Meals on Wheels and had other food delivery services."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"I live several hours away, so these technological options helped a lot.Also, their personality and their openness to assistance changes across time (at least that was true for my relative - not sure if that's true for everyone)."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,Some people who are unfriendly before dementia can become sweet after dementia.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"They usually become more child-like and open to being nurtured and ""parented."""
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"There are some things I just let go of, particularly if it's not a safety issue."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,That helped me somewhat.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"And then it also helped to think of these issues as intellectual problems to solve, so I used my mind rather than feel anxious about it."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"The other thing I would say is that whatever deep childhood wounds one has, they can be triggered by this experience."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,But I think it has been an opportunity for me to face those and grow stronger.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,"I also have come to admire her courage and see her in a very different light than I used to.But also, I would say that it's okay to feel pity for yourself and pity for them."
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,And to feel pain and sadness and anger and guilt.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,I don't know that there's a way to get through this without feeling those things.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,Thanks for the advice and listening.
Just have to stand by watching it unfold,I appreciate it!

Does Alexa and other smart devices really work?,My dad is fairly competent using android devices.
Does Alexa and other smart devices really work?,That all is closer to what I expected.
Does Alexa and other smart devices really work?,"Thank you for your input, everyone!"
Any recommendation?,Any recommendation?
Any recommendation?,"Hi everyone, I was hoping someone could recommend a radio for my grandmother."
Any recommendation?,She has dementia and has a lot of trouble with any device that has too many button.
Any recommendation?,"Lately, she has been asking for a radio to listen to Christmas music."
Any recommendation?,We bought her a radio but it has too many buttons and she has a lot  trouble tunning it to her favorite stations.
Any recommendation?,"We found a one button radio, but it's out or our budget ($100)."
Any recommendation?,I was hoping to find a decent radio with preset station buttons (preferably large buttons) .
Any recommendation?,"I have been googling for a while, but found nothing."
Any recommendation?,I was hoping someone on here had a good recommendation?Is Wifi available where your grandmother lives?
Any recommendation?,If so I would recommend getting an Alexa from Amazon.
Any recommendation?,It plays excellent music and no buttons.
Any recommendation?,"She would just say ""Alexa play Christmas music""."
Any recommendation?,My mom has one and uses it for music.
Any recommendation?,"She had trouble remembering what station she liked so I put a sticky note by the Alexa that says ""70's soft rock"".It also helps with other things, like lists, etc but my mom mainly asks about the weather and music."
Any recommendation?,Also she asks what time it is a lot too.
Any recommendation?,"Hi, thank you for the advice."
Any recommendation?,"Unfortunately, she has a lot of trouble with names."
Any recommendation?,She mixes things up a lot.
Any recommendation?,"For example, one of her favorite all time restaurant is called Domenic's… 2 years ago she started referring to it as Lorenzo's for some reason."
Any recommendation?,She hasn't stopped calling it Lorenzo's.
Any recommendation?,She does this with people's names too.

Any recommendation?,"Could also consider a device like Alexa, maybe a Christmas sale."
Any recommendation?,You could set it up for her to just ask to play music.
Any recommendation?,her voice has to be clear tho.
Any recommendation?,My dad has PD and his voice fluctuates alot and his Alexa has a hard time with him.
Any recommendation?,But you can even set her up an amazon prime acct and add her fav tunes to her playlist.
Any recommendation?,I'm sorry to hear that your grandma has trouble with radios.
Any recommendation?,"My grandpa is pretty much the same, except he has trouble with the TV."
Any recommendation?,He doesn't like working with the remote because of...too many buttons.
Any recommendation?,I was wondering if your grandma has a TV and has access to music channels.
Any recommendation?,I think some music channels tune to Christmas music at this time of year.
Any recommendation?,I have Comcast Xfinity and it offers a wide range of music channels called Music Choice.
Any recommendation?,"The channels are within the 400 range and I was able to locate Sounds of the Season on channel 441 (the channel plays music that goes with the season, such as Christmas as this time of year)."
Any recommendation?,Experiment with this with your grandma and see if she likes it.
Any recommendation?,Hope this helps!
Any recommendation?,Check out the Simple Music Player.
Any recommendation?,It basically just has an on/off and a button for skipping songs.
Any recommendation?,That’s it.
Any recommendation?,The caregiver loads it with MP3s via a flash drive and sets the volume by pressing a hidden button with a pencil.
Any recommendation?,It also resembles an old timey radio.
Any recommendation?,"Unfortunately we got it a little too late in my dads disease for him to learn to use it, but I think for some people it would be really useful."

Dentures,"Dentures As my (28) father's (84) full-time, live in caregiver, I must admit, it's far less scary for me to hear him say,""Where's my teeth?"
Dentures,"""As opposed to:""Pffhwairsh mah pffeeff?"
Dentures,"""Trying to find his misplaced dentures on a now fairly frequent basis is a nerve-racking new development."
Dentures,"It sounds comical, and admittedly it sometimes can be."
Dentures,"Once, I found them stashed in a box of Oatmeal Cream Pies.Does anyone have any tips for keeping better track of said chompers aside from the impossibility of truly constant monitoring?"
Dentures,"(As I think all live in caregivers know, there's also a household to take care of in addition to a loved one and chores inevitably must be done during my dad's down times."
Dentures,"Not to mention, we need time to take care of ourselves as well."
Dentures,")He says he likes to take his teeth out when he ""naps"" (he doesn't nap and hasn't since the latest progression of the Alzheimer's), ""to give my gums a rest""."
Dentures,"But he's so up and down, in and out of bed all day long, I feel overwhelmed at the thought of dropping everything else I have to get done to help him with his teeth about every 5 minutes at least two dozen times a day."
Dentures,"(No, that's not much of an exaggeration."
Dentures,)Sometimes I'll help him put his dentures away properly after breakfast and before lunch so I know exactly where they're at and then try to distract him away from them until he needs them again to eat his other meals.
Dentures,But this feels.... cruel to me in a way.
Dentures,I don't know.
Dentures,"I'm fumbling ungracefully throughout this entire process, but this particular thing is really wearing me down."
Dentures,Any help or humorous observations are welcomed.
Dentures,:)My solution is cheap web cams from Amazon.
Dentures,"Mother in law hid a bracelet the other day and it became a ""situation"", tracked it down to a box under her bed two days before."
Dentures,"I don’t have a solution but as another younger caregiver, how do you find time for yourself?"
Dentures,Do you work?
Dentures,Go out with friends?
Dentures,I’m struggling to have my own life in some ways.
Dentures,I’m just curious.
Dentures,"[deleted] Dude, your siblings should be the primary caregivers, and give you the space and opportunity to establish your own career!"
Dentures,Unless they (or your parent?)
Dentures,"have you in their will, in recognition of the huge sacrifice you are making."
Dentures,[deleted] It sounds like you would benefit from having a family meeting.
Dentures,They are taking advantage of you and you need to remind them that they need to be more present.
Dentures,I would get your thoughts in order and written down first.
Dentures,"And assume they aren't being assholes deliberately but are not being mindful of your needs, you're dad's needs, and their actual contributions to his needs.You should consider taking online classes that would allow you to work towards a degree online while you are your dad's primary caregiver."
Dentures,"If you cannot afford this, if you don't have a decent laptop, then your siblings should help you with this, happily (not grudgingly!)."
Dentures,You want to remind them of their responsibilities without alienating them.
Dentures,You want them to understand that you need help!
Dentures,In home caregivers make real money.
Dentures,You cannot make money while you are his primary caregiver.
Dentures,This puts you in a pickle!
Dentures,"You are frustrated, feel alone, and feel your own future slipping away."
Dentures,You are stressed and they need to know this.
Dentures,You also need regular breaks that do not have you worried about him while your are gone.How are bills paid and groceries bought?
Dentures,Medical care like doctors visits?
Dentures,Anyway.
Dentures,"Yeah, a family meeting is my suggestion."
Dentures,"If they do not cooperate and /or are jerks, I have no practical advice."
Dentures,But you need to look out for yourself also.
Dentures,"Yeah, it’s really hard."
Dentures,I’m not sure what to do.
Dentures,Thanks for the response and taking the time.
Dentures,It’s comforting to know I’m not the only one.
Dentures,I found myself in a similar situation: I agreed to move my mother in law into our house without full knowledge of what we were getting into.
Dentures,"First few weeks were a night mare, me hired someone to help during the day, but nights and weekends became hell.From the get go I did my best to avoid getting my kids involved, they are young adults with a life ahead."
Dentures,"Making them miserables from a decision they  were not part wasn't fair.Eventually things have slowly  improve the last five months, a combination of better diet, no more crazy pills, huge amounts of coconut oil and CBD have made our situation tolerable."
Dentures,"We are supposed to take a break for a couple of months since my brother in law is taking over for a while, I'm worried he will mess up mp progress.As for taking time for yourself, I mountain bike as much as schedule and the wife allows, and she goes to the gym and does arts and craft."
Dentures,The thing is we now seldom go out by ourselves together which mis hard.
Dentures,But I'm working on that.
Dentures,"[deleted] Hang in there, also do take a look at CBD, ketone diets and coconut oil."
Dentures,"At least the CBD is good for oneself, if you won't try it on your patient."
Dentures,Also I use retainer cases for my mother’s.
Dentures,I bought like 5 and leave them around the house.
Dentures,"No real help, but know you're not alone."
Dentures,My grandma does the exact same thing with her glasses.
Dentures,"She's completely lost all her recent pairs and only has one way out of date pair, and *coincidently* has been complaining of headaches... gee, I wonder if it's from wearing out of date prescription glasses??"
Dentures,"Not much can be done in our case, other than order a few new pairs and hope she doesn't hide/throw them out immediately."
Dentures,Does your dad have a few pairs on the go or just one?
Dentures,"Have backups, just in case."
Dentures,"And keeping track of his dentures as you do on some days is not cruel, it's helpful to you both to know their location."
Dentures,I'm sorry this is frustrating!
Dentures,"Caregiving is tough and can feel very unappreciated, but know you're doing your dad a great service and it's a true act of love :) [deleted] No solution, but hoping for an answer....we are in a similar situation."
Dentures,Lost teeth happen on a regular basis.
Dentures,I paid 2K for a dental bridge for my mom that got lost 2 days after I paid the bill.
Dentures,She is in a memory care facility.
Dentures,"I have searched the room a couple times, but no luck.One of those ""What was I thinking"" moments!"
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia We are a team in MIT Hackathon and we were interested to ask what are your thoughts on wearable glasses for patients with dementia?
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,Is this something  the caregiver community would be interested in?For what?
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"They'd probably take them off and ""put them somewhere"" and lose them."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"&#x200B;IME, everyone's trying to come up with apps and gadgets and doohickeys that might work for a day or two before the patient breaks it, or progresses past being able to use it... and then those thousand-dollar prototypes are useless."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"What we really need is something to help caregivers not burn out, and solid support staff."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"If you design anything, how about a system for police to know when the raving elder they're trying to corral is just demented, not coked out and dangerous?"
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,The gadgets and apps are like watching a movie when you have appendicitis.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"That's great and all, but what we need is real solutions."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"There are amazing new phone apps to address behavior issues: wandering (GPS tracking devices), sundowning (CALM and sleep apps), medication reminders and more."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"More apps targeted toward CAREGIVERS: addressing behaviors, bathing tips, etc."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,would be great.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"I also think the ""glasses"" idea probably won't take hold."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"A device to help locate misplaced items, such as glasses would be beneficial."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"Dementia patients ""hoard"" and misplace things often."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,Simple locators to attach to devices would help early onset people with dementia and caregivers.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,At least with my mother everything just ends up in the fridge.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,Except the milk and butter.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,So I know where to look for the TV remote Glasses would not be viable as they lose them often.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,I lost several pairs of my own sunglasses to my dad pilfering them somehow from out house.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"But then he'd lose his in the care facility and end up with someone else's glasses, even reading glasses."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,What is the purpose of these wearable glasses?
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,To correct vision?
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,Or to confuse and annoy a patient who does not understand their purpose?
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,(What is their purpose??
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,)It is hard enough to keep eyeglasses on the faces of patients who have worn glasses their entire adult lives.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"There is little chance someone diagnosed with dementia will tolerate wearing new eyeglasses for any purpose, no matter how useful they may seem from the outside."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,I agree.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,My mum has been short sighted and worn glasses since she was 7 and she has lost 23 pairs of glasses in the last 6 years.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,She also adamantly refuses to wear them on a string around her neck when they are not on her face.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,I feel like I spend half my life looking for her glasses.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,Just this morning I found her 'spare' set in  her underwear drawer.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,Her current main set is yet to be located today...
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"There was a period where I would have been grateful for a short range tracker, that would help me find Dad or set off an alarm on my phone if he wandered out of the house."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,Now that he’s in care I think such a device would be handy for new arrivals who haven’t settled in yet and are most prone to trying to get out of the building.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,I agree that most dementia patients won’t wear glasses unless they have had them for a long time already.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,Dad was still wearing a wristwatch for a while and that could have been a useful place for a tracker?
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,I agree completely.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,The most useful wearable device would be better tracker options.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,We just can't find a tracker that we think my mum would actually WANT to wear and on every occasion when she has properly gone missing she didn't take her phone with her so we couldn't even track that.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"If there was an actually attractive necklace, bracelet or brooch that she would really like that would be way better."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"This is a serious issue for us right now because she recently went missing for 12 hours and was found by police 70 miles away, at 1am."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,We have no idea how she got there or what happened but the whole thing was terrifying for us (she told me the next day that she had a wonderful time although she has given us no details of it) My sympathies!
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,Dad walked out of hospital and up to the main road before being helped by a very nice young lady who could see he was a bit confused and took him to a nearby pharmacy and called police.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,I only got to stammer a brief but heartfelt thanks to her.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,"Your title says wearable ""device"", but your post says ""glasses""."
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,I'm confused about this.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,Glasses usually get lost or get stepped on.
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia,A device that a senior would wear as a necklace or such is much easier and maybe no accidents would occur with that device.
GPS tracking unit,"GPS tracking unit I'm glad I found this group, today's question is something light.Adult Protective Services was called (again) on my step father, he is getting lost."
GPS tracking unit,They want me to get him some sort of GPS tracking keychain / necklace etc.
GPS tracking unit,Looking for some recommendations.A simple fix if he carries an iPhone is to use the Find Friends app.
GPS tracking unit,"If he has an iPhone and you want more into on how to set it up let me know.My mom was/is extremely resistant to wearing any kind of tracker or life alert system which is very frustrating, but luckily she carries her iPhone around."
GPS tracking unit,Good luck with your stepfather.
GPS tracking unit,We installed the life360 app on my mothers phone.
GPS tracking unit,Obviously they would need to have their phone with them but so far she's been pretty good about having it on her when she leaves the house.
GPS tracking unit,It's a pretty easy set up.
GPS tracking unit,We have been ok with the free version so far.
GPS tracking unit,The free version allows you to set up two alerts so we get notifications when she leaves or arrives at her home.
GPS tracking unit,Though it does have a bit of a delay.
GPS tracking unit,I don't know if the paid version is any faster.We are still interested in having something else as a safety net.
GPS tracking unit,Maybe something that pairs with her phone that would alert her and us if she left the house without one or the other?
GPS tracking unit,Identify something he always wears or carries and go with that.
GPS tracking unit,We got a tracker for my FIL that we put in his shoe.
GPS tracking unit,"The problem was, the day he took the car for a joyride my MIL hadn't swapped out the tracker because he was going to be with her."
GPS tracking unit,(But then she left him in the running car to go into the store!
GPS tracking unit,Argh)  The most important thing is for it to always be on him.

Grandma and the rise of technology.,Grandma and the rise of technology.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"Basically, my 84 year old grandmother is wearing my mother down."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"We live in the same house, which is split."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,My Grandma has a basic apartment to herself as she is still able to manage herself to a degree.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"Her memory for things has greatly declined, and yesterday she pretty much forgot who her eldest daughter was when my mother (second of 4 siblings) reminded my grandma."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,Regarding my post.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,She insists that she continues to have a phone.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,Demands a cell phone or a landline.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,We have gone through quite a few of each.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,A flip phone with basic tech to big buttoned land lines.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,She cannot grasp how technology works anymore.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"She comes out and gets angry, throws fits saying how she wants a land line ""you have a land line grandma"", how she doesn't understand after we explain it both verbally and in written form."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"We write extremely legible and simple instructions, that she never follows.After these confrontations my mom is in tears of frustration and sadness."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"There's more to my grandma's fading world, but right now my focus is on tech."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,Could anyone who has experienced similar suggest anything with a voice command option?
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"has Alexa or an echo worked, something that requires no pushing of buttons as she has a light touch and claims to press buttons but ends up turning the phone off in the end."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,Any help would be greatly appreciated.Who does she want to call?
Grandma and the rise of technology.,My mother presented a similar scenario.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"She didn't really need to call anyone, she just insisted on having a cell phone."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,She had a flip phone that we set up with a single number dial for each of her children.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,She had a little list of who was at each number.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,She never used it to call anyone.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,She just insisted that she have it in her purse.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,A year later we cancelled her phone plan and let her carry her phone around in her handbag.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"Sorry to copy paste my reply from poster above, but it requires the same response."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"""She does try to call people."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,She has her sister and decades old friend she talks to in another state.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"Along with making appointments for herself and talking to a local friend or two from the local synagogue, and talking to the family Jewish center.It wouldn't be so bad if we could just hook a phone up to an automated system that just responds to her calls, but she's still capable of calling and talking to people. """
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"If she is actually trying to telephone someone, perhaps try a product like this https://www.alzstore.com/memory-picture-phone-p/0030.htmIf it's more about seeing / believing that she has a phone, but not actually using it to make calls, maybe get an old rotary phone?I'm sure an amazon echo or Google home could have the ""talk only"" functionality that you are looking for, but depending on her cognition, she may not be able to use the tech or even identify the tech as ""a phone"" regardless of how many times she is told or how detailed written instructions are.Good luck She does try to call people."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,She has her sister and decades old friend she talks to in another state.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"Along with making appointments for herself and talking to a local friend or two from the local synagogue, and talking to the family Jewish center."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"It wouldn't be so bad if we could just hook a phone up to an automated system that just responds to her calls, but she's still capable of calling and talking to people."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,The phone you linked is one we have not tried.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,You may be right with her not being able to process the echo as a phone.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,Just trying to find any suggestion and go from there.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"I will pass along the info, ty.Edit: added words What about an intercom with the button labeled as CALL DAUGHTER?"
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"She is still pretty functional with calling people and talking to relatives and making appointments as long as she follows her calendar, but your suggestion may be useful in the future."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,Thank you.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"Have you tried a simplified phone, such as the Jitterbug Phone?"
Grandma and the rise of technology.,It's designed for seniors.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"Whatever phone you choose, make sure her contact list is limited to only a few numbers:  the people & numbers she would most need.Updated thoughts:   Does she know how to use Siri?"
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"(if you're using iPhones) I believe you can set it so all your grandmother has to do is raise the phone and say, Hey Siri, call Sally and it makes the call for her."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"...The sad reality is that her condition will progress, and she won't be able to figure out what to do with objects like phones, no matter how simplified."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"Even light switches and toothbrushes become puzzling to someone with Alzheimer's, so they need more and more help."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"Her frustration is understandable, because sometimes during those moments, she knows something is wrong but can't do anything about it."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"Other times, she doesn't get frustrated, but YOU will, because she doesn't realize anything's wrong and it's a skill she knew just a few hours ago -- like using her toothbrush to brush her hair or not remembering how to put on a shirt."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"When she gets frustrated, maybe you can agree with her that it's frustrating and redirect her attention to a different solution: ""How about if I sit with you and help you make the calls you need to make?"
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"I can come by every morning or evening and we'll do that together."""
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"And maybe her friend and sister can agree to call her more regularly, so she has less need to call them (I'm assuming they know about her condition and that she may need some help?)"
Grandma and the rise of technology.,We actually got the jitterbug last week and she's still having issues with it.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,If i recall there's a total of 12-13 numbers on the phone.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,She would have no clue what a siri could possibly be.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,You've described a lot of what's currently going on with her.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"The frustration and bouts of anger, the sadness that follows as she tries to understand."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,This is all quite so daunting.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,I've taken the time and read through some of the posts on this sub and have a slightly better understanding of things to come and the patience required.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,I plan to show my mother these posts and have her read through as well.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,I'm pretty good at switching her moods around and focusing on other topics when i sense the conversations going one way.
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"My mom on the other hand, see's things with a laser focus and barrels through the frustration, which adds to her own frustration."
Grandma and the rise of technology.,"Tons to think about, this is quite the journey."

Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids My mother is in her early seventies and my dad is in his late sixties.
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,I'm in my late thirties.
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,"They're divorced and both are disabled (rheumatoid arthritis for my mom, mental illness and back issues for my dad)."
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,"Both have been on doctor-prescribed pain medication for years; my father is also a former heroin addict who continues to buy unprescribed pills from neighbors/dealers.As they get older, my siblings and I had to pick up a lot of the slack for medical/financial planning, etc... and it's getting frustrating as fuck because honestly they're zonked out half the time I talk to them."
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,"For both of them, they routinely lose track of conversations after a few minutes, have sharp mood changes out of nowhere, or even fall asleep in the middle of talking/socail interactions after a few minutes.AFAIK, my mother is prescribed hydrocodone and father is prescribed gabapentin.Even though they're both relatively young, there's lots of hospitalizations and health issues getting out of control because they just don't take care of themselves."
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,"My mother was hospitalized for a few weeks due to an undiagnosed heart issue, is put on a strict diet, then goes back to eating fast food 3x a week a few weeks later."
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,"My father ""loses"" his pills so the doctor will prescribe him more all the goddamn time.It's really frustrating because my siblings and I are trying to work with our parents so they have a decent quality of life in the future, but from our perspective they're just fucking high all the time."
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,"I know they both deal with chronic pain, but when I try to sit down and map stuff out with them it's just like they're out to lunch mentally.Complicating it is the fact that they were doting parents when I was younger; they were complete shit at things like paying the rent, keeping the electricity on and holding down a job, but they were never abusive and always prioritized us at the expense of themselves.I'm just at my wits end..."
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,"I want to help them, they dont want to help themselves and it's really shitty."
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,Anyone else been in the same situation or dealed with a similar situation?
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,"What did you do?Yeah I’m dealing with it now, check my post history because I don’t have the energy to explain why I get you.My advice- don’t ever move them in with you or next door like I did."
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,Keep a safe distance I wish I would have.
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,> don’t ever move them in with you or next door like I did.
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,I think that's good general advice.
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,"My wife and I actually bought a condo for her mom to live in about 10 years ago, and part of the discussion was that a cheap condo is probably cheaper than a murder charge."
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,"It's only about a 5 minute drive away, but that's far enough."
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,"You can't help people who don't want help.This applies to food, drugs, alcohol, gambling, all of it."
Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids,"It doesn't really matter if the drugs are legal or not, prescribed or not.You can have the conversations and try to point them in a better direction - /u/hriaz has a good post - but ultimately if they're happy, you're not going to ""fix"" them."

Father with Early On-Set in Clinical Trial - working?,I sat in what looked like a dentist's chair and they put something like a virtual reality head gear thing on me.
Father with Early On-Set in Clinical Trial - working?,"It had a slide show built into it, just regular pieces of standard art from art history books that they cycled through, which I found a bit boring since I was an art major in college - it was all stuff I already knew anyway."
Father with Early On-Set in Clinical Trial - working?,"I was belligerent and not into it.After that, the guy came back and asked if I saw anything weird."
Father with Early On-Set in Clinical Trial - working?,"Me: Nope, not all all, just the regular slides."
Father with Early On-Set in Clinical Trial - working?,Him: what do you mean?
Father with Early On-Set in Clinical Trial - working?,"Me: There was just the art slides - I didn't see anything.So it turns out there was no art, no slides, just flashing (LED?)"
Father with Early On-Set in Clinical Trial - working?,"lights that tapped into something that was firing off in my brain, and I hallucinated the art slides - but it was so damn real."
Father with Early On-Set in Clinical Trial - working?,"I'm not a person who's ever done drugs, but that's the closest I've come to experiencing an alternate reality like being in some CIA LSD experiment.I thought it might be worth mentioning because my response was not a typical placebo response and it was the opposite of confirmation bias - I went in thinking the whole thing was absolute bullshit, and was still busy telling them so during the debrief."
Father with Early On-Set in Clinical Trial - working?,Placebo responses are fairly robust in any disease.
Father with Early On-Set in Clinical Trial - working?,We are all biased.

Savoring moments with dad,Savoring moments with dad My 73 year old dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's / primary progressive aphasia about a year ago.
Savoring moments with dad,I'm 30 years old with no siblings and it's been hard adjusting to this new reality.
Savoring moments with dad,"Yesterday I stopped by (he's still alone for now) because he was having computer troubles -- on the phone he said he kept trying to do Bank of America and Yahoo but ""no sound was coming out."""
Savoring moments with dad,"He was in a very bad place, anxious and upset and gasping for air on the phone trying to explain but barely making coherent sentences."
Savoring moments with dad,When I got there the internet was out (was he remembering dial up?).
Savoring moments with dad,"He was worried that he forgot to pay the cable bill; even though I've kept track of all the bills the past year and they're mostly on autopay anyway, he always tries to keep up to speed and it causes him a lot of stress trying to log into his online accounts.I reset the router and reentered the wifi password on his computer."
Savoring moments with dad,"He said something about how he needs to keep his hands off stuff now, that everything's better when he doesn't touch it."
Savoring moments with dad,I hate to see him like that and his anxiety only makes things worse.
Savoring moments with dad,"When everything was set with the computer I said ""hey daddy, why don't you come with me to Lowe's?"""
Savoring moments with dad,I've been fixing up my mom's condo since she died last year and I needed to get three new toilet seats.
Savoring moments with dad,"My dad was the handiest guy around  up until recently -- way more competent than I'll ever be -- and it's been hard to keep him involved with projects at the condo, especially when I'm learning as I go."
Savoring moments with dad,But he always let me tag along with him when I was growing up.
Savoring moments with dad,"So when I need to go to the hardware store, I take him along."
Savoring moments with dad,At least he can help me pick stuff out.
Savoring moments with dad,His mood lifted immediately.
Savoring moments with dad,At the store we admired the shiny new Kohler toilets on special and walked over to the seats.
Savoring moments with dad,"In his few words, he offered me guidance on choosing one -- plastic vs. wood, cheap vs. pricy, etc."
Savoring moments with dad,"We settled on a mid range seat, $20 with tax."
Savoring moments with dad,He carried the stack of seats to the car.
Savoring moments with dad,Next stop was his house for a wrench.
Savoring moments with dad,"We needed to remove all the seats at my mom's and I, being a complete beginner and all, didn't know what to expect."
Savoring moments with dad,"His basement is full of tools and he didn't really know where to look anymore, but we made it work!"
Savoring moments with dad,"Anyway, I'm writing this because at the condo, something really special happened."
Savoring moments with dad,"I got to experience my old daddy, the daddy who always knew what to do."
Savoring moments with dad,I let him go for it and he did it so well.
Savoring moments with dad,He removed the bolts on the first old toilet better than me -- he actually took over when I was doing a crappy job.
Savoring moments with dad,I stepped back and let him do his thing.
Savoring moments with dad,Pretty soon he was whistling (!)

How to occupy my dad,"How to occupy my dad A few months ago, the first week of my GCSEs, my dad woke up and he could walk, turns out he has blood clots in his legs and lungs, so he’s stuck at home, can’t walk far and can’t do much without getting out of breath."
How to occupy my dad,"The problem is that it was really sudden, before he was active, healthy, walked about 4-5 miles a day, and it was a sudden change for him, they told him he would be at work by August approximately, so he’s down about that, he started gardening, which is harder now it’s not growing season anymore, he also tried cooking but he loses track a lot and I’m scared of him leaving the oven on or something, and he gets really disheartened when something doesn’t work, I just need suggestions for something he can do with a short attention span, and doesn’t involve walking around or using too much energy, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading this far!!"

"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","""This is important because the protein kinase G signalling pathway contributes to increased blood flow in the brain whereas peroxynitrite contributes to neuronal cell death."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Also via the phosphatidyinositol 3 kinase/akt pathway heat shock protein 70 may promote the regeneration of neurons and synapses in the hippocampusThird step (the way in which heat shock protein 70 limits the damage of amyloid, inhibits tau misfolding, and limits neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease)."

"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Then, when they restored PKC alpha, amyloid beta once again impaired neuronal function."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","In other words, amyloid beta doesn’t inhibit brain function unless PKC alpha is active."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","""Before various enzymes get damaged in Alzheimer's disease perhaps electromagnetic head devices do have some benefit.Also, to quote you:“ I always look for a plausible explanation behind apparently successful results.”This is the critical flaw in your thinking - this is not how scientists are trained to think, for good reason."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","My discussions with other scientists about papers often begin with them saying “well I want to believe this is true, but...”Whenever you see a positive result, even one that is completely expected, you should do everything in your power to disprove it."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","If you cannot disprove it after extensive research and testing, then you can accept it to be true."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",This how how rigorous statistical planning for experiments works.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",You work the opposite of this with any study you find that supports your hypothesis - you pick out the parts that support your theory with no critical evaluation or consideration of counter explanation.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","If you find extensive flaws in the research design, analysis, or interpretation of the results, you really can’t take much away from a study."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",Yet you do this time and time again to irresponsibly promote unproven herbal remedies to patients.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Ah, but you are doing something similar, you just don't realize."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","You start with a premise that herbs cannot be used to treat Alzheimer's disease, and then dismiss all evidence to the contary as junk science."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",When a meta-analysis says a certain type of treatment is inconclusive the skeptic reads that as conclusively against.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","On the other hand if the explanation produces poor results time and again (say the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease) then the reverse is done--the failed results must be caused by something because the hypothesis has to be correct--wrong dose, given too late, wrong form of amyloid."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Thus ""positive"" results are rejected because they don't square with what one believes, and negative results are rejected because they do not fit the hypothesis that many Alzheimer's researchers have based their carreers upon."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","And thus no progress is made.This anonymous quote puts it nicely:[Clinical trials with over-the-counter supplements have concentrated either on items which suppress inflammation, or on antioxidants which scavenge oxygen derived free radicals."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",Most of these items have proved to be worthless in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Similarly most drugs used to treat Alzheimer's disease do little to slow the deterioration, but instead offer a mild temporary symptom relief."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","However, evidence has been accumulating that the primary driver of Alzheimer's disease is a nitrogen derived free radical called peroxynitrite, which may mediate both amyloid and tau accumulation as well as their toxicity."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Excellent results have been obtained with peroxynitrite scavengers, with reversals of Alzheimer's disease in human clinical trials being repeatedly demonstrated."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","IMHO, the only thing which may be preventing the abolition of Alzheimer's disease is the mental inertia of scientists, as well as the bureaucrats who fund them."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Unfortunately, most bureaucrats keep throwing money into repeatedly testing discredited interventions, while ignoring successful ones."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",Common sense is anything but...] You just don't get it.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","I start with the hypothesis that NOTHING can treat Alzheimer's disease, and work backwards from there."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","The genetic, human, and preclinical data on the amyloid hypothesis is extremely strong."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Unfortunately, the human trials have all shown that targeting it at all the stages they have tried does not change disease."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Either amyloid does its damage in the prodromal stages of the disease (10,20 years before symptom onset), or it is simply a byproduct of other pathogenic processes (inflammation, infection, diminished proteostastic mechanisms)  [please don't post a bunch of random abstracts to try and say that peroxynitration is involved in all of these processes]."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","To wit - Amyloid is most likely heavily involved in disease, we are just unable to therapeutically target it."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","The clinical trials do not ""prove"" that amyloid is not involved in disease - they do seem to prove that  it is not a good therapeutic target to treat the disease.Many researchers have also based their careers on the hypothesis that antioxidants can treat alzheimer's."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","These large scale trials have also failed.When I read that meta-analyses of evidence around a hypothesis is inconclusive, I certainly don't dismiss it out of hand."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",But the stuff you continually post and try to connect is really scientifically weak.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",You try to connect poorly done clinical trials to cherry-picked in vitro studies to support your hypothesis when they really have nothing to do with each other.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","And you post these piece by piece in a haphazard fashion which makes the evidence chain really hard to follow, instead of collating them into one cogent review citing 150-200 papers."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Again, my problem with you is not the discussion of alternative theories of Alzheimer's, or even that you are an amateur scientist."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","My problem is that you discuss your relatively fringe theory as basically settled fact to a lay-patient population using jargon-filled posts to legitimize yourself while promoting unproven and potentially harmful herbal remedies.I would love it if Alzheimer's could be effectively treated with aromatherapy, or CBD, or essential oils, or anything else that is readily available."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",Unfortunately that is not the case.Using an anonymous quote that sounds like you wrote it to support yourself?
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",Jesus.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",I googled it and you posted it almost a decade ago on another forum (that you were probably asked to leave).
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Well at least I have been upgraded to holding a relatively fringe theory since you have already acknowledged that ""many researchers have also based their careers on the hypothesis that antioxidants can treat alzheimer's."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","""As far as I know there has only been one large scale clinical trial testing antioxidants for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and it was fraught with many problems.One major mistake was to assume that because genetic mutations led to amyloid that amyloid had to be the cause of Alzheimer's disease, but those same genetic mutations led to oxidative stress first."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",And amyloid is certainly not the only thing that can cause oxidative stress in the brain.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Plus those other factors lead to amyloid in the first place.https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2014/375968/So the problem was not that anti-amyloid drugs were given too late, the problem was that they focused on only one trigger for the disease (in this respect Dr. Dale Bredesen is far ahead most of the ""rock stars"" of Alzheimer's disease).The quote is not mine."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",I know little about the person who wrote it other than that he is Canadian and is an amateur scientist who carefully reviewed the literature.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","At the time, the evidence for his position was not as strong as he suggested, but the intervening years have significantly bolstered his claims."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",The linked blog is a great summary of the current work on EMF and AD research.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device",I will have to dive a little more deeply into the individual papers if I have time.
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","From the end of the blog:“The currently available scientific database on the impact of RF-EMF exposures on AD is too limited to draw any final, or far reaching, conclusions in relation to human health and human health risk.”From my reading of the summary it sounds like the evidence on benefit is very thin with an unclear mechanism, and is greatly outweighed by the safety considerations."
"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device","Of course you connect this to your peroxynitration hypothesis, using extremely tenuous connections, and a word salad that looks impressive to those without a scientific education, but in reality barely makes sense to those who have studied the field."

Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,I have a weird situation.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,My mother is not very old.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,She is 58.. Mostly in good health.But recently she fell and hurt herself in her apartments basement parking lot.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,It was 10min before someone else came in so she could ask for help.In the basement she has no cell coverage so she couldn't call anyone.Is their an app or device which can notify me if her heart rate is abnormal even if she is not in cell coverage?
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,Or at worst case notify emergency services?It's called Life Alert.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"I'm sure there are a few different companies that do this, but my grandmother had this one."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"Remember the old ""help I've fallen and can't get up"" commercials?"
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,That's essentially what this is.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,Grandma had a necklace with a button on it.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,If she had a fall or any other issues she could press the button.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"Now, they have someone call to check on the situation."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,If no one answers then they automatically alert emergency services.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,I'm sure they can save your info as an emergency contact...that way if they do get a hold of your mother they can determine the severity of the situation.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"[deleted] I read that some of these services can use a landline as well, but I see your predicament... if your mother is in the parking lot I'm not sure if the service would extend that far."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,Best bet would be to contact a couple of these places to see how far their landline coverage would extend.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"I think Verizon has an emergency medical alert, but there again you run into the no cellular service issue."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,Wish I could be more help on that.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,How close is her apartment to the basement?
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,I have to make calls/texts over WiFi in my actual apartment because we have no cell service.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,You could try getting a WiFi booster that would reach the basement.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,[deleted] My husband said you'd need a massively strong mesh router and isn't sure it would work (he's an electrical engineer).
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"A few suggestions, but none are simple:Ask the building owner and see if they'll add something for safety, like install a cell signal booster (it might be a liability if someone fell and died in the basement because they had no cell service to call for help)Make friends with someone on the first floor, get their WiFi password, and then see if you can put a mesh router in the basement that would pick up on their WiFi signal so that your mom could use that when she was down thereDoes she own or rent?"
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"[deleted] Hope you can figure something out!And then, just because we're dealing with my grandmother right now - try to get your mom into a true single story with a kitchen/bathroom wide/large enough to use a walker in."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,My grandmother's  single story house has two steps into the garage and they've been a nightmare.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"Also, move her some place accessible - my grandmother lives in a fairly remote retirement community in NJ, so she has to rely on expensive taxis because there isn't much public transportation."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"Plus, it snows, and since she's isn't near i-95 (largest highway on the east coast), it isn't like we can drop in to say hello while we're driving by on a road trip."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"If you can move here somewhere near you, that's ideal - it would make our lives so much better - but you probably can't commit to living in the same town for the next 20+ years, so just try to make it a place that isn't hard to get to."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,[deleted] The cell booster is a great idea.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"If you are so inclined, you might offer to buy it and donate it if they would install it."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,That way you could ensure compatibility with her cell phone.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,Sell it on the safety merits and you're surprised they don't already have one.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,I assume you dont live in that same complex.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,There are devices you can get if there is someone within say 100 feet.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,You would need to test it tho.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,I live with my dad and got him a small wireless dorrbell.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"he puts one around his neck, the reciever is in my room and is quite loud."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,he presses the button and the receiver chimes and lights flash.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"It works by wireless, i believe 2.4ghz."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,Got it on Amazon.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,I dont know of anything other than Life Alert of that kind.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,Would want to talk to them about coverage.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,Same with a small radio like a walkie talkie.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,What about something using satellte technology?
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,If you cant find anything try this....if theres a college close or just email one with an engineering dept and present your problem and see what they say.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,can also try an engineering firm.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,Might also try a communications company.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"Cellphone boosters...would be a good idea for the landlord to put these in, in the event someone does fall or is sick or gets attacked."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"It is placed on the upper perimeter to boost the signal to the outside world.WiFi-calling, which doesnt rely on the cellphones usual signal, if the basement has wifi coverage then try her phone using the wifi instead of the usual signal."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,You would need to check the coverage all thru the garage.Just thinking out loud.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,What the landlord needs to do is put a call booster in so people can use their cells to call for help.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"If they make a emergency call box that people could just dial from their phone, 911 call."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,Good luck and hope Mom is doing ok. Great advice in here.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"I merely wanted to add: If she fell due to an imbalance or suddenly feeling dizzy, maybe she‘d want to see a doctor just in case."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,I would start by getting a cell repeater for the house.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,Its a plug in device that  boosts all cell signals in the area.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"Then get a smart watch, so she can monitor it herself."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,Then life alert or something of that nature where she can hit a button and call someone.
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,"There are devices she can have put on her by her doctor that will monitor he heart rate, if the doctor thinks it is necessary."
Help needed finding emergency response gadgets?,It will usually come with a wireless unit in the house that will call someone.

Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4,My father (73) was diagnosed with dementia a year ago.
Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4,He has used an iPhone 4 since 2013... probably not going to get him to upgrade now!
Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4,My problem is — it seems like the majority of the tracking or call screening apps that might be useful for me to put on his phone are no longer compatible with iPhone 4.
Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4,Do any of you have experience with an app that still works on an ancient smart phone?Could you switch him to a newer iphone and keep the same case?
Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4,Any chance he wears a watch and would wear the Apple Watch?
Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4,"Ever since I read about the EKG reading and the fall monitoring component, I have wanted to see if it could help the geriatric community."
Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4,Thanks for the advice!
Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4,"I was able to get my hands on an iPhone 6, and despite some initial problems, he seems to be doing fine with it."
Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4,"The fact that it’s new and shiny helps a lot, and I was able to remove most of the newer features that would cause him trouble."
Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4,Seconding what the other commenter said - would you consider upgrading to an iPhone SE?
Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4,"I just switched my mom from her iPhone 4 to an SE because a lot of the apps were no longer compatible, and it's been a huge improvement because of the speed, the buttons not lagging, and the responsiveness of the screen."

Safety issues,Safety issues Hello.
Safety issues,New here and still trying to figure out what I need to do.
Safety issues,My 65 yo wife was diagnosed with FTDementia two years ago.
Safety issues,Originally thought to be Alzheimers and had various scans including the expensive new PET scan that definitively ruled out Alzheimers.
Safety issues,She also has diabetes and thyroid issues and takes a statin for high cholesterol.While she she presents somewhat normally if you don't spend a lot of time with her it is becoming more apparent her short term memory is almost gone.
Safety issues,"Repeating things and asking questions constantly, playing solitaire on an iPad all day it allowed."
Safety issues,"She used to cook but can't really do that any longer as ingredients get left out or the stove gets left on... pretty typical behavior.I use the USPS service that alerts you to what mail is expected each day, have moved all bills to online payment so she can't interfere and have our home phone line forward to my cell."
Safety issues,I had it ringing at home AND my cell but disabled the ability to receive calls at home since the other day she answered a call from a scammer and gave out her medical information.
Safety issues,Fortunately the doctors office alerted me when the scammer called there trying to elicit information.When I asked my wife about the call she didn't remember what she told the scammer.On one hand I hate to block the phone completely (I also screen all her email) but I don't want what happened the other day to happen again.
Safety issues,Our utility has a device that can be installed on the electrical panel that allows you to monitor the electrical system and see what devices are being turn on and off.
Safety issues,Designed as a tool for monitoring expenses but I'm using it as a safety tool to make sure the stove/oven gets turned off if I'm not around.Any suggestions or should I just let things be as they are with calls all coming to me?
Safety issues,Thank you.Rerouting all your calls to your cell is a great idea!
Safety issues,"We did that with my grandma in law, pretty much for the same reason."
Safety issues,She was still able to make calls though and we left a sheet with friends and families numbers beside the phone.
Safety issues,She needed help to use it though so it was usually an activity that her visitors could help her with.
Safety issues,"Hey, is there a way to let ""certain"" numbers through?"
Safety issues,My Mom is going nuts this afternoon.
Safety issues,"Scammers keep calling but of course she doesn't think they are, they're checking to see she's home to come get her, they're this, they're that... the only problem with completely re-routing calls is she has family and friends that do call to drop by, or take her out for lunch etc., and would want her to get those."
Safety issues,"If anyone knows, would be grateful for the the answer."
Safety issues,"I'm in Canada, so there wasn't really anything like that here."
Safety issues,(At least that we could find at the time) But I think I remember seeing a TMobile plan or something that would only ring if certain numbers were calling.
Safety issues,I don't know if it exists anymore though.
Safety issues,It depends on your phone and carrier.
Safety issues,I'm using Comcast for a landline and you can block all or block up to 25 numbers total.
Safety issues,Either or.
Safety issues,We also use a free service to block spammers (nomorobo.com).Cell phones (at least my iPhone) has the ability to block everyone except your Favorite contacts or your address book.
Safety issues,I kinda figured.
Safety issues,It's a land line.
Safety issues,She has a cell but was never very good at it and now forgets how to make a call on it at all most days.
Safety issues,Blocking 25 numbers won't get rid of all the random spam calls they get on the landline.
Safety issues,"She really only can use land line handset these days, and struggles with that sometimes."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone My dad has Alzheimer's.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,He's been losing his phone a lot lately.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"I have Find My iPhone on his phone, and we're usually able to locate it...however that doesn't work when he forgets to charge it and it turns off."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,So I just bought him a bungee tether for his phone so i'll be attached to his pants and he can't lose it.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,Let's hope that works.....However that's just part one.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"The other part is that he's getting frustrated about not being able to be independent, and he's getting very stubborn and acting out."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"Sometime's he'll just go somewhere else when my mother or his aid isn't looking, and then we have to find him."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,I would like to get a tracking app for his phone that is a little more sophisticated than Find My iPhone.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"Something that will have a more specific location tracker, something that has a ""geo-fence"" that will let me know when he has traveled outside of a particular area."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"Preferably something that my mom can patch into and see where he is, or if she forgets, it'll tell her if he's not where he's supposed to be."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"Also, and I don't even know if this is possible, something that would allow me to patch into their phone and either use the mic to hear what's around or the camera to see what's around, in case we really can't find him."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,I don't know if that last part is possible.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"I know there are good kid tracking apps, but I don't have kids, so I don't know what they are."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"Does anyone have any suggestions based off of apps they've used?ThanksI work in an assisted living facility with a focus in memory care, and this happens ALOT."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,An app that I would recommend is Life 360.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"You can create a “circle” and that shows where the family member is, shows trip history if they were to go somewhere, and even shows their batter percentage so you can remind him to plug it in if you notice he’s getting low."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,You can set up notifications for when he leaves and arrives and destinations.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"Hope this was helpful, and good luck!"
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,I will look into that.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"Thank you for the very quick reply, it was very helpful."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,You’re welcome!
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"One this I forgot to add is it isn’t accurate to the point of telling you, for example, where in the house they are."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,But it can give an address and general area I second Life360.

Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,My parents can't even remember how to use their basic flip phones.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,They've given up even charging them.

Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,I bought mom a flip phone and she won’t use it.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,Setup nomorobo on the home phone and she’s not happy so many people “hang up”.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,I told her it’s to protect her but it falls on deaf ears.My nephew’s wife wanted to get her a new iPhone.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"Yeah, no."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,Different moms are different.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"My 76 year old mom has had an iPhone for quite a while and does pretty well with it - and she still works, with kids, and isn’t shy to ask one of them for help."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"IMO, you want more than a phone tracking app if he's forgetting his phone."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"I suggest something like the GPS tiles, where you can put one on his car keys, in the car, in the sole of his shoe, in the belt he always wears, etc, and then any time one of them goes outside a certain range, you get your alert."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,Unless/until he starts stripping.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"This is the recommendation for kids who are at risk of kidnapping by a family member - one in the shoe, and one in the backpack strap - so then if they ditch the backpack you still have the one in the shoe."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,The other option is to put one on him obviously (like a necklace or bracelet) so that he has something to ditch if he wants to get away and he doesn't look for the other one(s).

Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,https://blog.caregiverhomes.com/the-50-best-gps-trackers-for-seniors Find My iPhone is pretty much the best you can get from a phone perspective.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,It has lower level device location access that most apps won't.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"Other apps probably offer better GPS location features.For better reliability, you'd have to find a non-phone based device with much longer battery life."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,Garmin (and I'm sure others) make devices intended for being out in the wild with battery life's of 90+ hours.
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"It'd be another device, but something that you could find him with.Have you considered case with an integrated battery?"
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,It'd give him some extra battery life (double or more depending on the case).
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"For when the phone is lost/dead, I use a Tile on my grandmother's phone."
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,Works great!
Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone,"We also have an Alexa Show set up near her favorite chair and we can ""drop in"" on her in the Alexa app when needed."

Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia Basically, I'm currently living with my mother and brother at 28 due to my old roommate moving away."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"My uncle had a stroke about two years ago, and a couple months ago we moved him in with us to take care of him (this is the second family member we've done this with, the last was my grandfather with the same issue)."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"They said he's had multiple ""silent"" strokes in addition to the major one, and he has trouble forming new memories or remembering anything from the last 5-6 years (for example, he doesn't remember that my granddad, his dad, passed away)."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"As such, he needs constant care as if he wanders out, after 45 minutes to an hour or so he'll have forgotten what's going on entirely.&#x200B;We can't afford to keep taking care of him, I'm trying to get my own life on track and I'm giving up about a quarter of my paycheck each month towards his care, as he has to go to adult care while we're not home."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"The doctors are refusing to diagnose him with dementia and keep trying to send him to mental health therapists, which is causing problems applying for SSD."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"His daughter is 22, and basically doesn't want to do anything on her own, so she's living out of his house and was burning through about 2500 of his savings a month until my mother moved the money."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,If we even try to breach the subject of selling the house so that we can move him towards Medicaid she starts texting him telling him we're trying to throw her out and he gets distressed and upset because she keeps pushing the narrative that there's nothing significantly wrong with him.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,I really don't know what we can do.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,He barely had 10k in his savings after his daughter was done with it and that's not even going to last a year.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"We don't have anyone else to turn to as he's the last surviving member of my mom's side of the family, and he's 58 so barring another major stroke we're likely to be caring for him for the foreseeable future."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"Outside of governmental, do you guys know of any charities or organizations that can help?Your first call is to Social Services to see if you are possibly eligible for any benefits."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,Your second call would be for a 30 minute consult with an ElderLaw attorney.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,It shouldn't be that expensive.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,It's a little complicated.Has he signed a Power of Attorney over to your mother yet?
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"If not, then he needs to do that while he can still comprehend what he's signing."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"Because this will be important for her to have when he gets to the point where he can't make any decisions, and the house absolutely needs to be sold."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,Sounds like she has access to his banking so that he can continue to pay bills.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"That's all good, but make sure she has that POA.He has already decided to live with you, so, if he wants, he can sell the house."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"However, another way around this might be to investigate on your own, what memory care facilities are open, how much they cost, and what they offer."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"Talk to others who have gone through a similar situation, and go look at the places they sent their loved ones."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"Once you have the costs, this will be info you can share with him that will point to the necessity of selling."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"As far as the daughter, you will have to get an attorney or a restraining order forbidding her to live in the house."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,It's called a move out order.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"If you have evidence (documentation -bank records) that she's taken money, that's valuable info for the judge."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"Also, document what happens, and the dates when she's texted or called him and harassed him about the house.Read up on Adult Protective Services."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,It's good to know what they can do before you make that call.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,Has he made ANY statements to you about being afraid of his daughter?
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"If you do, then write down what happened and when."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"Chances are, they'll call you back to determine whether or not there's enough evidence to begin an investigation, or if your mother has everything under control.As far as the doctor, he needs to get a neuro-cognitive workup."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,Your mother should also be signed in for being the person allowed to ask for information and talk to the doctors for him.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,Is he on private insurance now?
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"Does he need a referral, or can he just go to a neurologist?"
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"Read through his policy and find out whether he has an HMO, PPO and how his plan works."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"If he doesn't have ANY insurance, then he can just go, though it'll all be out of pocket."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"He can, at any point, apply for Medicaid without the SSD.Anyone can call the county and request a social worker to come out and make an evaluation of his mental and physical condition at any point."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"My mother has POA, but unfortunately so does his daughter."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,He didn't actually decide to live with us; every day he forgets why he's here and we have to tell him he's staying with us for a while and make up something to placate him.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"He does not have the mental faculty to know that he needs to sell his house, some days he insists that he never had any strokes and that he's fine."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"The problem is it doesn't matter how much we talk to him, his recall period is only about six hours so all he can remember is that his daughter is living in his house and that we're trying to sell it, so when she calls him and tells him that, he thinks we're trying to do it out of malice.He's not afraid of his daughter, he legitimately wants to give her a place to stay but he can't understand what's going on because he thinks he's only been staying with us a few days when he's been here over 6 months.As for insurance, he's on the low income version of Medicaid rn so we can afford doctor visits, but they won't cover longterm care unless he has less than 9k in assets."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,I'll see about having a social worker out but the problem is that someone just sitting down and talking to him can't really see the extent of the problem.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"He can carry on a normal conversation without many problems, maybe a little confusion, the issue is that he won't remember any of it later."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,Basically his symptoms are similar to anterograde amnesia.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"His PCD agrees that it's vascular dementia, but the specialist he was referred to is hemming and hawing and saying that he just has some ""memory issues"" and she can't recommend disability."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,Sounds like you may need a lawyer to pry the blood-sucking leech out of the house.
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"That would my first stop, anyway."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"She's not only blocking your uncle's healthcare, she's indirectly siphoning money out of you since you're at an impasse until she turns loose of the house."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"I don't know all the details, but that's what it sounds like."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"Best wishes, and big hugs for your kindness taking care of your uncle."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"Well, we can get her out of the house, the issue is that she's going to immediately start whining to Uncle that we're making her homeless and he's going to flip out because he can't understand why we need to."
Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia,"But yeah, I appreciate the support!"

What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,Hi there.
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,My boyfriend and I are in our 30s and are seriously committed to each other longterm.
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"We once were hoping and planning to get married, and still would if it were physically and financially possible."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"We have lived together for a long time.However, all our dreams died about five years ago when he very suddenly became overwhelmingly ill with a very misunderstood severe neuroimmune disease."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"This disease is not technically terminal, but it is progressive and degenerative, and will eventually render him unable to sit up, eat, speak, or read."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"This could take a few years, or a few decades."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"The most common causes of death with this illness are suicide, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, so it will be a very very long, drawn out torturous and painful process for him, and for me to watch the person I love fall apart."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"This disease has a notoriously low quality of life.I have been taking care of him for four years, there have been ups and downs, but really only downs in the last year or so."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"We used to be able to leave our apartment together a few times a month and have meaningful interactions, but now his level of pain and suffering has him completely bedridden unable to even handle the volume from the TV."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,Conversations are rare; he doesn’t have the energy.
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"His needs for the first two years were nothing I couldn’t handle, but these last two years are starting to overwhelm me (things like helping him to the bathroom, bringing him water from the next room, keeping track of his 42 meds, getting yelled at for speaking because he cannot handle audio/noise or conversation, physically helping him up when he tries to walk and falls down, preparing all his meals and sometimes feeding him, etc.As much as it wears on me, I love him and I know however I feel about all this is nothing compared to what he feels, having his life taken from him so young, and being the one physically experiencing the pain and limitations."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"We both know it will only get worse too, and will end up needing extreme professional care and hospital equipment to keep his body alive down the road.Here is the caveat."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"He is incredibly grateful for everything I do for him, he has never been intentionally rude or demanding, and often apologies (which I assure him is not necessary) for requiring me to do so much work."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"He is 100% ludic, and he says he no longer wishes to suffer like this and is petrified of the next stages of the disease which “he does not care to be around for, this is already beyond what he can tolerate.” He tells me numerous times he wants to die."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"He does not want me working to keep him alive anymore, yet if I don’t he wouldn’t die naturally anyway... just suffer more greatly."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"He gets furious and distraught that he feels I have to do all this for him when he doesn’t even want it, he just wants the suffering to end."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"I understand where he’s coming from, but it makes everything I do feel pointless and like a waste of time since he is already checked out."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"Hospice or assisted suicide are not legal options as this illness doesn’t meet the qualifications of “less than six months life expectancy” though he always makes a point to note that he would be so relieved if he found out he only had to endure six more months of this.He has been treated for depression and all psychiatric angles but the thing that depresses me the most is, I don’t even think his feelings on this are terribly illogical."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"If I were in his situation with no hope and nothing to look forward to besides an extended excruciating life and death, I’d want to avoid all of that as well.He loves me, and tells me all the time, but he doesn’t love me enough to continue suffering this way for the sake of it."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,I will never leave him.
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"But I do know that in a year or so, his caretaking needs will seriously surpass what I am capable of and he won’t even want to be kept alive just for the sale of suffering longer anyway.I am NOT asking how or if to end his life."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,That is not something I will ever do or even discuss despite the gnawing side thought that it probably would be what’s best for him in the long run.
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"I don’t know how to emotionally cope with taking care of someone I love and who I know loves me, but no longer wants to be alive or be taken care of for what some people may see as a rational reason.I don’t really know what advice I’m looking for other than how to stop crying and how to make what’s left of his somewhat functional time here the best it can be.I read all these posts in this subreddit and it always seems like the caregiver is overwhelmed with their love one’s physical needs and demands and often have to treat them similar to a child."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,That’s not my situation at all.
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,I just don’t know what or how to do anything right for him.You are not wrong to have feelings of understanding for his wish to allow himself to die.
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,I know of no single individual who would be totally cool just existing inside  a body they can do nothing with.
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"I am so sorry you both have found yourselves in this predicament and it sounds like he is lucky to have you help him to navigate as his disease progresses.It sounds like the most important thing you can do for him right now, if you have not yet, is to see a lawyer and help him complete an Advance Directive so that as his condition progresses, he is not kept alive against his will."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,I don't want to say too much about this here as I have strong feelings about maintaining one's autonomy in death as in life.
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"And maybe this goes against yours or his personal beliefs, but from the sound of it, per your writing, it does not."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"In that case, your job will be to become his advocate in the face of a lot of resistance.I hope you find these words and the link below to be helpful."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"Feel free to PM me anytime.National Hospice and Palliative CareEdit to clarify: I know you are not asking how to help him die, but if his wish is actually to do so and there is nothing that can be done to prevent progression of the disease, then palliative care may be the most appropriate route to take."
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,He really needs to see an appropriate lawyer to understand his legal options.It sounds also like he is going to need to go into a care facility at some point as well.
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,Is he on Medicaid?
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"Again, I am so sorry you are both having to go through this.Caregiver.org Hello and thank you for your kind response!"
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,May I please send you a somewhat lengthy dm in the morning (my head is spinning right now and I just need to take everything in for a moment) but I have a large bouquet of questions that I’d love to run by you if that would be okay.
What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,"It’s so rare to come across somebody who seems to really understand everything, and I would love the opportunity to chat with you about this briefly and seek some clarification!"

What to do when they don’t want to live anymore?,He also had early onset dementia and the second stroke affected his personality (that was worse than the physical effects).

Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,Thanks everybody.

Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"Also, if he wanders at night, I can see him not taking his keys with him (sorry, just had to warn you)."
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,The smart watch can last 24 hours and he can wear it while sleeping even.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"Just needs 2.5 hour charging time, maybe while he eats and watches tv."
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"look in to GPS fobs I can't find a single one of them that is really a GPS tracker, despite nearly all of them calling themselves ""GPS tracker""."
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,They are all bluetooth trackers that alert you when an item moves a certain distance from your phone.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,Thats not what I'm looking for.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"We don't care when he goes a few feet away from my mom's phone, we care when we can't find him."
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"All the true ""GPS"" trackers are either too big for a key fob or require a constant power supply."
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,I have a tile tracker for my keys.

Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"Thank you for your reply, though!"
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"no i'm talking about actual GPS trackers like this oneyes you need to charge it every few days, but it is what is iswe use this for our dad There are watches with GPS trackers built into them."
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"There is a huge range from expensive to affordable, there are also keyrings that have inbuilt GPS."
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,A quick Google search will show you what is available in your country and most are available to buy from Amazon.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,If he refuses to carry keys etc you could attach the keyring to a belt loop.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,Hope this helps x Google emergency alert trackers for seniors.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,You'll find trackers that allow your dad to call an emergency service company with the push of a button and some have fall detection.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,As well.Another option is a watch.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,I got my dad the apple series 4 watch.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,It's the only one that I know of that has fall detection though rumor is more are coming soon.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,Can monitor sleep patterns too.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,He does seem to wear it but it's going to take a lot of practice to get him to wear it while showering like I want him to.The problem with both of these is that the devices need to be charged so your dad would have to remember to charge them.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,Also both require a service charge or phone service charge.I found this too but I'm not sure if the business is good so they won't go belly up or not.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,Plus it's service charge is quite expensive too.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,The benefit of this is that you can get a power charger attachment that let's it run for 2 weeks without having to charge battery.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,So maybe you can be the one that charges the batteries instead of your dad.https://www.amazon.com/Tracker-Tracking-Vehicles-Equipment-Valuables/dp/B07S7DVT33/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?keywords=tracker&qid=1565867605&s=gateway&sr=8-4 Thanks.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,I looked at that one.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,It is pretty large and doesn't appear to have a way to attach to a key ring.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,He's not going to remember to carry it and its too big for a pocked.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,Frustrating.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,Appreciate you advice.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,This is difficult.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"He'd never start wearing a watch, either."
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,Ugh!
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,There are skinnier trackers but they have limited ranges so I think it's a no go.You can attach a tracker to his car.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,That won't track him if he leaves the house in the middle of the night and wanders though.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,There are door opening sensors that alert you every time he opens and closes the doo but this still won't tell you where he's goneDoes he always wear the same jacket?
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,You could put something waterproof on an article of clothing he wears.
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,I think that fatter device could be put on a key ring with other keys.

Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"He likes to keep track of his exercise, a smart watch might just be the trick."
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"I think I could show him how neat they are at heart rate monitoring, distance, elevation, etc..  BTW, he can no longer drive."
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"The most affordable and universal one is something like SpotGPS , it's a small satellite GPS.tracker , not as small as a key fob, bit small enough.The biggest issue with these devices.besides battery constraints is MAKING SURE THE PERSON HAS IT WITH THEM when they walk outside , of they are having memory issues, this will be a challenge.. but solvable with some diligent planning Thanks."
Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location,"He never leaves the house without his keys, fortunately."

I made a mistake,"I made a mistake My second week working alone without a trainer at a nursing home, I absolutely get my ass fucked up."
I made a mistake,I wasn’t aware that I couldn’t leave a certain resident alone on their toilet.
I made a mistake,I needed to check another call light that had been going off for a while who gets extremely upset when I’m late.
I made a mistake,I told the resident to press their call-light when they were done using the bathroom and when I got to the other resident’s room I got radioed that she had fell.
I made a mistake,"Well I was already in the middle of toileting the other resident that I was late for so I finished them up, hurried to the fallen resident’s room and the nurse asks me what happened."
I made a mistake,The resident was sent to the hospital.
I made a mistake,"This resident was a fall risk, I was never supposed to have left her there."
I made a mistake,"Note to all caregivers, please please read their care plans, memorize the fall risk residents as best as you can even if you have 30+ residents that you have to try to keep track of."
I made a mistake,"If you have a million call lights going off at once, utilize your coworkers no matter what to help you."
I made a mistake,"I’m still finding it hard to face people because I still cannot forgive myself, but I have to so I can improve and try my best to serve these residents who need to be cared for."
I made a mistake,"I learned a huge lesson today, and I’m still trying to accept that we can all fuck up this badly.Most care facilities use some sort of marking on the door (oftentimes it's a large red piece of paper with a leaf on it) to indicate residents/patients that are fall risks."
I made a mistake,"You shouldn't have to memorize the fall risks, there should be some indicator in/outside their room.This was definitely a mistake and feeling bad about it is completely understandable - but don't let it be just a mistake."
I made a mistake,It sounds like you've definitely learned from the experience!
I made a mistake,"Accept that you made a mistake, but let yourself move on - I know, so much easier said than done, right?"
I made a mistake,But the fact that it bothers you is a sign of your compassion.
I made a mistake,Don't let it be the end of your learning experience in this job!
I made a mistake,"Keep your head down, focus on the job in front of you, and let yourself grow."
I made a mistake,You'll be great.
I made a mistake,;) Recognizing the mistake is 99% of fixing any problem.
I made a mistake,"Part of the remaining percentage, is not doing that again."
I made a mistake,I have been on the job for almost 20 years.
I made a mistake,I have seen a lot of bad shit and had a lot of really shitty days.
I made a mistake,Life goes on and you try to move ahead always.
I made a mistake,"Try to smile and mean it,always."
I made a mistake,"Take good care of yourself,always."
I made a mistake,"At the end of the day,its all just another layer of skin that is getting thicker every day."
I made a mistake,"Keep calm,chive on or some such common drivel."
I made a mistake,Heavy sigh.
I made a mistake,You have to remember that you are working with a handicap your first minute on the job.
I made a mistake,What is the patient to aide ratio there?
I made a mistake,"If it is like everywhere else, you are expected to be too many places at once."
I made a mistake,"When you are stretched that thin, all you can do is your best."
I made a mistake,"You may never be perfect because you are not given favorable conditions to do the job the way it should be done.That said, I know how terrible you feel, now that your patient has fallen."
I made a mistake,It has happened to me.
I made a mistake,All you can do is learn from it.
I made a mistake,Try to figure out a way to keep it from happening again.
I made a mistake,"Keep your own list of fall risks, maybe."
I made a mistake,"But move on, apologize to your patient, and I know you’ll keep a sharper eye out now."
I made a mistake,"Honestly, thank you for sharing this story because I’ll be starting RN school and now I’ll definitely be more mindful of this on clinicals."
I made a mistake,"It sucks that for us the mistakes we make on the job can actually hurt people, that’s the scary trade-off for wanting to help people professionally."
I made a mistake,You’re still a caring person and I hope you feel better soon.
I made a mistake,Ditto!

Completely At Wit's End,Completely At Wit's End I struggle so  badly with this.
Completely At Wit's End,"I know I'm a complete asshole for feeling this way, but I wish my loved one patient (patient) would pass away."
Completely At Wit's End,"I don't  want to be too specific,  because I don't want the loved one caregiver to  know I feel this way.Patient, a child, suffered a severe brain injury years ago, and is currently just slightly above vegetative state."
Completely At Wit's End,Supposedly can answer questions with the eye tracking technology.
Completely At Wit's End,"However, he is so fragile, he requires 24/7 extremely skilled nursing plus one extra helper to keep him alive."
Completely At Wit's End,"Numerous  surgeries including to try to fix a collapsed trachea, massive spinal twisting due to contractures, etc."
Completely At Wit's End,"He has a trache, is on a ventilator 90% of the time, vomits 1-2 x per week, resulting in aspiration and frequent pnemonia, has multiple seizures per  week, has intense neuro storming daily (not a seizure, worse...very painful  and  hard to watch), feeding tube, diapers,etc."
Completely At Wit's End,"He requires 7 machines, including a cough assist (he can't cough), oxygen machine, ventilor, tanks of oxygen, etc."
Completely At Wit's End,"All of these machines and tubing require maintenance, cleaning, etc."
Completely At Wit's End,Multiple medications...including morphine for his storming.

Completely At Wit's End,Multiple diapers and pads and is  constantly urinating on the bed and sheets and  blankets.
Completely At Wit's End,"Multiple syringes for feeding and meds,which also require washing etc."
Completely At Wit's End,The house is a hospital.
Completely At Wit's End,"He has 2 wheelchairs, a standing  machine, a special  bike (purchased for 2,000 and used once), and so much other equipment and supplies."
Completely At Wit's End,"The caregiver, who I love dearly, still  thinks he is  going to  walk some day."
Completely At Wit's End,This  breaks my heart.
Completely At Wit's End,Patient is obviously in decline.
Completely At Wit's End,"Doctors have said he will never get better, in fact have recommended DNI on several occasions."
Completely At Wit's End,I think caregiver is in some sort  of severe PTSD mental break.
Completely At Wit's End,The family suffers horribly.
Completely At Wit's End,"Sibling is suicidal, had to be in outpatient suicide program ($50k, not  covered)."
Completely At Wit's End,Refuses school and now  has to go to a special school ($40k).
Completely At Wit's End,"Caregiver rarely leaves house, refuses therapy, refuses family therapy (other than mandated by the suicide program)."
Completely At Wit's End,"Caregiver not taking  care of sibling as well as should be, because of depression and devoting every ounce of energy and time to patient's care."
Completely At Wit's End,"Even with a nurse and a paid helper,  caregiver has a  full time job managing the care!!"
Completely At Wit's End,I honestly can't imagine a patient with more  needs.
Completely At Wit's End,"Must have breathing treatments,  be suctioned constantly, bathed, diapers, feeding, enemas, must be turned every two hours, must be stretched and moved...it's ungodly."
Completely At Wit's End,I guess I just need to  vent.
Completely At Wit's End,"House is a mess, pets are not taken care of, spouse is breaking down and stressed beyond belief."
Completely At Wit's End,Everyone (including my therapist) tells  me just to quietly support caregiver.
Completely At Wit's End,Which  I've been trying to.
Completely At Wit's End,"But how do you support someone when you don't support their decision (not to follow the DNI,  resulting in devastation and  the ruination of the family?)."
Completely At Wit's End,Her life and her  family's life is currently ruined.
Completely At Wit's End,"Caregiver likely doens't see it...like  the frog slowly being boiled,  caregiver is  used to it."
Completely At Wit's End,"People tell me  I'm too emotional, too involved, let them make their own decisions."
Completely At Wit's End,"I've stepped away for my own mental health - boundaries, etc."
Completely At Wit's End,But I still care about caregiver and the family!
Completely At Wit's End,How can  this go on much longer!
Completely At Wit's End,Do I  say something to  caregiver  about my opinion?
Completely At Wit's End,All I know to do is let the consequences of their decision happen.
Completely At Wit's End,I call and  talk periodically...tell  funny stuff...listen when I  need to...but I cannot condone the ruination of the family.
Completely At Wit's End,Worst  of all is the refusal of therapy.
Completely At Wit's End,Especially family therapy.
Completely At Wit's End,Sometimes I HATE modern medicine.
Completely At Wit's End,What life is this?
Completely At Wit's End,Patient is slowly dying and is suffering.
Completely At Wit's End,"It's soooo unnatural to be this husk of a human, with food, medicine, and air being pumped into it."
Completely At Wit's End,Nothing in return but pee and poop and pain.
Completely At Wit's End,God help our family.It’s completely normal to feel this way and you’re not an asshole for it.
Completely At Wit's End,"Seeing someone in a vegetable state suffering and being fed with a million and a half machines is tough.... you think one power outage and that’s it, nature will take its course."
Completely At Wit's End,"I agree with you that modern medicine goes too far sometimes, it’s a blessing and a curse."
Completely At Wit's End,"It can help some people and rehabilitate them, but for others it just keeps them alive long enough for old age to eventually take them."
Completely At Wit's End,"That’s no life, maybe gather your family together and openly talk about these feelings."
Completely At Wit's End,"I’m sure you are not the only one to feel this way, and you all need to work on rebuilding your family after this tragedy, not continue to self destruct."
Completely At Wit's End,"As for the family member who is in denial, if everyone has similar feelings, you all need to be there and support them and tell them how it is, her child will never be a normal kid, they will never walk again, they will never eat by themselves again, they can never even shit on their own again."
Completely At Wit's End,"This is torture, and changing the DNR request is a humane decision, because if it’s their time to go, you’re selfish to not let them."
Completely At Wit's End,"It’s selfish to want to keep them hooked up to those machines while they suffer just so that the person in denial can feel some type of fake better of “oh see they’re better, they’ll get through this.” Sometimes the reality of things is disappointing to hear, but it needs to be said."
Completely At Wit's End,"Goodluck man, I hope your mental health is looked after, I know how hard it is to see a loved on in the hospital."
Completely At Wit's End,I don’t wish this on anyone.
Completely At Wit's End,"At one time, these cases were referred to as ""incurables"" and as harsh as that sounds, that is what they are.I keep  my personal opinions to myself when I come across these cases but I agree with you."
Completely At Wit's End,"You can prolong life or you can end suffering and though I can't make anyone's decision, I would  opt for that latter."
Completely At Wit's End,Maybe in 100 years we will get there.
Completely At Wit's End,"Much like /u/oxymom2002, I can't care less about what others, including dear friends and my MIL, think about my job as a caregiver and our decisions as a family about my wife's disease.Despite they're mostly well-intentioned (with a judgment here and there, like some things you state in your post), what other people who have never been in a situation like this think are just ignorant opinions."
Completely At Wit's End,"When you've never experienced something like this, you simply have no idea how complex it is."
Completely At Wit's End,"I know because I was ignorant before it happened to me.It is not your place to approve or disapprove, condone or not, understand or not, your relative's decision and path unless they have asked you your opinion."
Completely At Wit's End,It's their business and their business only.
Completely At Wit's End,Unconditional love means supporting that person even if sometimes you don't agree with their (in this case very personal and private) life choices.Your therapist and everyone else are right.
Completely At Wit's End,Seems like OP knows exactly what’s going on and what’s required.
Completely At Wit's End,He’s not an outsider shouting his opinion about someone else’s problem.
Completely At Wit's End,He’s not passing judgement from a safe distance.
Completely At Wit's End,This IS his private life.
Completely At Wit's End,His kid.
Completely At Wit's End,His wife.
Completely At Wit's End,His family.
Completely At Wit's End,He lives this life every day.
Completely At Wit's End,He’s losing his wife and children to this situation.
Completely At Wit's End,He’s losing everything.
Completely At Wit's End,It’s not your place to tell him that his place is to butt out.
Completely At Wit's End,I doubt a therapist would tell a husband to quietly support a caregiver wife.
Completely At Wit's End,If it was his wife he'd have direct say in what happens with the kid.

Completely At Wit's End,"Even if he's close, it's not their place to intervene in this way."
Completely At Wit's End,I was the primary caregiver of a total care child and I would give anything in the world to have her back.
Completely At Wit's End,"It was chaotic and hard, but she brought so much joy into our world and now I miss her every day.I'm sure that folks thought some of the same things about us, that you are thinking about the family that you describe, and honestly I could have cared less."
Completely At Wit's End,I hope you do not decide to share your thoughts with this mother.
Completely At Wit's End,"If you are concerned about the state of the house and the dog, please consider offering concrete assistance - washing some dishes, wiping down the bathroom, folding some laundry, or taking the dog for a walk."
Completely At Wit's End,>I hope you do not decide to share your thoughts with this mother.I agree with the OP but I would never say anything.
Completely At Wit's End,Not anymore.

Completely At Wit's End,"I basically said ""Where the   f**k are her children in all this?"
Completely At Wit's End,""".I was given such a lecture by the social worker that I never forgot it."

"am i crazy, or is this just completely unprofessional",It’s a terrible experience but don’t let it bug you or it’ll be more burden (holding onto their rude wrongdoing).

Father in Law wanders off a lot,Father in Law wanders off a lot I just stumbled upon this subreddit and I hope this is a place where I can get some advice.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,"So to cut it short, my father in law has dementia and is some days more easily agitated than others."
Father in Law wanders off a lot,One thing he tends to do when he gets fed up enough is he will leave the house without telling us and we usually only realize he’s gone once he’s made a good amount of distance from the house.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,This ends in us sending out a small search party until we find him and have to convince him to come back home with us.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,So we’ve got together with other family members and are looking into a form of locating device that we could put on him or he could carry that we could use in these kinds of emergencies.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,"Has anyone here had similar issues with Alzheimer’s patients?And of course the big question, does anyone know of any devices we could use to help us know where he is if he wanders off?I was looking into that for my dad but was told by a seasoned care giver that they give you a false sense of security."
Father in Law wanders off a lot,Prevention is way better.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,So we put those cheap alarms on the doors.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,That way if he opened a door we knew.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,Of course it scared the crap out of us when we open opened the door so we switched to a door chime sound.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,Worked great.If you do get a gps device it needs to be on a non removable bracelet or anklet.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,If it just clips on there is a good chance he will remove it.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,"I would make sure local law enforcement knows he is a senior with dementia so if they encounter him when he wanders off, they know how to approach him, and they can have his info on file in case he does wander longer than usual."
Father in Law wanders off a lot,My mom also had dementia and an ankle alert.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,She cut off two off them and left.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,So remember that it’s not a perfect system.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,They can be all kinds of confused but still determined to use scissors.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,alarms on the doors +cameras in the house.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,"its always good to be able to be doing your own thing and be able to pull out your phone and check the cameras to see exactly what he’s up to, and be able to hear when the door opens."
Father in Law wanders off a lot,another option ive not personally tried but read about on this sub is special locks for doors that are specifically meant to keep young children and/or people with alzheimer’s from opening them.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,theyre usually still really easy to open but work differently from other locks so they cant figure it out most of the time.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,problem with that is that it will likely fuel the anger hes feeling.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,another option is to ask a doctor about medications that might make him less likely to have those outbursts.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,I've used an Apple Watch with Cellular for my Dad.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,This won't work if your an Android user.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,"Also, if you don't want it connected to your Apple ID you'd have to connect it to a separate device with its own Apple ID."
Father in Law wanders off a lot,You might be able to setup an Apple Watch without a companion device now...
Father in Law wanders off a lot,I believe it was something they were working on.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,[deleted] I live with my Dad so if there isn't someone there to make sure it gets put on then I wouldn't recommend it due to the cost.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,It should also be charged nightly.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,I've also used Insteon (smarthome product maker) door sensors for alerts.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,Arlo cameras are also all around the house so I can check up on him while I'm at work.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,I put deadbolts on the doors that are keyed both sides.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,"Locks and bolts my friend, besides constantly monitoring him."
Father in Law wanders off a lot,Then CBD oil and next Coconut oil.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,Check on those two.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,So far this combo seems to be working wonders for my mother in law.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,Yes!!!
Father in Law wanders off a lot,My great nana gets fed up and often “escapes” since we took her car keys away.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,She’s speedy when she wants to be...We’ve given her a flip phone with a bunch of important speed dial numbers on a piece of paper taped to the back of it.
Father in Law wanders off a lot,"I put the loudest ringer on the highest volume on it, and because she craves talking to other people, she jumps to answer it when she recognizes that it’s ringing."
Father in Law wanders off a lot,"She’s gone on walks without telling us a few times now, but we’ve always been able to find her if two of us each take a direction, and one of us waiting on the porch."
Father in Law wanders off a lot,"Sometimes she can describe where she is (gas station, dollar store, intersection where the streets begin with X and Y...)We almost wanted to put something on her, but she often takes things off and misplaces them/hides them (Vicks, socks, her watch...)Anyways I hope this helps!"

Looking for recommendations: Mobile medical alert with pendant or wrist band,"But 911 would be ok too I guess but that would add delays until they found out he is in a facility with 24/7 medical help available.thanks in advance!We used Guardian Medical Monitoring, which is wonderful but limited to a few midwestern states."

Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,"Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development Hello everyone,&#x200B;Since I discovered virtual reality I've looked beyond its entertainment value."
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,"That's how in 2012 I started developing PHOBOS with the first Rift Devkit (PHOBOS is an open source platform to treat and research common phobias).In 2017 I developed PHOBOS for AR, which you can find in the App Store for iOS devices.If you are wondering, I am a psychologist and I've worked with dementia.Now, I have started working on a test to help detect potential early signs of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.The test will be free, open-source and cross platform; developed in WebVR so anyone with a virtual reality headset and compatible browser will be able to use it.We have started a Patreon to host the project, update the community and share progress and code.We are a team of 7 developers (and 2 more potentially joining us soon) and we welcome any professionals that want to join this crusade, by developing the test, reaching out to institutions to validate the instrument we are creating.All the money raised for this project will be used to develop the test, for outreach and to potentially fund research projects carried out by universities or non-for-profit organizations.If you need more information, please follow the link."
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,"And if you have any questions, ask me anything.https://www.patreon.com/alzheimerstestThis is meant to be a constructive comment, but to ask for money while providing so little information, or providing evidence of your expertise (do you have a degree?"
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,Have you published in the area?)
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,makes this seem like a bit of a money grab.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,Red flags everywhere.Can you provide some details on the implementation?
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,How about some background literature motivating why your approach will be effective?
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,What dependent variables you will use to diagnose alzheimers?
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,"Where is the background literature that suggests these measures are sensitive to the presence of alzheimers?Again, this is meant to be constructive."
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,"I hope you can provide more details (or, even that I simply missed an important link where they are hidden), but until you do that I could not recommend that anyone give you any money."
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,Constructive criticism taken.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,You can Google me: Fernando Tarnogol.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,"I have published in the science community more than once and in more than one area (even computer science), I have a degree in Psychology but my skills are not limited to it."
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,"There is a recent study very related to what we are doing: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/16/alzheimers-dementia-cure-virtual-reality-navigation-skillsand we are basing part of our test in the SAGE test but leveraging the possibility that VR enables, especially with measuring reaction times, visuospatial navigation and memory.&#x200B;If you follow the link, you will not only find details on the implementation, but a complete breakdown of it in the PDF."
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,It can also be found here: https://gitlab.com/ftarnogol/alzheimers-vr-test/wikis/Test-OverviewThere is even a complete project file with a concept that can be compiled in Unity.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,"I am also well connected with research and educational institutions around the world since I've been doing this type of work since 2012.&#x200B;As I type this, one of my research partners from Thomas More University from Belgium is presenting in the XVI European Congress of Psychology in Moscow the results of the research study we conducted to validate the use augmented reality for the treatment of phobias."
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,This will be the 2nd of 3 congresses we have made expositions within the past 2 months.&#x200B;Everything I do I validate it scientifically.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,There is no way I am releasing a health related tool without science's blessing.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,That's how I've worked since 2012 and I've managed to maintain a spotless reputation.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,I'm not going to start jinxing it now :)I hope this clears at least some of your doubts.Cheers!Fernando A quick google search only provides more marketing - I do not see any peer reviewed articles.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,"I did not do an exhaustive search, but the point here is that many potential investors will be dissuaded by the difficulty in finding that kind of information."
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,Don't you think it would instill confidence in potential investors for you to provide a clear link to your publications?
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,Why make us work for it?I also suggest that you link to other peer reviewed articles that support your approach.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,"If you have not done that kind of research, then I strongly suggest you do, and that you use that prior research to motivate your approach on your website.Again, I do this to be constructive: investors are always going to be wary of folks trying to misrepresent their expertise in order drum up financial support, and investors are wary of that."
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,"And, I want them to be wary - many people on this subreddit are going through emotional rollercoasters, and might be especially vulnerable to opportunists."
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,It would be a shame if someone with reasonable idea missed out on an opportunity because they did not properly represent themselves.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,I am not looking for investors.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,I am not seeking to make a business or create a startup.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,Free and open source is not exactly a business model.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,With $30 per month we have everything we need to keep things running.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,We’ve been clear what we will use the remaining funds for.
Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development,"We already have the development team, our national scientific activities council and 2 universities in 2 different countries have expressed interest to do the reasearch.Last not least, you invalidate most of your own points (mainly the ones I find mildly offensive towards myself and my track record) by saying that you only did basic research, but thanks for the good intentions.End of this thread."

"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements","Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements Hello, my grandfather suffers from dementia and cancer."
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements","He sometimes wanders around the house or takes off to do some random things like going to the bank or getting vegetables from the store, without any of us knowing where he had gone to."
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",Is there a Smartwatch that looks easy enough to wear and can help us track him?
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",and is not overly expensive?
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",Or anything that can be wearable and doesn't hinder him.I'm getting my dad the apple watch series 4.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",It's arriving this tues.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",I think pretty much any watch will do what you ask.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",You can even set up his phone to do the same thing I think without having to get a watch.But the apple series 4 is special in that it's the only watch I know of that can can detect falls and send out an alert to you and emergency services.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements","I posted on the Google sub asking if there was a Google watch that did the same thing but no, it doesnt seem like it based on the responses I got.The watch needs to be paired with an iPhone that is 5s or above if you get the GPS only version."
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",Or a 6 or above if you get the cellular version.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements","The good thing about the cell version is that if he forgets to bring his iPhone with him, you'll still be able to see where he is at any time."
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements","With the GPS version, you have to wait till he gets within a WiFi area to see where he's gone IF he forgot to bring his phone.The bad thing about thr cellular version is you have to pay more money per month for the cell service.I'm getting my dad the WiFi version since I'm cheap and it's unlikely my dad will forget to bring his phone (its habit for him I think)."
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",Well see if I'm right about that though.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",I like your idea.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",Are there any other smart watches with GPS and the falls feature?
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",My mom doesn’t have an iPhone.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",I do but I live 2 hours away and not sure that would work... plus my mom no longer knows how to use any devices but does wander.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements","The falls feature, no - I can't find a single watch other than the apple series 4."
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements","If you find one, could you message me by chance?"
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",I want to get a watch for my mom too but she's an android user.Your mom doesn't need an iPhone if you get the cellular one and sync the watch to your phone instead.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",You can be really far away from her then and it would still work but then you'll have to pay the monthly cell service.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements","Also, the smart watches can receive calls, calls from your phone if you sync to the watch."
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",I'm not 100% sure you can turn off the calls.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",You'll have to ask someone with a cellular version of the phone (maybe in an apple sub).
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",to find out.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",Interesting idea.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",She couldn’t answer the watch intentionally or run it.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",She likes to go for walks and generally walks a specific route but she’s declining and who knows what could happen.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",I will look into it some more.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements","Hey, is it your grandfather or your mom that had dementia?"
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements","If it's your grandfather and he doesn't have his own iPhone, if you go with a watch, you will definitely need the cellular option and to get cell service cause I assume the iPhone won't be within range of the watch all the time.Another option besides a watch is to sign up with a paid alert system."
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",It's  typically more expensive than getting cell service for a watch.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",But some of the devices can also detect falls similar to the iphone.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements","And if your grandfather has health issues, he can push a button and there will be a person on the other line that talks him through what to do and will send emergency services."
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",Your watch can call emergency services too but you wont have a special person on the other end talking him through things.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements",Sorry I think I confused you by highjacking the post.
"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements","It was OPs grandfather, but I was commenting about my mom ... thanks for the suggestions!"

Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips?,"I knew virtually nothing about dementia when I entered the care profession, but once I realised the majority of care home residents were afflicted with some form of dementia, I began scouring the internet for any information, research, and advice I could find!"
Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips?,"I've learned quite a bit both on the job and through my research, but I'm always anxious to learn more."
Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips?,"Anyway, I dabble in musical theatre in my spare time -- to the point where it's basically my avocation -- and often sing to the residents at the various care homes where I contract."
Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips?,"This always seems to receive a positive reaction from both residents and staff, so at one care home, I half-jokingly asked about being added to the home's entertainment roster."
Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips?,"The activities coordinator asked me to put together a short show with backing tracks, which would serve as a sort of audition, and said if the residents enjoy it I'll be welcomed aboard as a fully-paid entertainer at the home beginning next year (she books all of the year's entertainment in January), as well as receive a ringing endorsement if I'd like to do shows elsewhere in the meantime."
Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips?,"I've decided to call the show ""Special Requests"", and put together a setlist by asking residents with a greater degree of verbal capacity (as well as the family members of those with less) for songs which mean a lot to the residents and are likely to get them singing along."
Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips?,"While I wasn't able to garner a request from each resident -- and it would have been difficult to fit 33 songs into a 1-hour performance slot if I were -- I think the set has a good variety, and most folks in the home should find a lot to enjoy."
Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips?,"This is my setlist:  1) You Are My Sunshine 2) Moon River  3) Dancing Queen 4) What a Wonderful World 5) Tutti Frutti 6) Hey Jude 7) Hey Big Spender 8) Take Me Home, Country Roads 9) Danny Boy 10) Pretty Woman  11) Maria (Blondie) 12) My Way 13) Show Me the Way to Go Home 14) Bring Me Sunshine   This home, located in a former B&B on the coast of Morecambe Bay (Lancashire, UK), houses 33 residents, each with severe dementia and challenging behaviour."
Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips?,The residents range in age from 64-91.
Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips?,"Most are mobile to some degree, but about a third spend most of their time in wheelchairs."
Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips?,"In addition to encouraging everyone to sing along and/or dance, and adding in banter/jokes, I'm going to be passing out a variety of easy rhythm instruments -- tambourines, maracas, bells, triangles, etc."

Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips?,What do all of you think?

Holding vigil for my father,Holding vigil for my father Six months ago my father (age 76) was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's.
Holding vigil for my father,"The guy was a brilliant man with a Master's Degree in Biology, who spent a really successful career as a real estate agent for an oil company."
Holding vigil for my father,"He gifted me with a great head for math and a love of science -- some of my best memories of him were when he showed me Jupiter and Saturn through his back yard telescope.That man literally gave me the universe, and he also gave me a sense of my own place in the working world."
Holding vigil for my father,"Important context, my biological parents divorced when I was two years old, and I was raised by my mother and stepfather."
Holding vigil for my father,"The most significant time I spent with my bio father was a summer that I worked as an intern at his company in another state, and that's when I kind of sensed that I had a future in the corporate world."
Holding vigil for my father,And it's worked out exactly that way.
Holding vigil for my father,"He worked 35 years in his company, surviving a spinoff and a buyout that had him moving states more than once, but by the end of his career he was literally the only person left from his original department from 35 years before."
Holding vigil for my father,"I've always felt that was something to aspire to, and as of this writing I've made it through 17 years, 4 promotions, a merger and a reorganization at my own company, where I recently survived a layoff."
Holding vigil for my father,I credit my father for showing what that kind of work ethic looks like in the corporate world.So I knew something was off over the holidays last year when he started inventing memories that I knew never existed.
Holding vigil for my father,"Like for example, I mentioned that I'd been called for jury duty, and he started talking about his own jury duty experiences, in places I know he's never lived."
Holding vigil for my father,"He's brought up celebrities from the 60s and 70s who he shared a beer with -- people like Elvis, and the Bee Gees, and Willie Nelson -- all those stories are false but they are based on a true story he told me years ago, when he really did share a beer with Harry Belafonte."
Holding vigil for my father,So that was the beginning when I knew things were wrong.He got diagnosed and the whole family is adjusting to the new reality.
Holding vigil for my father,"But this weekend there was an escalation.For the last three years, he and my stepmother have been the owners of a Jack Russell Terrier."
Holding vigil for my father,One of the ways we've been trying to support him during the development of his condition is that we've allowed him to take the dog on walks.
Holding vigil for my father,"Most of the time he's ""present"" enough to stay within his neighborhood, but twice now he's gotten lost and wandered several miles away from home before being found and brought back.We've made arrangements to keep him tracked through geofencing on his phone, and for the most part that's worked.Until Saturday when he forgot to take his phone with him."
Holding vigil for my father,"He ended up about 4 miles away from home, lost and confused, at which point the dog keeled over from heatstroke.The police found him, looking confused, not really sure where he was and not knowing how to deal with the situation."
Holding vigil for my father,"He didn't have his ID on him and he didn't remember his address, but he was present enough to direct the police back to his house."
Holding vigil for my father,"They also took the dog in to the local humane society, but it wasn't enough."
Holding vigil for my father,The dog died.The dog's death is everybody's wake-up call.
Holding vigil for my father,"He now needs more help than we can give him where he's at now.I don't know why I'm writing this, necessarily, except just looking for a support system of random reddit strangers."
Holding vigil for my father,"I'm heartbroken at what the world is losing in this process, and I hope I can find a way to help make his transition better.I am sorry to hear this."
Holding vigil for my father,"You think you're doing okay, and the disease ratchets itself up a notch."
Holding vigil for my father,I’m sorry about your father.
Holding vigil for my father,This disease is awful!
Holding vigil for my father,"I recommend the book:  The 36-Hour DayA Family Guide to Caring for People Who Have Alzheimer Disease, Other Dementias and Memory."
Holding vigil for my father,I’ve used it as a reference as needed.
Holding vigil for my father,I have two years of experience with this blasted disease.
Holding vigil for my father,Will look it up in Amazon I’m so sorry.
Holding vigil for my father,This disease breaks your heart in new ways constantly.
Holding vigil for my father,"And it’s good to get it off your chest, so share away."
Holding vigil for my father,My dad also has Alzheimer’s and he’s at the point where he can’t be left alone.
Holding vigil for my father,"And not too long ago, he’d also go on walks and get lost."
Holding vigil for my father,It is awful.
Holding vigil for my father,Feel free to dm me if you ever need to get anything off your chest.
Holding vigil for my father,I wish you all the best.
Holding vigil for my father,Watching a parent slipping into the clutches of Alzheimer's is one of the hardest things you'll ever go through.
Holding vigil for my father,My mother lost her battle with the disease back in 2010.
Holding vigil for my father,Every new phase your father enters turns into your own personal hell.We're here for support if you want to vent.
Holding vigil for my father,Also seek out support in the real world.
Holding vigil for my father,"Talk to clergy, see if you can locate a local support group, consider joining a charity to raise funds/awareness of the disease."
Holding vigil for my father,Talk to your SO and family.
Holding vigil for my father,"Sorry to hear that, same boat here, just my mother in law."
Holding vigil for my father,"I fooled myself to think we had things running smoothly... until this morning.Not sure where will be in 6 months, but I'm sure I need to find a way to release the stress now."
Holding vigil for my father,"One day, one hour at a time."
Holding vigil for my father,(((Hugs)))

How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,My grandfather is 87 and has been having some trouble around the house lately.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,I recently found out that he was laying down a blanket for the dog and fell.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,He stayed on the ground for a few hours then was finally able to crawl up onto the bed where he stayed until someone got home.&#x200B;I am wondering if there is something I can place around the house so he can call for help if he needs it.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,I thought maybe Google Home devices so he can call someone in the family or an Apple Watch with cellular so he can use Siri to call family or at least hold the emergency button on the side to call 911.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,"&#x200B;He has a medical alert system already but he either forgets to wear it or, in the case of the other night, already took it off for bed."
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,Does anyone have any good ideas to use these devices for help if he needs it?The only idea I have is to make sure he is wearing the medic alert at all times.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,"My mother has Life Alert, which I believe is the company name, and she has a central unit in her living room, which is a big box with a very big red button she can hit for help."
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,"She also has a bracelette with a button, and a necklace."
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,"She doesn't use the necklace because just knocking it on stuff would call for help occasionally, but the bracelette doesn't seem as senistive and she wears it all times."
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,And it has served her well on at least two occasions.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,"You can talk to whatever company your grandfather uses, and maybe they can set up more of the stationary boxes, like one in every room."
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,But other than that I would suggest really trying to stress to him that whatever is wearable needs to be worn at all time.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,It seems to be what is working best for my mother.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,good luck:) I agree with the medic alert bracelet.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,You are suppose to wear it at all times.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,Some are even waterproof so you wear them in the bath.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,"My Papa even wears his if we go out of town, where it’s completely useless - but that’s better than not wearing it."
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,He likes it because it looks like a men’s watch.Did you know they have a version that detects a fall and alerts on its own?
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,It’s programmed off of the height of the user.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,"Pretty cool.The only problem I see with a device like Alexa, is the range."
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,Would he be in the right location for the device to hear him?
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,I’m wondering if an Apple Watch might be a better alternative to a Medic Alert bracelet.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,I know I can call people using mine (1st gen) and have it on speaker via the watch.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,They also have fall-detection in the Series 4.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,It would combine the medic alert bracelet and the Alexa you were thinking of.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,He could charge it only when he’s in bed.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,"Going off this, is there any way you can maybe tie something to your dog's collar?"
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,then he can call the dog over and not have to remember to wear something.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,The other idea is does he have any old school ritual like he always prays using a rosary or bible before bed or waking up?
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,Then you can make it a habit reminder for him to put on the watch/life alert before praying so he doesn't forget.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,Or maybe he drinks water every morning from the same mug tie it to that?
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,My mom fell a few years ago in her apartment and was able to yell to Siri on her Iphone to call 911 and paramedics came.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,She was across the room when she did it.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,She also has the Alexa Show device now that allows her to call and video call anyone with her voice.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,I can drop in on her anytime and see her room even if she doesn't answer it verbally.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,It has been incredibly helpful.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,One thing to think about is that  even with all these devices seniors often forget what to do when they fall or need help.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,My mom forgets sometimes the way to answer Alexa or even the fact that she can use her voice to get a call or help.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,That can be hard to help.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,The life alert and med alert pendants are great as others have mentioned especially when they react based on the fall motion so no action on the senior is needed to indicate they need help.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,So finding a way to make sure they have it on is key and can be tough if they don't want to wear it.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,I know they have ones work on the hip in addition to the typical pendant style.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,The other thing people do is have a big sign on the wall that says what to do if I fall that reminds them what their options are if they fall when they are alone.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,Hope you can find something that works for him:) Thanks for the advice.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,We ended up with an AppleWatch for him which he thinks is the coolest thing ever.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,We like it because it will also text us his location if an emergency is triggered as sometimes he goes on walks.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,I showed him some videos on the fall detection so he’ll know what to expect if he falls or accidentally triggers the alert.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,I also showed him the walkie-talkie feature so he can use that in pinch too.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,He already knows Siri from his phone so I made sure he got a lesson on how to activate that too.
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,"Lastly, I made sure he knew how to use emergency sos in case something happens and the fall detection doesn’t trigger."
How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather?,We covered pretty much every way to use the watch to call for help.

"Advice for early stages of dementia, wandering, etc.","But I'm guessing standard medication.What should be expected?What are your advice for dealing with situations like this and those that are similar?For wandering, what should be done?"
"Advice for early stages of dementia, wandering, etc.","I was thinking about a GPS tracker but the thing is that she won't want to wear it, and she is already wary of tracking and doesn't fully trust or believe that she needs it.For medication, I've heard it's only effective for 6-12 months but is there anything else that we should know?Any other advice or things we should know?Thank you all.For me, one thing I learned was just to go with whatever she believes."
"Advice for early stages of dementia, wandering, etc.","It can be hard when they're aggressive, or if they're still fairly aware of what's going on, but I try to just kinda agree with her, and offer some excuse as to why these things have happened."
"Advice for early stages of dementia, wandering, etc.","For example, if she says ""Why didn't you tell me about the holiday?"""
"Advice for early stages of dementia, wandering, etc.","Don't bother arguing about it, because you won't convince her, just say ""i forgot"" and let it go.Also, if it's any help, you may want to see if you can make friends with a neighbour or two."
"Advice for early stages of dementia, wandering, etc.",We had a neighbour on the corner of our street who was a stay at home mum.
"Advice for early stages of dementia, wandering, etc.","We friended her on Facebook, and any time my grandad walked past, she'd send me a message to let me know."

"Advice for early stages of dementia, wandering, etc.","I take it that he was away at the time?Basically somebody has to be there at all times, so he needs to schedule things so that somebody is there or, that she is in fact asleep.How I did it with my grandmother is after a big meal, she would sleep, and as soon as she did I’d leave immediately.Also, you can get cameras in the house that would alert you when something moves."
"Advice for early stages of dementia, wandering, etc.","This worked pretty well for me.Your papa could contact a family member to watch when he leaves for a while.He can deactivate it when he’s home and most camera systems have geo fencing connecting through an app on your phone, where it automatically deactivates once you get home anyways.I used the Arlo cameras."
"Advice for early stages of dementia, wandering, etc.","They’re wireless and about $300 for 2 of them and the base station, they come with batteries and last for 3-6 months if you only turn them on when your gone."
"Advice for early stages of dementia, wandering, etc.",He was sleeping I think.

Emergency Alerting System using Alexa,Emergency Alerting System using Alexa Requesting advice about technology that could be used as a reliable intercom system.
Emergency Alerting System using Alexa,We are looking for a way to ensure that we can communicate between rooms in case of an emergency with our grandfather who lives at home but recently needs to be watched full time because he is unable to swallow properly.
Emergency Alerting System using Alexa,"Our grandfather has recently been placed on 24 hour care because of asphyxiation risk, so he has an aide in his room all night to monitor him."
Emergency Alerting System using Alexa,"His wife is currently sleeping in the guest room downstairs but needs to be alerted at a moments notice without the press of a button if the aide needs assistance in the case of an emergency.They’ve tried baby monitors so the aide could yell for help in that scenario, but they are disruptive to his wife’s sleep because she can hear him coughing in it or the aide watching TV ect.Recently they’ve been trying an Amazon Echo system with one in grandfathers room and a dot in her bedroom, but sometimes when we try the drop in feature it does not work."
Emergency Alerting System using Alexa,"I would really appreciate any suggestions you have for a communication system because they are helping keep my grandfather safe and as comfortable in his home as possible.My mother has a Google home, not sure if the same program is availabl on Alexa, but on Google they have an app called ""Call my buddy."""
Emergency Alerting System using Alexa,"When my mom falls, she says ""Okay Google, call my buddy!"""
Emergency Alerting System using Alexa,it will then (after setting it up) send a text alert to my phone letting me know something is wrong.
Emergency Alerting System using Alexa,"It's the best solution I've found and it's free, or you can donate a small amount of money a month through PayPal for more texts."
Alexa,Alexa So my mom has Alzheimer's but it hasn't progressed to the point where she can't be alone for short periods.
Alexa,Unfortunately she had trouble with answering the phone.
Alexa,So of course when im at work and call to check on her and she doesn't answer I go into panic mode.
Alexa,So I bought an echo dot.
Alexa,Privacy and problems that have been reported aside I got it for one reason.
Alexa,Drop in.
Alexa,It's a life saver.
Alexa,I can call the dot basically and talk to her.
Alexa,She doesn't get frustrated with the phone.
Alexa,I can make sure she is doing ok.
Alexa,"Stress level dropped significantly.Ya, tech has helped me too.Wyze cams."
Alexa,"About $25 on Amazon, can monitor for motion or sound and send an alert to the phone."
Alexa,I'm worried whenever my father steps out of the house.
Alexa,He likes to go get the mail... several times a day.
Alexa,Stuck one on the front door and one watching outside.
Alexa,"When he goes out I can watch him, if he falls I have a few people I can call when I'm at work.Also, since they can't remember much, asking them why something happened in the house is useless."
Alexa,"""Which cat is puking?"""
Alexa,Wyze cam answered that question and others.
Alexa,Yes!
Alexa,My cameras should be here today.
Alexa,We have pt and ot coming in too when im at work.
Alexa,"Just added peace of mind 1)  The PTZ ones, I have two and rarely move them."
Alexa,Just buy the cheaper ones.2)  They seem to have really inconsistent audio.
Alexa,One close to the TV can barely tell it's on.
Alexa,One on the other end of the room hears it plain as day.3)  The audio OUT of them kind of sucks.
Alexa,It's either too quiet or blaringly loud and distorted.4)  They will actually live outside if you don't put them directly in the rain.Just some FYI for others that may happen to read this.
Alexa,Are the cams only motion activated?
Alexa,"No, you can do a lot with them actually.The cams will record 24x7 (a 32GB card will do 7-8 days on SD IIRC), on a schedule, on sound, on motion or you can do no recording and just use it as a live cam to log into whenever you feel like."
Alexa,You can turn on motion and send alerts to your phone.
Alexa,You'll get free 12 second cloud storage.
Alexa,"So the camera sees motion, you get an alert on your phone, hit the notification and the app starts up and plays a 12 second vid of the motion."
Alexa,If you put a 32GB micro SD card in (about $8) it will also record a 1 minute video on the card and you can connect from anywhere and watch that.
Alexa,Sometimes dad will pause at the door and the 12 seconds ends so I'll connect to the cam and watch the 1 minute or the live to see what's happening right at that moment.Also have the ability to set a detection box.
Alexa,So I can draw a box around the cat feeder and only motion in the box will trigger it.
Alexa,Used that yesterday to see if the auto feeders were working.There is a pretty good series of videos on youtube by the company themselves going over all the features.
Alexa,"There's quite a lot for what they are, I was surprised."
Alexa,"Things will even do time lapse video.There are a couple of different types of these things, like the Arlo or the Blink cams."
Alexa,They all have their little specialties.
Alexa,These were cheap and worked for me.
Alexa,"I never knew you could do drop in on a dot until someone in this sub recommended it, definite game changer."
Alexa,"Now, I’ll be looking into wyze cams I can understand how it seems a little.... invasive... but when you can't get a hold of someone with Alzheimer's,  it can create huge panic."
Alexa,I don't mind the FBI listening in as long as I can talk to mom when I have to be gone.
Alexa,I honestly don't get this.
Alexa,Could you explain how that's done?
Alexa,Download the amazon Alexa app on your phone.
Alexa,"Once you set it up to communicate, you’ll be able to drop in on your echo dot Wow."
Alexa,I never.... this just seems sooo 1984.
Alexa,"Ok, but it’s 2019."
Alexa,"Are you asking about how the app works, or are you getting worried about big brother?"
Alexa,"If you, or anyone near you has a smart phone, consider everything you say as being monitored, echo dot/amazon app or not."
Alexa,"The way I see it, if there is someone out there listening to anything I’ve got to say, they’re going to end up bored."
Alexa,"Neither, to answer your question."
Alexa,It just blows my mind that the technology exists to do that.
Alexa,"I have Google Home , does it do a drop in style service?"
Alexa,Thanks My dad also likes Alexa for listening to Pandora.
Alexa,"Most of the time he can remember how to tell her to turn on music (he can’t figure out the radio, etc.)."
Alexa,"And if he can’t figure it out, he can call me and I can switch stations or turn it on/off using the app."
Alexa,Oh wow.
Alexa,I set it to play music but I didn't know I could turn it on through the app.
Alexa,I just got it yesterday so I'm still learning too.
Alexa,Thanks for the information!
Alexa,Mom loves listening to music but after a bit it's too much stimulation
Dementia and alcohol,Dementia and alcohol I'm trying to get to grips with my mother's situation at the moment.
Dementia and alcohol,"She's 76 and seemed ok until a couple of years ago, slowing down with age but nothing majorly different."
Dementia and alcohol,"She's always enjoyed a drink, but it started becoming every day, a bottle of wine, or at least half a 70cl of spirits daily and her behaviour became much more erratic once she'd had a glass of booze.She's suffered a few falls due to this, 2 involved hospital, first a fall on stairs with head injury and more recently she broke her wrist but can't remember how.She was referred to a ""memory clinic"" by the NHS GP (we're in UK) who saw her a couple of times but have said they can't do anything because of the drinking, they'll see her again in 18 months if she refrains.She has avoided alcohol for the last couple of months but is noticeably deteriorating, eg, she's not eating during the day, has seeming forgotten how to use all household devices (kitchen stuff, TV, even the phone), and can't find her way away the town she's lived in for 50 years, even struggles with where the toilet and her bedroom are in the house she's lived in for a similar duration at times."
Dementia and alcohol,"I'd previously attributed some of these these things to her being drunk, but now they're happening when I'm sure she's sober.I'm living in the house with her now so I'm ensuring she has a dinner and keeping on top of cleaning and stuff, but I work during the day and I'll come home and find odd things like a tub of margarine upside down in the washing machine."
Dementia and alcohol,"I'm happy to look after her where I can but would like some help, I risked going away for  a week's holiday a while back and she was found by a neighbour screaming my name on the street, apparently convinced I was dead."
Dementia and alcohol,"Sorry for the essay, I guess it comes down to 2 questions:Am I kidding myself that as she spends more time not drinking she might improve?How can I get help?"
Dementia and alcohol,"GP has already referred her in the past but that option won't help for a while, are there other referral options?My father tried to cover his deterioration by drinking."
Dementia and alcohol,He would use it as an excuse.
Dementia and alcohol,"If she has symptoms when she's not drinking, she probably won't get better."
Dementia and alcohol,Make sure her doctor knows what's going on.
Dementia and alcohol,Has your mum got a definitive medial condition?
Dementia and alcohol,MRI done etc ?
Dementia and alcohol,What medication is she on?
Dementia and alcohol,"No, nothing diagnosed."
Dementia and alcohol,"I'm not sure what the process is, I think the GP refers to the memory clinic who then assess and decide how proceed, but they won't continue because of booze?"
Dementia and alcohol,"The was a scan which found evidence of a mini stroke, would that have been MRI?"
Dementia and alcohol,"I've only got the info my mum has told me about what tests have been done, so it's not fully reliable.... Would her GP provide details to me ?"
Dementia and alcohol,"I'm not in the UK, but Canada so I would imagine some things are similar."
Dementia and alcohol,"In order for the GP to tell you things your mum would have to have you come to the appointments with her/give consent, but your best bet is getting power of attorney for both finances and personal care."
Dementia and alcohol,That way you are in charge and they can tell you everything.
Dementia and alcohol,"I don't know why they would have said to abstain for 18 months, that seems excessive."
Dementia and alcohol,As far as I'm aware an alcoholic with liver disease is eligible for a transplant after 6 months sober for example.
Dementia and alcohol,"You really do need that diagnosis to proceed with certain things so I would contact the GP, express your concerns and see if they can expedite things."
Dementia and alcohol,"Even without the POA you can tell them things, they just can't reveal a patient's history."
Dementia and alcohol,I hope that is relevant.
Dementia and alcohol,"Yes yes,POA pronto while your mother can still give consent."
Dementia and alcohol,I would advise that you make an appointment with ur mum to visit her GP together and perhaps call the GP first yourself to discuss your concerns.
Dementia and alcohol,Discuss with the GP how you mum has been in the last 6-12 months.
Dementia and alcohol,"The GP should do some ' Mental status tests’  and evaluate your Mum (Mild Moderate Etc) and diagnose Alzheimer's, or due to her strokes Vascular dementia."
Dementia and alcohol,"This happened with our Mum, the GP advised that she stop driving, my mum started to get VERY anxious and did not want to me left alone and continued to be VERY forgetful."
Dementia and alcohol,She was a shadow of her former self very quickly.
Dementia and alcohol,"We went back to the GP again recently and said that we would like an official medical diagnoses,  Alzheimer’s has a wide spectrum."
Dementia and alcohol,So in order to medicate correctly we needed to know what she had exactly in order to do so.
Dementia and alcohol,"My mum was given Mirap (antidepressants) and it has completely changed how she was a few months ago, eating well again, much more confident and a lot less ‘confused’ she may even be allowed to drive again."
Dementia and alcohol,We have told her that they are her new ‘Sleeping’ tables and because of this she can not have anymore alcohol ever again (In fairness she did like to have a drink or 3) but she has stopped from this point on.
Dementia and alcohol,So GP referred for MRI and results came back with Vascular dementia (cant remember the exact name).
Dementia and alcohol,"After MRI we quickly met with a consultant Psychiatrist, who gave us more details and clearer view of outcomes etc.We know this is not a cure and never will be."
Dementia and alcohol,"We hope just to manage the next few years with her to be as best they can and well, hope for the best really."
Dementia and alcohol,"So in short, and on my limited knowledge, get a proper medical diagnoses and don't give up until you get it, then work with her GP for the best medication for her needs."
Dementia and alcohol,"Also, she must stop drinking Full Stop."
Dementia and alcohol,"Couldnt have put it better,my Dad had Vascular Dementia caused by a stroke Sounds like my dad - look into Wernicke’s Encephalopathy."
Dementia and alcohol,He got the diagnosis and is much safer and happier in assisted living for memory care.
Dementia and alcohol,"Go to the Docs,he will refer you to a Psychiatrist ,insist on an assessment,it may be because of her drinking they are refusingI am from the UK and how the system works is the Doc will refer her to a psychiatrist who will diagnose her,send her for scans to determine the type of Dementia and issue meds,if she is not drinking anymore that should not be a problemShe cannot drink while on medication"
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),Dealing with stubborn parent(s) My (44) dad (76) has been showing cognitive decline in the past several years.
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),The main symptom by far has been memory loss.
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"He is still pretty sharp about some topics, but I'll hear the same story and get asked the same questions again and again."
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"He doesn't seem to be showing other symptoms, such as getting lost, and his vocabulary is still pretty good."
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"He seems to be able to do his regular tasks, such as making coffee etc."
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),He thrives best when he can stick to a regular routine and be in familiar places.His memory loss symptoms are becoming quite noticeable and it has got me thinking about the future for the sake of my mom (76) who would be/is his primary caregiver.
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"This issue is that he is deep in denial, and I can tell he works hard to hide his issues/confusion (i.e."
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"he will change subjects, dominate the conversation, or go quiet etc."
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),in order to avoid showing his lack of memory about certain things).
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"Because of the responsibilities he holds (including overseeing their finances, and doing all the financial investing), I think that the next step is some sort of medical assessment."
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"They live part time in a small community, where the local clinic did do some sort of short cognitive test last year that apparently showed he was ""fine""."
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"However, my mom (who is dealing with her own issues around denial) did not get the results directly or follow up with that doctor."
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"We got the results through him, so I'm not sure how accurate what we heard is."
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"They share a family doctor in a larger nearby city where they live for the rest of the year, and he gets check ups with this doctor, but my mom has not yet taken to time to alert their doctor about this."
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"Obviously that previous test was not comprehensive enough, and I feel that the next step is a proper assessment so we have a better idea of what might be happening."
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"However, how do we convince him to get such testing?"
Dealing with stubborn parent(s),"And also convince my mom to take a more active role in tracking his health?Your Father is in the very early stages,it's vital you find a way to have him assessed,try explain to your mum the sooner he can be assessed the sooner any recommended treatment can start,catching it early is vitalI am not sure which country you reside in so it's difficult to give precise advice,I live in the UK and from what I read on here treatment and diagnosis are very different"

Need help with telephone solution,"Need help with telephone solution Hey everyone- So my mom has occasionally started forgetting to hang up the phone, which leaves us unable to contact her throughout the day."
Need help with telephone solution,"I've found a couple of products online that will automatically hang up after a certain time, but I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions or experience with anything like that-Or, as another thought, does anyone know of anything that would work almost like an intercom- a device/app where I could place a call and end up on speakerphone without the need for her to physically answer the call?"
Need help with telephone solution,"Any and all suggestions greatly appreciated!lol, man this is a throwback .... my mom did this a few times, heck I got a $125 bill for a long distance call from the Philippines, my brother and I blocked all international calls and she has to use a phone card."
Need help with telephone solution,"As for your mom, heck we actually got the Google home hub, I think you can get a free google phone number and she can only make local calls online."
Need help with telephone solution,"ALSO it's bigger than a phone and all she has to do is push the green button and it hangs up when the other user does, hope this helps Will definitely look into this."
Need help with telephone solution,"We already got her an Echo, and I know there’s a way to link phone service to it, but she forgets she has Alexa it's visual as well so it has a camera and it turns black when the caller hangs up, pretty handy Side question, is she hearing impaired?"
Need help with telephone solution,"If she is, she qualifies for a free CaptionCall phone through the Federal Gov't."
Need help with telephone solution,It does speaker as well as handset.
Need help with telephone solution,"If she can push a button to answer the phone, it avoids her having to pick up the handset."
Need help with telephone solution,"Not sure this is the optimal answer, just trying to be helpful."
Need help with telephone solution,"As they forget how to do things, the phone certainly becomes an issue."
Need help with telephone solution,"Not hearing impaired, but thanks for the info- I’ll look into that We just set up an Amazon Show on the same account as my sister."
Need help with telephone solution,"She can ""drop in"" whenever she likes and the camera is pointed towards the living room/kitchen area and she can also disconnect the ""call"" at her leisure."
Need help with telephone solution,"I printed out instructions in how to drop in on her kids if she wants, so we are testing out that feature now."
Need help with telephone solution,But my sister having the authority to drop in at max volume so she can summon our parents to the living room is the best option we have found so far.
Need help with telephone solution,"This sounds perfect, thanks!"
Need help with telephone solution,Looking into it now I have Amazon Echo Dots set up around the house and I can literally drop in whenever I feel like.
Need help with telephone solution,It creates an intercom system throughout the house to my phone.
Need help with telephone solution,No requiring that he answer.

A Phone for a Person with FTD,"A Phone for a Person with FTD Hello all,My sister was recently moved to a memory care unit and for years her primary means of communication with family & friends was with a Samsung smartphone."
A Phone for a Person with FTD,"One of her favorite things to do is call friends and family, but even with Samsung's ""easy mode"" feature (that gives a simplified UI), she has difficulty making and receiving calls."
A Phone for a Person with FTD,"And, to be honest, the phone app interface is not setup very well at all."
A Phone for a Person with FTD,"She gets stuck in ""recent calls"" section of the app and it's not intuitive to get out of it.A flip phone or something she has to dial isn't a good option because she is terrible with numbers, so she needs something where she can press one button with someone's name to make a call.So I'm looking at alternatives."
A Phone for a Person with FTD,The senior-focused phones/devices like the Jitterbug and Grandpad have mixed reviews when it comes to dementia patients.
A Phone for a Person with FTD,And there aren't a whole lot of other options out there that I can find.
A Phone for a Person with FTD,"I'd be interested in what has worked for others.Thanks!For the brief time between ""can't use cell anymore but can still make calls"" and ""can't make calls at all,"" my husband set up for my father-in-law a Google Voice number that rang an ""old-fashioned"" cordless phone, with speed dial programmed with the numbers he might need (mother-in-law, husband, me, maybe one friend?)."
A Phone for a Person with FTD,I don't know if this is a feasible setup not at home.
A Phone for a Person with FTD,"Thanks, I'll look into that."

Dementia and Technology,"Dementia and Technology Hi everyone,My mother-in-law is not diagnosed with dementia currently, but we believe she is in the early stages."
Dementia and Technology,"She won’t seek help to determine whether she has dementia, but that’s another story."
Dementia and Technology,I’ve done work in skilled nursing facilities and have hands on experience with certain aspects of dementia.
Dementia and Technology,"A lot of the behaviors my mother-in-law has are at least very similar to stage 4 of the 7 stages of dementia.Anyway, other than the standard, daily things that are problematic, we are also currently having A LOT of issues with my mother-in-law and technology."
Dementia and Technology,"She has always suffered from anxiety and depression, but lately, all she does is stay at home and move from her bed to the couch and back and spends hours upon hours staring at Facebook and texting and calling just about everyone in her phone."
Dementia and Technology,"She is on her iPhone non-stop, and her confusion is making her use of technology problematic.Her use of Facebook is both a privacy, financial, and safety concern (posting very specific personal information like everywhere she is or specific home addresses and details, and constantly getting hacked and at times even people targeting her for fraud financially), and somewhat damaging to social and professional relationships for herself and her family (she’s posted almost creepy details about friends and they no longer want to speak to her, and has liked pages for the places that family members work at and “accidentally” posts things to those pages...jeopardizing careers at times)."
Dementia and Technology,"We’ve also had issues with her confusing phone contact information, calling people she shouldn’t be calling, calling people 10 times in a row when they’re at work and can’t talk, calling at 3am repeatedly.When we try to calmly discuss any of this, she either shuts down entirely and forgets or screams at us, claims we’re trying to steal her phone, and then forgets."
Dementia and Technology,She then immediately goes right back to doing the same things.
Dementia and Technology,"I know all of this seems minor, but it’s becoming a large problem."
Dementia and Technology,I’m also quite certain that it will get worse as time goes on and she declines more.
Dementia and Technology,"Since previous generations with dementia didn’t always use technology to the extent that people do now, I’m having trouble finding resources on how to handle the current problems and how to handle things as she gets worse.Does anyone on here have a loved one with dementia who is it was an active user of technology, and how have you handled things when they could no longer manage certain or all aspects of technology as time went on?"
Dementia and Technology,(This is coming from someone who is usually a big proponent of assistive technology and its ability to help people.
Dementia and Technology,I’m out of my element here!
Dementia and Technology,)Thank you.I think monitoring what she is doing is best.
Dementia and Technology,As long as she doesn't know about it there is no harm.
Dementia and Technology,It's probably very important to her that she be given the illusion that she is using technology normally.
Dementia and Technology,"If she has dementia, she will likely not know the difference."
Dementia and Technology,"Now, if she becomes annoyed or enraged when she does discover the monitoring there is nothing you can do."
Dementia and Technology,You are protecting her and care about her and she your mother in law!
Dementia and Technology,"That said, I know absolutely nothing about this."
Dementia and Technology,I would consult a professional who aligns with your mother in laws ethical framework (were she in her correct state of mind of course).
Dementia and Technology,"I don't know, but I imagine there are many qualified professionals who could provide more help than this thread."
Dementia and Technology,You would of course have to be able to access them financially logistically etc.

Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,I just don't know how to handle or process any of this.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,Probably freaking out a bit too much.Thank you for reading this giant wall of anxiety.

Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"And big ups to reddit, what a great platform.It’s good that you’re helping, but don’t lose sight of the fact that keeping up the house and so on isn’t your responsibility, it’s theirs."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,Even now.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,Help them as sparingly as you can but don’t take it over.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,This could go on for many more years.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,You are definitely right about this.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"Luckily, she hasn't bought extra stuff since she quit driving."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,I threw away TONS of useless junk/trash/god-knows-why-it-was-their stuff.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"But part of it is a bit of my responsibility, should have been on top of this a while ago You have my sympathy - I have been going through similar things for the past 5 years or so."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,Fortunately my sister and I are tag teaming everything because it is a LOT of work.I have to say that it sounds like your moms showing signs of some type of cognitive decline or dementia.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,That she is worried is what you need to respect about her the most.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"Dementia is a brain disease that can affect spacial relations (driving and particularly parking), memory, and reasoning (buying extra stuff, no longer being able to organize, not having the attention span to go through the mail, etc).If your mom is amenable, make a list of things that concern her and accompany her to her primary care if she has one."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"If not, you can make a list of your own and email it to the doctor prior to her appointment."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,She will likely go through a short cognitive test and if needed will be referred to a neurologist for more in-depth testing.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"There are medications that can somewhat improve conditions and slow the decline and they work better in the earlier stages of dementia, different medications for different types of cognitive issues, so it's important to get a good diagnosis."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"Our personal experience is that it takes months to get on their schedule so start now.There are other possible causes of these symptoms too but only professionals could diagnose so please take her symptoms seriously, especially because any anxiety she has will only make them worse.If it is a dementia, most are very slow moving fortunately."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"It is a whole world that you have to learn about to navigate, and if so I would suggest seeing an Elder Law Attorney (certified) to help your parents plan ahead while your mom can participate."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"Planning for the end game is dreary, but you have to do it to protect your father if he outlives your mom, and provide the best possible care for your mom if the other way around."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"There are lots of options for getting care in the home, adult day cares, etc."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"so nursing homes are only at the very end if at all, and you want to make sure they have a cash flow for care without spending everything, especially if Medicaid is involved.And ""The Car Keys"" - the bain of all children taking care of older parents!"
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,There is no good time and no good way to take them away.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,It's a final admission of no longer being independent and it's so hard.I would focus on getting her a good diagnosis first and other things will fall into place.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"And please, remember to practice self care."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,Helping your older parents can and has given many caregivers health problems of their own.

Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,The cab companies in this town charge 2 or 3 times as much.

Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"If she can get comfortable with it now, then she won't feel as helpless when the time comes for her keys to be put aside."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"You need to take care of yourself, too."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,2x per day is a lot for you to be at their house.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"If you can get it down to once per day, then they can call you in the morning so that you can help them in the afternoon, or they can call you in the afternoon so you know exactly what they need help with the next morning - you'd still be checking on them 2x per day, but not in person."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"Then, you might be able to work on their house during your daily visits."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"One massive push for organization is intimidating and massive - so instead, look at one corner of one room."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"Decide what needs to happen, talk to them about it in your daily phone call so it isn't a big surprise or upheaval."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"It's a small thing, it's manageable."

Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"You'll need to get it directly from the Dr. You might not be able to make it to the appointments, but you can get on the forms to get the information for yourself."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"Give her a GPS necklace, maybe one of the ones that has the button she can use to call for help - directed to your phone."

Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,Do they have a neighbor that you can trust to check on them if you're unable to make it over to their house?
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"Next door or down the street?Do they have a neighbor with a kid who could be paid to come over and do simple chores - like helping move small furniture out of the house, or mowing the lawn, or changing a lightbulb, or even driving somewhere?"

Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,I could probably get some anti-anxiety meds for the heart palpitations I swear start up any time I think about it.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"I’m not the OP but you gave some great advice.I never knew there was a GPS necklace, I’m going to look into it for my mom."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"Right now all I can do is track her iPhone which she often forgets to take with her, the necklace sounds like a great idea."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,Getting her to wear it will be a different matter but I’m glad to know it exists!
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,I never realized that I can't be the only person who has a parent that frequently loses her phone.

Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"Mom has never had much of a routine after retirement, despite our trying to fix this."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"I know that diet and a sedentary lifestyle has not helped, on top of her having surgery and chemo a couple years ago.The 2x day split with calls is a great idea, will definitely incorporate that!I have some close friends that live around the area and will come check, and help if they have the time."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,You're really on point about getting someone who is more available.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,"Luckily the live in a college neighborhood and maybe I can find some young, well-minded college student to help them out.Good god, I can't imagine taking on the task you have at hand."
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,Good luck and you'd be surprised who may be willing to help for a good price.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,When my grandpa was in a similar situation we hired local high school kids/farm hands to help.
Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant,Cleared out a bunch of old tractors and other industrial-level machines.

Patient - a man trapped in his own mind,"Out film is about dementia, hence the tag line of this post, something myself and several of our crew care deeply about, and we really want to help with awareness of this cruel illness."
Patient - a man trapped in his own mind,"Our film summed up is about an old man who views himself as his younger self, and because of this he’s confused as to why he is in a care home - struggling with care workers that aren’t looking after him in the best way possible."
Patient - a man trapped in his own mind,Our film is inspired by a real life case of neglect in a British care home.
Patient - a man trapped in his own mind,"I don’t wish to be insensitive, or to communicate crassly about a really important issue but we’re currently raising funds so we’re able to create our set and pay our lead actor so that we can do this issue justice, the crew have all donated money to our kitty but any help would be appreciated."

Patient - a man trapped in his own mind,david2.neale@live.uwe.ac.uk :) patient - gofundmeI'm really torn about this post.
Patient - a man trapped in his own mind,On the one hand anything that brings awareness to this illness in a professional way is welcome and needed.
Patient - a man trapped in his own mind,On the other you are asking people dealing with it firsthand to help fund your graduate studies.
Patient - a man trapped in his own mind,"A graduate school film, no matter how well done, is unlikely to actually help advance research so in my mind it would not a donation to the cause, but mostly to you."
Patient - a man trapped in his own mind,I can think of better places to actually donate that can directly help and if you read most of the posts here the illness places financial stress on a lot of families.
Patient - a man trapped in his own mind,"I don't get the impression you have dealt with the disease in your family from the post, though maybe you didn't mention it.&#x200B;I am not trying to dissuade anyone if they feel like giving, just wanted to put my thoughts out there.&#x200B;EDIT: I saw this is your first post as well so you obviously are not familiar with how this works."

Patient - a man trapped in his own mind,"I completely understand where you’re coming from, I’m aware of how sensitive a post like this is and the implications of it- I’m working as the producer of this project but this is an issue close to the heart of our team and my director (who initially pitched this project), my grandmother suffered with brain tumour associated dementia so I understand.I was trying to be sensitive towards this subject and I apologise completely for any upset caused, it’s difficult to find the appropriate forum/tone for this."
Patient - a man trapped in his own mind,"If you have any other thoughts about this I certainly welcome hearing them and I’m open to any conversations, I appreciate your thoughts  Reddit is a very diverse place and there would be appropriate forums/subs such as /r/gofundme for example, there are likely many more - you just need to search for them."

(also mind you I was doing this for about 3 years total and check this out.. 8 hours a day almost everyday for 3 years and in total she gave me in grand total close to $100)."

A bit a of story with my mom who suffered last year with dementia.,")I visit my mom every few days, mind you the reason is, its the same each time ""I tell her hi mom, I give her a kiss and right away she tells me these people are keeping her hostage and I must take her home, I inform her as much as I want to I can;t you are sick ""she would go into a range and cuss and insult me and physically try to hurt me"" (hence which is why I told my family they need to be there for her when she is in the hospital)&#x200B;She comes home about a week and a half later, her decline really starts here."

A bit a of story with my mom who suffered last year with dementia.,she is there with of course UTI and a few other things and 5 days later they send her right back home.&#x200B;I am pissed as hell because I see my mom is not eatting still and she does not look any better at all (I know because I went to the hospital the day before they sent her home) well I open the door and they bring my mom home.
A bit a of story with my mom who suffered last year with dementia.,she is in her bed they leave and I  try to get her to drink ensure.

I am just so exhausted,I am just so exhausted I've been my mother's only caregiver for a very long time.
I am just so exhausted,She has so many health problems and can't be left alone as she falls very easily.
I am just so exhausted,My brothers are no help and the only break I get is when she is at dialysis a few times a week.
I am just so exhausted,"But then I have to use that time to run errands.She has been on oxygen for the past year and has progressed to were her oxygen drops into the 60s when her canula isn't on, and she keeps taking it off in her sleep."
I am just so exhausted,I tried everything I could think of to keep it on and finally broke down and bought a video baby monitor.
I am just so exhausted,"But I'm still having to wake up at least hourly to check it, to make sure her oxygen is still on."
I am just so exhausted,"And then I have a hard time falling back to sleep because my mind keeps going, ""What if she just now took it off?"
I am just so exhausted,"She'd be without her oxygen until the next time the alarm goes off."""
I am just so exhausted,"It keeps replaying over and over in my mind that it will be my fault if she dies, because I didn't check the video at the right time."
I am just so exhausted,I can barely sleep at night and my mom gets up early.
I am just so exhausted,"I can't nap during the day, because she doesn't want to wake me up and ends up falling trying to get to the bathroom by herself.I have been begging her health care provider for months and months, for a pulse ox with an alarm."
I am just so exhausted,"At first they kept telling me there was no such thing, then after doing my own research and finding one, they are dragging their feet on whether or not they are going to approve paying for it.Her worker, home health nurses and everyone else that comes in, are making me feel like I'm doing a bad job taking care of my mom, because she's missed an appointment here and there that was first thing in the morning and there are dishes in the sink and the laundry is piling up."
I am just so exhausted,"I've lost track of how many times my brother has said, ""how is the place this messy when you are here all day""I am just so tired and frustrated and feel alone in this."
I am just so exhausted,"Like no one, especially my brothers, understand how hard this is."
I am just so exhausted,"If you can't find a way to sleep, get some rest and get some time to yourself, you'll fall apart and won't be able to take care of your mom anyway."
I am just so exhausted,"The next time your brother makes a comment like that, say, ""Hey, I'm glad you feel that way because I need to be gone for 3 days and you will have to take care of her."""
I am just so exhausted,"If nothing else, make one of your brothers come over for a few hours a week so you can go decompress at a movie or something, even if you have to fib to them about why you're gone."
I am just so exhausted,"For things like the pulse-ox alarm, try requesting medical equipment or supplies through one of the home health aides or workers."
I am just so exhausted,"As much as I hate to say it, sometimes those companies are more 'financially motivated' to help you."
I am just so exhausted,You might also broach the topic of a 'sitter' through either the home health nurse or directly through your mom's insurance (if she has it).
I am just so exhausted,Is assisted living an option either of you could or would consider?
I am just so exhausted,Talking to a therapist might help - some will do Skype sessions now.
I am just so exhausted,You need to know it will not be your fault if your mom dies.
I am just so exhausted,"She clearly has multiple, serious health issues and no matter what you do, she will die at some point."
I am just so exhausted,Does she have a medical POA and/or a DNR?
I am just so exhausted,Do you know what her wishes are?
I am just so exhausted,Is she happy?
I am just so exhausted,"You being there for her and caring for her is a wonderful blessing, but please give some thought to your own sanity or health."
I am just so exhausted,"Sorry if this is rambling or comes across as harsh in any way, that is not my intent."
I am just so exhausted,"I'm not always great at communication and, like a lot of caregivers, I tend to have a 'solver' mentality."
I am just so exhausted,Give yourself a break - you are doing the best you can and sometimes you will have to settle for 'good enough' regardless of what others might think.Wishing you some downtime and a good night's sleep.
I am just so exhausted,Assisted living is an absolute last resort.
I am just so exhausted,"She's been in one, it wasn't a pleasant experience and she's terrified to go back."
I am just so exhausted,"She's fine at home, where she's happy, and I am able to take care of her just fine, it's just the whole not being able to sleep thing that's become a problem.I've been so sleep deprived for so long, that I didn't even realize how bad it had gotten, until she was in the hospital for several days, and I was able to get several nights of truly restful sleep."
I am just so exhausted,It's just seems so much harder now.
I am just so exhausted,I'm sorry assisted living was a bad experience.
I am just so exhausted,"I admit we, as a society, have a loooong way to go in improving the quality of care facilities."
I am just so exhausted,"With dialysis and such a low room-air (unassisted) oxygen level, I, like some of the others here, am surprised hospice hasn't been mentioned yet."
I am just so exhausted,"I can say that the amount of care and the quality of care definitely improve at that level, although in at least one situation I had to fire a hospice company and hire another - the difference between them being like night and day."
I am just so exhausted,But her removing the oxygen cannula at night - is it discomfort?
I am just so exhausted,Or dementia?
I am just so exhausted,Or are you not sure?
I am just so exhausted,"There are pads that can go over the ears to make the tubing more comfortable there, I think usually supplied by the oxygen supplier?"
I am just so exhausted,There is a way (can probably be found online) of draping the tubing in the back instead of the front.
I am just so exhausted,I've read that wrapping soft medical tape around the tubing on the face can help.
I am just so exhausted,"For any dryness (which is always a big gripe), you can use KY (or any water based lubricant) in the nose and beeswax on the lips."
I am just so exhausted,"A lot of people suggest putting mittens on the person's hands, even taping them at the wrists."
I am just so exhausted,"I've seen this work but, in my case, with a family member who had dementia, it just drove her crazy and made things worse."
I am just so exhausted,"We finally just  decided if she removed the oxygen and something.....happened as a result, it was meant to be that way."
I am just so exhausted,"That sounds callous, but it was in fact a very emotional, heart-rending decision."
I am just so exhausted,"To be honest, I'm amazed that someone with oxygen in the 60s, even when sleeping and on room air (ie, unassisted) is not in the hospital."
I am just so exhausted,"I pray you find a way to get some good sleep, as it is vitally important to your well-being while living in such a stressful situation."
I am just so exhausted,And I hope your doctors and nurses and everyone else stop being obstacles and start being helpers.
I am just so exhausted,"I'm so sorry you're going through this, and that you have no family support."
I am just so exhausted,"I'm taking care of my parents with my sister and I know how exhausting physically, mentally, and emotionally it can be."
I am just so exhausted,Anyone who hasn't been through this really doesn't understand.
I am just so exhausted,We finally switched from home health care to hospice for my father who has Parkinson's with Lewy Body Dementia.
I am just so exhausted,We now receive so much more assistance.
I am just so exhausted,"Besides the aide and nurse that come we also have a social worker, chaplain, volunteer to stay with him occasionally and we have up to 5 days per month that he can go to a nursing home to give us a break."
I am just so exhausted,I have also notice a huge difference in the attitude of the hospice workers compared to our previous home health care workers.
I am just so exhausted,"Hospice is SO much more kind, caring and compassionate!"
I am just so exhausted,"With all that being said, we are still looking to hire extra help for evening for bedtime."
I am just so exhausted,If you've not looked into palliative care that may be something to investigate?I truly hope things get better.
I am just so exhausted,Don't worry about the little things.
I am just so exhausted,Dishes and laundry can wait.
I am just so exhausted,"If you have some time, take a nap and get some rest."
I am just so exhausted,That's more important!
I am just so exhausted,God bless you.
I am just so exhausted,This sure isn't easy!
I am just so exhausted,Is it not time for hospice yet?
I am just so exhausted,It kinda sounds like it is.
I am just so exhausted,Has the topic of quitting dialysis ever arisen?
I am just so exhausted,Drop your mom off at your brother's house saying you will be on a week's vacation.
I am just so exhausted,Leave detailed instructions.
I am just so exhausted,"How do you survive?You say nothing about a source of income, then at the end mention ""her worker, home health nurses and everyone else that comes in""."
I am just so exhausted,"I feel for you, I really do."
I am just so exhausted,It sounds to me like you are not making appropriate use of the help being offered.
I am just so exhausted,"These are the people that can give you the best advice, as they are aware of the situation.Please take care of yourself."
I am just so exhausted,"If your mother didn't want you to live, you wouldn't be here."
I am just so exhausted,I'm making the best use of the available help that I can.
I am just so exhausted,"The state home health regulation format or whatever its called that they use to determine how many hours a day they will pay a caregiver, is only 3 hours a day."
I am just so exhausted,"Which is what their magic calculations determined she needed for ""active care""."
I am just so exhausted,"My mom requires 24/7 supervision and 3 hours is not enough time, nor enough for me to work outside the home."
I am just so exhausted,"So I am the paid caregiver, between what I'm paid and my moms retirement, we manage."
I am just so exhausted,Which is neither here nor there.
I am just so exhausted,"I thought this was a place to share and talk with other caregivers who would understand how hard this is... not have yet another person tell me I should be getting help from the agencies, which have thus far, proven to be decidedly unhelpful."
I am just so exhausted,"I have been run ragged and in circles, I have gone back and forth between my mom's primary doctor and the pulmonologist to the social workers and medical supply/ insurance company."
I am just so exhausted,Gotten the prescriptions and every other red taped hoop they wanted me to jump through and still those people have dragged their feet about getting the pulse ox with an alarm so I can get some rest.
I am just so exhausted,All well saying they can't approve more hours so I can get another caregiver coming in here.
I am just so exhausted,"By worker, I meant her Long Term Care worker and LTC nurse."
I am just so exhausted,She also has physical and speech therapist that come into the home as well.
I am just so exhausted,"I was not trying to be critical, and I'm sorry that you seem to have taken it that way."
I am just so exhausted,You didn't give many details and I was trying to find support that you may have missed.
I am just so exhausted,I have been in a similar situation and always found the outside agencies to be very helpful and supportive.Good luck.
I am just so exhausted,"Sorry, Rereading what you wrote, after being able to sleep in a bit this morning and having had coffee, I realize I did take it the wrong way."
I am just so exhausted,Thanks for trying to be helpful.
I am just so exhausted,:) A lot has been said already.
I am just so exhausted,Just want to add that you may want to consider finding a geriatric care manager.
I am just so exhausted,These are like privately paid social workers.
I am just so exhausted,"For what it's worth,  they'll dig up all the info you need to find to get the help you need for your mom."
I am just so exhausted,"There are a lot of resources, some free."
I am just so exhausted,Those hospital/LTC give you the minimal.
I am just so exhausted,A paid GCM will come up with a lot more.
Caring for a caregiver,Caring for a caregiver Hey everyone.
Caring for a caregiver,Hoping that someone in here has some advice that I can pass along.
Caring for a caregiver,At worst case it will hopefully feel good to vent.
Caring for a caregiver,Throwaway account just in case.
Caring for a caregiver,"Think it's going to be long, so strap in.&#x200B;Years ago my SIL developed an illness that caused seizures and swelling in her spinal cord that put her in a wheel chair."
Caring for a caregiver,She has no use of her legs and limited use of her hands and arms.
Caring for a caregiver,She went through some therapy and was eventually able to move out on her own.
Caring for a caregiver,She moved out of state and was involved with some great organizations that allowed her to work in an area she enjoyed and paid her enough to be able to continue to live on her own.
Caring for a caregiver,"&#x200B;I don't know the whole story, but early last year her condition started to change/worsen."
Caring for a caregiver,By mid summer she was in icu because she was having trouble breathing.
Caring for a caregiver,"Many options were put on the table, including physical therapy, certain medication rounds, and a few others I don't know about."
Caring for a caregiver,It was said from the start that the breathing mask was a temporary solution because it can cause skin to break down around the mask area.
Caring for a caregiver,So the options presented were to work toward getting off the breathing mask.
Caring for a caregiver,"After being presented with all of these options and then looking to good old google, SIL told the doctors that she wanted a trach put in instead of the other options."
Caring for a caregiver,My inlaws strongly advised against the trach but ultimately SIL went that route.
Caring for a caregiver,&#x200B;I get that SIL is an adult and because her mental capacity has not been effected she's of sound mind to make her own medical decisions.
Caring for a caregiver,Here's where the problems start.
Caring for a caregiver,Because she has been classified as disabled she is still on my inlaws insurance.
Caring for a caregiver,My inlaws have very good insurance thankfully that has covered most of the expenses that have been incurred in this whole ordeal.
Caring for a caregiver,"After deciding that she wanted the trach, SIL also informed my inlaws that because she will need full time care after the trach, she's moving back home."
Caring for a caregiver,"&#x200B;My inlaws are very well off, to the point they live a comfortable life and don't have to worry about every penny they spend."
Caring for a caregiver,But by no means are they wealthy.
Caring for a caregiver,"Because my SIL has decided to move home, they have incurred huge financial costs related to moving her in."
Caring for a caregiver,The first thing they had to do was have the main floor bathroom in their home completely renovated to accommodate her large wheel chair.
Caring for a caregiver,Total cost of this was around $30k to do everything needed done to make it work.
Caring for a caregiver,"Then they had to pay to have an industrial lift put in the garage that was able to handle the weight of her wheel chair, as well as have a platform put in for her to be able to get into the house."
Caring for a caregiver,Now they are talking about the need to get a wheel chair accessible car because she is constantly going back and forth to dr appointments.
Caring for a caregiver,"Even after insurance helps, they are looking at another $50k out of pocket."
Caring for a caregiver,All in all they are going to spending around $100k out of pocket just to be able to move her in.
Caring for a caregiver,&#x200B;Then as things progress we learn more.
Caring for a caregiver,We knew sister required 24/7 care and monitoring.
Caring for a caregiver,Very good insurance that my inlaws have cover something like 100 hours per week of care.
Caring for a caregiver,"Which means that since SIL decided she was moving home, not only have the inlaws had a huge financial burden to move her in, they are now her full time care giver at least 8 hours per day, every day of the week."
Caring for a caregiver,Even longer stretches on the weekend while they are home.
Caring for a caregiver,They even had a no show from a night nurse so my FIL had to take the 10pm-5am shift and then go into work.
Caring for a caregiver,This means that once they get out of work they come home to work.
Caring for a caregiver,"They have no down time, no off time, no time to relax."
Caring for a caregiver,"They can't leave the house together at the same time, even to go out to dinner together.&#x200B;Now my inlaws have been empty nesters for about 3 years, and have really taken advantage of it."
Caring for a caregiver,"They have enjoyed going on dates, cruising around different areas in their car, and were able to get back into their favorite hobby of travelling in their newly purchased RV."
Caring for a caregiver,All of that is gone.
Caring for a caregiver,"Because this situation is still unfolding, I don't think it has fully sunk in yet, but I'm incredibly angry for them."
Caring for a caregiver,A decision that they had no control over has cost them money and their freedom.
Caring for a caregiver,My MIL had their annual vacation trips planned for the next 3 years and was excitedly planning for those.
Caring for a caregiver,She can't go on those any more.
Caring for a caregiver,They had talked about taking all the grandkids to Disney next summer.
Caring for a caregiver,That's out the window.
Caring for a caregiver,"And the worst part of it, both my MIL and FIL have been counting down the days to their retirement as they both work incredibly stressful jobs."
Caring for a caregiver,"Before this whole thing with SIL happened, my FIL was talking about fast tracking retirement to this year."
Caring for a caregiver,My MIL had a calendar with every marked with a countdown to when she could retire next year.
Caring for a caregiver,And now both of them have said they will not be able to retire any time soon because of the financial burden of SIL moving home and needing to keep the higher more expensive insurance to care for SIL.&#x200B;Bottom line of everything is that my wife and I can already see that having SIL home is going to kill my inlaws.
Caring for a caregiver,There are already medical issues that have been watched that are getting worse through this whole situation.
Caring for a caregiver,"&#x200B;If you're still with me, you're a trooper and I appreciate it."
Caring for a caregiver,What I don't know is what happens to people that don't have parents that have enough money to pay to accommodate them at home.
Caring for a caregiver,"I get that my father in law is trying to take care of his kid as best as he can, but I feel like there have to be other options out there."
Caring for a caregiver,"Some kind of care facilities or homes that would be great for SIL, and allow my inlaws to feel that they are giving her proper care without having to destroy their lives in the process."
Caring for a caregiver,"&#x200B;I know it's a sensitive topic and one they may not be open to at first, but I would love to be able to give them some kind of options."
Caring for a caregiver,"We care for them, they are great people, and have earned the right to enjoy their success, and it's being ripped away from them and they haven't been able to prepare other options."
Caring for a caregiver,What can they do?
Caring for a caregiver,What is out there for them to be able to help?
Caring for a caregiver,Any ideas or services you might know of would be greatly  appreciated.
Caring for a caregiver,&#x200B;Thank you!
Caring for a caregiver,Your SIL has no income and should qualify for supports that will modify her living space and the primary vehicle used for her transport.
Caring for a caregiver,Or a transport service could be used.
Caring for a caregiver,Make sure that she has applied for all assistance she qualifies for and take advantage of all of it.
Caring for a caregiver,"For example, if she gets SSI, she may qualify for food stamps.As for the rest?"
Caring for a caregiver,There are not a lot of solutions.
Caring for a caregiver,I'm so sorry.
Caring for a caregiver,Thanks for the info.
Caring for a caregiver,"I know they have looked into some things, but she seems to be in a weird limbo where there aren't government programs available to her."
Caring for a caregiver,Because She was diagnosed after a certain age (can't remember what it is atm) she doesn't qualify for SSI and because she doesn't have 10 years in the workforce she doesn't qualify for disability assistance.
Caring for a caregiver,I'm sure there are other things out there but I am just starting trying to figure out where to look.
Caring for a caregiver,Thanks again!
Caring for a caregiver,I don't think your information about SSI is correct.
Caring for a caregiver,"Please check it again, there are no age restrictions for diagnosis that I am aware of."
Caring for a caregiver,"It's worth taking the time to explore, because so many services are tied to having it."
Caring for a caregiver,It may not have been SSI.
Caring for a caregiver,There was some assistance program that I thought was that but must have been something else that she didn't qualify for.
Caring for a caregiver,I'll dig into some SSI info.
Caring for a caregiver,Thanks!
Caring for a caregiver,Best place to get info is directly from Social Security.
Caring for a caregiver,try making an appointment!
Caring for a caregiver,What your in-laws need are resources.
Caring for a caregiver,"It appears to me that they are in the mentality of ""we can afford this, we dont need outside assistance"" but the question becomes for how long."
Caring for a caregiver,"They're already feeling the financial burden of living with a disability, and I commend them for the steps they have taken to ensure their daughter can live as well as she can given her circumstances."
Caring for a caregiver,"Outside help is required to ease their burden, and throwing money at the issue is just going to make things more difficult down the line."
Caring for a caregiver,"I'd like to offer to look up some resources in their area, a zip code should be enough for me to work with."
Caring for a caregiver,"You can reply with it, or PM me and I'll find what I can with the info you've provided.One bit of info I would give is always look for resources and assistance for anything regarding care."
Caring for a caregiver,"Don't just take the insurance recommendation, do some legwork of your own, and see if their suggestions are whats best for your situation.What I would be looking for:Paratransit."
Caring for a caregiver,"- if they live in a metropolitan area, odds are there is a disability program in their public transportation system."
Caring for a caregiver,"Paratransit operations that I know of have door-to-door service, wheelchair accessible vehicles among other things."
Caring for a caregiver,Insurance.
Caring for a caregiver,"Its great that your in-laws have good insurance, but is it possible for her to get her own?"
Caring for a caregiver,"Your state's health options may be able to help out, and may come with a social/case worker  that can assist in other ways."
Caring for a caregiver,Multiple insurance policies can work together- you dont have to have only one.assisted living there are organizations out there that may be able to help her get into a more assisted living community.
Caring for a caregiver,She could have her independence but the assistance she needs when she needs it.Theres a lot of research to do!
Caring for a caregiver,I hope your in-laws are willing to let others help them.
Caring for a caregiver,It may save their financial future.
Caring for a caregiver,All good suggestions.
Caring for a caregiver,Everyone in the family needs to be proactive in looking into options.
Caring for a caregiver,Asking for advice in online forums like this is a great way to find ideas you might not think of on your own.
Caring for a caregiver,"That said, you may find you in-laws and/or you SIL unwilling to consider other options."
Caring for a caregiver,"Your in-laws DID agree to let her move back in, and paid for all the alterations to their home."
Caring for a caregiver,Your SIL obviously decided that was where she wanted to be.
Caring for a caregiver,So you might meet some resistance.
Caring for a caregiver,But knowing options available to her is a great idea.
Caring for a caregiver,"I have seen parents lose all their retirement savings and even go bankrupt trying to support their adult children, so I hope this doesn't happen to them."
Caring for a caregiver,I wish all of you - the whole family - all the best.
Caring for a caregiver,"Wow, that was quite the ride."
Caring for a caregiver,"I wish I had something constructive to tell you, it's a terrible situation for your in-laws."
Caring for a caregiver,"I don't see how your SIL will ever move out, or what options are available to her now."
Caring for a caregiver,"Your inlaws will care for her until they can't, then what?"
Caring for a caregiver,You might want to start checking for alternative care for the SIL sooner than later.
Caring for a caregiver,The best thing you can do to help is give your in-laws some time if possible.
Caring for a caregiver,"Other than that, feel free to rant anytime, we're here to listen."
Caring for a caregiver,Appreciate it!
Caring for a caregiver,Yes; what a ride.
Caring for a caregiver,"It sounds like you have a close-knit, loving support group throughout the family—a real blessing."
Caring for a caregiver,Many hands make light(er) work.
Caring for a caregiver,"Maybe you could offer to spell them for a bit, something you may have thought of, so they can escape, decompress."
Caring for a caregiver,"If in-laws have, as it sounds, white collar jobs, they may well have access to an Employee Assistance Program."
Caring for a caregiver,"This can be a starting point for complex needs for professional help—referrals, directions to seek when they don't even know what they need."
Caring for a caregiver,"I'm wondering whether getting an attorney or estate planner involved, one who specializes in disability issues, might not be wise."
Caring for a caregiver,"Your inlaws will likely predecease their daughter/your SIL, and caring for her may speed up their need for asistance."
Caring for a caregiver,"It may not be soon, but the ""now what?"
Caring for a caregiver,"""question will eventually rear its ugly head."
Caring for a caregiver,Best wishes and virtual hugs.
Caring for a caregiver,Thankfully my FIL has a very clear cut estate plan for when things do come up.
Caring for a caregiver,Both inlaws are very wise with their money and have made it a goal for the kids to have nothing to fight over when they are gone because everything is pre planned.
Caring for a caregiver,Thank you!
Caring for a caregiver,"Also at some point we would like to be able to spell them for a bit but because the person ""on duty"" is technically a medical care person there are quite a few training programs that her parents had to go through to be able to qualify to be the person on duty."
Caring for a caregiver,"Eventually we would like to get that as well, but it was something like 30 hours of training needed to be able to help."
Caring for a caregiver,"I know I'm late to this but if you're still needing advice,  seek a Geriatric care manager in the area."
Caring for a caregiver,These are like paid social workers who dig up all the info and resources in the particular community that pertains to the particular situation.
Caring for a caregiver,There's a lot out there that could make your SIL's life and as a result your in-laws' much more bearable.
Caring for a caregiver,"Like someone else said,  your in-laws have to be open to receiving help though because it could be a very long ride."
Memory clinic expectations...,"Memory clinic expectations... Hi, my mum is 73 and has had a memory clinic scheduled in 2 weeks time."
Memory clinic expectations...,She has become forgetful and thinks her neighbour is stealing her money sometimes and had a few episodes of being very upset.
Memory clinic expectations...,"I call with her most days if possible and have noticed same recurring question ( do I want tea, am I busy in work, how's the kids etc) then asks the same ones soon after."
Memory clinic expectations...,She isn't sure on days of the week but I can understand if you don't have daily tasks it's easy to lose track.
Memory clinic expectations...,"She never really knew what year it was at best of times, she just loves in the here and now.So what expectations should we have at this clinic ( in northern Ireland )."
Memory clinic expectations...,Can they diagnose at this clinic?
Memory clinic expectations...,I hate explaining to doctor or social worker about her while she's present as she doesn't see that anything is wrong.
Memory clinic expectations...,"I’m in the US, so I can’t speak to how Ireland’s system will work."
Memory clinic expectations...,We did have the opportunity to speak privately with a social worker and the dr. You could call the clinic ahead of time and ask them what to expect.
Memory clinic expectations...,Or you could also write down your concerns and present the letter to the clinic ahead of the schedule and bring a copy to the meeting in case the first one is misplaced.
Memory clinic expectations...,I also tried to make corrections discretely during the meeting.
Memory clinic expectations...,"For instance the dr asked if Mom made her own meals, and my mom said yes, when in reality, I made the meals and Mom reheated them in the microwave."
Memory clinic expectations...,"So when Mom said yes to the dr, I shook my head no (behind mom’s view) and said that I brought over a lot of meals and Mom heats them up and also gets her own morning cereal."
Memory clinic expectations...,I was forthright about my observations even though my mom was present - the examination and dx are too important not to be direct and as the interview went in it was clear my mom wasn’t a good historian and my input was valuable.
Memory clinic expectations...,Thanks for your views.
Memory clinic expectations...,"It is certainly an important interview but it's perhaps an idea to write a statement pre interview and let doctor assess her without too much input, only when necessary."
Memory clinic expectations...,It's most important to be honest about everything while trying to stop mum feeling overwhelmed or feeling I'm against her.
Memory clinic expectations...,I just want an honest determination so we can move forward.
Memory clinic expectations...,My mum's mum and all her sisters unfortunately suffered so I hope to lessen my mum's anxiety with early intervention and a decent care package.
Memory clinic expectations...,"Hi Betty,This resource might be useful for some of your needs:https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/categories/stages/assessment-diagnosisYou can also call our helpline and speak to a Dementia Adviser who would be happy help with your queries too:https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/get-support/national-dementia-helpline Good luck with your Mother's assessment."
Memory clinic expectations...,That's very decent of you to pass me the information rikwilliams.
Memory clinic expectations...,I'll get a read over it and perhaps ring.
Memory clinic expectations...,No problems.
Memory clinic expectations...,"i work in the Digital team at the Society, but the Helpline team exist to speak with people just like you."
Memory clinic expectations...,Best wishes.
Memory clinic expectations...,Rik.
Memory clinic expectations...,"i'm from canada, so ymmv."
Memory clinic expectations...,"during the interview i had re: my grandmother, they asked me to explain things 'subtly', as in, using code words to explain things as she was being tested."
Memory clinic expectations...,"or, as someone else said, using head gestures."
Memory clinic expectations...,"if you talk to her often, which it seems like you do, you'll probably know best what she will/won't pick up on."
Memory clinic expectations...,"but the social worker and/or doctor will probably remind you not to try and influence her answers, which is also really important!good luck - i'm sure you'll be able to get her the help she needs, whatever that is."
Memory clinic expectations...,"and remember to take care of yourself as well, i know the process is very exhausting."
Memory clinic expectations...,"We take my MIL to a geriatric doctor, and with them we’ve gone through a few different methods of talking about her."
Memory clinic expectations...,From the beginning they’ve had us fill out our own paperwork while she does hers.
Memory clinic expectations...,"Then they compare our answers and since the beginning my MIL will write that everything is fine, she feels great on every question."
Memory clinic expectations...,"During the appointment, there’s a lot of head shaking behind her as the doctor asks her questions, and prompts from us to a more accurate answer."
Memory clinic expectations...,"However, the last few appointments the doctor just says things to us directly like MIL isn’t in the room, including very negative things about MIL and she just nods and smiles and tries to pretend like she has a grasp on the conversation."
Memory clinic expectations...,It’s changed a lot as she’s gotten worse.
Memory clinic expectations...,As far as diagnosis they had her do a short (15 min) memory test and once that came back with poor results they had her do a long (1 hr) memory test and thats when they came back with Alzheimer’s.
Memory clinic expectations...,Though we sort of already knew by that point and it was just formalizing it.
Memory clinic expectations...,You HAVE to be candid.
Memory clinic expectations...,"I see family members struggle with being candid vs being ""kind"" and staying silent."
Memory clinic expectations...,"Believe me, your doctor does not have ESP."
Memory clinic expectations...,"Doctors are overwhlemed, over worked, and rushed."
Memory clinic expectations...,So they don't have time to get at the symptoms from each and every angle.
Memory clinic expectations...,"Very few doctors are experts in dementia, and those who are not will not even know that you're holding back."
Memory clinic expectations...,"&#x200B;Further, you are not being kind with these omissions."
Memory clinic expectations...,You're actually preventing the best care and a clear diagnosis.
Memory clinic expectations...,You don't have to be rude and overly blunt.
Memory clinic expectations...,But be as honest as possible about distressing symptoms.
Memory clinic expectations...,Otherwise they don't get on the table and will not be addressed.
Memory clinic expectations...,"You're not the bad one, the disease, whatever it is, is that bad thing."

Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,We to had ask social services and they suggested getting her involuntary committed to hospital.
Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,I couldn’t even schedule the day.
Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,My brother did it and my mom felt betrayed and said lots of hurtful things.
Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,She hated him for awhile but the memory issues plus constant visits helped her stop being angry.

Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,Obviously the people back home did not see her when she was in her worst state.
Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,That means they are using invalid information to base their complaints.
Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,They either need to come see her in person or shut up.
Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,"You, as her soon to be guardian, have the final say."
Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,"She cannot stay at your house, since you have small children."
Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,You should place her in a nursing home or memory care/psych care near you.

Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,An elder of mine took a nose dive mentally following a bout with a brush-with-death respiratory illness.
Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,"Basically went from what we all thought was mild dementia & not that much of a concern for living on their own to ""Oh hell no, they need care yesterday."""
Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,That level they were at while sick prompted us to get them in a home.
Help with parent wishes vs medical advice,"Then, they rebounded close to mild dementia again for about 2 years before they reached that same more moderate-to-severe stage.If she's not able to care for herself, it's more think of your self as the parent or the adult in the room."

"Writing this for myself, mostly.",He kept insisting that I should I put way too many screws and nails on just the one small board.
"Writing this for myself, mostly.",This was unlike him as he had always worked on projects and was very smart about it.
"Writing this for myself, mostly.",He'd been smart his whole life.
"Writing this for myself, mostly.","He was voted 'Most Likely to Succeed' in his high school, was an allstar athlete in football, wrestling, track, he got a full scholarship to West Point Military Academy , was a Captain in the Air Force over in Vietnam, worked as an engineer for Honeywell, received a Masters in Business which led to being a well known, successful Financial Advisor, a Retirement Advisor ironically enough."

"Writing this for myself, mostly.","In the past few months, he's been very weird with the dog."
"Writing this for myself, mostly.","Making sure she's in her kennel at certain times, saying things about how he needs to be sure people won't kill her and stuff like that (she's definitely in no danger and idk why he'd ever think such a thing)."
"Writing this for myself, mostly.","Something he used to do was both laughable, yet infuriating, he had a ritual that he had to give the dog one piece of cut carrot every night."

"Writing this for myself, mostly.","My family has fallen apart over this and I have a lot of resentment for being the granddaughter taking care of the grandmother rather than her own children, and receiving criticism."
"Writing this for myself, mostly.","There is no easy way to cope with it, I find humor in it and sometimes I’m great with her and others days, I don’t care if I make her cry because I’m so frustrated and tired of the weird shit she says and I’m 32 with not nearly enough experience for this."
"Writing this for myself, mostly.","Her stories are absolutely crazy and I could relate to A LOT of what you said.Your family being together and helping one another with this is the most amazing thing you can ask for, and when the time comes to move him somewhere that he can have the care he needs, it won’t be nearly as difficult as a family torn."

"Writing this for myself, mostly.",Our plan is to take him to a walking track (which we frequently do) then stop at the home on our way back.
"Writing this for myself, mostly.","Our best plan is to tell him he has to stay there as it's ""camp"" or something."
"Writing this for myself, mostly.",Might try to tell him the house is getting worked on and he has to stay there for awhile.
"Writing this for myself, mostly.",It's going to be a shitshow and we all know that won't go over well.
"Writing this for myself, mostly.","We're also going to tell him he works there and has to help out, as he's always loved being helpful and maybe that'll be something he'd accept."
"Writing this for myself, mostly.",He won't be able to just up and leave when he gets upset.
"Writing this for myself, mostly.",Doors to the outside are kept locked.
"Writing this for myself, mostly.",The way the place wants us to do it is to drop him off and just let them do their thing.

How to handle my grandfathers anger?,He also said it was too painful to live in his house with out his wife there with him.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,It was all going well and the meds seemed to calm him down and he was on the right track but lately he has such bad anger.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,Everyone is a piece of * or a motherf** and he threatens our lives and his life and hits (with his fists or with objects) and grabs hair.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,He has such a good moments most of the time but at night or randomly through out the day he’ll get so violent and we don’t know how to handle it.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"We don’t know if it’s time to find him assisted living, which he’ll fight on that, or if he just needs us to do something we just don’t know because this is all of our first time dealing with this awful disease."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,I’m only 19 and my sister is 24 and we are all he has really because everyone else is too busy with their lives to take care of him and talk to him everyday.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,His late nephews wife is getting tired of being verbally abused so she is thinking about sending him home to us but I just don’t know how two young girls will be able to take care of a strong 78 year old war vet with random violent tendencies but we also feel like it is wrong to just give him to a home because our grandmother told us to take care of him.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"I know she didn’t know that this would happen but I feel like I’d be letting her down if I gave up so fast.I’m sorry this is so long but we just don’t know what to do and need advice or tips on how to handle this situation.TLDR cause I know this is long: 78 strong grandfather with recently diagnosed dementia randomly gets very violent verbally and physically, including threats of murder and suicide and we don’t know how to calm him down or handle it at all Your Grandfather absolutely should not be with your young children."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,His reasoning is gone.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"He wouldn’t mean to hurt a child, but he might, given the opportunity."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,Or he might not.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,The unpredictability means you can’t take the chance.

How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"They will also get his medicine straightened out, hopefully to stop the attacks."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,As far as promising your Grandmother that you would take good care of him - you are not able to the way he is now.

How to handle my grandfathers anger?,I would say it is probably time to look at assisted living.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,I work in a care home specialised in dementia and quite often when people are becoming aggressive it's best to just leave them be.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"I'm a stubborn person and hate to lose arguments, but what I've learnt with dementia is you will never win the argument."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"Plus, if his aggression becomes worse its draining."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,And it's hard caring for a loved one who then lashes out randomly.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"It stops you seeing him as him but rather as this person with dementia, it will make it harder for people to cherish the memories they have of him before his dementia."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"Medication can sometimes help to keep people settled, possibly look into that?"
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"Distraction can sometimes work, a cup of tea, watching a nice film, getting out photo albums but sometimes it doesn't."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,What works one day to help calm him possibly won't work the next day.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,Dementia is a day by day learning curve as I'm sure you know!
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"Obviously you want to stick to your grandmas wishes, but by putting him in a home doesn't mean you're not looking after him."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"You want to look after him, but is it in yours and his best interests?"
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"You can still visit, where I work families are allowed to decorate the rooms, bring in old furniture."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,Threats of murder and suicide are common with dementia but are also still to be taken seriously.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"Thinking of you and your family, this is such a hard situation to be in."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"Thank you so much for so much advice, it’s so much to consider and I’ve of course gotta go over all this with me sister but I think a nice home would be the best because we have small children under 3 living here and I wouldn’t want anything to happen to them and they love their pap and I just don’t think it’s right for them to see him like that  Currently dealing with this with my grandmother."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"She isn't violent physically or doling out threats, her words are more hurtful than violent."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,She has had really bad episodes in which she just won't calm down.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"Certain factors meant that we all decided to have her live in assisted living, and they have dealt with the episodic outburst."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,The doctors have adjusted her medication which has helped but one contained sedatives.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"So, while she was calm, she now had her eyes closed a majority of the time."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,They adjusted the medication again which now allows her to keep her eyes open.
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"I hate that the sedatives they are giving him are just putting him asleep for most of the day because even though he has dementia and is violent  that’s still no way to live, I’ll bring it up with the doctors if there are other medication options that will calm him but not just put him asleep for hours."
How to handle my grandfathers anger?,"Thank you so much and I’m sorry we have this in common, I know it doesn’t get better exactly but I hope things start looking up for you and your family <3"
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Frontotemporal Dementia Journey Hi everyone.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I'm 36 years old and smack dab in the middle of the the biggest challenge of my life.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,In 2013 my brother passed away from an undiagnosed enlarged heart.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,We all took the loss hard but Dad (age 63) really struggled to cope.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I knew from the moment that we found my brother deceased that something broke in him that day.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Fast forward to 2015.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Dad's behavior progressively became more erratic, violent, and lacked any sort of empathy for his actions."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,His wife (my mom) left him after 43 years of marriage due to his behaviors and he often reportedly lacked insight into how any of his behaviors may have contributed to the separation.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I always thought that he behaved in a narcissistic manner and just chopped up his lack of insight to his narcissistic personality.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,In 2016 Dad was arrested for the first time in his life for showing up to a football game intoxicated.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"He was put on Diversion and as part of his punishment, he was required to complete a mental health exam."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Upon completion of the exam, the psychologist recommended that Dad complete a physical exam and a cat scan."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,In 2016 a scan of his brain was done and sure enough....Frontotemporal Dementia and an Alzheimer's diagnosis.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"After meeting with his newly acquired Neurologist, Dad (age 63) was demonstrating symptoms associated with Frontotemporal Dementia, Behavioral Variant type AND Alzheimer's."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"So not only were his days a major struggle behaviorally, but every day is a new day and he doesn't have any recollection of the previous day.At first I was unsure about his diagnosis but the more I learned about the disease and observed his behavior on a daily basis, the more it was evident that the Neurologist was spot on."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Now that mom has left him and my sibling is no longer living, I am his only family and sole support system/caretaker."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"To add a wrinkle to the story, his mother (age 90) is still living and was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's as well."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Her symptoms progressed rapidly and due to Dad not being cognitively able to manage her or support her, I became her POA and recently moved her into an assisted living facility."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Dad lives in Grandma's house and he even still drives.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Most people gasp when I tell them about him driving but part of his FTD is routine and he drives the same routes every day (40-80 miles per day), to the same 5 spots in town, over and over and over again."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"He eats the same food each day, doesn't attempt to cook at home, and I track his every move through GPS software."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I ride with him weekly to monitor his speed, distance, decision-making, etc."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,He's still an excellent driver....UNLESS there is a distraction such as a ball or tangible item that may seem misplaced on the side of the road.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,He stops and picks these items up every time and that worries me.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I'm trying to promote his independence as much as possible knowing that there is no turning back once the keys are lost but I also don't know at what point that decision should be made.So here I sit....A 36 year old male, who owns and operates 5 businesses, POA and ultimate caregiver to Dad and Grandma with progressing Dementia/Alzheimer's, and I have a wife of 13 years and 3 children...ages 8, 5, 4."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I'm trying to balance everything but undoubtedly this caretaking role is taking its toll on my mental and physical health, my marriage, my ability to be the best parent possible,  and my effectiveness as a business owner."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I'm in the acceptance phase of this process.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I know it's going to get worse and not get better.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"But I feel like I am on my own island here and I could use some advice, direction, resources from people that have been in a similar situation."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I'm open to any questions, feedback, suggestions, or input as to how I can continue to navigate this without sacrificing everything."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Thank you in advance.BrianUnfortunately you are going to sacrifice something.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,This disease is worse on the care takers than the afflicted.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Easiest thing would be pitting him in an assisted living or hire home care.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Something is going to fail otherwise.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I find my job is taking the toll then my marriage (lack of one on one time).
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,There is adult day care too.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,My father has dementia and he refuses to do adult day care and he won’t do what is best for him because he thinks he is fine.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"He can’t drive any longer, he’s starting to get lost, he doesn’t remember how to use an ATM."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,At this point I am stuck what to do as he doesn’t have enough resources  to pay for assisted living and we don’t have enough to supplement it.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,We are waiting in medicaid.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Where are you located?
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I work for an agency currently part time, let me ask if they know of any emergency help."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I am located in a suburb of Omaha, Nebraska."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I'm learning that there are not many FTD resources in this area and I am thinking about getting involved and changing that.&#x200B; Thank you so much.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I very much appreciate your feedback and I am sorry to hear about your Dad.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,No worries.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,We are here to help each other.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,It’s a horrible disease.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,It takes a toll.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,All we can do is try to be patient and do what we can.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I think the narcissistic behavior should be mentioned more when speaking about symptoms of dementia, especially the FTD."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"In our case, my father is a retired neurosurgeon so he had that element of arrogance (you want confidence in a surgeon!)"
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,But note try telling him he has dementia.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Here's a brain surgeon!
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,He knows better.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,My poor mother's health rapidly declined in her final two years and she passed away at age 71 the year.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Everyday there was something about his health that had to be addressed.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"To be fair he's got severe arthritis and has had almost 10 surgeries for ankles, neck, back and replacement hips.But he also is very OCD and knows so much that the slightest sniffle had to be addressed immediately."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Calling and bugging his doctor friends got ridiculous and embarrassing.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,My sisters blame my father for my mother's death bc he was so selfish.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Mom couldn't leave him alone for the last two years of her life.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,She did tell me before she died that she felt guilty bc she didn't recognize the dementia earlier.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,We thought he was at just being a selfish asshole.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"He wasted a lot of his savings, but we are still able to afford in home care."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,For now.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,His dementia seems to be slowly progressing and his family lived well into their 80's.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I can't even fathom trying to address moving him into a home eventually, but we are lucky that a memory care assisted living center is being built close to his home."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"He's gotten sweeter in the last few years, but still doesn't get that he has it and occasionally tries to override decisions bc he's a doctor."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,We recently had to put vitamin C's in an accessible cupboard for him that resemble his pain pills bc he was insistent that he could self medicate.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,He goes to that cabinet at least ten times a day.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,The doctor says it just goes straight through him and is luckily safe.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,That was a very difficult aspect of his care bc he'd forget we'd given it to him and argue about it.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I'm actually surprised at how much he has willingly given up.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Driving for at least four years.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Still had to hide car keys though bc he'd try and sneak off to the liquor store, but other than that, he's dialed back a bit on the narcissism."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,It should've been a huge flag to us though.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I hope you reach out to his friends.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,We've found that people will come and take him to movies or out for meals when we contact them and it makes him so happy.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Even friends he hadn't been close to before this all started.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Good luck and check back here occasionally.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,It's not a hugely busy sub but there is support here and some good ideas for care.Stay strong.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I wish you well.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Good idea about reaching out to his friends!
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,My patient's frat brothers from decades ago still come around and visit all the time.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,That's awesome!
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Thank you so much.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I have reached out to his friends and they have been great despite them feeling quite uncomfortable with what to say, what not to say, etc."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,They get over the nervousness the more they come around.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I also should've mentioned leaning on your own friends also.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,My best friend is in town for the holidays and texted me to ask when would be a good time to swing by so she could see him knowing he's so lonely.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,(I live out of state)I have great friends.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I'm sure you do as well.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,And they know you're struggling.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"But if not, they'll be glad to know why and want to help."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Good luck and remember to take deep breaths.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,They don't get enough credit.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I'm not even really sure where to start.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I have been caring for a man with rapid-onset FTD for the past year and a half.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I actually have a decent amount of experience, training and knowledge working with dementia and Alzheimer's patients but hadn't heard of FTD until I started with this patient."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"This by far has been one of the most gutwrenching, devestating jobs I've ever had and I have a lot of patience for people especially with neurological diseases."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,But this is an entirely different beast.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I've told my friends and family many times, this disease just keeps finding new ways to break my heart.My boss (his 44 year old son) and I have literally just sat and cried so many times before (tearing up thinking about that)."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,He's somewhat in a similar position as you.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Very little family input so all of the responsibility, including taking over his father's business, falls on his shoulders."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"He actually does have an older brother but he lives almost 4 hours away and it seems ""can't be bothered to help."""
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I won't go into a tangent that I could about him.Anyway, not sure I have a lot of advice."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,But I would preach self-care for sure.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,As caregivers that is shoved down our throats because there is a HUGE chance of burnout.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Enlist help, if not from family, then see what his insurance covers."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Look into respite care.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,There's actually a lot of resources and support out there.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,And I'm happy to talk and help if possible.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Hang in there.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Thank you so much.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I spend 50% of my day managing Dad, another 20% of my day with my grandmother with Alz, and I also own and operate my own business."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"With this routine, there isn't much time to spend focusing on my business or my wonderful wife and 3 young children."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I appreciate the support.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I told my boss about you and he said he'd be willing to talk to you if you'd like.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,He is 44  and primary caregiver of his 75 y/o father with FTD.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,That's an amazing offer.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Thank you so much!
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Of course.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Just let me know.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,You definitely have support.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,:) You need help.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,You are in a situation that you can't handle alone.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,My Mom (94) began showing signs of dementia at age 85.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,She is in her final stages of dementia.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,She is currently in the memory care unit at a nursing home.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,She is receiving excellent care there.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"She is no longer lucid, and is unable to care for herself at all."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Here are some things that worked for my sister and me.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I encourage you to do likewise: 1) I contacted a local Alzheimer's support group.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I went to several meetings and found out about local resources for help.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"2) I went to a nursing home with a memory facility, and spoke to some nurses there."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,They helped me and informed me of resources available for help.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,3) My sister and I drew up all of the legal documents for my mom that are needed for eldercare and end-of-life situations.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"In my state (Texas), there are five or six:  a will, listing my sister and me as co-executorsa legal power of attorney, allowing us to make legal decisions on Mom's behalf; a medical power of attorney, allowing us to make medical decisions on Mom's behalf; a HIPPA form, allowing doctors to inform us as to Mom's medical condition and test results; a do-not-resuscitate form (DNR, also called Physician's directive), informing medical  personnel what to do in case Mom cannot be resuscitated; Additionally, there is a ""Guardianship in case of incapacitation"" form, which makes the children legally responsible for the elderly parent."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"We decided not to execute this document, because it would make us responsible for all Mom's actions, such as, if she had an accident and hurt someone, we could be held liable."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"We decided that the Power of Attorney and Medical Power of Attorney gave us the authority that we need, so we decided not to do the guardianship form."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"It seemed that the downside outweighed any advantages.We had all these documents drawn up by a lawyer, and we met with a mobile notary and had Mom sign them all, while she still had cognitive ability to do so."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Ensure that you have multiple signed, notary-stamped originals of all documents."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,We executed 3 signed copies of each form.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Some government agencies will not accept photocopies, they require an original document."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"4) During all of our searching for financial aid and resources, we found that there was a special program available to the elderly surviving veterans and spouses."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"My father was in WWII for three months, but that qualified my Mom for $1,100 / month assistance benefit."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I applied for it and was turned down.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Then I found a specialist in applying for military aid, and he reworded my application and re-submitted it and it was approved."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,This is the beauty of networking with support groups and nursing homes.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,They can help discover assistance programs that you never knew about.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,5) We became co-signers on Mom's bank accounts.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,This has helped in handling her financial matters.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"We also tracked down all of her insurance and other accounts, and ensured that her Medicare supplemental was adequate and up-to-date."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"We found all of her bank accounts, and consolidated it all to one account."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,6) Do not give your father any money.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"If you do, then the money you give him may be determined to be ""income,"" and he may be turned down for charity or assistance later on because of the ""income"" you have given him."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"He needs to completely deplete his own financial resources, then apply for charity or assistance, then, after that, if money is still needed, you can help him out."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"7) In the earlier stages of her decline, we hired a home senior care person to come in and sit with Mom several hours a day, and to cook meals for her at her home (www.homeinstead.com)."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,They were wonderful.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Eventually Mom declined to a point that she needed 24/7 care, so we put her into the nursing home."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"If your father is already showing substantial decline at age 63, you might look into both Social Security Retirement benefits and also Social Security disability benefits."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Hope this helps!
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Message me separately if you need to.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Wonderful feedback.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Thank you so much.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I am his POA and we have adjusted his trust/living will.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Banks are on board.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Dad has BOTH FTD and Alzheimer's so we are trying to reach out to the local resources to find support for both diseases.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Hi, I wanted to let you know you're not alone."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,FTD especially the behavioral variant is extremely tough.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"For now, there are quite a few resources about legit support groups, https://www.theaftd.org/living-with-ftd/support-for-care-partners/Aftd is a great resource."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Support groups are more helpful than you think.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"And to be very honest,  I doubt your dad will have the capacity to drive much longer or take care of himself."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Please start researching care facilities or care givers to help.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,My husband has had PPA for about 3 years and is starting to demonstrate behavioral symptoms which can happen between the two variants.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,He can no longer care for himself.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,This will be hard but hang in there.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,You're not alone and a social worker and a psychiatrist may be your best bet  Thank you so much.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"AFTD has 0 resources in Omaha, NE."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,My degrees are in social work and I am thinking that getting involved and helping to to bring these AFTD support groups and such to Nebraska.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I can't change the diagnosis for Dad but I am 100% committed to doing what I can to spread the word about this terrible disease and find ways to reach others that are in this struggle as well.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Seriously good for you.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Hello, my condolences to your coping with this tragic disease."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,My mother displayed a very similar progression.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I also can’t really tell if she has Alzheimer’s with frontal symptoms or straight out FTD because she does have all the behavioral stuff that goes with FTD.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,The neurologist doesn’t know either.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I’m just going with FTD because it makes the most sense.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Anyway, the best bit of advice I can give you as someone who is similarly situated is that you need to hire help."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I had a real struggle to get my mom to accept a “housekeeper,” but ultimately it has been a lifesaver because I’m not responsible for every detail of her dysfunctional life and she can still live with my dad at home."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I did take away her car.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Like your dad, she was basically a safe driver."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,But I felt that her lack of ability to plan or deal with changes and her impulsiveness could set her up for becoming flustered in an unexpected situation.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,You’ll know hopefully when the right time to take the car away is.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Feel free to DM me anytime.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,This is a really hard thing to cope with.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Thank you so very much!
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I am going to have Dad go through the simulation driving test at the local hospital.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I don't think he will pass.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Shockingly my mom passed.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Alz is different than FTD in this way IMO- the patients can pass tests much better for longer  even if they are just as impaired as Alz patients.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I ended up taking her car away anyway.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I did it in a sneaky way though.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I told her the car was broken, which it was, and then have the mechanic tell her it was a irreparable."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Since then, 2 years ago, we have been “looking for”, and “shopping for good deals.” But it’s amazing we just haven’t found a car yet for her!"
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,WOW!
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I drive with him a couple of times per week and can't believe how good of a driver he is.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,That's a good solution you provided.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Luckily his vehicle is a lease and has to be turned in soon.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,That may just be a blessing.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I've explained to Dad that he won't be able to drive much longer because insurance won't allow him to with his diagnosis.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,He just looks at me with a crooked grin ;/ which I always appreciate.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Sometimes you have to just laugh in situations like this.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Hi Brian,I am 34 and my father (62) too rapidly progressed in his disease of FTD."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"He is currently on a ""legal 2k"" hold for psychiatric disturbance he recently caused."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I too am a business owner and operator of a consultant group and  work with a few companies in leadership roles.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,However  I am not married but do have a LTR with no children.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I too am my fathers only relative who can manage and care for his affairs.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I am currently in the process of gaining guardianship, which has been difficult due to my fathers reluctance and non-acceptance of his failing state.I just want you to know you are not alone, and that people like you and I are forced into this position and in many ways can have closure for the ways our fathers behavior may have impacted us."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,What i use to think was narcissism was really just early stages of degeneration.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,What i use to think was embarrassing shameful behavior was just an early sign of devolution.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"In some ways, although this feels like the worst time of my life (business is not doing to well and financially insecure), in many ways i feel the most sense of relief."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"My only worry now is that my father is safe, i can manage his affairs, I can maintain my relationship and stay a float financially."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"On top of this I am calculating how I can try and prevent or stall this disease from consuming me, if it does.Anyways, if you ever want to be a pen pal, i'm here."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Good luck with everything.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"Find balance, and learn everything you can.cheers,Steven Thank you so much Steven!"
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I am so sorry to hear about what you are going through.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Your feedback is spot on and this has been a journey that I wouldn't wish on anyone.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I've made the decision to put dad in AL.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"It's for his safety, well-being, and for my own relief."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I have come to grips with the fact that I can't protect him from this and I need to lean on professionals.I'm here for you too if I can assist in any way.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Even to bounce ideas back and forth.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Thank you!
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Brian Fox i think you mentioned the difficulty and lack of resources/process there seems to be available in these matters.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I believe we share in this frustration.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I would like to fight for protocols to be in place, similar to that of a psychiatric disturbance, which can be initiated to identify and prevent further tertiary destruction that comes with these situations."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"In the event of a suspected early onset or rapidly progressive dementia, or even during a late /normative onset dementia, in which a patient can be brought into a neurocognitive unit, receive proper diagnosis and if client meets criteria to have a temporary guardianship facilitated at the hospital."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Then to allow for an after care plan to be established to minimize confusion for all parties and prevent further hardship.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,&#x200B;I am not sure where you are located  but i am out of Nevada and we do not seem to have anything in place to make this efficient or effective.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I hope my fathers legacy can be the initiation of such a procedure.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,i hope.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Best of luck to you as well and thank you for creating a forum for this discussion.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"&#x200B;Steven   I'm also 36 and my dad has FTD, and it's the hardest thing that has ever happened to me."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"I don't have a lot of advice except to recommend you try to do at least one thing each week just for yourself, something that you love."
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I find that goes a long way.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Will be thinking of you.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Love this.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,Simple solution but I am not currently doing this.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,You are so right and I will start implementing this.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,I'm sorry to hear about your Dad.
Frontotemporal Dementia Journey,"If I can be of support to you in any way, please let me know."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,I guess it's time for *me* to share.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,TL;DR at the end.The past couple of months have been rough on me.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"My wife (who has multiple debilitating physical conditions, Fibromyalgia, tendonitis, arthritis, GERDS (just to name a few) and some mental health stuff leftover from her stint in the Navy) has been having some severe 'episodes' where her muscles contract along her spine and shoulders."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"This has been going on for months, but as of a couple of months ago, they have been getting increasingly worse.Initially, it started with some vertigo when she stood up."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"Then, whenever she bent/knelt down."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"Soon, she would have the muscle spasms, but nothing too bad, then it became a whole lot worse."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,She would severely stutter.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,She would lose her cognitive ability (she told me she looked into a mirror and couldn't recognize herself).
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"In a couple of instances she stopped breathing, even though she said that she was afterward."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"The strangest part is that the episodes last just a couple of minutes, and she would be just fine once it has passed."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"We quickly learned that if I press on those muscle spasms, they would eventually release, but not without a serious fight."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"If ever I was thankful for all the heavy lifting jobs I've had since I've left the military, it is now."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,It takes some serious effort to apply enough pressure to release these things.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,It's the only thing that has helped her get through these episodes.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,We've waited to get to see her doctor at the VA clinic nearby.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"Our thinking for this was to get her General Practitioner on board with what was going on, and go from there."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"We've had an at-home nurse drop by and agree that waiting to get to see the doctor was a good plan, since Emergency Rooms generally don't like people coming in and saying ""Hey, watch this!""."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"It doesn't help that the closest VA emergency room is in San Francisco, an hour drive away in good traffic."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"We don't want to play the Russian Roulette game of ""will the VA cover this emergency room visit to a civilian hospital""."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"Once we got in to see the doctor, we talked about what was going on, then demonstrated it for her, and the concern was quite obvious."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"She was dumbstruck, and had almost no idea on how to help."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"She knew that we needed to see neurology, but going through 'proper channels' it would take a while to get us in.She told us to go to the ER, since they could fast-track us into an appointment, if we went during normal operating hours."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,So we did.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"We didn't know what to expect, so we planned for hospitalization."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,Went to SFVA the next day (last Friday).
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"We saw a nurse practitioner, explained what was going on, and demonstrated it for her."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"After a battery of labs, she informed us that the Neurology department wanted to admit her next week (Tuesday- holiday weekend)."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"It was such a relief to know that this is being taken seriously.We went over to the Epilepsy Center, and got the orientation packet, what to bring, what to expect, who would be seeing us, all that jazz."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"We left feeling relieved and happy that this was going to be a good thing, to figure out what was going on."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,The biggest stressor was just not knowing what was wrong.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,Her in-patient stay is going to be a 3-7 day EEG.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"I apologize in advance if I'm not as responsive during this next week, but I will be with her the entire time (save for some sanity breaks, and/or possibly a couple of meals)."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"My children (all four of them) are going to be with my mother during this time, who has generously offered to take time off of her work to help us out."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"She's had them since we went to the hospital, and staying with us this past week to help us out."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,I really don't know how we'd do this without her help.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"We've talked about possible diagnoses, from a seizure disorder, to cancers.. but right now, it doesn't matter."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"I got to spend a wonderful weekend with just my wife and I at home, talking, playing games, and a nice dinner at Olive Garden last night."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"We're hopeful at whatever news comes our way, since at least then we can talk about treatment, whatever that may entail."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,TL;DR:Wife has bad spasms that cause her to lose consciousness.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,"Doctor told us to go to ER, and are being admitted on Tuesday for 3-7 day EEG."
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,Looking forward to the results and whatever comes from it.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,Do NOT wait to go to the Emergency Room.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,Lesson learned.Best wishes to you both.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,You sound like an amazing couple.
I guess it's time for *me* to share.,And thank you both for your service.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,What are my obligations to my aging parent?
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,Moving in with my mother was a mutually beneficial arrangement.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"Shes 72 and ""retired"" after leaving her  last social work job."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,She couldn't keep paying the mortgage on social security and things didn't work out with her previous roommate.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"My wife had to make a career change and lowering our rent allowed us to more easily afford some time with her out of work, plus we could start saving for a house."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"After a year and a half, and multiple discussions, my mother continues to violate my wife and I's boundaries by moving our things around (problematic for my wife), eats some of our foods (not basic staples, problematic for me on shift work), and doesn't want to share the common parts of the house with any of our stuff."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"No shoes or jackets by the door, none of my wife's DVDs or books down in the living room."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,Very little closet and storage space.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"I spent $1,000 and a few weeks last year remodeling the attic into a loft so that we'd have our own space, but it's not habitable year round due to limited climate control in the summer."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,I know this stuff is pretty petty but here's the thing.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,We've discussed this multiple times and things haven't changed.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,We pay half the mortgage and 2/3 of the utilities but have very little storage and living space.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,I know that bothers my wife more than she let's on.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"With my wife stable in a new career track and some money in the bank, what obligation do I have to my mother and her continued aging in place?"
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,She can't afford the house without a roommate.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,A roommate wouldn't deal with the lack of respect for boundaries as long as we have.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"She's not abusive, she's just a dick who's hard to live."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"I'm 31, going on a year married."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"I want to start my life with my wife, not be buried away in a small bedroom and a loft, but then my mother's comfort and quality of life could take a severe dip if we leave her on her own."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"My dad, and my in-laws both sit on piles of money."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,She's the only parent with an insecure (more like nonexistent) retirement.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,What do?
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,There are subsidized senior living apartments if you do a little digging and work.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,Maybe this would help.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,It doesn't sound as if you living situation is going to be very beneficial for your marriage.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"A senior living community might be better for her socializing anyway.https://www.after55.com/blog/how-find-low-income-senior-housing/ I moved across country to help care for my mom/parents and am in very much a similar situation, minus them needing my money."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"They do need my assistance as mom can't safely cook, drive, or be alone for long periods of time anymore due to dementia/other health problems and my father is either slow to learn or just unwilling to pick up the slack."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,Maybe a little of both.Your obligation goes as far as you can extend it.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"I personally feel we should all care for the elders in our family, but we are people with lives too."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,You need to have a frank discussion with your mom.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"Tell her the situation isn't working, and you and your wife need your own space, either that or she has to allow her space to be your space."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"If it is the former, it is possible she may just have to sell the house and find a more affordable living situation for herself."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"If it's the latter, then you need to set some ground rules.For myself, I'm moving out."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"They don't need my rent so I can swing by a few times a week and do meal prep for them, take mom shopping, and clean."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"You could move out and give your mom some sort of allowance, but realistically if it's going to be just her, then she needs to find an appropriately sized/priced home or deal with the risks of roommates.Life is tough all the way through mommy."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,We have to make hard decisions at every turn and no one is every going to be able to just take the wheel from us and let us coast.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,>I want to start my life with my wifeIt's time you do so!
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"Nature intends for baby birds to leave the nest, so do so.Options for your mom include a 55+ apartment where the average age is about 70 so she'll have lots of socializing she can do."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"No, it may not be what she wants, but, right now, it's not what you want, so you figure out what really matters."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"BTW, your wife might ask you to choose between her and your mom, and you better know what you want!Unfortunately, we often have to let things fall apart for our elderly parents before they realize they can't keep living like they used to."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"The generation over 70 never really had to care for their aging parents because back then, people died mostly before they were 80."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"So, the over 70 generation thinks they'll die still owning their home, and their death will take a few weeks at most.Read Atul Gawande's Being Mortal if you haven't already."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"Wise knowledge is you don't move in with your parents, nor have them move in with you.How it will unfold with your mom is she might get some tenants after you leave, and they'll make her miserable (be sure the tenants sign a lease because evictions take months even with a lease, longer if without - search r/legaladvice for more on that)."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"After the tenant fiasco, she'll have some other crisis (health, bank repossessing the home, etc) that will force her to move."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"It's much better if she can decide on her own to move before that happens, so be sure to inform her of her future before it falls apart."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"The over-70 crowd in general doesn't believe they are over 50, and live in denial that things are changing.Source: Read some of my replies here an here, this isn't my first rodeo, and the one I'm in now is ongoing."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"edit: typos , and will ad, in 2018 and beyond, I'd say you have an obligation to help her stay safe with food, clothing, shelter, and medicine, but you don't have to pay for a level of living that isn't financially tenable (if she's living beyond her means, she needs to change how she's living, send her to r/PersonalFinance for that)."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"She is still responsible for how she manages her possessions (her home) and if she screws it up, then she screws it up."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"If you've warned her, that's, sadly, often all you can do."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"There are options for her living arrangements, maybe even with some financial support from you (send your $ directly to the apartment complex or utility, don't give it to her willy-nilly unless trust is absolute.)."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"You really aren’t obligated to do anything, but understandably you don’t want to put your mom into a precarious living arrangement."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,We’re considering looking for a house with a detached MIL apartment.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,We live in a different state and things are looking like she will need to be closer to people who can give her more support than she is currently getting.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"I can barely survive a 10 day visit with her in my space, so she will absolutely need her own living quarters."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,"We live in a high cost of living area, so she won’t be able to afford her own place."
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,A separate house/apartment on the same property that she rents from us feels like it will be the best solution for our situation.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,sell the place you have now and get a duplex?
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,I’ve asked her to sell her to consider selling her house and buying a condo cash.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,She refuses.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,If my wife and I can swing a duplex that’ll be nice but it won’t be with any help from my mother.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,She should have sold this house and purchased something smaller when her and my father got divorced.
What are my obligations to my aging parent?,She didn’t though.

Music players?,Music players?
Music players?,Seems like a lot of folks with dementia would be helped by playing music.
Music players?,"It soothes, calms, distracts, is generally a great thing."
Music players?,Especially if it's from their young adulthood.
Music players?,"Are there any stand-alone devices out there that include memory storage that we could load with the right music, integrated speakers, and simple (preferably big) buttons for PLAY and STOP?"
Music players?,Is there a gadgety subreddit that might have suggestions?
Music players?,I would suggest looking into mp3 players with built in speakers.
Music players?,"I plan to do so and will update if I do find anything, but thought I'd recommend you search there as well.I think your question could lead to a great solution, making listening to favorite songs simple."
Music players?,yes!

Walking assistance,Walking assistance Mom is 78 and has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s for the past 5-6 years.
Walking assistance,"Over the past 6 months, she has had 2-3 fall, and her shuffling is significantly worsening."
Walking assistance,"She compensates by clutching Dad’s arm, but he’s 82 and recently had a knee replacement."
Walking assistance,"She has said she doesn’t want to use a “crutch,” but it’s clear she could use a walker or other such assistive device.Has anyone successfully convinced a demented loved one to at least try an assistive device?"
Walking assistance,What worked?
Walking assistance,I work in an ER.
Walking assistance,"I’m terrified she’s going to fall, injure herself, and know this can be devastating in terms of long term outcomes."
Walking assistance,We just stuck the walker in her front closet.
Walking assistance,Then she could try it without pressure from family.
Walking assistance,What if your dad started using one to eliminate the stigma?
Walking assistance,"She says it’s fine for him because of his knee, but that she doesn’t want to be a “wimp” and use one because she didn’t have surgery :-/ I have not dealt with this, but what if you got a walking cane with some pizazz."
Walking assistance,Of course take her personality into consideration - but find something that doesn't look so medically sterile.
Walking assistance,"Wood, rhinestone, feathers."
Walking assistance,Good luck.
Walking assistance,"I've recently become aware that my wife's shuffling/walking problems have to do with vision problems -- specifically, that Alzheimer's gives a patient tunnel vision."
Walking assistance,Such an explanation makes a lot of sense to me.
Walking assistance,The number one determinant for falls is quad strength.
Walking assistance,"If she won't use a walker, can you bring in someone to do exercises with her?"
My Grandpa's Story,My Grandpa's Story Hey everyone I just stumbled upon this community and I wanted to write a little bit about my grandpa who passed away last saturday.
My Grandpa's Story,"A friendly disclaimer beforehand, I am from Germany so excuse any potential mistakes concerning grammar or terminology and whatnot; I also don't know if posts like these are allowed/appreciated."
My Grandpa's Story,My grandpa passed away last saturday after years of fighting off the inevitable.
My Grandpa's Story,Even though we were kind of prepared it still hit us harder than we thought.
My Grandpa's Story,"He was diagnosed with Alzheimers in 2014 I think but at that point he was not even able to write his name ""Alexander"" or even ""Alex"" in short in his medical evaluation so I guess he already had it for a lot longer."
My Grandpa's Story,"He had mixed up the names of my Dad and me for years and he sometimes had trouble ""finding the right words"" and finishing sentences."
My Grandpa's Story,"In 2013 when I was at their house during lunchbreak he would later tell his wife that ""the tall guy with the bag"" (that is me) had been there cause he couldn't remember my name anymore."
My Grandpa's Story,What I found weird was that compared to other documentaries I had watched about dementia and alzheimers was that he also degraded physically a lot.
My Grandpa's Story,It came to a point where he could not move for longer than a minute and he couldn't walk down the stairs to their basement.
My Grandpa's Story,His overall movement became very slow and it took multiple tries for him to get up from a seated position.
My Grandpa's Story,"From 2016/2017 he was constantly in and out of hospital with pneumonia, high fevers or other things."
My Grandpa's Story,"Sometimes he would wake up at night and not realize he was in his own home and other times he would not even recognize his wife, his daughter or his sister."
My Grandpa's Story,A few days before his passing he came out of the hospital again and they told us they had moved him to palliative care which was a bit of a surprise for us.
My Grandpa's Story,"He often refused to eat or drink, sometimes consuming not more than 2 or 3 glasses of water each day."
My Grandpa's Story,Maybe he didn't want to life anymore?
My Grandpa's Story,There was one weird instance in 2014 a few weeks after his official diagnose.
My Grandpa's Story,"At this point he was not able to walk down the stairs for quite a while now but one night he managed to get down the stairs, woke up his SIL and basically told her to lock him up and beat him to death which was odd and totally out of character for him to say something like that and since then this event stuck with us...He was 75 years old and an avid runner."
My Grandpa's Story,"Going through his notes I have learned that he wasn't born a strong runner but he had the motivation to change his life in his late 30s and he wanted to do ""something sporty""."
My Grandpa's Story,So he started off slow and painful and through hard work and determination (he ran 15 miles at least 3 times a week) he was able to run one marathon (26.2 Miles) after another.
My Grandpa's Story,I can't find the exact number but it's gotta be more than 35 marathons and he even participated in a few 100 km (62.1 Miles) and 24 hour runs.
My Grandpa's Story,In 2003 he also flew to Nepal to go on a hiking trip.
My Grandpa's Story,There are so many things I've learned in the last few days and I'm quite amazed about the things I read.
My Grandpa's Story,I think it's a shame he could never tell me these things personally and convey the emotions he must have felt during these achievements.
My Grandpa's Story,"The burial is this friday and until then I hope to learn a lot more awesome things about my grandpa which light him in a different, motivational and happy way.Thank you all for reading this!"
My Grandpa's Story,I just wanted to share this story... rest in peace Opa AlexI'm so sorry for your loss.

"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","My situation is... problematic, to say the least."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","I'm 22 (almost 23), transgender & finishing up my transition pretty soon (October); my brother's autistic, high functioning and 24 and violent/unemployed/NEET-ish; my mom has issues of her own, undiagnosed."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","Myself -- I work as a software engineer, I'm known to be pretty intelligent, I can more than ably take care of myself and have a good circle of friends and support more or less."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","Most of my misery in life comes from my family, not really even due to the transgender thing (which is usually pretty bad by itself).For the purposes of below, my dad is about 59, and my mom is about 57.The past two years have been a rollercoaster of heartbreak, mostly - my dad was fired from his job of 20-something years in October 2016, and I helped him a new job around April 2017."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","He was then let go from the new job in March 2018, and was supposed to start another job (in Florida, away from my family) in September of this year."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","He was fired for reasons I don't want to get into, but the running diagnosis up until there was unmanaged bipolar disorder, leading to episodes of mania and culminating in an involuntary psychiatric hold in October 2017 (my brother was also put in psychiatric hold at that time for attacking my mom).Over this past year, my dad has been somewhat forgetful, and more distant from me conversationally, which I also ascribed to my transition (aka not knowing how to relate to a daughter, rather than his son)."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.",He's also had 4-6 minor car accidents.
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","He's also on a cocktail of meds (Abilify, Prozac, Trazadone, Valsartan, Atorvastatin, Antabuse, Omeprazole, and Vyvanse) and historically has depression and alcohol issues (partially due to family drama)."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","Last month, my mom took my dad to see a neurologist (funnily enough the one who I used to see for my juvenile epilepsy, which thankfully I outgrew)."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","The neurologist, owing to what my mom described and observing my dad, recommended my dad for further testing and told him he should minimize driving as much as possible.Today and this past week, my dad's been going to testing at UCLA, which culminated in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, which detected significant impairment in my dad's visiospatial & mental tracking, and mild-to-moderate in verbal memory."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","This is indicative of cognitive impairment, and some amount of decline.My greatest fears is - does this likely point to early-onset familial Alzheimer's dementia?"
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","His dad died of Alzheimer's related dementia around 82, and his side does have a history of it, but from what I know in old age mainly."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","I don't know of any other sufferers of EFAD in our family line, but I can start searching.Also - what does this mean for me?"
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","I'm in the process now of trying to schedule APOE/PSEN2 testing if I can get it, but I don't even know exactly how I'd handle the results if I get them."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","Goodness that’s a lot to handle at 22, and your family certainly seems to have a lot going on as well."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.",So here are my thoughts and hopefully other people will be even more helpful.
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","First, you don’t know your dad has Alzheimer’s."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","He could have any number of cognitive issues, particularly one triggered by alcoholism."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","Second, even if he does have early onset Alzheimer’s  it doesn’t mean you have a genetic risk for it."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.",Sometimes terrible things just happen.
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.",The question of a genetic test is one many people struggle with.
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.",So I can only answer for myself.
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","Personally, if I took a genetic test and it showed a genetic predisposition I would try to use that information to do all the things that have been shown to forestall the disease like cutting out sugar and taking up a second language (for instance)."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","In terms of your family, I think a good first step would be to contact the local chapter of the Alzheimer’s association."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.",You can call the 24 hour helpline at https://www.alz.org/ and they can put you in contact.
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.",One of the nice things is you can meet to talk to a social worker and they can lay out some possibilities.
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.",After that you’ll want to talk to an attorney to create a financial plan and get documents in order.
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.",You’ll have a much better idea of where you stand after that.
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","Hopefully, you can work out a plan where this will not become your full burden and responsibility."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.",The genetic component of early onset Alzheimer's is really misunderstood.
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","If your dad doesn't have a first degree relative with early onset Alzheimer's, then his case is unlikely to be of the familial type (at least, one of the currently identified familial types)."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","It could be some sporadic type, or associated with a gene not yet identified, or alcohol related, or who knows what."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","That said, diagnosing Alzheimer's based off of one MOCA assessment would be pretty difficult to do."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","Hopefully the doctors did a lot more testing than that, because there are other, more likely causes of early onset dementia besides Alzheimer's."
"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it.","In my mother's case, she had repeated neuropsychologist testing over a couple of years, several MRIs, and finally a PET scan (which pointed toward Alzheimer's and pointed away from frontotemporal dementia)."

Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,"Although I have found many interesting articles pertaining to dementia and posts regarding remote access of all kinds, I have yet to find anything which specifically answers my query below."
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,"Of course, if you can direct me to something I would be most grateful.Our Mum is 95 and her memory is diminishing day on day.She is otherwise in good health and we, as a family, are trying to allow her to keep her independence for as long as possible.We have installed 4 Nest cameras (connected via Wi-Fi to her high speed Virgin broadband router) in her flat so that five family members – across the globe - can make certain she stays safe."
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,"Although her family phone regularly, I was thinking how useful it could be if we could remotely ‘interrupt’ her TV viewing and ‘force’ a connection with some form of video chat such as Skype, Google Duo, Whatsapp, Messenger etcetera."
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,"We feel this would be helpful for her as she is finding it more and more difficult to put faces to voices and, therefore, reinforce the memories/connections of her extended family."
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,"It would also be a more effective means of reminding her to get her breakfast/lunch/tea (regarding Mum’s TV, it is quite a dated so I will be purchasing a Smart TV and advice/suggestions would also be helpful).Does anyone know of a way we could do this using an App on a mobile device?What sort of interfaces and other hardware would we be looking at?I did find this guy’s YouTube channel with his clever system of voice activated home automation utilising Broadlink RM Pro 2:https://youtu.be/DJIhEyMQ0TI but, as I say above, our family would really like to be able to access remotely via the internet.I may not be the quickest to answer your replies but do bear with me.Many thanks in advanceI'm sorry I don't know of anything but just wanted to say that I have been wondering the same thing myself."
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,We are four siblings on three continents (2 are local to our Mum) We would love a way that we could check in on her and remind her of things.
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,I have been talking to people about ideas for family members with dementia.
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,I believe there are great opportunities for app developers and entrepreneurs to come up with ideas to help.
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,Sadly our Mum has been deteriorating quickly and I'm not sure she will be in her home for much longer.
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,I must say the Nest camera system is fantastic (should be seeing it's a Google product!
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,").Obviously you'd need a strong, consistent broadband to start with."

Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,The latest camera was only installed recently as mum took a fall in her bedroom and it was only by chance one of my sisters was passing and dropped in.
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,Fortunately mum was fine.
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,She has worn a linkline pendant which is pressed in case of emergencies but nowadays she only perceives it as a thing she wears and didn't think/remember to press it for assistance.All the cameras have a 10 days video recording facility (paid for by subscription) although you don't have to have it.
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,"All have a microphone which you can talk through via the app on a phone/tablet.You can set up specific zones to be covered and set for notifications of people, movement and/or sounds.I installed 2 Nest CO/smoke alarms which can be tested via the app and will notify us if there is an issue."
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,They each have a night light which can be set to turn on if someone passes in the dark.They are ideal if anyone has a big property because if one alarm is triggered it will 'speak' to all the other alarms in the house stating which alarm was first triggered and where!If I manage to work out a system regarding the tv I'll post it ☺Thanks for your reply and hope your mum's ok. Is your mom good with technology?
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,"My mother had to get an upgraded cable system and cried because it was ""too complicated"" for her."

Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,We have one that when she yells for help it sends a text to my phone to notify me.
Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv,"Unfortunately Mum was never good with tech so, at this stage, nigh on impossible to introduce anything new."

Need to vent,Need to vent Let me know if this post doesn't belong.
Need to vent,I'm just feeling overwhelmed.My SO and I have been staying with my father in law and just started home health and home care services for him.
Need to vent,And it's rough.
Need to vent,We keep having issues with his catheter.
Need to vent,"My husband is not handling the stress of care at all; he's doing the best he can, but he's not used to taking care of people and sometimes it feels like he's someone else to take care of.I'll finally be able to get a day tomorrow and have time to myself, which has been severely lacking."
Need to vent,"The other day, I'd just had coffee made when my FIL woke up and needed help getting up and wanted me to cook breakfast."
Need to vent,Then the therapist came while I had sausage on the stove!
Need to vent,"That was actually kind of funny.I have a therapy session tomorrow, but I'll only be able to go twice a month or so."
Need to vent,We haven't heard from respite care about some time we need this weekend (we're in a wedding).
Need to vent,"It's really hard for me not to be resentful Tuesday my FIL or my husband, who ""gets"" to go to work a few days a week."
Need to vent,"And now this is starting to sound like Alexander's Horrible, Terrible, Very Bad Day, so sorry.And I'm so full of questions."
Need to vent,Can we get home care long term?
Need to vent,What happens when my SO and I are both working?
Need to vent,How can I convince my SO to seek help and where (neither of us has mental health insurance right now).Sorry for the long post.TL;DR How can I keep myself and my SO same while we take care of his father?You mention a catheter.
Need to vent,"If that is a long term solution, it probably isn't appropriate to continue home care."
Need to vent,"This person requires 24 hour, 7 day a week medical care, and it is breaking you."
Need to vent,"You ask how you can keep yourself and your SO sane while doing this, you can't."
Need to vent,"You don't want to put him in a nursing home, and he probably doesn't want to go to one."
Need to vent,But you have to consider: would he want you to ruin your lives for him?
Need to vent,Would you want your children to ruin their lives for you?
Need to vent,Hopefully he'll get the catheter out next Tuesday.
Need to vent,"If he can't, then a nursing home would be the only option."

How to respond?,"My mom is in her late 80s and is on the cusp of dementia (can live independently, but has forgotten things she once knew at an expert level, has mood swings, etc.)."
How to respond?,She has been living in a really nice retirement community for the last three months and it was her own choice to do so.
How to respond?,"Once every couple of weeks she decides she wants to go back to her house (which has been on the market for a bit and is virtually empty)or she starts feeling sorry for herself (today it was “I’ve lost everything”- untrue, as most of her nice things were moved in with her)."
How to respond?,"I sometimes go to “Now, Mom, we’re not going to go there” and get accused of being not loving."
How to respond?,"My DH & I sold our house, moved in with her and I even took early retirement so we could handle her affairs after my dad died."
How to respond?,"If I get my brother to call and check in on her, she’s all chipper and happy."
How to respond?,"DB is angry and sad that Mom decided rather suddenly to move to this place, but he offers no solutions, as he was content to leave me to deal with the day-to-day stuff."
How to respond?,He only is present for the crisis stuff and leaves as quickly as he can.
How to respond?,"My dads cousin is around and has done a lot for her, including finding her apartment and handling the house sale, so I’m not totally alone in this."
How to respond?,"But I am the recipient of her moodiness and self pity.I don’t know how to respond to this—she does depend on me for a lot of things, and I don’t really want to leave her to her own devices, but I also don’t want to have a guilt trip laid on me when my DH and I have done quite a bit for her.You could try to turn the conversation around by asking about some times or things that you know she would associate with that - try to get some reminiscing on it - like 'Wow, I remember the flowers - they were red weren't they - did you plant them?'"
How to respond?,or a remark about how much work spring cleaning was - and if you can remember a funny story about it that could be a plus.
How to respond?,The idea is that reminiscing would calm her down and distract her for a while.

Gps tracker,Gps tracker I am just wondering if anyone here could recommend a reliable non bank breaking gps locator?
Gps tracker,My mom and sister are heading away for a holiday at the end of the summer and we are looking for something to be able to locate my mom for peace of mind.
Gps tracker,"My mom doesn't use a smart phone but does use a standard one, so tracking apps installed on the phone are a no go.We use MasTrack."
Gps tracker,It has given us a piece of mind.
Gps tracker,I highly recommend checking them out.
Gps tracker,It plugs right into their car and you use the app on your phone.
Gps tracker,It’s perfect to make sure they are safe and sound.
Gps tracker,Good luck.
Gps tracker,https://www.mastrack.com/ When you say 'standard' phone - do you mean a flip phone?
Gps tracker,Because you can track a flip phone.
Gps tracker,"[deleted] Well, I have my parents on my Sprint phone plan and I can track their flip phones using the Sprint family locator app on my smart phone - for you to do that you may have to add her phone to your phone account, I don't know if you can track just anyones' phone otherwise."
Gps tracker,Check with your phone company to see what kind of deals you can get for adding a flip phone and if there are extra charges for using the locator app.
Gps tracker,"Because the phones are on my account, I could see when my father called 911 and check in on him (he forgot to pay his electric bill and the power was off - I took over paying that account as a result)."
Gps tracker,When they are living some distance away this can be a good thing.
Gps tracker,remindMe!
Gps tracker,1 week Would tile work?
Gps tracker,Tile doesn't work as a GPS locator.
Gps tracker,It connects to a phone via Bluetooth and uses the phones gps to see the last location of the tile.I would recommend that you buy the cheapest Android phone possible that uses gps.
Gps tracker,Then try life 360.
Gps tracker,Probably would be cheaper than buying a standalone GPS tracking system.
Gps tracker,You would just need to make sure the phone was on her at all times.
Gps tracker,If you find something better I would like to know as well!
Gps tracker,I've used it for my suitcase.
Gps tracker,The distance is very short where it works.
Gps tracker,"Other people can ping her location, but the volume of people that have it differs significantly internationally."
When did you know it was that time?,When did you know it was that time?
When did you know it was that time?,My sister and I are our mother's primary caregivers and we have been for about a year at this point.
When did you know it was that time?,We are both in our early 20s and we have no other family nearby.
When did you know it was that time?,She has declined fairly rapidly.
When did you know it was that time?,The other night we woke up to my mom yelling for help because she had pooped all over the floor and herself and tracked it all over the place because it was on her feet.
When did you know it was that time?,I feel like my life is on hold.
When did you know it was that time?,I haven't been able to pursue the dreams I had of traveling in my 20s or going to grad school.
When did you know it was that time?,I finally think its time for her to be placed in a home so my sister and I can start living again.When did you know it was that time?I'm in a similar situation as you!
When did you know it was that time?,My sister and I are in our mid 20s and my mom has VERY rapidly declined in the last 6 months.
When did you know it was that time?,We're trying to get finances together and we're still figuring out how  to handle things because it all happened so suddenly.
When did you know it was that time?,She lives alone in an apartment high rise and my sister and I live 7 hours away.
When did you know it was that time?,My mom has siblings in her city but they don't visit/aren't very involved.
When did you know it was that time?,My mom still wants to live alone but something happened on mother's day that made me decide that she needs to move into some type of assisted or independent living.
When did you know it was that time?,"She had a UTI (the symptoms of UTIs in dementia patients is downright SCARY, which I learned on mother's day) but no one knew she had one because she's alone, and my mom was so out of it that she didn't know to ask for help  I called her to wish a happy mother's day and I didn't know what was wrong with her at the time, but she was incoherent and unable to speak."
When did you know it was that time?,I had to call an ambulance because I have no idea what else I could do living 7 hours away.
When did you know it was that time?,I was so scared because she also has seizures and is at risk for strokes.
When did you know it was that time?,That's when I decided that it doesn't matter that she wants to stay living where she is in that city.
When did you know it was that time?,She isn't safe.
When did you know it was that time?,So I told my sister that I want my mom living in our city in a home (we're still looking at options).
When did you know it was that time?,Hopefully that will happen within the next year.
When did you know it was that time?,I went through a very similar situation with my mom as well.
When did you know it was that time?,I was living in a different state and we didn't know she had dementia.
When did you know it was that time?,She was getting worse and worse to the point where I knew SOMETHING was wrong.
When did you know it was that time?,"She continued to live on her own for a while, but I was on the phone with her everyday trying to coach her through daily tasks like putting her bicycle helmet on or changing a light bulb."
When did you know it was that time?,Eventually I knew I had to move back home to help her.
When did you know it was that time?,"While you are in the process of getting her in a home, you should look into in-home caregiving options."
When did you know it was that time?,"If she really is declining quickly and having trouble taking care of herself, it might not be safe for her to live by herself for another year."
When did you know it was that time?,"If finances are a problem, you might want to look into medicaid."
When did you know it was that time?,"I know it differs by state, but we were able to get my mom on medicaid and they pay for the in-home caregiving we currently have."
When did you know it was that time?,Yes.
When did you know it was that time?,this.
When did you know it was that time?,"In-home care is less expensive and more effective, but it takes f o r e v e r to get the state to come evaluate."
When did you know it was that time?,"Start now, before something bad happens!"
When did you know it was that time?,Thanks for that info.
When did you know it was that time?,Having covered in-home caregiving would be such a godsend.
When did you know it was that time?,I need to just suck it up and do those tasks of applying for more benefits.
When did you know it was that time?,I feel so guilty because I wish I could do more like move up to where she lives but Im going to school and have so many commitments that it would be hurting myself if I leave.
When did you know it was that time?,> she had pooped all over the floor and herself and tracked it all over the place because it was on her feetThat's a good sign it's time.When we moved MIL to long term memory care unit she had a 6 second memory.
When did you know it was that time?,She'd be in the middle of pooping and get up forgetting what she was doing.
When did you know it was that time?,Obviously diapers are now warranted so maybe you can buy some time there.
When did you know it was that time?,"But MIL was wandering around the house all night, frightened, getting into trouble... like a grown adult toddler."
When did you know it was that time?,"Needing constant supervision and > I feel like my life is on holdWe had to sleep.There were four grown adults at the time trying to care for her, we tried taking shifts."
When did you know it was that time?,It just became impossible.
When did you know it was that time?,Yeah we have been trying to make sure she wears diapers but she can be very stubborn and she makes a big fit about it every time.
When did you know it was that time?,Damn it sounds like the situation you were in was worse than my Mom right now.
When did you know it was that time?,She sleeps through the night 99% of the time.
When did you know it was that time?,"But she's definitely getting worse and worse...Now when she goes to the bathroom, she just sits down on the toilet with her diaper still on, and just pees into the diaper...."
When did you know it was that time?,I keep telling her she can just take the diaper off to pee and that the diaper is just in case she has an accident... but she doesn't seem to get it.
When did you know it was that time?,UGHHHHH
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"Son living away from father with congestive heart failure Can you recommend a good app/tool/system for  helping a person with congestive heart failure monitor their symptoms on an ongoing basis and for a caregiver to monitor their progress?For context: my father, 67, recently experienced heart failure that doctors say was brought on by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (read: no blockages or cholesterol problems)."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"His cardiologist instructed him to monitor his weight, fluid and sodium intake daily."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"He's done a great job of tracking so far, but he's using pen and paper which I fear he could lose."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"Using pen and paper also makes it difficult for his doctors, my family and I to monitor and support him in his efforts from afar.This Sunday, I'll be leaving my dad (he lives on the East Coast, U.S.) to return to the West Coast (U.S.), where I  live ."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"Before then, I to make sure we have a dependable system in place and figure someone here might have gone through something similar and has advice to offer.Some more details about everything below, but if any more information would be helpful please please ask Sorry this got so long...I am looking for something that will:1) Help the **patient** (my dad) easily log their weight, sodium intake and fluid intake, daily2) Allow the **caregiver** (me) to monitor the patient's logs in real-time3) Prominently display the **patient's** weight, fluid and sodium intakes in the appThus far, it seems diet and weight tracking apps are best suited to accommodate the workflows we're after."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"And of the  apps we've looked at, MyFitnessPal and LoseIt!"
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"are top for they both allow for weight, fluid and sodium intake logging."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"However, they  feel quite bloated and neither allow you to include fluids in your primary goal tracking dashboard among other things.What about just setting up a shared Google spreadsheet?"
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,You can put a shortcut to it right on the screen of his phone (at least in Android - not sure about Apple?).
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"You can do stuff with autoformatting to highlight cells where any particular figure is way high (or low) that would let you see in a glance if there's a problem.Something else I'm really a fan of is Alexa devices - get a pair of Amazon Echo Spots, one for each of you."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"That allows you to ""drop in"" on him any time you want to check in on him."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"A lot of people are stressing about privacy and all that, and I get that - but for a caregiver that's not on-site, they are a godsend."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"Your dad doesn't have to do anything - you tell your Spot to drop in on him, and it automatically connects and you get a view of wherever you've got it set up."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"If you put it someplace central, he/you can even hear from pretty much anywhere nearby.Hope that helps - good luck to you both!"
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,Woah.
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"This is the first I've heard of the ""drop in"" feature...super neat.As for Google Sheets, auto-formatting is a wonderful idea."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"And in case you were curious, you can set a shortcut on iOS :)For now, we've been using Apple's Notes app for sodium and fluid tracking."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,It's worked well in so far as he's  comfortable with the app and it does collaboration relatively well.
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"IMO, there are obvious shortcomings, but as I'm coming to learn, whatever helps keep up his habit works for me.We did however order a wifi scale , so we'll see how that works."
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,Thank you for your thought :)

Useful new tech for Alzheimers patients and their caregivers?,"I set up the Google Home for my parents and they now constantly have classical music playing in the background, I think it really does set a peaceful tone that everything else stems from.I made it a priority after learning that music can reach a part of the brain that disease effects, touching memories otherwise not accessible - sure enough, while she has trouble remembering most things she still knows all the lyrics to her favorite songs!"

OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I need to vent!
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I initially wrote this to ask Crohn’s sufferers how to handle issues with my newly diagnosed son of 22 yrs old... but I have MS and am caught in a family drama with my son & husband.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I am new to Reddit & didn’t know where I should seek support...
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I decided to post in here instead of directly on the Crohn’s forum.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"Here are my issues, and I am shaking with so many emotions."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I don’t know if I’m angry with my husband, my son, MYSELF, or just plain confused and hurt."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I am desperately seeking advice:Dear Crohn sufferers.I first want to say how helpless, horrible & guilty I feel about passing on this crappy set of genes to my (almost) 22 year-old son... his father’s family may have had something to do with it, too, because there have been some similar symptoms on that side of the family, as well."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,But who knows?!
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"Regardless of who, how, why:  It is what it is, and nobody deserves this insidious disease."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I feel so terrible that anyone suffers with this disease or ANY disease for that matter.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,It’s NOT fair.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,It’s difficult.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,It’s scary.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"And it’s definitely NOT fun, either... My son has explained quite a lot to me about this life-long, chronic disease."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"He was recently dxd with it about a year ago, and we are all trying to learn about the do’s and don’ts... we are all TRYING to educate ourselves, too... as well as TRYING to comfort & console him."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"He helps me, too, while trying to deal with his Crohn’s."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I love, appreciate and admire him..."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,But his bad days are so difficult to handle.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"Heck, it’s over my pay grade, so to speak."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I’m a mother.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I’m not a doctor, scientist or a specialist.Secondly, I’d like to add that as a mother who was dxd with Multiple Sclerosis ~eleven years ago... I’m fighting my own battle, along with his battle."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I’m managing my symptoms and I’m doing my best to help him.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"Our diseases are VERY different, I’m learning, but a few things are the same or at least similar:  We BOTH need support systems, and both diseases encounter fatigue and have horrible reactions to stress."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"We both need to make choices about how to spend our limited energy during the course of a day; And we both deal with the frustration of having to educate & re-educate even the closest of family members & friends, over and over again."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"It was one thing when it was just me with a chronic illness, but it’s downright overwhelming for me worrying about my son’s pain, too."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Any mother understands that you’re only as happy as your saddest child.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"Therefore, I can’t imagine how my son feels at this young of an age... my heart aches for him..."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I was 40 when I was dxd.Getting to the point...
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I am the mom, and I need to know how to balance both of our diseases without arguing and defending myself constantly as he plays the blame-game with me."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"And yes, he HAS come right out and blamed me for his “bad genes.”  Can any of you give me advice as to how I should speak to my son without offending him?"
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"From my point of view, I’m listening and trying to comprehend everything he’s explaining to me — with his precise & medically technical approach — to the best of my ability... and often late at night he decides that he wants to talk about it..."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I have no problem listening, talking & answering his questions... if he didn’t have such a hair-trigger temper as I’m trying to comprehend the barrage of information, discussions and questions he’s throwing at me at 1, 2, 3, 4am, etc."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"This last episode, I kept telling him that I didn’t know the answer to his specific questions over & over the other night."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,He kept badgering me about it & I felt trapped in my own kitchen with him when he wouldn’t let the topic go.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,My feet were swollen and I just needed to sit down.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I found out later that I didn’t know the answer, because I was in the hospital during the time in question with a broken back and wasn’t even involved in this particular fixation he had that night."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,But he kept on and on and on all night long.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I finally had to yell at him to go to bed & stop being mean to me.I TRY VERY HARD to be extremely supportive of whatever he needs... emotionally, food-wise, medicine-wise, etc."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"But like him... I’m trying to handle my own disease as well as trying to be supportive with his disease... and also convince other family members of both of our special needs... why he needs certain foods, etc., and why I need the air conditioner set at a certain temperature so that the messages can be sent from my brain to my limbs in order for them to work."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,They’re both invisible diseases that most people don’t completely understand..
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,He perceives everything I say in response to his explanations as me being a know-it-all; argumentative; and he goes off on me all the time... zero-60... (he says I do the same to him).
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I am willing and WANTING to talk with him, listen to him, learn with him... most times."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"However, since he calls me names and says I’m “lazy” & that “life is better without me,” etc., WHILE I’m listening or responding to him and trying to understand his questions, fears and frustrations... I’m feeling so physically & mentally drained... and frankly, verbally abused, that it’s not easy to be there for him."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"It’s hard to hug a porcupine, so to speak, and want to come back for more."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Yet I do come back and keep trying... as does he... but we wind up escalating each time.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"He judges the medication I take when I don’t answer him in the way he wishes me to do, but expects me to tolerate his own method of pain relief (which I do)... and then his dad walks in during the worst of times... always... and then he’s involved."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"His dad then pours his nightcap... and then takes his side and walks out angry for the night, leaving me thinking, what the hell just happened?"
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"How does my listening and attempting to answer his questions when he engages the discussion, turn into ME being the sole, causative factor for everyone’s upset?"
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,My husband/his dad wasn’t even around for the FIVE OR MORE CALM RESPONSES before I’d had enough and rose my voice to match his.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"(Which I’m accountable for my piece, but don’t feel that I should be talked to so disrespectfully from anyone I’m trying to help, let alone my own son in my own house."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,")So, is this how everyone is treating their well-meaning loved ones?"
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I’m not asking in a snappy way, I promise..."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I know with MS, for me, I had a LOT of misfirings, feelings that I can only describe as electrical shock, pain and confusion during my flares... especially during my initial diagnoses..."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I spoke backwards & was temporarily paralyzed on my entire right side & wasn’t exactly jumping for joy about my disease.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I’ve had plenty of broken bones and absolutely had my cranky days.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,But I was very positive and appreciative of anyone helping me on most days... and I’d have NEVER even thought to blame my parents for bad genes or tell them they were useless & lazy... and that nobody wants them in the house.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I think my dad might have thrown me across the room or out of the house, had I talked to my mom that way under ANY circumstance... disease or no disease!"
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"So, I’m genuinely wondering if this is a Crohn’s symptom or just plain frustration on his part?"
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I do not have Crohn’s, and I don’t ever claim to know exactly what he is going through."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"He says that I never help him one day... and the next day, I’m his best friend and the ONLY ONE who bothers to understand and talk to him."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"He says he needs me to talk with him, then during the same conversation, he says he hates talking to me and says how worthless I am to the family."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"He is sending out so many mixed messages... loves me, hates me."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"Talk, don’t talk."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"Best friend, worthless."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,It’s exhausting.Sorry so long...
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I know you are all suffering from Crohn’s and seeking support.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,As a parent and a fellow member of the “silent disease” club...
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I WANT to know what I can actually do differently or better to help my son without always setting him off.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I feel like I’m walking on eggshells or glass, and we are both getting so upset, stressed and fatigued as a result of our encounters."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"And frankly, I’m not going to accept being continually demeaned anymore by someone I’m trying to help, unless this is a symptom that will pass once the meds start to work."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Having a disease does not give a person a license to be an asshole indefinitely to others.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,It will take me two days to recover my own emotions from being verbally hammered all night long.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"After the long night & zero sleep, I tried to find my husband to talk to and found instead, four bedrooms that someone had left like a hurricane hit."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"Then I get wound up again because I have zero energy left to figure out what happened, by whom and why."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I see broken items of sentimental value and broken items all over the place and can’t figure out why everything is spinning out of control.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"With my lack of sleep, I’m not able to think straight anymore, which in turn, makes everyone angry at me again."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,My husband and son literally left me and have been gone two days now...
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Happy Mother’s Day!
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"Such a low blow, I believe."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,How do other families handle these issues?
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Does one person run the show?
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"Does the newest sick person get to say how much more their disease is debilitating than yours, like it’s a contest?Being a family member with a chronic illness IS tough, someone said in this forum."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"It’s especially tough if two of the three family members in the household have these chronic issues, and the healthiest of the three won’t help de-escalate a situation... in fact, it makes it worse for the family... we should all be helping each other as a team, right?"
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"Two in distress... one gives an assist, knowing that you’ll get the assist when you need it, too?"
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Be the hero of the family team to get the family team back on track?
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I don’t like this whole take this side or that side... we are ALL escalating issues and not solving a darn thing, so there’s always one family member on the out."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"Nobody is working as a team over here... but in my opinion, if it comes down to utter disrespect... my husband ought to sit my son down and tell him not to talk to his mother like that under any circumstances."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Right?
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Wrong?
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,It’s like the tail is wagging the dog over here.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Am I being too self-righteous?
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I just don’t know anymore.Any suggestions as to what I can do to make things better for him, short of having to endure being verbally demeaned?"
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Or advice for my husband as to how he can help in an effective way for the benefit of every member of the family when there is discord in the house?
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,And are my son’s responses to me typical of a Crohn’s patient in a flare?
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"I’m the go-to person for so many friends & family members, but I can’t seem to get it right in my own household with the people I love the most.Thank you for reading."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I apologize if this is not the appropriate place for a family member to purge frustrations or seek advice/answers.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I’m hoping that the best people to ask are those who have the same disease.Disclaimer: I don’t have your disease or your son’s and this may sound simplistic but —Family Counseling!
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Someone to help defuse the high emotions and help with communication skills?
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,You sound so overloaded and I am sorry you are having such a difficult day.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I am primary caregiver for a son with leukemia and it’s hard work to love someone so much and see them suffer.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Absolutely in that boat with you.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I hope things improve for you.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Perhaps your son would be supported by being in communication with others with his disease.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I didn’t know there was a subreddit for individual diseases.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Hang tough.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I wish I could say it gets better but I do think that handling it gets better with time.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Take care of you.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,I second the suggestion for family counseling.
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,"It sounds like it might be difficult to figure out what parts of the emotions from everyone are the medical issues; and what parts are genuine, real, valid responses to being dealt a tough hand in life--emotions which have not yet found a proper ""home,"" if that makes sense."
OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY!,Sending virtual hugs to all.

i just need to get this out of my system,I completely understand and resonate with the things you're going through because of the dementia in your family.
i just need to get this out of my system,"I have gone through a similar ordeal, and it took me a great while to find peace with myself and how to handle the dementia with my father, which has torn apart his life and much of our family.The most important discovery for me was understanding that none of this is my father's fault and most of the fears, aggravation, embarrassment, frustrations, disappointments, and so-forth are directly under my control."
i just need to get this out of my system,"Moreover, I realized that I was letting the issues this generated within myself and our family negatively affect my relationship with and how I treated my father.I could write about this much more at length, but I just want to point out a few things, even though they may be trite by some standards (it's hard to know where anyone is when it comes to how we view dementia, especially when it is within our close family) and sorry if I am too abrupt or frank:1."

i just need to get this out of my system,Why should what someone else thinks about your father having dementia affect you in any way?
i just need to get this out of my system,"As it is, most people don't understand and make light of dementia as much as people do the same with, say, misunderstood mental illness."
i just need to get this out of my system,"People can think of those with Dementia (as well as the family for the changes they make to accommodate it) as just plain weird.That's just people reacting to anything different in a negative manner, and there is a lot of people that will tell you what you ""should"" do."
i just need to get this out of my system,"A true friend (to you, your family, and your Dad) would jump right in with a positive attitude even if it is a little awkward at first."
i just need to get this out of my system,"Sometimes people reflect off of our attitudes as well -- in other words, my advice is to not worry about what people think and they will get strength from you to be your friend."
i just need to get this out of my system,"If not, then forget them anyway.2."
i just need to get this out of my system,Not visiting your grandparents because the place smells like urine.
i just need to get this out of my system,"I don't want to be too forward here, but this does hit me at home a little bit, with my father being in a nursing home where I constantly have to smell many similar things, if not worse, on a regular basis.Why not visit your grandparents because you're uncomfortable?"
i just need to get this out of my system,Think of how they feel being in a place like that.
i just need to get this out of my system,"Nursing homes can be awful places, especially for those that cannot help with their own personal grooming and other habits, as they also lose their voice to make changes."
i just need to get this out of my system,"I don't know what your grandparent's situation is in terms of possibly taking them outside, or opening a window for a while, etc."
i just need to get this out of my system,"Whatever their status is, visiting would make their lives better, which makes it more about them -- which, in turn, does come back to make it about you and feeling good for helping someone else out.3."
i just need to get this out of my system,Enjoy what you have now.
i just need to get this out of my system,My father is not the same person he was a few years ago.
i just need to get this out of my system,"It took me a long time to figure out that the real person is still in there, with the same feelings, plus a whole lot more -- he is much more like a child and needs to be taken care of as such."
i just need to get this out of my system,"However, that has allowed me to form a new relationship."
i just need to get this out of my system,"In many ways, our roles have reversed and I act like his parent -- he calls me his father every once in a while."
i just need to get this out of my system,"Sometimes he thinks I'm his brother, or my brother."
i just need to get this out of my system,"However, even when he does mistake me for someone else, it is clear the feeling of family and that a ""I like this person being here"" mentality is still there."
i just need to get this out of my system,"Just because he may forget who I am doesn't diminish the value of our relationship, or my desire to help him have a higher quality of life.4."
i just need to get this out of my system,Constantly look for new avenues.
i just need to get this out of my system,"We often hear a lot of stories about people with dementia -- screaming, agitation, blank stares, etc."
i just need to get this out of my system,"This does happen and, in many cases, there is not much you can do about it as it is a genuine cognitive breakdown."
i just need to get this out of my system,"However, it's amazing what little changes can do."
i just need to get this out of my system,"For example, there is one case where a women was completely upset and agitated when her family changed her clothes."
i just need to get this out of my system,"Well, you have to change someone's clothes, so what could they do?"
i just need to get this out of my system,"it took a while, but they realized it was because it was different clothes."
i just need to get this out of my system,"As soon as they realized that they just needed a few separate sets of the same exact clothes, everything was fine."
i just need to get this out of my system,"In my Dad's case, he was getting very upset at staff in the nursing home."
i just need to get this out of my system,"I like the staff in this nursing home, but they do need much better training."
i just need to get this out of my system,"I finally realized it was because they were pulling a curtain behind him unannounced, which triggered him (this is classic Dementia behavior, by the way)."
i just need to get this out of my system,"Once I was able to convince the staff to not walk behind my father without announcing themselves, things were much better.5."
i just need to get this out of my system,Listen.
i just need to get this out of my system,"The issue with the people walking behind my father was one of 50+ things we discovered over time (like making sure the tv stayed on CNN at all times, or leaving the light on, or closing the curtains, etc."
i just need to get this out of my system,etc.).
i just need to get this out of my system,"This is the way it is with Dementia, and the smallest thing (like a stuffed animal, for some) can make a night-and-day difference in how they feel and how they relate to others."
i just need to get this out of my system,"Some of it is obvious (look up triggers for dementia, for example), while others take a lot of listening.6."
i just need to get this out of my system,It's their universe; learn how to listen.
i just need to get this out of my system,"This was probably the hardest part of understanding that I was placing my view of the way things should be on my father, which was simultaneously not helping him and causing me to be upset and frustrated."
i just need to get this out of my system,Things that seemed painfully obvious wouldn't work.
i just need to get this out of my system,I needed to learn to listen and understand how he relates to his world (a subject that needs a lot more writing space).
i just need to get this out of my system,"Once I did that, things became much easier."
i just need to get this out of my system,"I've been much more at peace with things, and my father has a much better quality of life.Don't get me wrong -- his life is still awful and Dementia is such a scourge."
i just need to get this out of my system,"However, is life is 10 times better with the efforts in understanding what works for him and letting go of any expectations on who and what he should be that we once had.Anyway, I just thought I'd throw some thoughts out there."
i just need to get this out of my system,"I guess my basic message is that, while Dementia is horrible and a strain on the family, there are ways to deal with it that can make it so much better for many with Dementia, and much easier on the family taking care of them.I think the idea (from other people) of a support group is great!"
i just need to get this out of my system,Being able to talk to others with the same situation makes our seem so much easier to handle -- and definitely a little less lost.

Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation My mother-in-law has been declining with worsening memory loss, confabulation, cognitive function loss, and worsening self care in a dramatic way for 2-3 years."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She has three sons.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,One of them has been aware of the situation and trying to help for a long time.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"He recently said she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's more than ten years ago, before her husband died."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"At that time, they set up a living trust and POA papers, but the rest of the family were not told about the diagnosis."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"My fil passed away, and mil has been on her own for seven years."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"She has steadfastly denied anything was wrong with her and refused any and all help, even minor, common sense measures."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She has poisoned family relationships through paranoid/confabulated stories of abuse.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"She speaks negatively of all family members behind their backs, and this has poisoned family relationships because people have believed her stories rather than talking to each other.She hasn't been able to manage her own medications consistently for several years."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Last year, I took initiative and with her permission and cooperation, I found her an automated medication dispenser."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She paid for it with her own credit card and agreed to use it.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"I also went with her to a doctor's appointment, with her permission, after I talked to her about concerns about her memory and she agreed she shared the same concerns."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"At the appointment, we saw a PA who confronted me about why I was there, told my mil she ""didn't need anyone to go to appointments with her"" and gave a mini-mental status exam that I'm pretty sure she assisted mil to pass."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Then declared her as having ""only normal age-related memory loss."""
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"At this time, I didn't know about the longstanding Alzheimer's diagnosis and neither did that medical practice."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She ended up putting the medication dispenser somewhere and forgetting it existed.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"A couple months later, my husband pulled it out from under a desk and she was shocked."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Didn't recognize it.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Had never seen such a thing.Each time a family member has tried to get involved in her care, mil has initially been receptive, and then refused to share information about her appointments and removed any information releases she had previously signed so we could not know anything about her health care."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"She had breast cancer and was going to all of her appointments alone, refusing help, unable and/or unwilling to tell us what treatments she was receiving, what her prognosis was, or anything."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She could not tell us anything about her many health problems.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She has insisted some of her doctors came into the exam room and sat silently staring at her before leaving without a word.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She has not been compliant with her meds.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She is prescribed many medications.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She does not take them on schedule and sometimes takes too many.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Until last fall she was still driving.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She only lost her license because I called and reported her to the DMV.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"She failed the road test abysmally, but thinks she was done wrong and had her license revoked unfairly."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Now she has had an incident where she locked herself out of the house and spent 24-hours outdoors before anyone missed her.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She lives way out in the country on her own and has repeatedly said she would rather die than move OR have any professionals come into the home to help her.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Her doctor ordered a visiting nurse and she refused the service.We are the long distance family.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,The two local sons are not dealing well with the situation.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,One knew about the dementia and has been trying to help for years.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,His reward for all of his effort was for mil to tell everyone that he's been trying to put her in a nursing home and steal her property.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,The other son has been in total denial and has avoided the situation until recently.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Now he's jumped in and is taking her to doctor's appointments, which is great, but is also actively getting in the way and raging out regularly."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,He is still in denial about the dementia and thinks she ought to be living on her own and STILL DRIVING.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,He recently threw a fit because his wife told him I was the one who reported her to the DMV.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,He confronted my husband about it and ended up punching a wall.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,He also got in an argument with his mother and pulled back a fist to punch her.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"My husband had to jump in between them, and he put down his hand, but it's really got us shook up."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,I have no regrets about reporting her to the DMV.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,The idea of her behind the wheel of a vehicle is terrifying.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,We finally found the living trust and DPOA paperwork after searching the house for over a year.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,(Her paperwork is a mess--she hasn't paid her taxes yet and we have no idea what's happening with her bills).
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,But these documents require all the brothers to cooperate and that is not happening.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"The ragey brother goes to her doctor's appointments with her, he is making medical decisions for her via bullying--not the DPOA that she and her husband prepared when she was still competent--and he is making financial decisions for her."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,He is refusing care on her behalf as doctors and social workers are increasingly attempting to intervene.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"The burned out apathetic brother is not participating because he is stressed out and thinks his dead father meant for him to be in charge of everything, even though the paperwork has all three names on it.We have consulted our own lawyer and are trying to find our way through this mess."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,It's beyond frustrating and heartbreaking.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"We know now that the years of conflict in the family have been created by the mother's paranoia and confabulations--every time something happened that upset her, she would blame somebody and make up a wild story about why they were at fault."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Until recently, her stories were mostly plausible."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,It's very difficult to navigate all of the hurt feelings and damaged relationships.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Most of us understand now that it was never personal, but ragey brother is causing a lot of problems with his behaviors."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,He also packs a pistol everywhere he goes and has bragged about brandishing it in order to intimidate others.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"He's never pulled his gun on us yet, but obviously the fact that he's showing up armed to family discussions and raging out is making it difficult to advocate for his mother in the face of his bad decisions, gatekeeping, and poor understanding of her limitations."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Rage bro is also lecturing her and trying to train her to stop her dementia behaviors.She's not safe in the house.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,There's nothing keeping her from getting locked out again.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"She has free access to a stove, many appliances, stairs, bathrooms, etc."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,where she could get hurt.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,And she's making a mess of her medications.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"She is due to finally get a neuropsych eval in May, but her condition is obvious and every doctor she's seen lately has acknowledged she obviously has dementia."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Rage bro and his wife are still hanging on that evaluation, though, and are holding up addressing her safety needs until they get their ""proof."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"""I think we're doing everything we can."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,It's a nightmare.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"We spent last weekend with her after she had some teeth pulled, and then we had to just leave her home alone, where she is clearly not safe, because the local brothers think that's ok."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Rage bro bought her a medical alert device from Walmart, but we're expecting about the same success with that as the medication dispenser."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"She's insulted by the idea of it, and it needs daily charging, as well as her to cooperate with wearing it and remember to wear it.Has anyone else been through this?"
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Any thoughts?Well, that sounds like hell."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Sorry you're going through this!
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,It sounds like you are doing all you can.Are there neighbors you can ask to keep an eye out?
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,We asked the longtime neighbors of my grandma to keep an eye on her and let us know if something seemed wrong.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,This was when we started getting nervous about her being by herself and she of course was refusing help.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"She was in early stages at this point, and we had no idea."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,One would run the car which she no longer used and chatted with her once in a while.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"The other would drop by for a chat, cup of tea, or to retrieve a ball one of the kids had thrown over the fence."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"If she's really rural, that might not work."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Is she religious?
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Ask a pastor or priest to drop by.You can try calling APS to see if they can help start a fire under peoples butts.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Can you get your lawyer to explain to Ragey about liability from grandma?
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Or can you call a doctor and ask him to lecture Ragey about it next time they go for a visit.Call the cops and let them know that grandma is having issues.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,At my local dept families could send in a picture and info about vulnerable adults.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Anytime a call came in from that address the cops could pull it up and see what was going on.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Cops could call family members about what was going on with the vulnerable adult.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,My dept also has the RUOK program which is an auto call system that calls seniors every morning and sends out an officer if there is no response.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Limited use in keeping her safe, but at least someone would come in the morning.Can you have someone install an auto shutoff for the stove?"
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She doesn't have very many neighbors and the situation is beyond what an occasional check in would solve.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"She needs someone to dispense meds three times a day, for example."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,I'm not sure any kind of reasoning would help with Ragey.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,At this point I feel like he's going to either come to acceptance in his time or not.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"He got a 45 minute lecture from a social worker, and that hasn't changed anything that I can see."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Our hands are tied right now from speaking with her doctors because there's no information release or medical DPOA on file.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"My husband has one, but it needs to be signed by all three brothers to execute, we think."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,We're asking our lawyer if only one brother can sign and use it.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"People are calling her every day, so that's covered."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"I'm not sure what an auto shutoff for the stove is, but we could look into that."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Thank you!
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Your story and my story have some similar elements.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,My MIL has an undiagnosed mental illness that she’s had her whole life (probably a personality disorder.)
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"She was diagnosed with “mild dementia” about 5 years ago, but to us it was just a continuation of what has been going on her whole life, just with more confusion."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She also talks badly about whoever just left the room.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She has played my husband and his two sisters against each other their whole lives.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"His youngest sister has always been their mother’s enabler, and helped her hide her obvious mental illness and villified anyone who dared point it out, no matter how kind the approach and intention.We are also the long distance family members, with my husband’s two sisters nearby their mom."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"We had financial POA for years, and I managed to get things straightened out and even got her approved for Medicaid which got her some home care and eventually covered her nursing home costs."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Her condition has definitely worsened over the years, mostly because my husband’s enabling sister has Medical Proxy, and won’t let them give her any neuro-psych meds or be seen by that doctor."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She’s showing signs of increasing frontotemporal dementia: getting aggressive and being sexually inappropriate.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,She also wets her bed every night and refuses to let them change the sheets until the next day.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Still, my husband’s sister swears it’s not the dementia and that she’s just unhappy in the nursing home."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"So, out of the blue, his sister has a lawyer draw up a new POA that put her in charge, and their mom told us (after whispering that she’s not supposed to tell us) that his sister is working on getting an apartment for the two of them to live in together."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Oh...did I mention that his sister has MS and is disabled and needs daily care herself?Yeah, so basically it’s a shit show, and we have no power to do anything anymore, and now his mother tells us to f-ck off when we talk to her on the phone and tells my husband I’m a b-tch and he never should have married me."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,We had a very good relationship for many years (I’ve been with my husband 18 years.)
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Now she blames me for everything that goes wrong.The only advice I have for you, is to think about getting guardianship of your MIL."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Bring whatever evidence you have to court that your husband’s brothers are neglecting her needs.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Or, you can do what we have done, which is to let them have their dysfunctional mess, and get your own therapy to deal with the pain of watching it all happen."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"If your husband’s family is anything like my husband’s family, they will find a way to ruin you if you try to take control."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"For us, it was too big of a chance to take."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"It is extremely painful, though, for my husband and I to watch, and we try to offer whatever comfort we can to her that she will accept."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"You could also call adult protective services anonymously, but you’ll have to weigh that with the possibility that they might know it was you because of your previous action with her driver’s license.Whatever you choose, know that I am with you in spirit, and wishing for the peace and safety of all of the family members involved."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Oh that sounds miserable and pretty similar.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"MIL does not have a personality disorder, but has had untreated depression her whole life."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Before the dementia, she was kind and generous and if she gossiped some, she also tried to speak well of others and build relationships."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Looking back, we can kind of see where the paranoia kicked in with various conflicts with extended family, communication breaking down, etc."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,We have been going back and forth between calling APS and petitioning for guardianship.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Guardianship is hard for us because we'd have to move her to a facility in our town, and that would effectively cut her off from the rest of her family, friends, and everyone she ever knew."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,That's not something we want to do to her.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"APS is a hard choice for us because we feel responsible for her, so it's like we're calling APS on ourselves, you know?"
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Like, if we feel so concerned about her wellbeing, then we should go to court and do what is needed to take care of her."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,But then we come full circle to the problem of moving her away from the rest of the family.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,I'm also not sure APS would be at all helpful.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"In the past few years, I've tried getting help from child protective services twice for children I know that are being neglected, and CPS did nothing."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Thank you for the support.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,APS is limited in what it can do.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"If your MIL basically tells them she’s fine and to bug off, there’s not much they can do (without a court order.)"
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,I’m not sure what it would take to raise things to that level.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"If rage brother is the caretaker, you’d be calling them to investigate whether he is being abusive, not on yourselves."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,It’s different than CPS.We had the same concern about moving my MIL closer to us (and also my FIL who is mostly recovered from a stroke but lives in a different nursing home.)
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,It’s a difficult decision to weigh the pros against the cons.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Just make sure you’re not opening yourself up to the threat of violence against you from other family members.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"Are there some kind of assets/inheritance that are involved, that is making the rage brother be so protective?"
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"The very ironic thing is that there are assets, but rage brother doesn't seem to know about them."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"He's been preoccupied with ownership of minor, nearly worthless belongings on the property, like an old fishing boat that's probably not even worth $1000."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,But when she passes he's likely to inherit several hundred thousand dollars.
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"There's lots of odd concern by both of the local brothers about her not being able to afford care, etc., as if she is poor, or as if her only asset is the house."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"She is quite well off, though."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,"I think for some reason they trusted us to talk about finances, but did not discuss it with the others."
Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation,Possibly because we have done well for ourselves and never asked them for financial help.
Looking for input for School Project,"Looking for input for School Project Hi everyone,I am currently an engineering student in University and would like to seek the inputs of everyone regarding a project I am working on."

Nighttime urination help,Nighttime urination help My grandfather is immobile without help from caretakers and has been using a urination contraption (I don't know what it's properly called) so he can pee in the middle of the night without waking someone up to help him.
Nighttime urination help,The urination contraption he uses now is apparently difficult to handle and he spills pee all over his bed and we've been having to change his sheets nearly every day because of this.
Nighttime urination help,"I'm wondering what other devices there are to help, because I'm at my wit's end with everything in the house smelling like piss between this poor man and our cats acting out.Depends, adult diapers."
Nighttime urination help,Sometimes it takes 2.
Nighttime urination help,"And if he insists on taking diapers off, as my mom did, the next step could be onsie pajamas put on backwards so he can't unbutton or unzip them (tho you'd have to redo the neckline so it's comfortable for him)."
Nighttime urination help,"You'll know better than I though, whether the time has come to use onsies or not :) There are things called “condom catheters” that could be of help."
Nighttime urination help,They are not a true catheter as they do not insert into the urethra.
Nighttime urination help,Instead they have a thick condom with a tube coming out of it.
Nighttime urination help,This tube leads to a catheter bag.
Nighttime urination help,He will need to see a urologist to see if these are appropriate for him.

Nighttime urination help,"You might notice if your stream changed overnight, but over years it just seems normal."
Nighttime urination help,The bladder gets used to not being emptied and begins to stop reporting its fullness properly.
Nighttime urination help,"This all adds up to nighttime bathroom visits, accidents etc."
Nighttime urination help,it’s possible that his urologist might prescribe a traditional catheter to be used before bed or a minimally invasive procedure to remove some of the obstruction.
Nighttime urination help,"These may seem unnecessary, but they could drastically improve his life."
Nighttime urination help,"Between these options, depends, disposable and washable chucks you should be able to find something that will help."

Ideas for Caregiving 'Life Hacks'?,If I'm not feeling well enough to talk I can type and show it to someone.
Ideas for Caregiving 'Life Hacks'?,"There's a whole rabbit hole of adaptive technology as well that I'm not sure you want to go down, but I wonder if you might just bring into your talk ways that technology can be used to welcome the person being cared for into the process of caregiving Thanks for the feeedback!"

What's Coming,"What's Coming Not a caregiver, but I could really use some advice on how my family can deal with the issues caused by my great aunt and uncle right now (both in their mid-80s).Just a quick background: my parents, sisters, and I are the only family my aunt and uncle have, we all live 1+ hour driving time (one way) from their house, and obviously we love both of them very dearly.My aunt and uncle have each had their health problems over the years, but we are now at the point of no return."
What's Coming,"My uncle can no longer take care of himself, and even though he knows it, he refuses all help unless it's coming from my aunt."
What's Coming,"That last part might sound like a good thing, but it's not."
What's Coming,"My aunt is not capable of taking care of him for a variety of reasons, with the most difficult being that she refuses to see the reality of the situation."
What's Coming,"I cannot imagine the pain she has endured watching my uncle deteriorate the way that he has, and I understand that she is being faced with some unbearably hard truths, but that does not change the fact that she is allowing (and a lot of times forcing) my uncle to put himself in dangerous positions."
What's Coming,She will still send him to get something from their basement even though he's had trouble keeping his balance lately.
What's Coming,She asks him to fix stuff around the house even though he loses track of what he's doing and makes things worse.
What's Coming,"The most extreme example I have, which I only mention to show the gravity of this situation, is her letting my uncle lie face down on the floor for hours after having a stroke because she ""thought he was sleeping"".I feel like normally my family would be in a good position because my aunt and uncle are very well off financially and could afford any type of help they needed, but both of them refuse to acknowledge that it's necessary."
What's Coming,"We have tried everything we could think of at this point, but it wasn't much."
What's Coming,"My parents have more or less given up because they've tried things over the years (begged my aunt and uncle to move closer to us, spoke with them about independent living and assisted living facilities, etc.)"
What's Coming,and nothing has worked.
What's Coming,"They also say that we cannot force them to do anything they don't want to do, and that they don't want to anger them and ruin the time we all have left together."
What's Coming,"I went over to their house recently and had a heart-to-heart with my aunt (told her how sorry I was for what she is going through, told her my perspective, offered my help) but that didn't lead anywhere either."
What's Coming,"If I was able, I would be their live-in caregiver in a heartbeat."
What's Coming,Anyone in my family would do that.
What's Coming,"Unfortunately, we all have full-time jobs or are full-time students, and it wouldn't matter anyway because my aunt and uncle wouldn't want that."
What's Coming,"I just don't know what to do about what's coming...my uncle isn't going to get better, and I'm afraid he will die in terrible accident around the house, which my aunt will have to witness, if my family doesn't do something."
What's Coming,But what can we do?
What's Coming,"Edit: In my rant I forgot to mention that my uncle has recently been diagnosed with dementia (though we've suspected it for years)In my experience, it has to be their idea to get help."
What's Coming,They fear losing control and so hold onto it fiercely.
What's Coming,All you can do is to keep gently nudging them to accept help.
What's Coming,Usually the elderly don't want to accept help because they don't want to be a burden on others.
What's Coming,What they don't understand is that by refusing help they are a bigger burden.
What's Coming,"There are lots of in home services like Home Instead, Visiting Angels, etc."
What's Coming,"There is also a referral service called ""A Place for Mom"", you tell them what you are looking for and they'll have the right people get in touch with you."
What's Coming,Also check into your Area Wide Aging Agency.
What's Coming,They also have loads of information.
What's Coming,"Thank you very much for your reply, color_me_curious."
What's Coming,"Over the weekend, my aunt told us that she bought Life Alert for my uncle."
What's Coming,"I don't think it will do much good, but it's something."
What's Coming,I will look into the services you mentioned and see what I can find.

App or device for dementia caregivers,App or device for dementia caregivers Attention dementia caregivers!
App or device for dementia caregivers,I’m participating in a Brain Health Hackathon where students design technology to assist people with dementia.
App or device for dementia caregivers,My team is currently brainstorming ideas and would love your input.
App or device for dementia caregivers,What problems do you have in caregiving that an app or device could address?
App or device for dementia caregivers,"My mother was placed in a care home last year and it was a difficult transition for everybody.In order to help curb her agitation episodes I bought an Amazon Fire tablet and created a kids profile (look up 'FreeTime Unlimited') and made it so the only 3 buttons on the home page are for a Photo Viewer, Video Viewer and Facebook Messenger Kids (a facetime app that only allows calls / chats to be made with approved contacts).My mother can't always use the tablet, as simple as it is, due to the disease, but her caregivers can help her with it whenever she wants to watch an old home movie that I uploaded of me and my brothers as kids, or her 9 year old son, or old photos, or even to facetime with us whenever she wants to talk to us."
App or device for dementia caregivers,So far it's great!
App or device for dementia caregivers,I wish it was more simplified so she can use it without help but I don't think that's ever going to happen.
App or device for dementia caregivers,"I was considering trying to spread awareness that something like this would help, or try to patent something, but I'm not really an inventor or developer, just a tinkerer.I call it the 'Happy Tablet'."
App or device for dementia caregivers,"So basically old photos, videos and the ability to facetime people makes her happy, and if she's happy then I'm happy!"
App or device for dementia caregivers,"That's a great idea!I myself have collected her favourite songs/videos from YouTube (downloaded using the command-line program 'youtube-dl'), and either play them on my Mac, or stream them to our Apple TV, or on an iPad."
App or device for dementia caregivers,"My wife squeals with delight whenever I start playing her songs.Unfortunately, the GUIs for all of the above are too complicated both for her, and for our part-time caretaker.An app that would help with self-sufficiency for the sufferer or the caretaker would be great!"
App or device for dementia caregivers,"One challenge we noticed was how difficult it is to coordinate wellbeing activities in a residential care facility, to ensure all residents have a healthy activity level."
App or device for dementia caregivers,We have worked over the past two years to build a shared activity logbook and visualization tool.
App or device for dementia caregivers,"Our project is fully open source, and has a growing backlog of tasks/features."
App or device for dementia caregivers,We would be very grateful for any help your students might offer.
App or device for dementia caregivers,"It would be a win-win as the students would get real-world experience improving a production web application to improve the lives of people with dementia spectrum disorders living in residential care homes.https://github.com/GeriLife/wellbeing Some type of medication reminder/log, I'm sure there are apps out there I just haven't looked."
App or device for dementia caregivers,"Something to keep all medication taken and needed in a logbook, along with food and insulin reminders too."
App or device for dementia caregivers,"An alarm that goes off when something is needed at a certain time(lunch, pm meds, insulin, etc..) One topic that comes up over and over is a tracker for a loved one.They want it to be small."
App or device for dementia caregivers,"Be able to put it on their wrist, or on a lanyard."
App or device for dementia caregivers,It should have a geo fence.
App or device for dementia caregivers,An alert would go off if the tracker was out of the geo fence.
App or device for dementia caregivers,Another topic that has come up over and over is a simple phone with a few contacts.
App or device for dementia caregivers,"It needs to have a large font size, and a photo of the person they are calling."
App or device for dementia caregivers,App or device for dementia caregivers Attention dementia caregivers!
App or device for dementia caregivers,I’m participating in a Brain Health Hackathon where students design technology to assist people with dementia.
App or device for dementia caregivers,My team is currently brainstorming ideas and would love your input.
App or device for dementia caregivers,What problems do you have in caregiving that an app or device could address?
App or device for dementia caregivers,"As a caregiver, I'm coming from a point of view where my loved one can no longer use a device."
App or device for dementia caregivers,"With that being said:• For those caregivers who worry about their loved one who wanders -- an app sorta like ""Find My Phone""."
App or device for dementia caregivers,"Launch the app, drop it into the pockets of their loved one, and from a second device, know where they currently are.• When my wife's diagnosis was confirmed, I began to keep a semi-daily journal of things I'd noticed that didn't quite seem right."
App or device for dementia caregivers,"I had stopped doing that, but I wish I'd continued."
App or device for dementia caregivers,"A simple app to quickly jot down personality changes or whatever might have made the difference for me.• A checklist of medical and legal things caregivers need to keep track of (medical tests, suggested legal things that are recommended over at alz.org).Good luck at your hackathon, and come back and tell us what you ended up doing!"
App or device for dementia caregivers,"I’m not a care giver any longer, but when I was, the the biggest problem for us was keeping track of mom."
App or device for dementia caregivers,We had to deadbolt with a key the locks so she wouldn’t wander.
App or device for dementia caregivers,We also had to child proof the kitchen and bathrooms so that she wouldn’t get into non-food items and ingest.
App or device for dementia caregivers,"Currently I have the SmartThings hub to monitor my house for security, and I could see that it would have been a godsend for dealing with my mother."
App or device for dementia caregivers,"However, I think that current caregivers are older, and typically not as tech savvy to use this type of product and fully utilize to their benefit."
App or device for dementia caregivers,(My mother had ‘early onset’ and I’m not convinced my dad in his 60s would have set it up.).
App or device for dementia caregivers,"I think an ‘out of the box’ hub, specifically designed for dementia patient caregivers would be a real benefit."
App or device for dementia caregivers,"For monitoring doors, location, and even vital signs and medication dosage."
App or device for dementia caregivers,The whole works!
App or device for dementia caregivers,I will also add that the animoji feature of my iPhone X for some reason is a hit with my mom.
App or device for dementia caregivers,"It's the only thing that's able to engage her, besides humans, on her good days."
App or device for dementia caregivers,I think there's something there worth researching and developing.
App or device for dementia caregivers,Exactly what the person below said.
App or device for dementia caregivers,"A tracking device would be so helpful, something that had a long charge."
App or device for dementia caregivers,Also the ability to have checklists to take the best care of them.
App or device for dementia caregivers,It can be overwhelming to the caretaker to keep track of everything.
App or device for dementia caregivers,"A discreet looking RFID system of iron on tags for clothes or something that would send traps/notices to a human monitored device like a smart watch the caregiver wore and/or a phone, when the RFID tags approach a movable detector."
App or device for dementia caregivers,The majority of helpful devices for caregivers are surprisingly not internet/WiFi connected.
App or device for dementia caregivers,A simple button to be pushed to ask for help.
App or device for dementia caregivers,Most connect to call center that can only call an ambulance and cost a fortune.
App or device for dementia caregivers,I found one that will call on my phone through a landline connection so it can be used for more than just emergencies.
App or device for dementia caregivers,Anything from I’ve fallen to I need to go to the bathroom/need a drink/am confused etc.
App or device for dementia caregivers,"Bed alarms, door alarms chair alarms and incontinence alarms all do nothing other than screech which is helpful but sometimes counterproductive."
App or device for dementia caregivers,"My SO can no longer walk well on his own, but his dementia makes it hard for him to realize this."
App or device for dementia caregivers,With our current bed alarm it makes a noise when his weight lifts off the bed.
App or device for dementia caregivers,At this point the alarm scares him and almost ensures a fall.
App or device for dementia caregivers,It could alert me in the next room and I would be aware he is trying to walk and not scare him.
App or device for dementia caregivers,The same with incontinence alarms.

Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker) I’m here looking for some advice.My family is currently facing a stressful situation, as my 93-year-old maternal Grandmother has been suffering from Dementia."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"The dementia is the result of her having thrown a few PEs in the past, rather than her age."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"This means, her loss of memory/filters has been a relatively gradual process."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"In many ways this has been a blessing – my Grandmother lives alone, in another state."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"She is a very independent, and a very, very stubborn individual, who is adamant that she will never accept help from a caregiver (outside the family) and will certainly never leave her house.As her memory loss has been a slow process, she has been able to stay in her home by herself."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"My mother calls to check on her multiple times a day and flies out to check up on her every few months, and remotely handles her medical/financial needs."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"In addition, she is driven to appointments/stores by a neighbor, who also helps her out physically (taking her trash out, and the like), and she is in relatively close proximity to her sisters and a niece."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Though she is on medication to slow the progression of the disease, there are many times she forgets to take her pills, which as a result negates any help they may have otherwise supplied."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"In the past few months, we are seeing more and more signs of decline."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Names and dates have begun to slip, and her short-term memory too is declining."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"At the moment, she is still able to more or less take care of her daily basic needs – food, chores, bathing."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"But, she is not able to rationalize things – for instance, she hordes things, keeps expired food, will sit in the dark on occasion (though this is clearly a tripping hazard)."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"My mother has been working with Adult Services, who has been keeping track of my Grandmother’s decline."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"The last contact they had with my mother, was a call to inform her that they had done a home check on my Grandmother and found there to be no issue (as in she did not yet pose a danger to herself)."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),They ended up closing her case file.So where does that leave my Mother/us?
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),It leaves us in a holding pattern – a very stressful one.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Though my Grandmother’s disease is heavily documented, there is not yet any legal recourse for us to transfer her to assisted living."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Basically, we have to leave her to decline some more, before such action can be taken."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"In the meantime, my Grandmother’s personality has become more and more volatile."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Her personality from her childhood onward, has one of stubbornness."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"I’m not sure if this was the result of various familial tragedies she’s had to endure, or if this is simply her natural personality."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Despite the helpful neighbor and the various family member who will occasionally call her, my Mother is really her sole caretaker (her father and only sibling are both long since deceased)."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"As such, the relationship between my Mother and Grandmother has declined to a point where my Mother can no longer remember a time when her Mother behaved as such."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),She has begun to question whether my Grandmother ever even loved her.The pinnacle of this came tonight – my parents are currently at my Grandmother’s house checking up on her.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"My mother was in the process of throwing out expired food in a basement pantry, when she stumbled upon decades old food."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Not only had the food and surrounding shelving begun to blacken and dissolve, but my Mother had cause for concern that she was exposed to some very harmful mold.Shaken by this, she relayed her worry and finding to my Grandmother, and was met with only anger and denial – no sympathy/empathy was given despite my mother’s proffered fears (that she had been exposed to a toxin)."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),My mother has been attending some group therapy sessions in regard to caring for someone with Dementia and is aware that the disease takes a way a person’s ability to rationalize and perhaps even empathize.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Though she is aware of this logic, I see her having trouble internalizing it."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"The decline in the relationship between mother and daughter is taking a very large toll on my mother emotionally.I know this post is a long ramble, and I'm not sure if any one will even read it in its entirety, but I guess my purpose here is to figure out a way to help my mother."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),I can’t (nor can my siblings) be there physically to help (at least at the moment).
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"I try to offer assistance emotionally, reassuring her about things, letting her know that we know she is doing all she can, etc."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"However, there are times when I find myself at a loss for words (on how she may be able to make suggestions or have positive interactions with my Grandmother)."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"What can you tell someone who is going through such a difficult thing that will make them feel better or will be useful to them?Though we are all here to support her in any way we can, I know there are many times when she feels as if she is carrying the burden alone."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),Any advice would be much appreciated.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),Thank you.I’m sorry you’re going through this.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"I struggle with this too as I’m long distance while my mom and sister bear the brunt of caring for my dad.I asked my sister and mom how best I could help and they’ve told me this: be there as much as you can physically, but if that’s not possible then keep doing what you’re doing."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Call as often as you can, be there to vent to, and if you don’t know what to say, you can be honest about that."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),Just keep reminding your mom that she’s doing a great job.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"I don’t know how internet savvy your mom is (mine isn’t), so you can also help by doing online research for her, especially on the tech front if there are any gadgets that can help your mom keep a better eye on your grandma."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),Every little thing helps.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),Thank you very much for the reply/advice.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"I am sorry you are going through this with your dad.On the tech front, there are many options we would love to employ (like security cameras), unfortunately my grandmother does not have any internet at her house."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),It sounds like your grandmother is no longer capable of making decisions for herself.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),Does your mom have power of attorney?
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"If not, I would suggest consulting with an elder care lawyer, and getting that sorted."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),It will involve getting your grandmother's doctor to certify that she is incompetent to handle her own affairs.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"If she forgets to take her meds, then that is proven.Once your mom has that, she can use your grandmother's resources (or her own) to set up security cameras, hire in-home caregivers, etc.The Alzheimer's Association has a helpline, anyone can call for advice: 800-272-3900.From my personal experience caring for my gradually-declining dad since 2010, the drug seroquel has helped with paranoia and aggression, and I've learned reason and arguing don't work."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),But there are other ways of handling the issues.It's the worst disease.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),I know your mom is glad she has you in her life.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),Thank you very much for your reply!
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Perhaps, the hotline might be a good resource."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"I'm not sure if my mother is aware of it or not, but I will pass the info along to her.Both my parents of recently taken charge of her bank accounts so that they can pay all her bills online (there was some worry that she would begin to overpay them)."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"My mother has attended all neuro appointments that my Grandmother has been dragged to (not literally of course, but close enough)."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Her mental decline is well documented, however, as I said the progression of her Dementia has been very gradual."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"We did manage to take steps like getting her driver's license revoked - lots of hoops to jump through for that, amazingly, given her age and disease."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"My parent's are both recently retired (my Mother worked for decades as a ARNP, caring for others, and now when she is trying to enjoy life she has been left to care for her mother - who is by far the worst ""patient"" she has ever encountered)."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),Since they are now on a fixed budget themselves they are hesitant to spend any of their own money on my Grandmother's expense.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"My grandmother has more than enough money to take care of things, however, her personality is such that she does not wish to spend money on anything but expensive luxuries.Hopefully, the fact that my parent's have taken control of her accounts, will help this issue."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"However, the current worry is that if money is spent on assisted care (like a nurse/health worker doing in house visits), or assistance based tech (security cams, WiFi, emergency alert devices), not only will she not use them, but she will find a way to retaliate (as in she won't answer the phone, etc.)."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"As her last neuro appointment (December) actually showed some improvement (at that point she was correctly taking Exelon), we didn't have enough to show she was not capable of living on her own."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Again, there is some concern that if we don't have the proper amount of evidence and we take her to court (to gain full control over her), then she will find a way to cut us off (communication, financially, etc."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"), which will undoubtedly make the situation a 100 times worse."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Though her ability to rationalize things is mostly gone, she has still found ways to manipulate things when she wants something - in a way it is fascinating how this disease targets certain parts of the brain before others.The best way to describe the situation is that we are in a game of Capture the Flag, currently sitting in No Man's Land, inching toward the line at which we will need to make a play for the opposition's flag (taking her to court)."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),I'm sorry to hear about your Dad - this disease certainly sucks!!
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Eventually she will set something on fire, or wreck the car and then you have your case."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Unfortunately, that can lead to a funeral (or funerals, depending on who she hits) instead of guardianship."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),If only doctors and the DMV were more proactive.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),She does not drive - we worked hard to get her driver's license revoked.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"So, at the very least there is no threat of her harming someone else with her car."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),Thank you for being responsible dementia caretakers.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),My uncle ran into the back of a school bus before he could be stopped.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Oh my gosh, that's awful, I've very sorry!"
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Try adult protective servicesMaybe literal piles of mold is enough to have them take action  Thankfully, it turned out to not be mold."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"We have gone through adult services, not to sound like a jerk, but they are pretty useless (at least in this case)."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),They had opened a case on her and were working with my mother.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),They stopped by my Grandmother's house a total of 2 times.
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"The first time they only went as far as the doorway - asked my Grandmother a few question, but didn't conduct any type of house/safety survey."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"Since they only asked my Grandmother the sort of questions they would not know the actual answers to (basically she could have made things up or got things confused, and they would have taken her word on it), all they achieved was to incense my grandmother."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"She got angry with my mother over that and threatened to cut off communication, which would have ultimately made things much, much worse.The second visit they did go into her house briefly (amazingly my Grandmother let them in), but they didn't find anything that overly concerned them."
Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker),"As a result of that they closed her case, and deemed her fine to be on her own.Oh yeah, they were real helpful."

update and a message to y'all,"i called and texted regularly, asking how she was doing."
update and a message to y'all,my brother would text me when she got rowdy and i helped him deal with it.
update and a message to y'all,"i don't know if i mentioned it before, but he and i are both mentally ill so it was very important for me to be accessible to him as much as i could be."
update and a message to y'all,"despite all of that, i'm on track to graduate this year with an undergraduate thesis under my belt.so about my grandma."
update and a message to y'all,winter break came up and it was obvious that she was declining very quickly.
update and a message to y'all,"we've had this happen before; she'd have periods of time where it seemed like she would get significantly worse before plateauing, so i didn't think much of it at the time."
update and a message to y'all,on christmas day she became sick.
update and a message to y'all,"nothing intense, just a bit of a cough and runny nose, so we still went to the family gathering and had a great time."
update and a message to y'all,"she was very tired by the end and had a hard time getting in the car but we managed alright.the next day, my mom and dad decided to take her to urgent care since she is very old and we take our health very seriously in this household."
update and a message to y'all,"i was responsible for the dog and feeding myself and my brother, so i didn't hear much that day."
update and a message to y'all,"it was apparently crazy busy to the point where people would cheer every time someone would leave, according to my dad."
update and a message to y'all,"well, after eight hours grandma was finally checked out."
update and a message to y'all,"i'm not sure what the details were, but she was admitted to the hospital for getting the flu that's been heckin everyone up this year."
update and a message to y'all,"thankfully she had her flu shot so it wasn't too bad, but the doctor was very very concerned about something else.my mom mentioned to him at some point that my grandma had been falling more, hence the use of the walker and the wheelchair my mom's cousin gave to us from my great aunt before she passed."
update and a message to y'all,"they talked, and he said that she wouldn't be going back with them."
update and a message to y'all,"my mom was in shock but my dad was on it, and discussed how he wasn't able to find a home for her that was willing to accept her insurance that was also accessible to the family."
update and a message to y'all,"the doctor said ""you'll get a call tomorrow""grandma stayed overnight, and lo and behold we got a call."
update and a message to y'all,"while both of my parents were staying with her, i answered the phone and a lovely woman let me know that there was someone on the way to talk to my parents and that my grandma was to go to a hospice at 6pm that night."
update and a message to y'all,it was honestly both the most relief and the most sad i've ever felt at the same time.
update and a message to y'all,"i was so glad she as going to get the care she needed, but the doctor also confirmed that he didn't expect my grandma to live beyond 6 months to a year longer."
update and a message to y'all,"i know that she's gone, but it's going to be very hard to deal with her being gone gone."
update and a message to y'all,my mom's taken this super well.
update and a message to y'all,we've been kind of expecting this to happen for a while.
update and a message to y'all,"honestly, there were some nights i'd go to bed and watch grandma in her room to make sure she was still alive, and my mom and dad were already discussing funeral plans."
update and a message to y'all,"those got finalized in the last few weeks since she's gone to the home, so all they need to do is make one call once grandma passes and everything will be taken care of."
update and a message to y'all,"they've also talked to my dad's regular therapist, and my mom has finally confided in me that she was indeed feeling overwhelmed and burned out, and that now it was strange but lifted a huge weight off her shoulders to have other people deal with day to day issues.speaking of which, we've been visiting her at the home."
update and a message to y'all,"mom's visited every day after work since the home is right on her route home anyway, which has been fantastic."

update and a message to y'all,"it's a super diverse group of people that live there, too, so she's been making friends (as dark as it is, it is kind of funny that she gets to make ""new"" friends with the same people every day) and listening to spanish radio with them."
update and a message to y'all,"best of all, it's right next to a beautiful homestead museum, so every day she goes outside she can see the building and the gardens around it."
update and a message to y'all,the best part?
update and a message to y'all,"because the doctor deemed this a necessary thing, it's 100% covered by insurance."

Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,Some lawyers won't touch it.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,We ran into this problem with my mother who had to sign some stuff.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,"In order to do it properly we needed to have her doctors say she knew what she was doing, and the lawyer involved needed to interview her also to make sure she understood."
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,However since everybody was in a cord we just had her sign the papers with a notary instead without mentioning to him the issue.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,This only worked because no one in the family was disagreeing with the action.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,Be very careful when you're finding a lawyer what you tell them about her mental status.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,My mother was Compass enough to do something legally but it made the first lawyer not want to do the paperwork.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,Those were my concerns as well that there will be problems executing legal documents because of her status.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,"In what form should the the doctor's statement take, will a letter from them suffice?"
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,"Because she does know what she is doing, there is no doubt."
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,I think she wants to avoid upsetting her husband who is unpredictable.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,I've seen that he won't let her speak for herself when they visit the doctor but I speak to her all the time and her decision making capacity is fine.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,Her memory and coordination are what are failing.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,"If I have a prepared doctor's statement that she is competent enough to execute legal decisions for herself, this could facilitate interactions with attorneys in the matter, if I understand correctly?"
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,"We are going to review and amend the designated trustees and beneficiaries in the document to reflect her wishes, so we have to work with an attorney for this I imagine, a notary probably wouldn't work."
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,Thank you!
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,"I found out the some doctors will write a letter about their assessment, our specialists preferred to have the lawyer speak to them over the phone."
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,I'm sure they're just afraid of getting in trouble.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,The lawyer than said that in addition to speaking to the doctors she needed to interview my mom by herself without others so she could ascertain that she was not being influenced by anyone.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,That is a good thing in your case.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,Insist that the lawyer do this if you are worried about your mom not being able to speak up.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,And do this as soon as possible before circumstances change.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,One other thing that can be done is stipulate that additional bequests can be left in an envelope with the will for the executor to follow as he sees fit.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,Another thing I forgot to say was that a guardianship can have more than one person on it and the person that is named first can overrule the ones that are second Etc.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,So if you can get him into having a younger person i.e.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,"you, on it as the first so they don't have to change it later, that might solve some of the problem."
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,When my mother was first diagnosed my dad did put me first on his legal guardianship documents in front of moms.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,Just in case there was an emergency.
Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother,"We are both still on it, but if we have a disagreement it'll work out fine because she and I are on the same page."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?"
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",My fathers dementia is getting worse and he is starting to wander off more frequently.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",My mother lives with him and I live just a few houses down but he is sneaky.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","Although we have lived in the same neighborhood for our whole lives he is getting lost and scared.Although it seems like a creepy ""big brother"" move, It crossed my mind that a small tracking device might be one option.Possibly looking for a GPS tracker that I can put in his pocket that would allow me to quickly locate him in the event he takes off and gets lost.Any advice on this or any other options I might have would be appreciated.You should look into Tile (I discovered them a couple days ago - the reviews seem good, I'm likely to order them soon myself).... you get four thin Tile Slim gps tracking devices for $100 (or four Tile Mate devices for $70) and can track them with your phone."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","Here is their website: (You can search their app in the App Store) https://support.thetileapp.com/hc/en-us I had a tag made for my mother, at the Petsmart dog tag station."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","It has her address and my phone number, and I'm going to put it on her keys, which she remembers to put in her purse out of habit."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","That way at least she will know where she lives, or someone can call me to go get her."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","She's not a wanderer, though."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",I don't see any problem with GPS.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",Have you looked at the cellphone tracking apps?
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","They're made for parents trying to keep track of their kids, but if you can get him to remember a cell phone, that might work."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",We can't chip them yet.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",Take a couple of pictures of him each week so you have current ones in case you need them when he wanders too far.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",I've been locking exterior doors and putting the keys away to help prevent wandering issues.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","I have a small device called ""stick n find"" that I keep on my cat that works with my phones Bluetooth so it's only good for about a hundred yards or so."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",It  lets me find her  by showing a radar like  screen  that points me in her Direction and also it beeps  and make some lights  so I can track her by sound .
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",There are trackers that are used 4 Hawks by falconers which actually allow you to track them down with another device.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",They cost a couple hundred dollars at least.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",The problem with most GPS devices is they are not exact.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",The advantages of both these kinds of devices is they are small and can be attached easily as a piece of jewelry or in a pocket.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",I am sure there's also GPS devices but I haven't used them yet Have you considered a clock that shows the time of day and his schedule and putting it next to the door?
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",That way he knows that he is not supposed to be on the way out.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",FTD = his decision making and ability to synthesis disparate informations and contextual clues are probably not very good.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","Clock and schedule posted might be nice to help with re-orienting, but near the door probably wouldn't do much... though might attract more attention to the door and idea of leaving."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",Companies like medicAlert or lifeline have medical bracelet service that also will ensure contacting back to family.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","GPS tracker , cell phone apps, in addition not a bad idea I think, of course the ethical concerns because he is not giving consent or assent to the plan."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","Store car keys, coat etc out of view."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",Put something on the door to notify you when opened (there are different products).
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","ensure you have at hand noted in one place info like height weight identifying features so you wouldn't have to think about it, with up to date photo."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",Try to find out places he goes or tries to go and routes he usually takes to keep in mind where he might get lost if that ever happens.
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?","Edit to add:speak to his case worker or whoever is implicated clinician for further advice My father and I installed ""reserve locks"" on all the doors."
"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker?",This did the trick until we had to admit her into a memory care facility.
Venting: memory care move in,Venting: memory care move in We moved my folks into memory care.
Venting: memory care move in,"Dad's forgetfulness is on the order of 1-2 hours, he is literally the ""where is my wife, my wife is lost"" guy now, when she is away too long.We're suspending their cell service because they keep calling local kids like me and asking for otc drugs they can't manage, food they can't keep track of, and to be moved back to where they didn't have enough 24 hour support.Some of us kids are dead burned out and swearing."
Venting: memory care move in,Some have been away too far and are still processing that our parents are not whole anymore.
Venting: memory care move in,The greater family has either given up or will be some version of 'doesn't get it'.I'm taking a one month break from contacting them because I think they'll need months to fully connect with the staff.
Venting: memory care move in,I am preparing mentally for nothing to change and that they continue making unreasonable unsafe requests of us when we do connect.
Venting: memory care move in,"They act happy and connected when with staff and fellow residents, but give seemingly unreal angry and sad and desperate comments only to family.Meanwhile, heart rending voicemails (both with a message, sometimes just labored breathing for three minutes) continue coming in."
Venting: memory care move in,Although I think there cell service was suspended just now so my phone should stop ringing every hour.Hang in there.
Venting: memory care move in,It took my mum 3 weeks to stop crying & leave her room.
Venting: memory care move in,During that time I checked in with her once or twice a day... on my schedule.
Venting: memory care move in,"It's so frustrating & yes, I have gotten totally burned out again & again."
Venting: memory care move in,"But, given time they will settle in & get a routine."
Venting: memory care move in,They'll be fine.
Venting: memory care move in,I think the month thing is really a myth.
Venting: memory care move in,"There's nothing to say you can't stop by for 15 minutes to check in on them, short frequent visits generally work better and cutting off all contact so quickly can be very disorienting for them."
Venting: memory care move in,"But, don't forget, either way."
Venting: memory care move in,So whatever works.
Venting: memory care move in,"If the presence of family isn't comforting to them, and it isn't for everyone, it's OK to cut back on visits.And, honestly, they will either settle in or they won't."
Venting: memory care move in,They're safe.
Venting: memory care move in,Safety is king when happiness isn't on the table.
Venting: memory care move in,I'm sorry for the hardship you are experience.
Venting: memory care move in,"It's true that you need to take care of yourself, so if contact with your parents is too much for you right now it's a good idea to take a break."
Venting: memory care move in,It was recommended to us by the first care home my mom moved into to cease all contact for 3-4 weeks.
Venting: memory care move in,"The recommendation was based on nothing they could articulate, and from their feeble explanations I sensed that it was more for their benefit than my mom's to have her family out of their way."
Venting: memory care move in,We were ultimately not comfortable with not supervising her care in those early days and in a place she was unfamiliar with.
Venting: memory care move in,"Mom called us incessantly for the first few weeks as well, which was heartbreaking."
Venting: memory care move in,"It made me realize how often she was thinking of us (all day, sometimes in the middle of the night)."
Venting: memory care move in,I felt as though the only times she could have some peace was when we were there for her in person or answering those calls to reassure her.
Venting: memory care move in,"It's all in the moment now, your visits won't have an impact before or after, only in the moment."

Something different...,Something different... Apologizes if I broke any or all of the subreddit rules I'm on mobile and it's 1am.
Something different...,So I'm a student tasked with an assignment about creating a PSA.
Something different...,I've chosen to focus on the eaely signs of Alzheimer's and more specifically this four parts:-Forgetfulness-Losing track of time -Losing motor skills-Familiar places becoming unfamiliar The whole video will be 30 seconds exact and I plan to incorporate real life examples of this happening without showing any faces.
Something different...,"I was wondering if you guys have situations you've encountered before where this happens and that you feel can strike an emotional chord with the viewers.For example, for the part about losing motor skills, I intend to show someone having difficulty tying his or her shoelaces."
Something different...,"For the part about familiar places become unfamiliar, I have an idea about a hand stretching out towards a door (home), freezing for a second before turning away (forgetting where you are)."
Something different...,"While this may be simple, I hope it will stir the emotions of some of the viewers.Like I said above, this may be the entirely wrong place to post this but I will try anyways."
Something different...,Any ideas are welcomed though preferably able to be shot within a students budget(aka no budget at all).
Something different...,Thank you!
Something different...,"Sounds like an interesting project!The ones I come to think of:Ability to handle instructions, especially processes."
Something different...,"For example ""pull the switch and then turn the handle"" or ""add the eggs into the milk and the whisk in the flour""."
Something different...,Multiple sequential steps often become completely impossible to handle.
Something different...,"Looking to others for answers, if I ask someone with dementia when their sister is coming over or what they had for lunch then will sometimes look around and search for a safe person to answer And on th ebrighter sideSongs!"
Something different...,"Early stage alzheimer patiens who have lost a lot of awareness, are still often able to sing the lyrics of old favorite songs."
Something different...,And late stage alzheimer patients often react positively to music with smiles and non-verbal singing.
Something different...,That sounds like a great Idea.
Something different...,Feel free to post the result!
Something different...,One moment that sticks with me re: familiar places is when my partner asked me one day how to get to the post office.
Something different...,He had not been diagnosed yet.
Something different...,It was only a few blocks away to the post office and he walked there twice a week.
Something different...,I told him how to get there and he grabbed his car keys.
Something different...,At this point he never really drove as I did all the driving so I walked to the post office with him.
Something different...,Another sign that hit home was changes in emotions.
Something different...,He started getting frustrated easily.
Something different...,He went from a happy go lucky guy that never really got upset to scared and confused easily.
Something different...,That would be much harder to show in the PSA however.
Something different...,My father gets confused about what cutlery to use to eat.
Something different...,He tried to use a straw to eat his pancakes when we went out for breakfast one time.
Something different...,"I have seen that to, the know that they need a utensil but which one is less important, like spoon and fork."
Something different...,My experience is that it can in early stages be avoided by only placing the correct options in front of the caretaker.
Something different...,"Losing track of time - going outside in the summer in a heavy coat (or vice versa, going outside in a sleeveless dress in winter)"

What's the best way to approach the subject of dementia?,The best thing you can do is get the required tests done to produce a proper diagnosis.
What's the best way to approach the subject of dementia?,The underlying problem is pinning where your mother is at in the progression of her possible dementia.

What's the best way to approach the subject of dementia?,"I honestly believe that her being in a nursing home would be the better decision because she is way more at risk of endangering herself or others in her own home because of all the things that become hazards, stairs and the kitchen area to name a few."

Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,Our facility is large with anywhere between 25-40 children in attendance daily.
Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,"We have a pool, gymnasium, track, trampoline room, and a huge outdoor area, their favorite place to play."
Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,"This area backs up to an assisted living facility.The assisted living facility has one rogue occupant (~80ish) in the advanced stages of dementia who likes to sneak out, wander around, and oftentimes gets lost."
Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,"She can walk fairly well but is otherwise non verbal and cognitively checked out.When she sees us bring the group of children outside, she wanders over because she wants to play with them, which makes the children extremely uncomfortable because she will proceed to try to grab them, tug their hair, poke their faces, get at their jewelry (necklaces, bracelets, etc), pull at their clothes, hug them and not let go/block them from leaving, grab their backpacks, chase them as they run away, and more."

Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,She is simply very mentally far gone and I don't think she even understands what's going on or what she's doing.
Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,"When she finally leaves, it's usually to wander around elsewhere and we're always having to call assistance to one of the subdivisions in the area that she frequently gets lost in.We have had a talk with the children and they know to try and avoid her while playing, but it hasn't helped because she just chases/corners them if they ignore her."

Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,My boss knows of this issue but I don't think she understands just how uncomfortable it's making the kids because it's 'just an old lady who doesn't mean any harm'.
Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,I know she doesn't mean any harm but she's wandering around unsupervised and now the kids have taken to hiding behind my chair whenever she comes around.I want to be as respectful and gentle as possible handling this.

Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,This type of behavior would not be allowed if she was at a skilled nursing facility.
Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,"Because she is displaying these dangerous behaviors, she needs a more appropriate placement at a facility that can address these behaviors."
Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,"It is not the lady doing these things, it is the disease..So please dont feel guilty, it would be for the best of her and the children."

Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,"As a CNA who works in a memory care building, I am absolutely appalled and disgusted that this amount of negligence has gone unreported and unpunished."

Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,Her behaviors are her own.
Respectfully handle a situation where dementia patient is scaring children?,She cannot control what she is doing and I'm glad to see you can understand that.

Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Hi,I'm looking for some advice on my Grandfather / Dad (There is two of us here, however the grandson is typing so I'll be typing from my point of view), this is a big post so I'm sorry but if anyone could have a read and provide me with some advice I would greatly appreciate it!--Noticeable OnsetIn 2015 we started to notice that my Granddad had the start of dementia/Alzheimer's and we spoke to his doctor (with his wife/my Nan) to make them aware and see if they could do anything but for some reason they said that they are unable to do anything or say anything to him until he asks/mentions it...6 Months LaterAbout 6 months later he had a TIA (transient ischemic attack) and was taken to hospital, they released him the next morning but started him on some tablets.6 to 12 Months LaterWithin the next 6 months several people like his neighbors mentioned that he is forgetting things and repeats himself lots.Other attacks & hospital visits.Since then, he's had a few more smaller TIA's and we notice his memory is getting worse and worse, he can't remember going to the hospital in the last 5 years (even though he's been 5 or so times, twice by ambulance).ConfusionHe repeats himself a crazy amount of times, even sometimes in very quick succession."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"He misplaces things like his keys, phone, hat, chargers... etc and gets confused with even the simplest of things that 10 years ago he would have been able to do just fine, he's broken several things lately from trying to ""fix"" them himself because he would have normally been able to fix them but now he just does things wrong.We recently installed new taps in the kitchen and bathroom and within a month he had broken the taps in the bathroom because he tried to undo them because ""they felt broken"" which is just because they are different and could be turned easily where as his old taps had broken and were pretty fused up.He purchased a new door bell recently and he brought it over unable to get it to work so he wanted me to have a look at it, he had tried to open the doorbell to fix it and had damaged all of the plastic where he was trying to push a screwdriver into it to open it up when all he had to do was pull the plastic tab (it said ""Pull me out"" on it) to get the battery to connect."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"I let him take it home and we said we'd come and put it up on the weekend (2 days away), when we turned up he had been trying to open it up again because it ""wasn't working"", he had forgotten that he had brought it over and the only thing required was to put it up on the wall.Violence/AngerHe get's quite angry when he gets confused and he's also been a little violent towards my Nan by punching her on the arm on multiple occasions, we've spoken to him about this and told him that he can not do this, we've also spoken to my Nan and told her not to wind him up."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,It starts of by him forgetting something and then my Nan goes on at him over whatever it was and he gets angry and ends up being aggressive.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Since we spoke to her about it he has been fine as she has been doing what we told her of not making a fuss over it, just let it go even if it's very annoying.Repeating himselfSpeaking to him a few days ago, he repeated the same story to us about 5 times within the space of 10 minutes."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,We don't bother saying anything instead we listen to the same story 5 times.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"He however isn't aware that he's told us.Recent ScansOver the past month he's also been having a few MRI scans and memory tests to check for any changes with his brain, however he still doesn't really tell any of the family (or his wife) the results and probably forgets the results by the time he gets home.My Granddad was spoken to on a 1 to 1 basis with my Dad in the car when they were coming back from his MRI scan and my Granddad said that he didn't think he had anything wrong with his memory, my Dad thought this was the perfect opportunity to talk to him and he told him straight up that he did believe that he though there ""was something going on with his memory"" but that there isn't anything to worry about and that he should just get on with life and enjoy himself."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"After he got home and my Dad had left, he apparently broke down in tears and got upset over it all."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,We actually went down the next morning and already he had forgotten most of the previous day and didn't mention Dad thinking he has something going on.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"I could tell him the upcoming winning lottery numbers though (he asks all the time if I can get him the winning lottery numbers as I am always able to help fix things for him) and within an hour he would have more than likely forgotten them.Getting Lost...The biggest worry with him for us is him getting lost, he goes out in the car (doesn't tell anyone where he's going) and goes off at hours at a time, we don't know if he gets lost or what is going on.What we really kind of need is to get a tracker on his car/on his keys but we don't want to appear or be invasive for his privacy, the main reason we want a tracker is to make sure he's safe and ok, there's been many occasions over the last two years where it's 11 at night and he's not home after going down to the pub, he's not told his wife where he is and she obviously gets very worried, upset and scared."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,We have to go out and try and find him.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"He just doesn't understand and laughs at it every time.We noticed a note in the Kitchen about a ""loan"" and we're not sure what that is about, he says he doesn't know what it was about either and we're obviously a little worried that he might be in trouble with money and also a bit worried that he seeing someone on the side (I wouldn't be surprised, likewise our Nan wouldn't be surprised) and maybe giving her money (even though the money he has is equally shared between him and his wife)Taking control...We've already kind of taken some form of control by speaking to the pharmacy (with him being there) and getting agreeing that no changes to his tablets or how they are delivered can be made by him without one of us being there because he gets confused and has changed delivery of his tablets several times causing himself lots of stress, the staff at the pharmacy stress and causing himself to have to wait a few days without any tablets.Forgetting to do things like eating, brushing his teeth, wearing a coat... etcHe forgets to eat and has to be reminded by his wife constantly, if she was to pass away he would quickly get into a state and either not eat enough and become unwell or just get dirty because he forgets to brush his teeth (his wife reminds him every day), he forgets to put underwear on (his wife reminds him every day) and he forgets to go out with a coat on even though it's supposed to rain later on.What next?This is all of our first experience with someone with Dementia/Alzheimer (we're pretty sure it's vascular dementia) and really don't know what to do so any help and advise would be very much welcome and appreciated."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,The first thing you need to do is get him a thorough check up to make sure that these symptoms aren't being caused by anything treatable.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"After that, find a neurologist who specializes in dementia."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Honestly, the meds that are currently available show little efficacy in most patients, but you can try them."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,A clinical trial could offer some home.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Finally, dementia patients don't know they are doing anything wrong with their outbursts and they can't learn, so scolding them is meaningless."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Even if you sit them down and they agree to everything half an hour later it will be as if the conversation never happened; to them, it didn't."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,This is why so many dementia patients end up in a care facility.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Most homes are utterly unequipped to deal with them.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"If possible, get him to designate a POA so you have the legal ability to make decisions for him."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Bring in a caregiver to give your grandmother/mother a break in her duties.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,It is unbelievably exhausting to care for even the most compliant dementia patient.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"It is, in effect, caring for a toddler with the body and legal rights of an adult."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Hi Lordica,He's been having checks including MRI's over the last month in relation to his past TIA's and they've been testing his memory at the same time.He's mostly all there just he gets very forgetful, frustrated and he's very very stubborn just like both of us, he genuinely doesn't think anything is wrong and as such it's hard.He still lives at his own home with his wife, they go shopping (to a degree), they take care of themselves (to a degree).They both have their own problems my Granddad is actually the listed carer for my Grandmother because she lacks a lot of physical capabilities due to weak muscles, arthritis, bad hips/knees... (even though she's had operations/replacements) and he is able to help her with all of that."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"He certainly does take on the role of having to take care of her, a lot more than most couples.We've tried to encourage her to age concern ""events?"""
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"but she just like him is very stubborn and she feels that it's for really old people and doesn't want to ""be one of them"" but we're all confident that she'd enjoy it and it would do her good, part of the reason we want her to go is so he can have a break... but saying that she also cares for him by getting him to eat, reminding him of everything, in her case she is all there mentally but not there physically, where as for him it's the opposite way round.If we said to him that we're going to take him to the hospital or have a discussion with him over it he would get frustrated, angry and upset; let alone mention power of attorney."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,We feel that he's right on the edge between being able to remember and not being able to remember going to see someone about POA.Hopefully that all makes sense.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Disclaimer: I'm not a pro.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"I just have a grandma with moderate-severe stage Alzheimer's Disease and so, I'll be speaking from my experience.First, you need a proper diagnosis."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Certain types of dementias are treatable, others are not - the only way to know is to get a diagnosis, preferably by consulting several neurologists and psychiatrists."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,[Here's] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1307463/pdf/westjmed00154-0073.pdf) a list of reversible and irreversible dementias.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"The document is a bit old, but it'll help you understand (just like it helped me) that dementia is a symptom of a disease, and you need to know what you're dealing with in the case of your dad/grandpa.Second, form what I have seen in my grandma, your grandpa's symptoms sound quite similar to hers: see them here She hasn't been aggressive, though, but this could be due to her personal character."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"She has always been a bit stubborn, for example, and has gotten even more so in the past 2-3 years.Usually, with Alzheimer's you can see a physical shrinkage of the patient's brain over time."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"I don't have my grandma's MRI scans handy, but there was clearly more water in her most recent brain scan compared to one take 2 years ago; the density of some of her brain parts has diminished too."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"So, archive his scans and make sure to bring them to your physician/s for progression checkup.Keep in mind that if your grandpa has irreversible dementia he will be unlearning things day-by-day, from more complicated tasks like driving to simple ones like feeding oneself and going to the bathroom; so there will come a day when you'll need someone who will take care of him 24/7."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Hence, start thinking about getting an at-home caregiver or a residential care for elderly with dementia right now."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Begin to research this issue, plan your finances and start discussing this with your nan."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"A good, trained caregiver will be your godsend."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Having her/him in your lives will ease up the psychological damage that you will go though during the last years of your loved one with dementia.In the future, please consider lying therapeutically and abstain from fixing your grandpa's storyline."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"I know it hurts you to hear him say something about having recently seen or spoken to a deceased relative, but he doesn't remember any of it, so reminding him of a death of a loved one will make him upset all over again."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Whenever my grandma talks about wanting to see her dad who died in the 1950s, we just straight up lie to her that he is on a vacation and will be back in a few weeks."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Same goes for telling him about his diagnosis, but this is my personal view."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,I don't know which state/country you live in but reach out to your local Dementia organization.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,They can provide you with lots of very useful advice and support and remind you that you are not alone.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"If I can be of any additional support, please pm me."

Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,I'm writing this on my phone.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Hi,That's part of the problem, he's very private, stubborn and the sort who would stay in denial for a long time, he would also get angry, frustrated and upset if we spoke to him about it and wouldn't let any of us come to the doctors with him so we can't ask the important questions; let alone get anything done."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"He's all there mentally, it's just his memory that's the problem.My granddads children (even my father) are all hesitant to step in and sit him down and talk about it partly I assume because they don't want him to actually have dementia (don't we all want that?)"
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,and because of how he will react to it.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,I've been trying to push my father at least to step in or at least speak to the other siblings to try and get them all to agree on something.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"It's not really for me or my mother for example to step in as we can't do much being non-immediate family.As far as our medical knowledge goes (we have a very healthy amount between us) it certainly looks like vascular dementia, he's had 3-4 MRI scans over the last 3-4 years and they haven't said anything yet, I fully expect the results of his most recent set of tests to come back saying that he definitely has dementia and I can see something happening on the medical side."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"He's always drunk a fair amount of alcohol, probably a little too much on a regular basis throughout the years but not to an alcoholic degree, he still has a few beers here and there but only really 1 or 2 on a night to the pub for example because he just can't handle his beer anymore.You mention the unable to recognize people in photos, my Granddad is terrible for this."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"He struggles sometimes to even realize that some pictures are his wife (granted she does look a bit different) but he very rarely manages to recognize any of his children in any pictures unless the picture is within the last 15 years.My granddad also mentions that he ""saw this lovely [insert dog breed] down the town a few days ago"", it's the same story every time, likewise he keeps telling us about all of his mischievous doings back when he was a young man."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"When 10 years ago none of these would ever be mentioned.We've been getting photos out a lot whenever they come round, likewise we have made them photo calendars, buy them some old school music just to try and help with his memory.In the UK, the doctors can just bring up their notes on the computer and the MRI scans will be available for any doctor that sees him to see.We haven't noticed him unlearning things so to speak, just confusion with anything technical (I can understand that) and forgetting to do things."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"I spoke with my mother today and an agreement she has with my Nan is after her other knee is replaced (later this month) she is willing to go to a few age concern meetings/events (for tea and biscuits) to see how it is there but part of the agreement is that she'll only go if my mum goes along with her for a few sessions because she's obviously and understandably anxious about it.Ahh, we already lie and abstain to help with his stories, we know he's confused and forgets and there's no point getting in an argument with him over something silly, we just as bad as it sounds, nod and smile."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"The only reason my Dad mentioned to him about he thinks something is going on (memory/brain wise) is because my Granddad started the conversation and it was the first and more than likely only good opportunity to speak to him about it, in private, without his wife (she'd chip in with comments which wouldn't help)Your advice, story and help is much appreciated."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,No need to apologise for typos :)Edit: Apologies for the typos.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,I'm writing this on my phone.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Hi, sorry for a rather later reply, but here we go:From what you have written, I am getting an impression that your grandpa's progression into the disorder/disease according to this outline is either in stage 3 or 4."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,The outline is a bit general and may not fit every person's symptoms but its translation was given to us by my grandma's physician.Have a look at https://www.dementiauk.org/ for support.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"I don't know where exactly you are in the UK, but here in Aberdeen we have http://www.alzscot.org/ chapter and although I'm not originally from the UK and my grandma isn't being treated in Scotland, I have been visiting them for some moral support since last year and they have been extremely helpful."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,So have a look online for a local chapter and do give them a call even if you don't have anything to say and just need a bit of encouragement that you are doing all that you can.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Also, I don't know if the NHS covers elderly care but maybe it would be worth calling the NHS and asking them about palliative care for elderly with dementia?"
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"I'm sure there must be some sort of help out there.Yes, get your Nan on board as soon as she feels better."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"If possible, have your grandpa's GP or physician talk about his diagnosis to her, so she fully understands the severity of the situation."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Then, inform the rest of the family and start working on a plan for your grandpa."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"The sooner you agree on one and get everything ready, the less anxiety you will feel and the more opportunity you will have to spend quality time with your grandpa before his condition gets really bad."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"I can understand your father and his, to some extend, unwillingness to accept his father's (possible) diagnosis and move on with it."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,My dad has been struggling too.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"His mom (my grandma) has been a strong and independent woman all his life and brought up 7 kids all on her own, gave them very good education and took care of their kids when they couldn't."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,To see her now struggling with tying her laces and making tea is heartbreaking.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,So my mom and I have become my dad's counsellors and we try to support him when he feels sad and upset.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"If your dad has been showing signs of sadness and anxiety because of his dad's health problems, and he isn't willing to share them with you, then maybe it'd be worth to talk to him about seeing a counsellor?Hope it works out for you!"
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Hi, Thank you for your reply, very very late from me.I had a look at that website and we believe he's actually stage 4, but not too far away from being stage 5."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Over the last few months it's been getting quite noticeable.So, he had to go back in to the hospital to get the results for his scans and the way we decided to deal with it was instead of any of his children or his wife go with him one of the grandsons went in with him as he tends to be more accepting around us we think it's because he doesn't feel as embarrassed which I can certainly understand but none of us judge him or anything we're all very understanding people.They confirmed to him that he has dementia-alzheimers and vascular dementia as we expected and he took it surprisingly well, he didn't get upset or anything but the hospital were amazing and made it sound not as bad as it sounds."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"The hospital gave us some telephone numbers and we were asked to organise a meeting with a lady from age concern / dementia uk.The lady went to my Granddad's place a few days ago and they (Granddad, Nan, their daughter in law and the Age Concern/Dementia UK lady) discussed a bunch of things, she suggested a series of things that should be done such as a joint power of attorney, getting attendance allowance for my Mum & Dad as they go down a lot and help them with all sorts of things from decorating, cleaning, sorting their tablets, taking them to the hospital/doctors... etc)."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Again he surprised us and was all okay with it.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"We think it's because it's confirmed now so he can't be in denial anymore because you would understandable deny it, I certainly would!We're going to organise another meeting with the lady again but this time without my Granddad being there because there were a lot of things that weren't brought up that are a concern including things like in the last two weeks he's only showed twice and if this was brought up in front of him he would definitely get angry.My Nan, unfortunately is rather useless she is the sort of person who won't step up to the plate and take control."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,He's always been the one in control of things.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,She's also really not good with knowing details because she nags at him and she also is very sneaky and uses his obvious forgetfulness to get things that she wants even though she doesn't need it.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,I'll can't think of an example right now but everyone notices it.The family have already spoken without Nan & Granddad being around about it as we were all confident that is what was wrong and had been trying our best with no experience with it before.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"We've already for the last year or so been spending more time with them because we all had thoughts that it might be dementia creeping in and in hindsight we now notice even more occasions were we're thinking ""oh maybe that was dementia starting...""."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Today for example my Nan & Granddad, Uncle & Aunt, Mum & Dad are all going out for a meal and to the theater for a show :)As for my Dad, he hasn't shown any signs of sadness or anxiety."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,We'd notice it if he was because it's normally very easy to spot.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"We're just getting on with it, kind of shrugging it off and keep everything normal but now trying to put things in place now that we have a diagnosis.Sorry for such a huge reply again but thank you for being a wonderful help, we really appreciate it."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,:) You need a good doctor and a good lawyer.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Take him to the doctor.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Explain what's happening and that you or your father need to be present for appointments to discuss issues and meds.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Secondly, your father needs to apply for legal conservator of his money, or POA, or guardianship."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,OR he needs to be placed in a memory care facility because legitimately elderly people cannot care for other elderly people.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Especially if he is already hitting his wife.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,There are several meds that help lessen symptoms such as anger and aggression.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,They do not help the disease itself but they will mitigate symptoms so that you all don't want to kill each other.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Have his license taken away.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Driving is not advisable.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,You can easily change this to just a govt issued ID.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,If he cannot be trusted to stay at home or to be civil around his wife you may need to consider having someone move in to help care for them.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Or like I said, a memory care facility."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Neither are cheap.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"In the states memory care places range from $4,000-$6,000 and up per MONTH."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"This entire thing is scary and horribly stressful but it needs to be done, the sooner the better."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,By the time I made it home to help my dad he was hiding knives under his bed and living on hostess snack cakes and not paying the mortgage.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,It was bad.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Hi,I should have mentioned, we are in the UK and healthcare is free and universal so the doctor side of things isn't really an issue especially with our local doctors who are fantastic.He would understand what is happening, but he would be in denial, he would get frustrated, angry and upset and just wouldn't come with us to the doctors (let alone to see someone about POA)He's still mostly all there, he's made it very clear before even when he was much younger that if he needed to go into a home/care facility that he would kill himself as he doesn't want to be a burden nor does he want to be unable to do things for himself."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"We have noticed that recently he has been letting people help more with things which isn't like him, almost like he's starting to realise he can't do everything anymore.In regards to the physical violence, he has stopped and hasn't hit her in 6~ months and that is after we spoke to his wife about how she needs to stop winding him up, going on at him about forgetting things."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"She's the sort of lady who would frustrate even the most sane so I can kind of understand my Granddad but we are all well aware and in agreement that he can't hit, we've told her if he does it again to tell us and we'll have to sit down with him and talk about it with him present as it's unacceptable and will NOT be tolerated.Do you know of any legal means for us to either put a tracker on his car or on his keys (I would put one on his phone but he uses old school phones) just so we know where he is for his safety and our peace of mind."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"His driving is still very very good, I can't really falter him in terms of his driving.We check up on them regularly between the sons and daughters and we also make sure they get out and about, be it food shopping, clothes shopping, random trips to the town for coffee or even take them to the cinema, theatre... etc so we know roughly what they're like, except for the financial side of things he refuses to talk about money and keeps everything private when it comes to money; it's a very British thing to do unfortunately."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,The only gps trackers I know of require a monthly service fee.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,But if he has a newer vehicle services like onstar can be helpful.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Google for a while and see what you can come up with.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,I would work on the money thing if you can.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Just to be sure he isn't giving it away or whatever.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"My dad was very very easily upset about his money, of which I had total control of for the last year of his life."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Most of the time I could redirect him but we did have some major fights about it.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,At the end of the day it's all being done with the persons best interest in mind.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,A lot of people will hide symptoms.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,They won't ask for help out of pride.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,And the will forget they even need help if they do realize it.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Patience is key.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,And persistence.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Be observant and note any changes in behavior etc.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Hi,I posted a lot of stuff over at https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5rto1f/looking_for_advice_on_my_granddads_ever_worsening/desjtge/ about the results of them actually diagnosing him and the dementia uk / age concern lady advised a series of things like power of attorney, letting us know about all of his bills and everything so it can be sorted and managed.After the lady had left he actually drove my Mum back to her home and after dropping my mum off he was supposed to be going back home straight away however an hour and a half later we got a call from our Nan asking if he had left because he wasn't home yet."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,We explained that he had already left and we told her we would drop in to the pub to see if he was in there and drop into the supermarket to see if he was there but just as we were going to leave the house to check the phone went off and it was him.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,He had just got home after 1 hour 40 mins when the car trip home is about 8-10 mins.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,He said that he had gone and done the lottery and looked at some football results.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"Which as far as we are aware would only take 20 mins max, there's still 1 hour 10 mins of unaccountable time."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,We have no idea where he went.
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,It's hard to develop a plan without access to his physicians and medical records - doesn't the spouse have access or any authority?
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"To more practical things: I would ""break"" the car (take out fuses?)"
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,"or ""lose"" the keys so he can't drive - it would be horrible if he harmed someone."
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Limit the amount of cash and try to make sure he doesn't carry checks (my dad would just sign a blank check and hand it to the cashier at stores for them to fill out...).
Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,Make photocopies of identification he carries in his wallet because that will probably get lost.

Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,Non the less of course if you need a phone for it to work of course then it is not good enough.Oh and thanks you may have explained to me why she watches (and complains about watching) the news.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,I have tried to set up netflix for her on the TV but that didn't seem to keep her attention either.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,Speaking of TV a complicated thing for her is the remote.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,She can't understand pushing the device buttons means the remote won't work.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,I have painted the correct device button gold so she could get back to TV/Cable box control but she doesn't understand that.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"Yeah, she depends upon me to switch from listening to music on the CD player back to the TV."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,I'm totally cool with that.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"It kinda spooks me that she'll stare at the blank TV when the CD is done, and I've not noticed the music has ended.I noticed a while ago that even watching our favourite rom-com movies was not satisfying anymore."

Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,You really want something I'd be interested in?

Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,By the time I got an alert ID probably already know grandma was missing.Dementia is hard to nail down but going in the direction of strait monitering is better.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,The less reliant the device is on patient input the better because that would capture a wider range of patients on the cognitive impairment spectrum.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,Wireless baby moniters work well in a lot of these instances because there is no input from the patient.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"Moniters work great, but won't tell me where grandma went when she escaped."

Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,My sister in law recently was part of a search for an elderly patient that escaped their house one night.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"All the neighbors searched for 3 days, and the police eventually started just looking for a body."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,A day laborer stumbled on her in an orchard about a half mile from her house and called the police.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,Every night she was out the temp dropped down into the 30's.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,No one knows how she survived given how sick and frail she normally was.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,A strait up tracker that was always attached to her would have alerted everyone to her exact location and prevented such an arduous search.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"If you can create the tracker I described, you would not only capture consumers who care for elderly wandering patients, but also a ton of parents of special needs children with cognitive impairments, parents of toddlers, or just parents who are paranoid."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,That is a MASSIVE market.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,Thanks for the follow-up.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"I find your response really valuable, but I just want to make a couple comments to make sure I understand your replies.> Yeah, that intercom/speakerphone stuff just wouldn't work for a lot of patients."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"By the time they would need such a device, they wouldn't know how to use it much less know to push a button when they are in need of help."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"The idea, as I envisioned it, is to hear a patient who is crying out."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"The patient wouldn't be using specific voice commands they would need to learn, they would just be shouting for anyone to help them."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"Would this be more useful, since there is nothing the patient needs to know or do except the normal human response?"
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,Or do patients tend to be unable to even call out for help when they are having problems?> A simple text is useless.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,By the time I got an alert ID probably already know grandma was missing.How would you already know that grandma is missing?
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,The product that I envision would be sending an alert at the very moment that the patient leaves the house irregularly.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"Irregularity is to-be-defined, but it might mean leaving at odd hours (after dinner, before breakfast) or any time that the cell phone is not being carried on the person."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"First one, some patients are non verbal."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"My grandmother when she got to the non verbal phase would chew on the insides of her cheeks, fidget profusely or other non verbal queues to suggest to me she needed aid in some way, whether it be a dirty diaper or a cramping muscle or whatever else."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,A baby monitor would catch this most of the time.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"Most moniters have a button I could press to let me speak to her like a walkie talkie to let her know I was coming.The second thing: baby proofing doors can prevent a lot of escapes but not all, but again who care about a blanket text, I watched granny like a hawk but she was sneaky as fuck."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"I should clarify, she had 24 hour live in caregivers (me being the main one) and she still managed to escape."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"She'd wait until I threw a load into the dryer or went to make a bed, or go to the bathroom (with the door open even) and make her move."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"I'd notice the minute I'd walk back into the room where she was sitting which, no joke, I would never leave her more than 3 minutes."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,Grandma was super quick when she wanted to be.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"Once out of the house, even a couple seconds ahead of me she would essentially disappear."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"Again, I am fortunate that she would usually end up in the same place, but most patients aren't like that."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"I'm going to tell you right now, don't bother with cell phones."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"They can be chewed on, flushed, peed on, etc."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"They are impossible to wash, and are useless unless on the patient, which I can just about guarantee, 90% of the time a patient escapes with nothing more than the clothes on their backs and where they are going is the important information, not that they have left an area because a patient can be astonishingly fast when they want to be."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,This isn't just 'simple app stuff' you need to design here.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"There's a zillion apps, and they all have a major flaw, a phone can be destroyed by the patient."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"Trust me, if you want to do this right you need to essentially make a consumer version of those ankle bracelets they put on chronic drunk drivers."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,Putting something on a phone like this would be mostly useless.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,Think of a dementia patient like a giant 2 year old.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,Would you expect a 2 year old to not destroy a phone if for no other reason than to satisfy curiosity?
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,"Also, there were times in the day I wouldn't want anything phone like near grandma because she would stick a lot of things in her mouth."
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,I'd be afraid she'd bite down on it mid sundowning fit.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,It needs to attach to the patient in some way at all times for it to even be mildly effective.The thing you need to understand about dementia is that there are a lot of times a patient is perfectly coherent.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,That's why you want it to be tamper proof.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,It's the times they are suddenly incoherent that is the problem because those moments happen randomly throughout the day and night with zero warning.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,Here is something that may fit your needs.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,I've used it successfully with some clients with dementia.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,It's a gps tracker that goes in the sole of the shoe.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,http://gpssmartsole.com/gpssmartsole/ The closest thing are GPS locators for dogs.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,You can make one into an ankle bracelet.
Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing?,Here are a few of them:https://www.thepawtracker.com/blogs/the-pet-tracker-blog-by-the-paw-tracker/84621315-top-13-gps-pet-trackers-dog-and-cat-cell-phones-best-of-2016-reviewed
Need to hide a Wander Guard,Need to hide a Wander Guard I am a social worker at a nursing home that has a locked memory unit.
Need to hide a Wander Guard,It is a requirement that each of the residents wear a wander guard device that will alert the facility if they attempted to elope.
Need to hide a Wander Guard,It is typically worn on a bracelet around a wrist or ankle.
Need to hide a Wander Guard,"However, one particular resident continues to take it off."
Need to hide a Wander Guard,We need to find a way to mask the wander guard device so that it can be placed on his body and not have him take it off.
Need to hide a Wander Guard,Does anyone have any crafty suggestions on how to disguise/mask/hide it?If he wears a belt look the bracelet around the back so it's connected to the belt but not visible to him.
Need to hide a Wander Guard,"Sew it in a pocket, if the resident's clothes allow for it ?"
Need to hide a Wander Guard,There is only one device per resident.
Need to hide a Wander Guard,"They are probably about $200 a piece, so it wouldn't be practical to sew it into one piece of clothing when they have so many changes of clothes."
Need to hide a Wander Guard,"If they wear pants with a belt, it can be adhered there too."
Need to hide a Wander Guard,"Or if he has glasses, add a necklace/drawstring/lanyard to it and attach the wander guard to it."
Worried About a Neighbor,Worried About a Neighbor I am really sorry if this is the wrong place for this post.
Worried About a Neighbor,If it doesnt belong here I will delete it or the mods can handle it.
Worried About a Neighbor,I will try to keep this as short as possible but it might run on a bit.
Worried About a Neighbor,Last night at ten PM my dogs went crazy and started barking at something outside our front door.
Worried About a Neighbor,I went to look and I saw a little old lady crouched beside my garage hiding from something.
Worried About a Neighbor,"This is in Anchorage, AK and it was 15 degrees out and snowing heavy."
Worried About a Neighbor,"I opened my door and asked ""who was there?"""
Worried About a Neighbor,"and she replied ""its me Susan""."
Worried About a Neighbor,The next couple of sentence she spoke where clear as far as the words go but the words didn't go in any kind of order.
Worried About a Neighbor,So I invited her in and got her something warm to drink.
Worried About a Neighbor,"We chatted for like 20 minutes, she had no ID or other effects with her just a coat, house slippers (her feet where frozen), and a pocket knife."
Worried About a Neighbor,She was very confused about where she was and wether she knew anyone in Anchorage at all.
Worried About a Neighbor,She didn't have a phone or list of contact numbers.
Worried About a Neighbor,At this point she told us she has some kind of dementia.
Worried About a Neighbor,I suggested that we call the police to come help us find out where she should be.
Worried About a Neighbor,"At this she started to become very agitated and upset begging me not to call the cops, crying."
Worried About a Neighbor,She said she could just call a cab.
Worried About a Neighbor,I got her calmed down and told her I could give her a ride if she could remember where her house was.
Worried About a Neighbor,So we got in my car and started looking (I was very skeptical that we would find it) but sure enough after 20 minutes and some back tracking we found her apartment.
Worried About a Neighbor,She invited me in and we hung out for about twenty minutes.
Worried About a Neighbor,Her apartment was cozy and filled with lots of really interesting art by some fairly famous Alaskan artist and bunches of other cool pieces I didn't recognize.
Worried About a Neighbor,"She told me very lucidly about her family, her dead husband, her daughter and sister."
Worried About a Neighbor,She told me all their names and married names and about her grandkids.
Worried About a Neighbor,I gave Susan my phone number and told her if she needed anything to call and not to leave her house again.
Worried About a Neighbor,"Then I left and went home, this was about 11:30 PM."
Worried About a Neighbor,I dropped by her place this morning with coffee and checked up on her.
Worried About a Neighbor,She remembered me (but not my name) and thanked me for my help.
Worried About a Neighbor,"We had a pleasant chat and drank coffee, at certain points she was confused about people, places and things and then other times she spoke very clearly and confidently about things."
Worried About a Neighbor,"So heres my question, I found her adult daughter on Facebook she is a second grade teacher at a school very close by."
Worried About a Neighbor,I want to send her a message but am very uncertain how best to approach the topic.
Worried About a Neighbor,My intentions is to let her know that I found her mom in a pretty unsafe place and if she wants to exchange phone numbers so that if she needs someone close by who can check on her that my wife and I would be happy to help.
Worried About a Neighbor,How do I approach this so I don't make Susan's daughter feel like I am judging her for letting her mom live alone or for what happened.
Worried About a Neighbor,I just don't want to see this lovely older woman get hurt because of improper supervision.
Worried About a Neighbor,At the same time Im just a neighbor its not really any of my business and her family may very well have a good handle on things.
Worried About a Neighbor,Absolutely let her daughter know.
Worried About a Neighbor,People with dementia can be very good at keeping family members fooled as to the extent of their affliction and the daughter may not be fully aware of what's happening.
Worried About a Neighbor,"(Nights can be especially difficult for these patients and if you don't live with someone, you often don't see the full picture.)"
Worried About a Neighbor,"If her family had a good handle on things, she wouldn't have been outside in 15 degree weather."
Worried About a Neighbor,I also would inform APS so that they can follow up and make sure that some sort of support is provided for this woman.
Worried About a Neighbor,"Sometimes families take the ""ostrich approach"" and sort of pretend it's not really happening, and with APS involved, they'll hopefully be provided with different avenues for support in getting help for the mother."
Worried About a Neighbor,You are a kind human to get involved and especially so for checking on her the next day.
Worried About a Neighbor,"By all means, don't feel badly."
Worried About a Neighbor,You did a great job and I'm sure the daughter will be grateful that you stepped in to help.
Worried About a Neighbor,"Thank you, I hadn't thought of APS."
Worried About a Neighbor,Im going to sound like a creeper but I looked through her daughters FB page and there are tons of pictures of her mom with her and her kids at lots of different holiday party and family events from this past summer.
Worried About a Neighbor,From her FB page she looks like she cares about her mom very much so hopefully she will take my message as I intend it.
Worried About a Neighbor,I think she would.
Worried About a Neighbor,You certainly come across as a compassionate person and I for one would be very grateful to someone like yourself.
Worried About a Neighbor,Always nice to know there are wonderful humans like yourself!
Worried About a Neighbor,Good luck and Happy New Year!
Worried About a Neighbor,"I don't know if this will be of any help, but dementia patients in the late stages of the disease experience something called ""sundowning"" which is a time period after sunset when they get extra confused, restless, agitated and anxious."
Worried About a Neighbor,"My grandma who I believe has some form of dementia, too gets very hazy around sunset and often wanders around at night."
Worried About a Neighbor,Because we don't live together we have someone in her village who watches out for her and brings her home and informs us about how she is doing.
Worried About a Neighbor,"I think the old lady's daughter will appreciate your message, concern and offer of help very much."
Worried About a Neighbor,"As someone with a mother with dementia, please contact her daughter!"
Worried About a Neighbor,I would want to know.
Worried About a Neighbor,"She may be in the process of working on things for her mom, but she still deserves to know her mom was lost."
Worried About a Neighbor,You can say to the daughter exactly what you said to us in your last paragraph.
Worried About a Neighbor,":)Also, I would call Adult Protective Services."
Worried About a Neighbor,I had to report my own mother to them.
Worried About a Neighbor,"At first calling APS seemed weird, did it mean there was neglect... for us it was self-neglect on my mom's part."
Worried About a Neighbor,"APS will allow the elderly woman to get the help she needs, and a social worker can check on her.Thank you for caring!"
Worried About a Neighbor,Thank you so much for the response.
Worried About a Neighbor,I am so sorry your family is going through this.
Worried About a Neighbor,"My own mother is getting up there and has a bunch of different health problems, none dementia related and it has been really hard getting her to accept the help she needs."
Worried About a Neighbor,I hope you had a wonderful holiday season.
Worried About a Neighbor,As someone who cares for a loved one with Alzheimer's I would certainly want to know both that dangerous wandering had happened and that there was a caring person nearby willing to help.
Worried About a Neighbor,It was very hard for me to accept help initially but now if someone offers a day/time they can help out I snap up the offer!
Worried About a Neighbor,Tell us what happens  I will I would definitely let the daughter know.She may not realize the danger her mother poses to herself.
Worried About a Neighbor,"Oftentimes, with dementia, the person does fairly well in a familiar environment (like their apartment), but they get very disoriented when they venture out into unrecognized territory.The mother may be experiencing a worsening of symptoms, and if that is the case, it is in everyone's best interest for the daughter to be aware of this."
Worried About a Neighbor,I defineitly noticed this.
Worried About a Neighbor,Once she was back in her apartment she seemed to remember everything a lot better.
Worried About a Neighbor,I sent her daughter a message on FB hopefully she reads it.
Worried About a Neighbor,"Nothing new to add in terms of advice, just want to say that you did  a really good thing."
Worried About a Neighbor,I don't know many people who would have handled the situation with such grace and compassion.
Worried About a Neighbor,Awww... thanks but I think I did what most people would have.
Worried About a Neighbor,"Im just glad I have dogs, if they hadn't started barking I wouldn't have known she was out there."
Heartbroken and Worried,"Heartbroken and Worried My sister in law, 58, was diagnosed with Dementia about 3 years ago."
Heartbroken and Worried,"She was ""ok"" for a while but has been on a steady decline recently."
Heartbroken and Worried,My brother is the primary caregiver and it has taken a toll on his health too.
Heartbroken and Worried,She has recently started sneaking out of the house while he is in the shower.
Heartbroken and Worried,She has a GPS bracelet that she wears that allows them to track her through the Sheriff Dept but it is usually a 2 hour ordeal wondering where she is.
Heartbroken and Worried,"They typically find her sitting in someone's car in the neighborhood, which in itself is scary because people not understanding what's happening could become violent in the protection of their belongings."
Heartbroken and Worried,"We saw them tonight for Christmas Eve and when she arrived she was crying and breathing heavily from what her doctor has said in the past, is a panic or anxiety attack."
Heartbroken and Worried,She has trouble forming coherent sentences and most of the time just mumbles.
Heartbroken and Worried,Very restless.
Heartbroken and Worried,Sits down and then gets right up and starts wandering around the house.
Heartbroken and Worried,My brother is torn on placing her in a nursing home.
Heartbroken and Worried,They don't have the money to pay thousands a month for her care in a nursing home of his choosing and has been denied MediCaid/Care on 3 separate occasions.
Heartbroken and Worried,"Someone even told him he needs to divorce her which would make a ward of the state and they would then place her, but they could put her in a home anywhere in the state."
Heartbroken and Worried,She is the light of my brother's life.
Heartbroken and Worried,They have been together since their junior year of high school.
Heartbroken and Worried,Does anyone on this sub Reddit have any advice on where to turn for help or assistance?No question about it.
Heartbroken and Worried,Put her in an institution.
Heartbroken and Worried,Otherwise it takes down two people.
Heartbroken and Worried,"Apply for Disability on her behalf, that would bring in some money."
Heartbroken and Worried,"I did for Early Onset Dementia and got it, to the tune of about $400 a month."
Heartbroken and Worried,This is not safe and your brother needs help.
Heartbroken and Worried,Please call the Alzheimers Association and tell them you need resources and advice.
Heartbroken and Worried,"Ca APS, tell them you are concerned about her safety (wandering!)"
Heartbroken and Worried,and health.
Heartbroken and Worried,They can provide help as well.

Tracking people with dementia,Tracking people with dementia My father-in-law has early signs of alzheimer's.
Tracking people with dementia,He's still pretty functional.
Tracking people with dementia,He still drives.
Tracking people with dementia,My mother-in-law is concerned because he sometimes gets lost.
Tracking people with dementia,"I've researched some tracking devices, but they all seem to have bad reviews."
Tracking people with dementia,"Does anyone know of some that really work and aren't very expensive?Has anyone used those ""tile"" devices for tracking?"

Tracking people with dementia,He has regular cell phone that he rarely turns on.
Tracking people with dementia,He hates technology  This is not a tracking option but could help.
Tracking people with dementia,Find him a cell phone similar to his current that has an sos button.
Tracking people with dementia,This is a dedicated button that calls a programmed number.
Tracking people with dementia,The one we used would even turn the phone on and then dial the number if needed.
Tracking people with dementia,They are starting to make tracking watches (often for children) that use a SIM card but that is another thing your father (or mother) will have to make sure is charged and he is wearing and had poor reviews.
Tracking people with dementia,"Again I have no help to offer in the tracker as I like you, viewed the options and could decide if any were actually up to snuff."
Tracking people with dementia,I'm in the same boat with you.My mom carried PocketFinder for awhile but stopped carrying it regularly.

Tracking people with dementia,Thankfully she is not a wanderer.
Tracking people with dementia,"In fact,  she doesn't even want to leave home most days.Have you considered an android or apple watch on a cellular data plan?"
Tracking people with dementia,There are geo location apps on the watches that help you track your routes.
Tracking people with dementia,You would be able to see the routes on a computer.
Tracking people with dementia,It would be both functional for him (keeps time and shows date) and for you (tracking mechanism).
Tracking people with dementia,Have you considered getting your father in law a medical ID bracelet or med ID dog tag style necklace?

Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes I'm sorry for what's going to be a long, untidy, and overwrought first post."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,I had a terrible day today (complete with my very first panic attack) and need to vent and ask for some advice.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,When I was 13 my mother suffered a traumatic brain injury.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"She gradually recovered, but over the following decades had a number of unrelated surgeries and health issues."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"I ended up taking on varying degrees of caregiver responsibilities throughout all of it.Now I am 36 and she is 77, and I am feeling increasingly depressed, hopeless, frustrated, angry, and frightened."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,At this point she is suffering from severe memory and cognitive issues.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"The memory problems I can almost deal with, but I simply don't know how to handle her inability to think rationally."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,I'm stuck in a cycle where I feel like if I can just find the right way to explain something she'll understand it.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"I know it's not going to happen, but I don't know what else to do when she harasses me relentlessly with questions and then insists on debating the answers."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,An example: she gets four pain pills a day that are put into a sectioned box for her.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"She insists she MUST MUST MUST have control over that box (I keep the rest of the month's supply locked up, because she WILL overdose if she can access them.)"
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"I put the box with the pills on the kitchen table in the morning for her, and once she takes them she doesn't get any more until the following day."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,Without fail she will move the box and lose it.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,She'll then seek me out and tell me that I failed to give her her pain pills.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"I'll explain that she moved them and lost them, as she does every day."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,She'll say that I put them on the table in the mornings.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"I agree that, yes, that's true, but she's the one who later moves them OFF the table."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,She'll repeat that I put them on the table in the morning.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,I'll try to figure out why she thinks that information is relevant.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,I spend half an hour looking and finally find the pill box hidden under her socks in the bottom drawer of her dresser.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,I remind her we go through this multiple times a day and put them back on the table.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,She insists she never loses them.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"I walk away, and five minutes later she tells me she has no pills and I must have forgotten to give them to her."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"What's missing from that cheerful little scenario is the gas lighting, subject changes, and general drama that surrounds the entire conversation."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"As I'm looking for the pills she's following me asking me what I'm looking for, reminding me I was the one who put the pills on the table (yes, I know, THANK YOU), insisting I haven't given her pills for weeks, switching topics mid sentence to ask what her doctor said at her appt last week, arguing with me when I tell her, and asking me if I have my period because she doesn't understand why I'm getting so frustrated."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"Now, there's an obvious answer here, right?"
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,Just take the pills away so she has to ask for one when she wants it and they don't get lost.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,Except when I do that she harasses me even more.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,Why do I have HER pills?
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"No, she never lost them, that's bullshit."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,Why am I treating her like a child.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,How dare I suggest she can't keep track of them or that I have to care for her on any level.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"And on and on and on and ON To be clear, this behavior isn't just about the pills."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"She does this for everything, even the simplest of questions."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"She'll ask the date, I'll answer, and she'll stare at the calendar, shake her head, and say she doesn't understand."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,Just trusting that I am in fact correct is impossible.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,Now I know she's not purposely doing this to stress me out.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,Though I do feel confused and conflicted that she seems to be ale to take other people at their word.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"If she asks them a question and they answer she might repeat the question several more times, but she won't insist they are wrong or use the question as a starting point for a two hour long debate."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"So I'm curious why she does this to me, even though she's driven me to tears on multiple occasions."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,She'll keep going when I'm literally begging to be allowed to sit and eat for just five minutes without having to answer any questions.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"As far as the family situation, I'm the youngest of six and none of my siblings have any interest or involvement in care giving duties."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,Several of them have outright stated that mom is 'my job'.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"Outside of that, I might as well not exist for them."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,They'll never once asked for more information on her medical conditions and I can't imagine them ever asking how I'm coping.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"My father worked several jobs when I was young, which is the reason taking care of my mother got pushed off on me (I'm not necessarily saying it was a good reason, just...an understandable one?"
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,I may resent it a little.)
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,By the time I was a young adult the pattern had been established and any time she had a surgery or illness I was the one expected to take off work so he could continue paying the bills.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"Now he works nights and sleeps all day, and interacts with mom for MAYBE an hour each night."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"I do all of the cooking, cleaning, taking her to appts, and deal with the endless questions."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"For whatever reason, she does not harass him and will hush me if I'm frustrated because he's sleeping and 'shouldn't have to deal with this.'"
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"But I should, I guess?"
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"When they do interact, he really has a hard time coping and gets frustrated within seconds."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"I know how hard all of this is, but he takes it very personally if she can't remember things and I end up running interference between them."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"And yes, I know how messed that is, and the funny thing is that when I was a teen I used to say I would never become my father's wife."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,Meaning I wouldn't cook for her or clean up after her like he wasn't capable of doing it himself like my mom used to.
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"Well, now I've become my father's wife and my mother's husband, and fuck all if I know how it happened."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,"On the legal and financial side, I'm screwed."
Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes,When I was fresh out of college I gave up a great career opportunity because mom was sick and it would have meant moving away from her.

Dealing with my mother with dementia,Dealing with my mother with dementia tl;dr: Mother has been recently diagnosed with dementia.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I need help and advice.SORRY FOR THE LONG POST.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,NEEDED TO VENT.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE AND MY THOUGHTS ARE ALL MESSED UP, SO IF YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING PLEASE LET ME KNOWHello, I am 29 years old and my mother is almost 74."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,StoryShe has been getting worse since 2010 (noticeably) and I suspect that it started in 2003/2002.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Even though she has been getting worse since 2010 we've only been seeking doctors since dcember 2014.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,This is due to the fact that she was taking care of her own mother (96 years) who had been bed ridden since 2010.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"She had a pretty strong stroke and later had successive micro infartions in her brain completely destroying it, spending the last 3 years in bed screaming non stop (really non stop) until her death in august 2014."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"We all believed that my mother was just suffering from depression, lack of sleep, unbelievable stress (I took care of my grandmother a few times ..."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I couldn't stand it for 20 minutes, let alone 2/3 years)."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Then she started sinking .. fast ... REALLY fast.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I forced her to go to neurologists (she lives in a small town in a third world country, where she was a doctor (geriatrics and nephrologist) until 2010, for 41 years) and it took a really long time to take her to the doctor (500km away)."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,He sent for a few tests and it took us a really long time to get back to him due to my mother's panic attacks making it impossible to travel.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"So, we looked for doctors in town."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"One of them NEVER said she had anything, just medicated her with donepecile clorhydrate and memantine clorhydrate (both used in the treatment of alzheimer), which only made her worst and the other doctor said she didn't have alzheimer nor dementia and he'd consult his coleagues and get back to us in 2 weeks."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,3 months later we had to track him down and practically beg to get our tests back so we could go to another doctor.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"After that I tried taking her with me to where I live, a large brazilian city and my mother lives in a small uruguayan city."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I tried taking her with me but she went completely crazy after arrival and I had to take her back home immediately (after 1 hour in my city) by car, where she procceeded to freak out the entire 6 hour ride and open her door while a car was passing us."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Finally we go to a new doctor a month and a half ago who said it clearly .. she has dementia.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"At that time my world came crumbling down and I barely heard a few thing: ""She's probably had several microinfartions in her brain, which is certainly why she is always dizzy."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,She certainly has mixed dementia and is firmly planted in the 4th stage of dementia and presenting some symptoms from the 5th stage.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Her dementia has a vascular side to it certainly and presents some symptoms similar to alzheimer and another dementia.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"We need to perform a pet scan with the FDG and PIB markers to get a better idea""."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"This destroyed me, but ok, I'm prepared I can manage."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,It turns out that I'm not prepared and I can't manage.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,After the doctor's visit she has been progressively worse very fast.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Until a week and a half ago she was taken by her brother to the emergency room because she stopped talking and was completely stiff.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"Turns out she was severely dehydrated (probably a combination of medicine) and since then she can barely walk a little bit with help because she falls on her back if you don't grab her (her position is literally like the back slash ), doesn't take her medicine (we basically wait until they dissolve in her mouth), doesn't eat well, doesn't drink a lot of water and rarely ever makes sense or is able to pronounce all the words she wants."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I checked this link about the stages of dementia and I can certainly tell you that she is now firmly in stage 5 and hast at least 75% of the symptoms of the 6th stage of dementia.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,She went from 4/5 to 5/6 in just 3 weeks and I'm scared.Ok.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Sorry for the long vent but I needed it.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Now I'll post some probably relevant information and ask you some questions and ask for some guidance.Info-I'm an only son-She lives with her brother (71) and he has hired 3 more women to help him take car of her.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"2 of them have been with her for a long time (one of them is a nurse and the other one helped take care of my grandmother) and they are absolutely wonderful with my mother and then a new one, that seems kinda useless (also a nurse my mother knows) because she's really quiet and I don't know if she can deal with my mother, but has planted herself as an ok care giver.- I don't put her somewhere to take care of her because in her city, many of the asylums are known for hitting/hurting their patients or keeping them drugged up."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,And if I took her to one in my city she would freak out.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I also don't take her to one in Uruguay's capital because of this link.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,- I live 500km away in Brazil.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,She lives in Uruguy.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I have a job and if I had another boss I'd be fired already.

Dealing with my mother with dementia,This is specially kind considering the economical crisis that is happening in Brazil.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,The past 6 months I've spent at least 3 here.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,And since she's been taken to the hospital until her pet scan I can't get back to work.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I'd be fired anywhere else.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I have a really great boss (no, he doesn't reddit).Current symtpoms- Can't walk without help.- Can't do anything without help.- Can't maintain a conversation.- Confuses past and present.- Talks to dead people.- Confuses me for her brother and her brother for her father that died in 1977- Confuses TV and reality- If we don't give her medicine that make her sleepy she doesn't sleep.- She starts crying non stop after all medications wear off and stays like that for about 6 hours."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I don't want to give her too much because it could make her worse, but if I don't give her something she'll kill herself."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"She literally tenses up for 6 hours tried to fight, get up and all that until her next medicineQuestions- How accurate is the link stating the stages of dementia?- I know my mother has mixed dementia."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I know one of them is vascular dementia, another one could be alzheimer."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Any suggestions?
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Until we make all the tests it's impossible to know and they might take some time.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"Even if it's wrong, someone giving me an idea is better than nothing.- How can I give her her medicine?- She's been getting really dizzy after she goes to the bathroom."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Waht could it be?
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I already tried talking to her doctor but he isn't here.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,He'll only be back by friday next week.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Any suggestions are welcome.- Has anyone experienced such a fast decline in health?
Dealing with my mother with dementia,In january she was able to talk perfectly (was kinda forgetful and dizzy) and she was able to walk.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"The nurse we hired was hired back then because my mother had a tendency to do whatever she wanted, not take her medicine or take any other medicine in any doses (we didn't know it was dementia, I had my suspitions but I'm an engineer, not a doctor, and no other doctor said it at the time)."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"In march she had a lot of difficulty saying some words and started creating memories (If I said a number and someone said bank she would get it in her head that she needed to go to the bank to deposit the number I said in her account .. she did that for weeks, every day at least 50 times a day and she would read a piece of paper put it down then pick it up again and read it again .. she did that for 30 minutes non stop .."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I timed it once).
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"An in the last 2 weeks she can't dfferentiate between television and real life, she has hallucinations, can't maintain a conversation, can't do absolutely anything without help and is getting worse."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I can feel her getting worse and everybody else around her as well.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Advice- How can I make her feel better?- Does anyone know how to deal with this?
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I'm kinda young and wasn't expecting to go through this at all, even though my mother had me almost at 45."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"She's always been a rock for her entire family and many people in the city (remember she was a doctor .. a beloved doctor to some a hated/loved/respected co-worker to others).- I live 500km away and besided going to her house every weekend and on emergencies I don't know what else to doEDIT: Added a question and reformated some of the textFirstly, I am so sorry you are struggling with this."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I am a dementia specialist carer completing a degree in Dementia Studies in the UK, I will try to answer your questions as thoroughly as I can.Please excuse the wall of text, I'm on my phone."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"Progression: It's likely that due to her vascular dementia she is continuing to have what are known as TIA'S, which is a ""transient ischemic attack."""
Dealing with my mother with dementia,This is basically a mini stroke and could be behind the quick deterioration.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Alzheimers disease progresses steadily instead of in steps.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"A vascular dementia will be like going down in steps, and can happen over a few days or a few years."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"Diagnosis: whilst this is not the nicest fact, it's true."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,The only way to 100% diagnose a dementia is via an autopsy of the brain.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"When a doctor diagnoses a dementia, it is not set in stone."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"So far the vascular dementia diagnosis sounds accurate, so does the alzheimers disease."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"You mentioned she also talks to people that aren't there, do you mean she is talking to a person and mistaking them for someone else or talking to an empty space?"
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"If it's the latter, it is possible she has a lewy body dementia also."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,This can cause hallucinations and symptoms like Parkinsons disease.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,There are around 500 different types of Dementia.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"It is unfortunately very difficult to diagnose.Medication: most medications are also available in a liquid form, and if not then in a soluble form so they dissolve in water."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"You can also get medication that dissolves in the mouth, speak to your mum's regular doctor about switching to liquid or soluble medication."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"If it's pain relief, you can get transdermal patches (usually either fentanyl or buprenorphine)."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,These are basically plasters that stay on for between 3-7 days and release a certain hourly dose of pain relief that is absorbed through the skin.Her mood: with dementia one of the most difficult things is often that the person cannot express themselves anymore.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Think of your mum like an iceberg (weird but hear me out) what you see is what is above the surface  (crying or being angry) and that's her way of communicating to you that something is wrong.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"Below the surface, that's where the problem is and unfortunately you can't see it."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"It could be something like needing the toilet, pain, feeling sick, shoes being too tight, discomfort, not hearing well, not seeing well, things being in the wrong place, frustration as she doesn't know what to do, she's tired."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,It's mostly about trial and error.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"It could be that she is experiencing depression as this is unfortunately very common in people living with a dementia, especially alzheimers disease."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Medication like fluoxitine or citalopram (which are available in liquid form) can help.Stages of dementia: the link is not very accurate.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"Everyone's experience of Dementia is intrinsic to them, no one else will experience it the same way."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"Generally stages are referred to as ""early"", ""middle"" or ""late"".Dizziness: if by bathroom you mean urinating, she may have a urinary tract infection."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"If you mean pooing, she could be constipated."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"If she is just getting dizzy when she stands, it could be an issue with her blood pressure."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,It could also be none of those and something else entirely.How can you make her feel better: you will know this better than anyone else.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"Try things that your mum liked in the past, or really anything at all."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Again it's a bit of trial and error.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,You may not always be able to make her feel better.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"It's also important to focus on what she can do, not what she can't do."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"If she is able to eat with her fingers instead of cutlery then great, that means she can eat independently and will give her that little bit of confidence."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Try and encourage her to do as much as she can.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Try to go along with her reality.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"If in that moment she believes you are her brother, try not to tell her otherwise."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I know it's very upsetting :(Coping: there is no one way to cope with this.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I live in the UK, and we have a couple of organisations that can help on the Internet."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Try www.alzheimers.org.uk or www.dementiafriends.org.uk.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Both of these have forums and people to talk to who are going through similar things as you.

Dealing with my mother with dementia,"Most importantly, remember to take care of yourself."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,It is extremely hard being a carer for a family member and you need to make sure you are the number one priority.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Let me start by saying thank you to your advices.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Some of the things you said I didn't know where possible (or just forgot) and were extremely helpful.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,About the diagnosis portion: - She has talked to dead people but rarely.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"Looking back, they happened when she out right refused to sleep for 48 hours and sometimes after she takes the quetiapine (she really tries to fight the urge to sleep ... it usually takes at least 3/4 hours to make her sleep with 25mg of quetiapine)."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"But she confuses people all the time and I never contradict her, even when she can't say words I just complete her thoughts with random words like ... ""thing"", ""them"", ""him"", ""her"", etc.About the liquid medicine."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I completely forgot about it.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I'll talk to her physician.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,About the mood.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I almost understand her behaviour like science.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I can tell when she needs to pee, I can tell when she starts getting too agitated and then starts crying non stop (usually a few hours after citalopram) so I give her plidex, a medicine with 3.5mg of diazepam."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"It usually calms her down but it doesn't work all the time and I am really afraid of giving her too much medicine, because I know it can worsen her condition.About the bathroom."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Probably too much information given in the original text.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I just meant to say that she barely walks to and from the bathroom.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Today she walked a lot more than she usually does and she did it until her legs were shaking (it's really difficult to tell when she's tired ...
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I said she walked a lot more but it must have added up to 1 or 2 blocks, which is not much).About the dizziness."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"It started in 2002/2003 (I was 14) when all of a sudden she stood up from the couch looking like she was agonizing and she ""drunk walked"" (body pressed against a wall) until she reached the bathroom and started puking."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"She put her head on the sink, spread her legs and put her butt on the wall (very thin bathroom) or else she would fall."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I attribute that episode to the beginning of her condition, I truly believe that this is the moment she had her first micro infartion."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"She went to doctors but they all said: ""you're fiiiine .. you're gonna outlive us all"" and all that ""jazz""."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Some of them treated her for vertigo.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"She suspected it wasn't vertigo, but like all doctors, if there isn't anything showing on THEIR OWN exams, then it's nothing."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,She did the next MRI many years later when I forced her to and by then the damage was already done.About making feel better.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"The thing about doing things she liked is that the only thing she did was work, drink some mate with her mother while watching TV and she can't watch TV anymore because she confuses reality and TV."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Fortunately I always aggree with her reality and I go along with everything.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Probably the only thing I was doing right.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"The only thing I can make her do is hug her and kiss her a lot, because it's the only way we can communicate, but it's really difficult for me, I'm not a very touchy person, I don't like being affectionate, I wasn't even affectionate as a child, but I can't complain."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,That's one f the few moments she feels well.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,What kills me are the 5 minutes she's completely lucid she says that she wants to die or asks me to kill her.About coping.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,This is my first attempt at coping.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I tried talking with her brother, but he's kinda closed up and the rest of the people don't really understand."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"As much as they may love their grandparents, when it happens to a parent or parental figure it's so much worst."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"When my grandmother had it I prepared myself and was able to get over it really fast, but now that it's happening to my mother I'm breaking down.About being a carer."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I am while I'm here.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"It kills me but I can't leave my job to take care of her and I can't take my job closer to her, so I'll have to worry whenever I'm away and stay by her side when I'm not working.Again thank you for your help."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"Saying these things actually made me feel better and understand it a bit more, even though I couldn't give much information and also pardon my english."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"It's not rusty, I use it every day for my job, but it isn't my first language and I find it difficult to express myself sometimes."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"If she's this advanced, I'm not convinced that she will be able tell whether she's in Uruguay or Brazil."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"In any case, you really need to secure your own position in order to give her the best care possible."

Dealing with my mother with dementia,There's been a bit of research in transfer trauma.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,There's a reason old people don't like change.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,What I can say about coping is that with family members of those affected by dementia this is really where the grieving process start to happen.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Your mother is no longer who she was.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,You may have glimpses of the past ohlf what what she wants was.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,But there will be no recovery.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,It does not get better it's really about prolonging the life and keeping the affected as comfortable as possible.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Whenever you are dealing with behavior the best thing you can do is meet her where she is.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,If she is looking for her mother do not tell her her mother is dead.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Tell her that Mom is at the store or someone else is watching Mom for a bit and she gets to relax depending on what time her mind is at.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I'm a firm believer that reorienting is one of the worst things you can do because it causes the person to relive that grief every time.Don't push yourself too hard and know where you're at your limits.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,You can't be a good caretaker when you're tired.

Dealing with my mother with dementia,He left the room almost shaking.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Looked like a terrified kid It progresses differently for everyone.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,:\ I've seen people walking and talking (although very confused) pass a few weeks later from rapid decline.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I've seen one woman linger for a few years bed bound and completely unable.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Total assistance with everything.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,It may be unusually fast but it isn't unheard of.As for the behavior I would recommend seeing if there is any medication that could be given as needed.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,The key thing in my opinion is comfort.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I'll do that, thank you This sounds really awful for you, and I'm sorry that you've got such a tragedy going on with your mother.Do you think her sudden decline might be because she continues to have strokes?"
Dealing with my mother with dementia,It almost sounds like she may be regularly having little ones.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Is the medication she is on available in any other form besides pills?
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"Perhaps her caregivers could give her injections or something.I don't really think there is much you can do to make her feel better, to be honest."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I know that you desperately want to, but she is likely past the point where she could be easily soothed or treated for particular issues."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,Is there any kind of sedative or anxiety reducing medication in her treatment regimen?
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"I suspect it, but they haven't done a new MRI to confirm it, just a cat scan (I think that's what it's called in english) and they say that it came out ok. About the injections ... yeah."
Dealing with my mother with dementia,I'm really worried about turning her into a pin cushion.
Dealing with my mother with dementia,"And yes there is anxiety medication, but when it doesn't work it really doesn't work."

Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,Question 1.
Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,"""The person needs to remember to wear them""."
Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,I often get asked this question.
Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,Our research from speaking to carers in the field is that people with the disease often have very limited shoes often one or two pairs.
Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,So we feel confident that our device will be in the right place at the right time.

Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,One is having large charging coils to allow for large charging zones.
Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,Our hope is that the person can simply have this charging pad where they would normally put their shoes and just place their shoes on their.
Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,Our aim is to have the insoles charging inside the shoes.We don't want to break the persons routine so we try and consider this every aspect of our design.I hope this answers your questions if not I can clarify  It would be cool if walking charged the device.
Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,Maybe that's  too far in the future.
Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,Hi kbsncme Sorry for the very late reply.
Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,That is something we hope to introduce in V2.0 in our device.
Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,In 1-2 years.
Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease,perhaps the technology will be there.

Selfish caregiver?,Selfish caregiver?
Selfish caregiver?,"Hi everyone,Thank you for reading."
Selfish caregiver?,I just need some advice on how to cope right now.
Selfish caregiver?,"I am thirty, and my 28 year old husband is currently in the hospital for a month undergoing a bone marrow transplant."
Selfish caregiver?,"He had advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma and there is a fifty fifty chance he will make it.He has already undergoing a year of treatment, and we face another year after this."
Selfish caregiver?,"Before this I have dealt with some health issues, a difficult job, and some depression issues."
Selfish caregiver?,"We moved a year before his diagnosis, so I don't have a big net of friends to lean on, and my husband is very introverted and really just hangs around me."
Selfish caregiver?,"I feel so embarrassed saying this, but I have developed bulemia as a result of the stress."
Selfish caregiver?,It hurts to eat due to my medical issues I just purge every night now.
Selfish caregiver?,Since I am at the hospital with him every day and come home and spend the night alone It has evolved over the last few months into binging and taking anxiety medications and sleeping pills to stay calm.Everyone in my life feels sorry for me.
Selfish caregiver?,"It makes me feel pathetic...I wish I was able to be more positive and optimistic about our situation, but I try my best just to hide it enough from my husband."
Selfish caregiver?,I feel so selfish I am so depressed I can even take care of myself enough to do the dishes or keep the house clean.
Selfish caregiver?,"For the most part, I have spent all my free time lying around in bed because I just don't want to face anything outside of work and the cancer.Thanks for reading."
Selfish caregiver?,"I called a therapist to talk to someone about the bulemia issue and to help get me back on track, but an other advice would be welcome.My heart goes out to you."
Selfish caregiver?,"I'm considerably older and take care of my wife with AD, however I can certainly relate with the feelings of depression and loneliness that comes with carrying the torch alone.A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon journaling as a technique that might help get my head straight."
Selfish caregiver?,"I started to read a lot of very positive comments about the technique and found a free app called ""Journey"" that could be used."
Selfish caregiver?,So I started.
Selfish caregiver?,"Interesting that after only a couple of weeks, I'm beginning to look forward to each day sitting with a coffee before my wife awakes, and just babbling to noone.One of the bits of advice was to include a comment about what I am grateful for....hello...grateful?"
Selfish caregiver?,"Actually, I have a lot to be grateful for, and thinking about it and writing it down and then rereading it a few days later is helpful."
Selfish caregiver?,Actually does lift the spirit.
Selfish caregiver?,"So look into journaling....it's free, easy to do, helps to get some focus on your feelings, and lots of people swear that it helps.Another item that might help is to read the recent commencement speech by Sheryl Sandberg."
Selfish caregiver?,I saw it in the news and was impressed by her comments....she also speaks about recording a joy from each day.
Selfish caregiver?,"A helpful speech.http://fortune.com/2016/05/14/sandberg-uc-berkley-transcript/Remember that there are always people that have it worse than we do, and be inspired by how they cope."
Selfish caregiver?,Best of luck to you.
Selfish caregiver?,From my perspective you are beating yourself up over some perfectly rational & valid behavior.
Selfish caregiver?,"You have an awful lot to deal with right now, so it's no wonder you don't have energy left for the dishes."
Selfish caregiver?,It's easy to underestimate just how physically taxing emotional exhaustion is.Quiet time in bed is one of my main coping skills.
Selfish caregiver?,"Kick back, pet the cat, maybe watch something on TV."
Selfish caregiver?,Best way to recharge.
Selfish caregiver?,The trick for me is to give my brain something else to do besides think about things.

Gas Stove Scare,Gas Stove Scare First off.
Gas Stove Scare,I thank God I was working from home today.
Gas Stove Scare,My mom is 84.
Gas Stove Scare,"And I've suspected she has dementia from other clues (she asks the same questions repeatedly, she's forgotten how to do things she's always done, she's ""slower"" in her gait and seems constantly unsure, etc)."
Gas Stove Scare,But she has more good days than bad on average.
Gas Stove Scare,Well today I was working from home and in my den.
Gas Stove Scare,The den is around the corner from the kitchen.
Gas Stove Scare,"My mom had gone in to make herself lunch, nothing unusual about that."
Gas Stove Scare,The only thing I've taken over has been her medication preparation and distribution since I suspected she's forgotten to take it one day.She'd gone back to her room and I started smelling gas.
Gas Stove Scare,She'd turn off the taps but turned it back on without letting the auto ignition click on to light the flame.
Gas Stove Scare,If I'd have been at the office there would have been a tragedy.
Gas Stove Scare,She could have asphyxiated (???)
Gas Stove Scare,"or could have blown up the house.My house is pretty much wallpapered in notes to keep her on track, but I'm thinking I'll be ordering an electric stove today after this scare.Getting her to the doctor for an evaluation is also indicated, as some forms of dementia are reversible, while others so fast moving that the stove investment may be rapidly followed by an out of home placement, making it a waste of money."
Gas Stove Scare,Remove the handles so she can't turn on the stove anymore.

MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"The very real possibility that she might become paranoid enough to harm your father should be brought up with her doctor, as well as the wandering."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"With both those, she could be committed involuntarily (or ""sectioned"", depending on your country)."

MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,Do you know for sure what type of dementia she has?
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,I have been reading about Lewy Body Dementia and it sounds like the drugs really do have an effect on the quality of life of someone with dementia and can help lessen some of this behavior if they are correctly diagnosed and given the corrects medication.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,At least one of you should read about the medications and get to know it and any changes in her behavior to make sure its going ok.  Doctors rely on accurate representations of the patient's behavior.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,My father was never put on a memory medication for 5 years and is only now getting it.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,They also changed his meds to reflect Lewy Body dementia rather than Parkinson's and its really made a huge difference.My other advice though if improved medication does not cut it is to get her to a place where she will be safe.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,I don't unfortunately.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,Until now my in laws approach to this has mostly been to ignore it or make excuses.

MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"She was diagnosed two years ago, but is not on medication currently because at the time she refused it and no one has brought it back up since."

MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,I did a quick search and found this kids watch.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"One feature I liked was the ""Electric fence"" ""After adding an electric fence name, you can set a fence with the watch as the centre and with a radius of 100 to 5000."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"The APP Client will receive an alarm when the watch enters or exits the fence."""
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,Maybe he could slip this in her purse instead.This is a whole page filled with tracking devices.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"One of them goes in their shoe.As a simple not tech solution, put her information in all of her clothing."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,Like a kid going off to camp.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"That way if the high tech solution fails the cops can look inside her coat, shirt, or pants and find out who she is and who to call."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,Thank you for the resources and suggestions.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,I am going to talk to my father in law about adding her name to clothes.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,The insole GPS is actually one I'm considering.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"I don't see many reviews on it.m, but it will probably be her best bet."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,If she can remove it I'm almost positive she will.

MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"It has a GPS in it, and if she wanders the police will be able to locate her."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,I use Pocket Finder.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"It's a bit chunky, about the size of the palm of your hand."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"Does your loved one habitually carry a certain item, like keys, or a purse?"
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"My loved one wanders too, but always brings her purse."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"If so, you might be able to find a way to hide or secure it to that item."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"Like this incident you described, it's not a foolproof strategy because they might not bring it- but it's an idea."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"I charge it twice weekly, and re-sew it into the lining of her purse each time."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"There are different power settings- to save battery, you can put it in airplane mode and just activate to tracking mode when you need to locate her."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"It is VERY accurate., quick and user friendly."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,I have used it three times to find my loved one.

MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"Thank you, I did find some information in Project Lifesaver and will call them in the morning."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"I'm pretty sure my FIL has secured anything dangerous because she has threatened him in the past, but when I speak to him tomorrow I will ask him to go back over the house."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,It's a great suggestion at this point.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,After the wandering episode the other day she is even more out of sorts than normal.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"A lock box (like the fire proof kind you can use for documents) might work, so your FIL can still access those things when needed (knives, scissors, meds etc).I'm sorry to hear all this."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,My loved one has gotten agitated and physical with me twice.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"I made myself a ""three strikes"" deal- if she lays a hand on me ever again, I'm done and out."

MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"I actually stepped way back and now only see my LO 1-2x/week, and it's been a huge relief to my mental and physical health."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"Maybe your FIL needs to make a similar deal, draw some sort of line- he does not have to live with physical abuse, whether the abuser is of sound mind or not."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"She can't necessarily help or control how she's behaving, but he doesn't have to suffer as well."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"There have been many, many instances in which the person with dementia and/or the caregiver have both suffered serious physical harm, as a result of agitation/violence, stress, and an unsafe environment."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"I think sometimes the best, kindest thing to do is admit when it's too much."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"For what it's worth, the top reasons for someone to be placed in memory care are: agitation & violence, wandering and incontinence."

MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,It's a very well known connection to behavioral disturbances and violence in dementia.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"It can really add a lot of confusion and paranoia, and sudden behavioral changes."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,It might also just be how the disease will progress for her.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"I know you said they don't have health insurance right now, but it's past the time for medication."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"He can call 911 or bring her to the emergency room if it gets bad, and they will have to treat her."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"If he refuses to bring her home, then they have no option other than to keep her, or they can send her to a geriatric psychiatric unit which will stabilize her with medication."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"If they are having financial difficulty, she might be eligible for Medicaid, which is actually a good thing with dementia."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,Medicaid covers the cost of long term care in a nursing home/memory care facility.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,There's no easy answers.

MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,You brought up a lot of things we hadn't thought of.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,I appreciate the thought out reply.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"We are having a family meeting tomorrow to figure out the next steps, so you've given me lots to talk over with everyone."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"From my research and what I've seen posted, they make them but they are pretty expensive."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,One of the best solutions I've seen is buying a cheap phone with GPS and getting a cheap plan and installing a parental app that can track the phone.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,I don't know what the app is called but from what I understand parents use them to track their kids with the GPS in the phone.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"This only works if they keep the phone on them, I've heard of sowing the phone into there pocket but keeping it charged would be though and they would have to wear the same pants."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,This is actually what my FIL currently does.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,He keeps it in her purse because she doesn't like to even leave the room without the purse.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,Unfortunately she left it behind this morning when she left.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"The wearable devices are very expensive though, so I guess I'm just wondering if it's actually worth the cost."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,In the meantime I will talk to him about trying to figure out a way to keep the phone on her instead of her purse.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"I don't have any experience with them so I don't know if they are worth it or not, but I think if they have the right health insurance then it might cover some of the cost."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,Can you guys camouflage the doors?
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,Add an alarm to the door so he'll know if she leaves?
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,We are definitely adding an alarm to the door.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"I think Seroquel, Trazodone and Ativan would be much more effective at helping keep track of your MIL than a GPS."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"The logic runs to me that if she needs a GPS, what she really needs a boatload of meds and/or to live in a lockdown memory care unit."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"I agree that it is time for medication, and we are pushing for an emergency appointment with her doctor to re-evaluate."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,The GPS is for the more immediate moment and for peace of mind from now on.
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,"Even on medication, dementia patients sometimes wander off just from confusion."
MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective?,Now that it's happened once we want to make sure we are doing everything possible to avoid her wandering off on her own for any reason.

Tracking Devices for Patients?,Tracking Devices for Patients?
Tracking Devices for Patients?,I'm trying to find a GPS tracking device for my father.
Tracking Devices for Patients?,The highlight of his day is taking our two dogs for a walk around the neighborhood.
Tracking Devices for Patients?,The disease is starting to progress more rapidly and I'm increasingly concerned about him getting lost on his walks.
Tracking Devices for Patients?,Does anyone have any suggestion for a GPS tracker that I could have him wear or attach to his keys?
Tracking Devices for Patients?,"I'd like to be able to track his movements on my smartphone so I can go direct him home if he loses his way.Not a response to your main question, but you might also consider putting GPS on the dogs."
Tracking Devices for Patients?,"(And if your dad is resistant to  wearing a GPS tracker himself, he might be more open to this.)"
Tracking Devices for Patients?,TAGG Pet Tracker is the one I'd been considering for my own dog - a small collar-mounted device.
Tracking Devices for Patients?,"I haven't had to look into one of these yet, but one time my mother in law got lost driving, and we just used Find My iPhone to see where she was."
Tracking Devices for Patients?,"Thankfully she doesn't drive anymore, but it was a good last-minute scrambling kind of lifesaver."
Tracking Devices for Patients?,"If your dad has a cell phone that he will reliably take with him, I would certainly use that or a similar service."
Tracking Devices for Patients?,There's an app called Life360 that we use.
Tracking Devices for Patients?,Its helped us many times.
Simple Student Market Research Survey,"Simple Student Market Research Survey Hi, I am an industrial design student who is creating a medial device/gps to remotely monitor loved ones with dementia."
Simple Student Market Research Survey,This device would be targeted at the next generation of dementia patients who will have grown up surrounded by technology.
Simple Student Market Research Survey,It can also be used by current generation because it requires no interaction from the user.
Simple Student Market Research Survey,I have set up a very simple survey to help me collect market research to create a more focused concept.
Simple Student Market Research Survey,"Thank you.I actually use the family tracking app for android, Life360 to track my father using the GPS in his phone."
Simple Student Market Research Survey,It's a fairly good free alternative to buying a seperate device if your loved one still uses or carries a phone.
Simple Student Market Research Survey,Otherwise this device you are creating is a great idea.
Simple Student Market Research Survey,"Thanks, I was actually thinking about going deeper into the concept to include a small wearable device that can keep track of a persons overall health (still cant believe they actually have chips that can monitor brain and nervous patters to remote sense emotions accurately).This is a good point about the app that can do gps for phones (didn't know trackers where free)."
Simple Student Market Research Survey,Knowing this I should spend a bit more time on the drawing board.

When to make the transition?,When to make the transition?
When to make the transition?,Hi everyone.
When to make the transition?,"I just stumbled upon this sub - wow, do I ever need a support group."
When to make the transition?,Hope y'all don't mind if I start right in with a question of my own.Our situation is this - mom has had cancer (multiple myeloma) for about 9 years now.
When to make the transition?,"In remission now, actually, but with a whole host of complications from the chemo."
When to make the transition?,Her body and immune system are destroyed.
When to make the transition?,"I spent most of this time caring for her while she lived alone, but moved her in with me about a year and a half ago because I noticed she was not taking care of herself at all anymore, not eating meals if I didn't bring them, losing lots of weight, her house was a wreck and I couldn't find the time to take care of her house and my own."
When to make the transition?,It was a hard decision to make (especially because I had a 3 month old baby at the time) but I didn't know what else to do.
When to make the transition?,"She does not have a husband or other children.Since she's moved in with us, she has had pneumonia 7 times and has been hospitalized 8 times, all for at least 2 week stays."
When to make the transition?,"When she comes back home, she needs full time care."
When to make the transition?,We are currently about 3 weeks out from her last hospital stay (which was almost 2 months long and involved three surgeries to resect her bowel).
When to make the transition?,This time her care is extremely high maintenance.
When to make the transition?,"She has a huge incision site that has to be packed with gauze etc, tons of medicines to keep track of, can barely do anything for herself."
When to make the transition?,"I am working from home about 45 hours a week and taking care of her at the same time, and taking care of my now almost 2 year old as well.I am really reaching the end of my rope."
When to make the transition?,I just don't know who to talk to about this or what to do to make it feel more manageable and less overwhelming.
When to make the transition?,I am stretched so thin.
When to make the transition?,My job is very demanding and I am constantly running back and forth between her and it all day long.
When to make the transition?,"As soon as work ends, my child is home and I want to spend quality time with her, but often find myself having to do more things to help my mom."
When to make the transition?,Mom is an extremely high maintenance person on top of having lots of physical assistance needs.
When to make the transition?,"My daughter does not understand and has been acting out as a result, making it even more difficult to care for everyone and keep everyone happy."
When to make the transition?,"My poor husband has just been lost to the shadows at this point, I have no time for myself or him."
When to make the transition?,"By the time I'm finished tending to everyone's needs, it's past 8pm and I just crash into bed, only to start the next grueling day all over again.I am so stressed out, and I am starting to feel incredibly trapped, angry, resentful."
When to make the transition?,I just want it to end.
When to make the transition?,"At this point, death would almost be a relief for me after a decade of caregiving."
When to make the transition?,I want my life back.
When to make the transition?,I want to spend it with my family.
When to make the transition?,"And then, of course, I feel incredibly guilty for having those negative feelings, but I just don't know how much longer I can hold on.So partially, I just really needed to vent, and I thank you for listening."
When to make the transition?,But I do have a question now that I have laid this all out.
When to make the transition?,I have been thinking a lot about a transition to a nursing home.
When to make the transition?,"It feels a lot like ""the end"" to me - like a death sentence or something - if I make her do this."
When to make the transition?,She will be extremely upset.
When to make the transition?,She hates those institutionalized environments and does not do well in them.
When to make the transition?,I don't even know how to bring up the conversation with her.
When to make the transition?,It will be a huge fight and she will likely never forgive me for it.
When to make the transition?,"But at the same time, don't I have a responsibility to my growing family?"
When to make the transition?,I feel like they are just getting lost in the shuffle and I do not want to miss the early years of my daughter's life.
When to make the transition?,"I just don't know what to do, who to prioritize."
When to make the transition?,This is the hardest decision I have ever tried to make.Has anyone been in a similar situation with your parents?
When to make the transition?,"What did you do?Thanks for listening.Howdy, and welcome (although sorry you're here!"
When to make the transition?,").I can't speak towards being in a similar situation with my parents; however, I'm going through the nursing home thing with my wife."
When to make the transition?,She's 39 and has pretty aggressive MS. She's been pretty much bedridden for about five years now.
When to make the transition?,"Obviously, this is not where we planned on being."
When to make the transition?,"We've been struggling and making adjustments to our lives to accommodate her progression, but it's gotten too difficult: although I only work about 1.5 miles away from home, she still can't be left alone for any amount of time."
When to make the transition?,"So we have aides with her during the day - but they're through an agency, making barely above minimum wage, and not exactly medical professionals."
When to make the transition?,"Their level of care varies from really good to pretty terrible - they've repeatedly screwed up the (numerous) medicines my wife has to take, she's had some falls in the hoyer lift (which I can't criticize them too much for, as I've also dropped her from it).But with the advancement of the disease, I just don't feel it's safe for her at home any longer."
When to make the transition?,Last month I made the decision to bring up the nursing home topic.
When to make the transition?,"Obviously, she is/was completely devastated."
When to make the transition?,"She's not even 40, but facing life in the nursing home."
When to make the transition?,"I did my research and found an amazing home - it's about 30 minutes away (the only real downside other than being a nursing home), but it's a beautiful place with top-notch care."
When to make the transition?,"We talked about it (a lot), and then went for a tour."
When to make the transition?,"The place is great, and our hope is that after a couple years there: A) they will engage her in physical/occupational therapy that will improve her condition, and B) in that time I will be able to make home improvements so we can sell this shithole of a house we bought - a fixer-upper we bought right before the market crashed, thinking we'd have time to get it in great shape together, only to lose our shirts and sanity to this goddamned money pit... Erm... where was I?"
When to make the transition?,"Oh - fix up this house and maybe buy a condo that could be set up for caregiving.I hate this disease, I hate this house, and I pretty much hate life right now.But to your original point (sorry, lost myself in a self-pitying tirade there!"
When to make the transition?,"): I absolutely understand about it feeling like ""the end,"" and the resentment you're going to experience."
When to make the transition?,"Realistically, a nursing home is going to provide the level of care and attention you cannot (well, if you find a good one, obviously)."
When to make the transition?,"While a child absolutely has a duty to a parent, the greater responsibility is the parents' towards the child: it's hard-coded into nature that a parent sacrifices for their child."
When to make the transition?,"Some(often)times that is absolutely horrible, but it's what it is."
When to make the transition?,"If your mother were able to look at the situation objectively, she would agree."
When to make the transition?,"Put yourself in her position: if your daughter were taking care of you, wouldn't you want to make it easier on her and do what you can to allow her to take care of HER child?"
When to make the transition?,"Your mother is doubtless frustrated, scared and depressed (and rightfully so, of course)."
When to make the transition?,"This is going to cloud her judgement and make the situation more difficult, but you have to put aside your guilt and base your decision on what is going to be best for YOUR child (and, really, your mother): you cannot continue in this situation."
When to make the transition?,"Not only will your mother's care suffer, but you will both begin to resent the other, your daughter will resent YOU/your lack of attention, and I'm sure this is hard on your husband as well.I'm so, so sorry that you are in this situation."
When to make the transition?,But I think you know this is for the best - there's just a ton of guilt and feeling like your failing your mother that you have to deal with.
When to make the transition?,"Not only would I suggest going forward with nursing care for your mother, but look into counseling for yourself - this is going to be hard to deal with, and having someone ""outside"" the situation to talk with would also be a big help.Soooooo..."
When to make the transition?,I hope this helps?
When to make the transition?,"Stay strong, and we're here for you any time (even if we're not always the quickest to respond!)!"
When to make the transition?,"Um....wow....just, thank you so much for your response."
When to make the transition?,And I'm so sorry to hear about your wife.
When to make the transition?,At least my mom is almost 70 and has lived a long and wonderful life.
When to make the transition?,"As age declines, we expect these things to happen."
When to make the transition?,You do NOT expect these things when you are in your 30s.
When to make the transition?,I cannot imagine how devastated you both are.
When to make the transition?,Truly my heart goes out to you.I think you are completely right that this all really just comes down to guilt for me.
When to make the transition?,"It's been a hard thing to come to terms with - that I just can't provide for her anymore in a way that is healthy for everyone.We actually had an initial conversation about it this morning, just to get the ball rolling and the idea in her head."
When to make the transition?,It was hard for me to bring up but she was receptive and understanding.
When to make the transition?,"Now we just have the long journey ahead of us to figure out timing, find the right place, etc etc.Thank you so much again for your thoughtful response."
When to make the transition?,It really does help to have someone to talk to about everything.
When to make the transition?,"kwip, words fail me ."
When to make the transition?,. .
When to make the transition?,I simply cannot tell you how sorry I am for you and your wife.
When to make the transition?,"My brother-in-law had MS and died in a nursing home at age 52, so I have an awareness of at least some of the challenges you're facing."
When to make the transition?,"My husband and I both loved his brother very much, and as I'm reading your story it feels like my heart is literally breaking for you and your wife.I honestly don't know what, if anything, to offer you in the way of advice based on his experiences."
When to make the transition?,It occurs to me that some things you may not want to hear and other things may not even be good for you to hear!
When to make the transition?,"If you have a question you'd like to ask, however, please feel free to do so and I will attempt to answer it as honestly as possible."
When to make the transition?,Our thoughts andprayers are with you and your wife!
When to make the transition?,"I came here because I was feeling sorry for myself, having given up my career to care for my 88-year-old mother (who has Parkinson's disease and a genetic vision impairment) for 6 years largely alone, without respite or a support group."
When to make the transition?,And then I read your story and kwip's and .
When to make the transition?,. . wow .
When to make the transition?,. . you two ARE AMAZING!!
When to make the transition?,"!So many of the things you said resonated with me, SiaMaya, especially the husband lost to the shadows and the feeling of just wanting it to end and then feeling guilty."
When to make the transition?,"I think these are feelings that anyone would inevitably have under the circumstances you've described, so please just accept them as natural and don't be hard on yourself for them!"
When to make the transition?,"Because my mother is older than yours, my sister (who lives out-of-state and deigns to speak to our mother on the phone for 5 minutes once a week) has for the past four years aggressively tried to place her in a nursing home."
When to make the transition?,"About four years ago, mother agreed to stay in a nursing home temporarily while she was getting some physical therapy and she called me every day of that 6-week period, begging me to get her out of there."
When to make the transition?,"Now, as my mother's condition continues to decline and her needs increase, the question has come up with more frequency, both in my mind and expressed by my husband, and the memory of those calls is one of the barriers."
When to make the transition?,"We have a fine nursing home in our town, but I know that I could never have my mother begging me to get her out of there and ignore her pleas; it would be torturous for me."
When to make the transition?,"As a result, I applaud the fact that you're talking openly with your mother about it and referring to ""we"" when it comes to the journey ahead of you."
When to make the transition?,"I really think that, if it's at all possible, getting her on board and facing the decision as a family is key."
When to make the transition?,"And since you have small children, I think discussing this with your mother in the broader context of ""family"" may be helpful to you; they are also her grandchildren and it seems likely that she would want the best for them and be willing to make reasonable sacrifces to ensure their wellbeing."
When to make the transition?,"I sometimes worry that the natural feelings of frustration, etc., that you outlined may color the decision of when to transition my mother."
When to make the transition?,"I value myself as a person, love my husband and other family members as well as my mother, and realize that there are no guarantees with respect to my own lifespan or theirs."
When to make the transition?,"In order to find the appropriate balance between mother's needs and the needs of the others that I love, I try to objectively ask myself whether, as her situation currently stands and given the limitations of what I can provide to her in the way of care, my mother is ""better off"" in her current situation or in a nursing home."
When to make the transition?,"Our family's value system is such that we don't necessarily value quantity of life over its quality so her happiness -- as well as mine and my husband's -- are factors that weigh heavily into the determination of where she would be ""better off."""
When to make the transition?,"By measuring it this way I think that when the answer is that she would be ""better off"" in a nursing home, we will be confident that we are making the right choice.As you proceed on your journey to find an acceptable ""home"" for your mother, you may want to check out the automated Philips Medication Dispenser at http://www.managemypills.com to help keep track of the tons of medication you mentioned."
When to make the transition?,This has been a real Godsend for us -- and I have no relationship whatsoever to the company!
When to make the transition?,"-- and found it super easy to install so, even if you only use it for a couple of months, it may help you find a little extra time in your already incredibly busy day."
When to make the transition?,You can load 10 days' worth of medication into it and it will automatically dispense medication up to 6 times through the day on a schedule that you set up.
When to make the transition?,"My mother, for example, takes 1 pill at 7:00 am, 2 pills at 8:00 am, yet another pill at 9:00 am, pills at 1:00 pm, at 5:00 pm and at 9:00 pm because that's the time schedule that works for her medication."
When to make the transition?,"The machine could at least in theory be set up at your mother's bedside and all she would have to do is push a rather large button -- the machine calls out nicely whenever ""It's time to take your medicine"" -- for the cup with the appropriate medication to come out at the appropriate time."
When to make the transition?,"The cost is about $90 a month and it's well worth it to us because it means that I only have to think about medication once every 10 days when I load the machine!I'm so sorry you're faced with this challenging situation, but I know you're moving forward thoughtfully and carefully and that your decisions will therefore be wise."
When to make the transition?,Thank you so much for your kind and thoughtful reply.
When to make the transition?,I am so grateful to have other people to talk to about this and hope that we can be a sounding board for you as well anytime you need it.
When to make the transition?,It is so hard to walk this path alone.It must be so difficult for you to face this decision knowing your mom is not on board with it at all.
When to make the transition?,I can not even imagine how much that must add to the guilt and burden you must be feeling.
When to make the transition?,This is not an easy decision to make.
When to make the transition?,"It is easy to feel that we are letting them down somehow, after they spent so much time and energy bringing us into this world and caring for us for so long.For my family, there is no other option than to talk about it openly."
When to make the transition?,My mom raised me alone and it was just us for my entire childhood.
When to make the transition?,I feel a strong sense of loyalty to her and I truly want what is best for her.
When to make the transition?,"However, I am beginning to realize that my biggest priority in life right now has to be my own child."
When to make the transition?,"I owe her exactly what my mother gave me, and we have talked about this and mom understands and agrees with that."
When to make the transition?,I'm afraid I'm not able to be the best mother to my daughter right now with all of the stresses and demands that come with caregiving.
When to make the transition?,It's been one of the big reasons we've begun this discussion.
When to make the transition?,"It's difficult to be thinking about this so early - she is ""only"" 69."
When to make the transition?,Cancer sucks.
When to make the transition?,"The treatment worked in putting the cancer in remission, but it totally destroyed her body and immune system in the process."
When to make the transition?,It's sad.
When to make the transition?,I wish we had more years of her being healthy.
When to make the transition?,She seems like a pale shadow of the person she used to be.
When to make the transition?,"I am already grieving her in many ways.I am also exhausted, burnt out, stressed out, overwhelmed, frustrated, depressed, anxious."
When to make the transition?,"I definitely need some therapy and help on my own, but I also think that working full time and trying to be a full time caregiver as well as a mom to a toddler is just stretching me way too thin."
When to make the transition?,I just simply and honestly explained everything to my mom and that I feel I am at the limit of what I can handle at this point.
When to make the transition?,I think being open and honest about all that really helped her be able to move forward with thinking about changing our situation.
When to make the transition?,"You are right - discussing it in the context of how it is affecting the entire family has really helped her gain some perspective on the situation outside of her own experience.We actually visited her doctor today, and he told her in no uncertain terms that she needs to be move."
When to make the transition?,We have some concerns about the air quality in our house (it's older) and she is having a lot of trouble breathing.
When to make the transition?,There's also a concern that she is sick so often because she lives with a germ factory (toddler in daycare).
When to make the transition?,"So that has really helped us get the ball rolling as well....if we have to move, then it makes sense to go ahead and make the move to assisted living so that everyone can get what they need.I think you are coming at your own decision in a logical, rational, and compassionate manner."
When to make the transition?,It's not an easy thing to do.
When to make the transition?,"I hope that, when the time comes, you are able to find a place for your mom that she also finds acceptable and can be happy living out her remaining years.Thanks so much for the recommendation on that dispenser - it sounds wonderful!"
When to make the transition?,We definitely struggle with helping her to remember everything so an alarm and automated dispenser would be a lifesaver.
When to make the transition?,"That's a steep price tag for my budget, but I will definitely look into it.Anyway, I just really appreciate your response, and for you listening to my rambling :) It's amazing how much it helps to just be able to talk things out with other people that have some idea of what you are going through."
When to make the transition?,"My husband is sweet and kind and supportive, but he doesn't totally ""get"" what I am going through on both a physical and emotional level."
When to make the transition?,It's good to know we aren't alone.
When to make the transition?,"I'm extremely thankful for reddit, as funny as it sounds."
When to make the transition?,You guys have been so kind.

Phone for Mother-in-law,Phone for Mother-in-law My mother in law is 60 years old and has some very serious memory problems.
Phone for Mother-in-law,"According to her son, she's had some emotional/psychological challenges throughout her life and they've compounded with the memory problems."
Phone for Mother-in-law,"We've done our absolute best to help her - from the initial realization, having her license removed, moving her into independent living - but she resists absolutely everything we try to do."
Phone for Mother-in-law,She's also manipulative and only seems to remember things she wants to remember - she's aware of her memory problems and sometimes clearly uses them to manipulate us.
Phone for Mother-in-law,"This has made getting a diagnosis impossible - plus scheduling neuro appointments, oh my… Her 92 year old parents are also a hindrance to our progress."
Phone for Mother-in-law,"They thought nothing was wrong, eventually supported us, then she brain washed them, and now they scold us for not caring about her."
Phone for Mother-in-law,It's fun and after 3 years is starting to wear on my family.To the point...She was recently involved with a dangerous person while in independent living.
Phone for Mother-in-law,"We hadn't removed all of her money - she freaked out, and it's tough for her children to completely remove her freedom - but the guy managed to convince her to buy a car in both of their names with cash, she actually went shopping for him, he ended up living in her apartment, and somehow stole all of her cash (we're talking thousands - her mother sends her cash in the mail… wth)."
Phone for Mother-in-law,She didn't tell us about him and managed to hide the entire situation from us for 3 weeks and even made up a false name for him.
Phone for Mother-in-law,"When we learned she was seeing someone, we were happy for her."
Phone for Mother-in-law,"Then we figured out the car situation, then the money, then found a couple bruises."
Phone for Mother-in-law,"One day she was lucid and wanted to call the police, admitted that he caused the bruises and stole all of her money."
Phone for Mother-in-law,"The police did nothing because we couldn't find him or the car and we didn't have a record of the cash.The man has a significant criminal record (DUI's with an impounded car - now we know why he wanted her to buy one, multiple thefts and break-ins, and he's homeless)."
Phone for Mother-in-law,We're convinced he manipulated her and gave her attention and now she is protecting him.
Phone for Mother-in-law,"(She is ""in love with him"")We were concerned for her safety."
Phone for Mother-in-law,My wife has POA so we took control of the money and we're safe legally.
Phone for Mother-in-law,We changed her phone number and blocked his and moved her to her parents' for a month.
Phone for Mother-in-law,"Somehow, and I have no idea how, she managed to call him."
Phone for Mother-in-law,"We had a week-long saga of phone blocking, which ultimately seems to have worked."
Phone for Mother-in-law,"Now she's moving back to the area - new room, no name on door, man is banned from the building - BUT we're very afraid she will figure out how to contact him.We want a dumb phone for her with some serious blocking potential - as in, she can only contact a list of numbers that we designate."
Phone for Mother-in-law,We haven't found anything that is helpful or available in the US.
Phone for Mother-in-law,"It'd be nice if there was GPS tracking on it.Any suggestions?tl;dr: Mother-in-law, neuro degeneracy, psychological problems make it more challenging, involved with bad man who steals money and abuses her, she vehemently protects him, need to get her a dumb phone that can only call listed contacts, would like to have a gps tracker in her phone, can't find anything, hoping for suggestions and maybe some advice...I think they make phones like that for little kids."
Phone for Mother-in-law,There are like 5 buttons max and the parents have to program the numbers and all the kid can do is press a button that dials one of the pre programmed numbers.
Phone for Mother-in-law,Reddit has a sub /r/cellphones which might be of more help.
Phone for Mother-in-law,Didn't know that!
Phone for Mother-in-law,Super helpful.

Phone for Mother-in-law,Thank you!
Phone for Mother-in-law,Yeah… it's been challenging to say the least.

Gps car tracker,Gps car tracker The other day my grandfather-in-law took his car for his normal 15min daily ride.
Gps car tracker,He didn't come back for 4hrs.
Gps car tracker,Now we are looking into getting a gps tracker for his car.
Gps car tracker,"Any suggestions?sounds like you need to consider getting his license revoked.I Went through the same thing with my dad back in december.It's not easy but when you consider if he runs a red light or gets lostfor a day in cold weather, it becomes a safety issue for the community.you will probably need to get creative with the method you employ for taking care of this.remember it is the best for HIS safety AND the safety of the community."
Gps car tracker,Hide the keys.
Gps car tracker,"It can be difficult to have a license revoked and even if that is successful, many will forget their license is no longer valid."
Gps car tracker,"In addition, allow him to drive with a passenger occasionally so that he retains some sense of autonomity, as long as it is safe."

Alzheimer's Support Groups,Alzheimer's Support Groups I went to my first Alz support group today.
Alzheimer's Support Groups,What got out of it:We're not alone.
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"It's good to talk to others, if for no other reason then to vent."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"But I did get a lot of good tips & tricks from this group:Dad likes sweets, bribe him if we have toLying is good."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"It's therapeutic lying - an alz patient will shut down & stop talking if you keep on correcting them that they're wrong.Instead of saying There's no one here but us, Dad say The other people here, are they bothering you when he's loopy at night."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,If they're not bothering him then fine.
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"If so, say something like I'll ask them to leaveChoose your battles."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,Wearing the same clothes you did yesterday is nowhere near as important as getting him to eat todayLower the heat setting on the hot water heater.
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"Many elderly have lost their sense of pain where heat is concernedIf he has a set of clothes he likes wearing, buy him several copies of it."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"It may be comfort, it may be an emotional bond to it.See if Dad can do specific things, like empty the dishwasher, fold clothes."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,He wants to feel helpfulMaybe we should buy him tickets to the Opera again.
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"He enjoyed that so muchThe movie Still Alice, We may want to check that out."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,It's about a college professor who goes through Alzheimer'sMedicAlert - a way to track a wandering person.
Alzheimer's Support Groups,Something to research.There are support groups (on the Alz website) all over the place but they are not all alike.
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"Some of them have lecturers, some are just caregivers talking, some have doctors there to answer technical questions that lay-people have."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"You have to check them out until you find a group you likeDocs I received:""Tools in the Toolbox"" https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9xGtK-MG8QzcVZkTXlodThJVlU&authuser=0""It Takes a Team"" https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9xGtK-MG8QzS3YtUDk5WVprUXc&authuser=0I'd love to see this subreddit collect all this information into one big helpful sidebar."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,Not just what I've found but what others have found too.
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"I especially like the point about the lying - I know it's hard for people to see, but holding firmly to ""truth"" in the context of relating to a person who literally can't comprehend/retain the truth is not a kindness... Agree."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"The lying part was the hardest/weirdest thing to learn because as a kid I was always taught to be honest, and as an adult have always been a straight-shooter."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"But how many times should someone have to go through the pain of losing what they equate with independence (""Your car is at our house... you asked us to hang onto it since this place doesn't have a garage""), the death of their parents (""Why haven't they visited?"
Alzheimer's Support Groups,They don't get around very well but cousin Fred is taking care of them.
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"""), or the death of a spouse."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"At this point, it would just be cruel to remind them of these things."
Alzheimer's Support Groups,And for the little things... it just doesn't matter.
Alzheimer's Support Groups,"If he says he just bought those shoes yesterday what's the point upsetting him in order to be ""right""?"
Alzheimer's Support Groups,Who cares.

Drug Compliance (help please!),"How do you think this can be integrated into home-care (as in, if we were to improve upon a device such as the pill box to insure that the drugs are actually being taken)?"
Drug Compliance (help please!),Any other general comments regarding Alzheimer's in-home care (esp drug compliance) would be greatly appreciated!
Drug Compliance (help please!),p.s.
Drug Compliance (help please!),what would be a good Alzheimer's support group to look into to get more personal feedback?I had to resort toadying for twice a day visits to have someone physically hand my dad his pills and stand there while he took them.
Drug Compliance (help please!),"I tried weekly pill boxes, then a pill box with alarms."
Drug Compliance (help please!),"He either didn't hear the alarms, or would dump the pills out to stop the alarm but still not take them."
Drug Compliance (help please!),I would call him and he would swear he had taken them.
Drug Compliance (help please!),"With my grandmother she was overdosing when we would leave a pill box for her, even with an alarm reminding her to take them or phone calls coaching her."
Drug Compliance (help please!),"We had to resort to just giving them to her in a cup (she had arthitis in her hands as well) and sometimes tricking her into taking them (she always wanted pain pills, so all of her medication were ""pain pills"")."
Drug Compliance (help please!),"But like someone else who posted below, we would also have to stand by and coach her.Maybe something that is timed and won't open until it is the appropriate time to take them would be enough, I mean it is not like we can integrate all the medication into one super pill that is somehow easy to swallow!You might want to reach out to the Alzheimer's association magazine and see if they would be willing to have a questionnaire in one issue."
Drug Compliance (help please!),"Each major city has their own caregiver's support group, looking there would probably be a good resource as well."
Drug Compliance (help please!),Good luck!

Drug Compliance,A year ago he moved to assisted living but we still use this.
Drug Compliance,It became ingrained and is part of his day now.
Drug Compliance,"I call about 10 mins after it is programmed to go off and ask him to check the bowl he dumps the pills in, to ensure he actually took them."
Drug Compliance,"Most of the time he has, but if he hasn't I ask him to take them while I'm on the phone."
Drug Compliance,About once a month he will skip a dose (it stays in chamber and is evident)
Wearable for someone with Dementia,"Wearable for someone with Dementia Hi All,I could really use some help."
Wearable for someone with Dementia,"I've been working on a way to have Alzheimer's patients wear activity sensors for my research, and I'm wondering how I can best get someone to wear one every day."
Wearable for someone with Dementia,"It's a little module that can be worn as a watch/wristband, pinned to clothes, etc."
Wearable for someone with Dementia,"My concern is that someone might not recognize/remember a new gadget on them, and remove it."
Wearable for someone with Dementia,Any ideas?
Wearable for someone with Dementia,If you could build it into a working watch that might work.
Wearable for someone with Dementia,"Other than that I would say if they have a caregiver ask the caregiver if they can keep an eye on it and if it's taken off to try and have the patient put it back on, then record the date/time it was put back on."
Wearable for someone with Dementia,What it looked like this?
Wearable for someone with Dementia,I don't think I can get it to look like a regular watch...
Wearable for someone with Dementia,I'm wondering where else to put it.
Wearable for someone with Dementia,"If not a watch, maybe you could decorate it to look like a jewelry bracelet."
Wearable for someone with Dementia,Or maybe like an antique styled necklace if it can be worn around the neck.
Wearable for someone with Dementia,Unfortunately I'd say it'd be best to have like a house arrest bracelet.
Wearable for someone with Dementia,What are those made of?
Wearable for someone with Dementia,Because I'm hoping if drunk drug addicted freaks can't get it off I'm sure it'd be difficult for an elderly dementia patient to.
Wearable for someone with Dementia,"I've seen GPS systems modelled like watches, and bracelets, and the people (only about three) I've used them with didn't take them off, as long as it's familiar as an object that should be on their wrist it seems to be fine."
Wearable for someone with Dementia,"I think I should test it out, but yes I want to make something nice looking."
Wearable for someone with Dementia,Would feel terrible (especially due to connotations) if it were used like an ankle monitor that they use for parolees!

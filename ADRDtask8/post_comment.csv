"Patient Transfer Belts/Shower Shoes Hi! My niece took our car, and it had Mom’s lift belt in it. I cannot get it back. 
I used the belt to help my Mom in and out of cars (from a car seat to her walker or chair). Can anyone recommend a replacement that I can order from Amazon? 
Also, Mom is having a harder time getting out of her shower chair. Even with wall handles. I have the chair at it’s maximum height setting, so I’m wondering how to get better traction for her feet. She hates the bath traction strips I put down and insists on having a towel under her feet which is too dangerous. She can only hoist herself up, just barely, from the right side. Any slippers or other devices you can recommend would be helpful. We have a walk-in shower but I’m starting to wonder how many more weeks it will be practical for her. She can get into the shower fine. Getting out is dicey.","comment 1: Here's a really basic gait belt similar to what you get from the hospital. I've found that the fancy ones with the hand grips and different features are too slippery and open up making it a fall risk.
My dad uses this shower chair which sits much farther out so that he can sit while outside the shower, spin his legs around, and scoot over.
Also early on in his recovery my dad had issues lifting his legs and walking. This device helped him spin to sit and stand. It's basically a lazy Susan for people. It does need someone to assist. She may not be able to do it on her own.
comment 2: There are a few good ones I found, I used the search term ""gait belt"" I dont have any personal experience with any of those, though. 
I'm wondering if some pool or water shoes would work for what you need for grip though. They can be fairly easy to get on and off, and pairs I've used in the past are pretty grippy. Might be worth a look.
comment 3: Crocs. They make slippers that work well for my dad as shower shoes.
comment 4: My preference for a gait belt is the one with various handles as it gives me more options by which to grip a patient without hurting them.
As for showers, look into getting a transfer bench. I have one elderly, below the knee amputee and that is how I get her in and out of the shower.  The shower has a handheld so she can essentially rinse herself off, after I soap her up.   
Once she is out and dried, its up and back into the wheelchair.
comment 5: I have a ""security pole"" right outside the shower for her to grab on. And she wears shower shoes for better grip.

"Caregiving with Technology Hello All
I am a 27 year old caregiver to two elederly grandparents and two aunts with Parkinson’s. Me and my wife take turns feeding and helping around the house, I’ve noticed that Alexa has a lot of skills that could be useful for elderly folks. Asking for weather, time, calling family etc etc. I’m a self confessed techie and wanted to use that skill to help. I’ve created a few Alexa skills to help us around the house as well
I was wondering if there is any technology that anyone uses here to aid in Caregiving?","comment 1: Alexa has been great for us too! My boyfriend (30m) became quadriplegic a few years ago, and we’ve really embraced the Echo in our house.
We use Eufy lightbulbs from Amazon with yellow-to-white options. So we can say “Alexa, turn bed lamp to white,” “Turn living room light to 100,” etc. We had the standard one at first, but the ability to have white light during the day and yellow light at night really made a difference 
We also have some compatible plugs for small appliances like the humidifier. And a fire tv for the bedroom, fire cube for the tv in the living room. That way both can turn on the tv and control volume through Alexa. 
What sort of skills have you made to help out around the house? We’re always looking for ways to make things a little easier :)
comment 2: Elderly people often lose technological skills and abilities they had before. Your idea sounds great, but be prepared to be met with blank stares. But please give it a try, and keep us informed!

"Plz help,from 3rd world, neurologists and psychiatrists unable to give proper time and treatment due to covid Im in the most painful and complex situation of my life, father dementia worsened after couple of years and seems mother also apparently has some sort of dementia but so far no neurologist or psychiatrist have been able to properly diagnose.
Im only child and barely able to care for both due to fatigue and own mental health issues. Not much help from others as its chaos here due to covid and du to fear cant hire nurse and tbh cant afford it  
Im in a 3rd world country, Pakistan and due to covid, treatment and diagnosis almost impossible, dilemma is most experts advice antipsychotics for her extreme anxiety and agitation but im afraid as fda warnimg says it can be fatal if she actually has dementia. 
I have videos of her that i can share in pm to respect our privacy, hope to find proper treatment, memantine gives me hope but must check from a neurologist as mother also has comorbids  like hypertension and copd diabetes and donepezil an rivistagine patch is contraindicated etc
Unable to get MRI after repeated tries as she becomes agitated and sedation ia contraindicated due to copd. 
FOLLOWING NOTES FROM A BOOK
-Onset of depressive symptoms preceded much earlier, perhaps years than cognitive
impairment and memory problems
-Memory problems fairly sudden onset eg within 1 to 2 months of hospital admission october 2019 often
identifiable onset of cognitive impairment especially during and after hospital stay, which was definitely a shock as she never had to be hospitalized for so long and become so much dependent in life.
-Often emphasize inability to think,concentrate, and remember, especially when asked questions
-Signs and symptoms of depression include:
-loss of appetite.
-loss of interest in cooking, overseeing house cleaning and other chores she used to love.
-more silent
-less mobile or willingness to move
-less pain and discomfort tolerance probably and less temperature tolerance as evident by asking to switch on and off AC in short time
-much less patient than before
Much more 'i dont know' or 'not feeling well ' replies when trying to test cognition or memory

"I think I just need to know I'm not alone Sorry if the format is weird. I'm on mobile and this is kind of my first actual reddit post ever. 
At the beginning of the year my (27F) Dad (64M) suffered a stroke, leaving him unable to speak, swallow, and move the right side of his body. He already dealt with diabetes, high blood pressure, an amputation (luckily just some toes), extremely poor eyesight, and overall was a very disorganized person. So prior to the stroke I was already somewhat of a caregiver. I checked his feet almost every day for diabetic ulcers. If he had wounds I would dress them. I kept track of all of his appointments, and my boyfriend would drive us to all of them (I don't have a license). 
Other than that he was largely independent. He cooked his own meals, remembered to take his meds, and was pretty normal! But I had been taking care of him for almost 5 years already and was starting to feel the burnout. My life was on hold until we could figure out a way for him to not Constantly be on the verge of foot infections. Side note: his foot with the amputated toes has a longer medical history than my entire life. It's kind of irrelevant now, since he's bed bound.....but my point is my life was stagnate and I was starting to burnout with no end in sight. Until...
My older sister and her boyfriend decided to move back home to help me out. I was excited to have some help and maybe enjoy my youth. Maybe find a job related to my degree instead of a part-time job (which I enjoyed a lot but wanted to move on from)...and then my dad had his stroke. They're still moving back! In fact my sister is here already to help out....but she's working from home and now I am our Dad's full time caregiver. I volunteered because I love my Dad and I Can do this. We also didn't really have a choice because no care facility in my state would take him. I quit my job, and take care of him all day and all night. 
I'm stretched so thin I don't have the emotional capacity to deal with anything else. Which is awful! My boyfriend and his family are going through their own trials, and I feel awful I can't support him more. We've been together for 6 years. His family is my family. And my boyfriend is so stressed about my dad And his family, that he's constantly angry and/or depressed. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want everything to be okay. I want everything to be normal but it can't be. My dad can't move half his body. He can't have anything by mouth. His care and therapy are my priority. 
But I don't want it to be. I'm just so tired all the time. And I feel guilty for not giving Dad my undivided attention. I feel awful for neglecting my boyfriend, who has always supported me. I feel like my stress just adda to his stress. I'm in therapy but it can only help so much. 
I just....I don't know. I'm scared. I'm angry. I'm sad. I'm not even sure why I'm posting this. To vent? To ask for advice? To seek validation? I don't know. I don't know what to do anymore. All I know I can do right now is take care of my Dad.","comment 1: First, you sound like you are already at burnout stage. 
If your sister is really there to help you out, then I suggest you get the actual help you need from her. She works full time yes but you are literally working 24/7 so she still has more spare time to help. Even if it's only on her off days. 
I'm guessing you need like an actual vacation to recharge yourself. Even if it's only 2-3 days of you not being responsible for everything. Seriously good uninterrupted sleep and not being in caregiver mode is essential. 
You need off time. Even if it's only an hour a day. You need time to do literally whatever you want. Steal a kitten, rob a bank, watch paint dry, scream into the void, it doesn't matter what it is. No one should be asking you how you use that time to decompress. It is your time and you need it to be a functioning caregiver.
Without any break you will be going further into the burnout which is going to hurt. You're going to make mistakes and it's hard to come back from a major mistake. Likely it will be something not related to caregiving. Like putting in the red with the white laundry. Dropping a plate because you thought you put it on the shelf but you're so tired you couldn't tell the difference. Worse driving while you're burnt out and you may literally not see the cars on side streets because you're so tired and stressed out. I've done the double take and been unable to tell if it was my turn or they came up after I checked both ways. 
It's terrifying and at the same time hard to avoid when burnout hits you. You don't know how it is going to affect you exactly. At some point your brain will miss something that didn't seem important. You don't want to get to that point. It's not even your fault as you're doing your best with the resources you have. 
I don't want to scare you but I do want to say I've been there. I hope you take enough time for self care. You need to have time alone. Even being in the same room watching TV is stressful because you're always in caregiving mode. You're always wondering if they need something.
comment 2: It is scary, and it's scary to hear about it, but necessary. You actually sound like my therapist! But I think sometimes I need to be told things many times by many people, even strangers on the internet. I have trust and control issues, so I suck at asking for help. 
I'm lucky to have people willing to help if I ask for it. My sister is seriously amazing and my best friend. I can't fault her for not helping more if I don't tell her I need the help. And it's time I admit to her, and myself, that I really need help.
Thank you. Sincerely, thank you.
comment 3: Absolutely. I have been told the same thing. It is hard to do but you'll get there! Also getting real sleep is totally worth it
comment 4: It is completely normal to feel the way you do. I think most of us are or have been there. So even if I can't say anything that will truly help, I can guarantee you that your are not alone. It's okay to feel this way. Let yourself feel it, or else it could do your mind harm. If you can do therapy even only by phone, I recommend it. Take care of yourself however you can. Hang in there, we are here for you
comment 5: Thank you. I'm sincerely grateful to all the internet strangers giving me their support. I wasn't sure how it would go or how it would make me feel. But so far I feel overwhelmed by the kindness and sincerity. I hope to continue to turn to this community for support and advice. Thanks again.
comment 6: That's tough. Can you find an at-home caregiver service that could come part of the time to relieve you? I know that can be pricey, though, and especially without long-term care insurance. Hang in there!!
comment 7: Thanks! I think we can look into it. Even if it's not on a regular basis, any reprieve would probably help at this point. We're working on upgrading his insurance and getting him social security benefits to help pay for stuff like an at home nurse. We're not struggling financially just yet, but we're not at great place. Hopefully SS and his insurance will be able to help.
comment 8: [deleted]
comment 9: Gosh you're making me cry a little. I'm glad you have some options to try and make your life easier while also giving your dad quality care. I spoke to my sister after making this post and fully realizing just how burnt out I am. We cried, we hugged, and she's looking into all kinds of stuff for me, like respite care--where his insurance covers someone to come over for a day. 
She also is taking over Sunday mornings entirely so I can sleep in, and will take over right after work so I can try to nap/relax too. Hopefully I'll be able to let her help me too, because I'm sure at least in the beginning I'll still be worrying. 
You're amazing, and I hope things go well for you and your dad too. I think it's incredible you're managing all that and your own household. 
My love to you and yours. 
And thank you.
comment 10: You're not alone, I think that's what you needed to hear
comment 11: Sending love. You aren’t alone. You are loved !

"23 (F) taking care of a grandparent I 23 (F) have been caring for my grandma since I was 16. She lived by herself until I had to suddenly move her into a nursing home last year. For about 6/7 years, I took care of her errands/doctors visits at least once a week. Whenever I had travel plans, i would arrange a neighbor or friend to bring her food and her meds. Around the time the pandemic hit last year, I had to go over 2-4 times a week (she lived an hour away) to meal prep and take care of her daily needs. I was paid in lunch meals and coffee. She never really learned English, became a retired housewife at 40, and hasn’t driven a car in 5 decades. So when my grandpa passed away several years ago, she became completely reliant on me, even though I had to finish high school, started college, worked 30+ hours a week in 3 part time jobs, had internships, finished college early and graduated with a Masters degree a semester early too. 
I thought her decline in cognition was a normal part of aging until she had a diabetic seizure (turns out she wasn’t taking her meds like I thought, i think she was tossing them away or something) and the hospital informed me they were diagnosing her with vascular dementia. THANK GOD before things got bad I had her sign a POA and started diving into her finances when she was officially diagnosed with dementia because it occurred to me she maybe wasn’t paying her bills. I found huge credit card debits, HELOCs, loans, no savings etc etc. I also found she stashed her bills into a drawer and was on the verge of having all her services cut off because she simply forgot to pay her bills. I caught her up to date on everything and consolidated her high interest credit card debt and quickly paid it off. 
Now, after her diagnosis, all of her strange habits from about January 2020 - November 2020 made sense. However, she was put in rehab care for her seizure and I had to quickly scramble to figure out what to do. 
This is where I’m still having trouble coming to terms with what I had to do. I decided to sell her home of 30 years, the house I sort of grew up in, and most of her possessions because I realized, I could not live in and take care of her daily needs full time. I have zero medical training, and am starting my professional career in a cutthroat field. My student loans prevent me from not working too. Well, I was unemployed TWICE in the middle of everything, but I’m putting all my remaining energy into finding a new job ATM. She also fell in a sticky position where she could not afford a live in caretaker in our state on her social security, but did not financially qualify for assistive services or welfare because her social security is too high... THE IRONY. The other stressor was that her home sold in 11 DAYS, and I had one weekend to sell EVERYTHING. My grandma couldn’t afford an estate sale company, so i spent a solid 72 hours on pure adrenaline selling furniture and all the crap she was semi-hoarding. Her extra clothes, photo albums, family docs, and a few China sets are currently piled in my closet. 
I have now set up her nursing home to be paid for the next three years on private pay thanks to the sale of her home and estate and then she will be on government assistance. She doesn’t even remember her home anymore, and thinks she’s in 1944 in her home country... it’s currently WWII. 
Why am I here? I think I was led to this Reddit group because I’m looking for comfort. My grandmas only child, my Dad, is incapable of helping because of his addictions. My mom has accompanied me to a few things, and acted as an official translator for my grandmas native language twice, but legally has no role. My sibling is a cancer survivor, and so I can’t give her any responsibilities because most of it involves hospitals, and she understandably has severe anxiety around anything medical and is too young to understand the severity of the finances. Any other relatives are long dead or assholes living in another country. I won’t inherit anything because if anything is left over from the nursing home, it will go straight to my father, who will not be giving the inheritance to us. And even if he wanted to, he owes thousands to debtors who will be seizing it all. Sadly my grandparents did not set up any protections for me and my sibling against our Dad. Yes, I have consulted three separate attorneys. It is too late. 
My grandma’s dementia is getting much worse, but physically she will be living for a long time. She is now seeing her other son who died at birth as a ghostly toddler hanging around her nursing home. She also had a full conversation to “something” standing next to her the other day when I had a window visit. I have chills thinking about it because she talked into the air, and jumped as if someone had brushed against her. I could see the whole room around her, nobody was there. Her face turned different and her eyes were not hers for about 20 seconds. She also sees her Mom sitting on her bed every night. 
Thank you for reading.","comment 1: I'm sorry. Unfortunately many of us have stories like this. Caring for our loved ones with dementia is so hard, and their lives are so complicated. We try to make the best decisions we can under murky circumstances with laws and medical conditions that makes it so much harder.   
Your grandma is very lucky to have you. It sounds like you have taken marvelous care of her and done all the right things. The fact you could do that while also getting yourself through college is amazing. Taking care of my parents and working fulltime right now, and it about breaks me sometimes.
comment 2: Thank you for the kind words. Full time while working to take care of both parents is extremely honorable and brave of you too.
comment 3: You are a hero.  What you did at such a young age is remarkable.  At this point, I'd be focused on using as much of her money as possible to make her comfortable and happy.  What would you like to see happen next?
comment 4: Oh thank you, but I do not consider myself a hero at all. I just have unique circumstances where I’m one of her sole surviving family members. 
Honestly, I don’t know. I know she’s trapped in her mind, and I feel it’s cruel that she can’t seem to pass away more peacefully. I just wish her all the comfort I can possibly provide while my state is on lockdown. Praying things get better enough where I can take her on wheelchair walks around her facility or something.
comment 5: You've done such a great job. I'm so sorry for your stress. This is a good group to hear similar stories and get support.
comment 6: Thank you for the kind words. Yes, I see this is a good group to read similar stores and get support.
comment 7: Tru here.
Reflections can be a problem for those of us with dementia. Every time i look at myself in the mirror it is a shock. (of course i dont recognize husband either, because i am looking for the younger man i married.) i know that later the mirror will bring a feeling of a stranger watching me. 
Many folks keep all windows covered in order to prevent reflection complications.
comment 8: Could it be possible my grandma doesn’t recognize me because she’s looking for the little girl she used to babysit after preschool?
comment 9: very probable.
comment 10: You’ve done a remarkable job so far despite the obstacles! Unfortunately with this disease it’s as if there are no winners, so I have found that what you are doing, actively seeking comfort for your loved one is all we can do ❤️God bless you and give you strength and wisdom to continue this journey. The best thing to do is find a community that understands what you (all of us) are going through and offer support, you came to the right place. One day at a time and everything will be ok. Virtual hugs!!

"Grandmother is losing mobility. Need help with things I can do to make this easier Hi all. My grandmother has been slowly losing her mobility ever since she came out of the hospital after an extended stay in standard care. IMO, the hospital shouldn't have put her in standard care since she was incapable of feeding herself but that's another story. 
She went to rehab at a care facility and was released in August of last year. At first she was capable of getting up on her own, balancing, even walking to bed some days, but within the last couple of months has completely backslid into near immobility. She can't balance to stand up, she doesn't realize when she's going to the bathroom, so it's basically transfers from bed to a portable commode, to the wheelchair, to a recliner in the mornings and reverse order for bed.
What I could use help with is dressing her. She can stand, but doesn't balance herself and leans so far back that she has to be held up. This makes it almost impossible for one person to get her dressed (and clean her up if there's a major accident). If I could find something that would help her stand and to help hold her up, then it wouldn't be such a major hassle to get her pants on. So I basically need to learn how to handle someone who is wheelchair bound. 
Anyone know of any devices to help her stand up (walker doesn't work) or any lifestyle changes we can make to help get her pants on?","comment 1: It won't help her to balance herself standing, but do you think a gait belt may help you hold on to her?  They aren't too expensive and they have lots of handles on them to help steady someone and help them transfer.
comment 2: Medicare or insurance might cover some more physical therapy. 
Easy yoga might help with the balance.
Modified bed Pilates might help strengthen her core. There are some YouTube videos.  Check with her doctor first
NSFW
Kegels might help with the pissing herself.
As long as she remains somewhat ""ambulatory"" she will have more options if she ever needs to go into assisted living.
Can you dress her, as she is laying down?
Elastic waist pants, and snap-on items perhaps.
comment 3: We went through this a few years back with my father, who now has managed to rehab up enough that on good days he can walk around the house without his walker even.  Our case, it ended up being that I could not physically handle him because of his size and my own deteriorating health, so we've all had to put in the work here to keep going.  
At this point, the best option would be to get her back into some PT.  You may be able to do this with just a phone call to her doctor to see if you can get physical therapy to come to her at home.  That way, PT can also assess her other needs and get her strengthened up a bit more too to hopefully prolong these things from happening, rather than making her adapt.  As long as she's making progress in it, medicare should cover most of the expense, plus being mostly homebound as it sounds, she is eligible for them to come.  The more independence she can keep now, the better it will be for her and you physically, mentally, and emotionally.  
I'd recommend a gait belt if you don't already have one.  
For dressing, if she can balance standing with a walker, you can dress her while sitting on the commode.  Her cleanups between baths/showers can be done there too before getting dressed while sitting there.  You can dress her upper half that way, then help get her pants, socks, and shoes on while seated on it, giving you more access to line stuff up with her legs.  Then you help her stand, she grips the walker for support, and you pull up the pants.  If she needs to sit back down then she can and you can swap the walker for the wheelchair where she needs it.  If she cannot do that, you can do the upper half of the body still on the commode, and the lower half you may have to do while she lays on the bed, with her laying on one side while you pull up the other side that you can access, and have her roll then to the other side and repeat.  
As for devices, there are technically standing lift machines (or sit to stand lifts, sit to stand machines) they use in assisted living and such, but they are expensive.  There may be some lower cost ones available, but even the ones used professionally are used between multiple people.
As for the incontinence, if you can get her to the commode on a schedule, it can start to help too, even if she says she doesn't need to go right then, the body learns.  Plus, her doctor may be able to look at her meds and see if something is contributing to it too.  That happened with my mother and it helped some when she was taken off one of her medications and another one was changed in dosage.
comment 4: One thing that we have is grab bars everywhere. They are all over.the bathroom, by the bed, they are more than just handy in the usual spots. They give something to hold onto by the portable comode. You can put them length wise to hang onto someone is standing and getting them dressed. Our house looks insane but if put up correctly, they are sturdy like a railing and have helped us a bit.
comment 5: There are recliner chairs that shift to help the person sitting in them stand up. 
I also recommend floor-to-ceiling grab bars.  We have several, especially near the bed and bathroom, which can help with balance a bit.
comment 6: So there are recliners that can help people stand up. They also have the grabber reacher that have helped my loved one after surgery. I had them sit on the commode while I put the pants on, if that helps. I’m sorry you’re going through this.
comment 7: For my grandma we have completely stopped putting pants on her, it's extremely hard so we dress her In diapers and gowns that have snaps in the back that open up. That way it's easy to change her and we can sometimes get her dressed laying down. These ones are similar to the ones we use: https://www.silverts.com/short-sleeve-hospital-gowns-for-women?___store=english&size=7120&color=5935&cur=usd&gclid=CjwKCAiAhbeCBhBcEiwAkv2cY-Jor3cK_PsLN5gNNya0ZzXptg_N7pJV8V1g_wYuP87c7TlcskiUhBoCUmYQAvD_BwE
comment 8: Have you tried any of the suggestions in the comments? There are a lot of great ones.
comment 9: We have floor to ceiling grab bars beside the bed and toilet. I change her while she is on the toilet. Before she sits on the toilet I pull her pants and diapers down. I change them while she is sitting. Then I change her shirt while she is still sitting. Then when she gets up she holds on to the the grab bar again and I pull her pants and diapers up.

"Did someone noticed a decline in cognitive functions after covid vaccine? !I'm not anti vax! This is a serious question!
My grandma has Dementia/Alzheimer since almost a year. It was quite stable. Missing words, not keeping track of dates and time, repeating the same stories a few times in the same day. 
She's receiving some medication from geriatric (going to have a next visit soon).
The thing is, after first doze of the vaccine her memory seemed to be getting worse (and for ex. she started phoning her daughters at 2AM). 
 Now she's after the second dose and her cognitive functions are declining rapidly - she's becoming aggressive, very stubborn (will not let us explain her when she's doing something wrong, she knows better), forgets to take her meds, forgets and mixes up things. Generally I can notice way more symptoms of Alzheimer (I know how they look like, my grandpa had it).
All those symptoms started appearing after she received the covid vaccine. I know with Alzheimer it can get worse suddenly but I dont know what to think about it. Is it just a coincidence?
Does someone have experience with people with dementia/alzheimer that received the vaccine? Did you notice the symptoms getting worse? Or maybe you don't think there are any differences?
I appreciate all the replies.","comment 1: I asked the owner of a 36-bed memory care facility whether they had witnessed any declines after the vaccines. He said No, but added that his residents got the Pfizer shot.
I will ask another facility of their experience.
My parents have dementia and are set to get the 2nd dose in less than two weeks. I do notice they have good days/weeks and bad ones.
My instinct is always to ask what went wrong when they have a bad day/week, but never to ask what went right when they have a good day/week.
comment 2: Thank you!
My grandma had Pfizer as well, second dose 2 weeks ago. It might unfortunately just be progressing dementia. Yesterday she had big problems with making her dinner whereas it was not a problem before, it's like during the past too weeks it's getting worse rapidly and we're very worried
comment 3: I heard back from another facility with 20 memory care residents. They too reported no cognitive decline from the 1st or 2nd vaccine. They noticed fatigue, weakness, and sore arms.
They did, however, notice cognitive decline in those who caught the virus, which makes sense.
I noticed my mother with Alzheimer's can decline very rapidly from any sort of stress, whether mental or physical (or a bad night's sleep, for example).
Hope your loved one bounces back and has some better days!
comment 4: My dad (82) got the Pfizer shot from the VA three weeks ago; he’s been stable/normal for him.
comment 5: My mom (75) had her second dose of Moderna on Monday. She had symptoms from the vaccine. No sign of any further or unusual cognitive decline.
comment 6: It’s far more likely what with millions of vaccines being administered that it has just happened to coincide with a decline in her case.  Because while the world gets vaccinated random health stuff will continue to happen to us all.
One of the reasons people brought into the MMR nonsense is because you have it around the same time that Autism symptoms really start to show up. 
With hindsight I could see signs in my son from 8 weeks old.
People also like to blame epidurals for postnatal back pain.  I have back pain, I had an epidural, it went in my back therefore the epidural caused my backache.
It couldn't possibly be multi factored.  
Pregnancy hormones soften your ligaments and increase the risk of strain in your body.
The position of your baby in labour putting pressure on your pelvis (FYI more people who have ‘back labour’ have epidurals.
Not being careful when you pick up and carry stuff after the birth, those car seats people carry about don’t exactly scream good for your back when you are trying to cart them around.
comment 7: Many of my friends living with dementia (and myself) have had vaccine with no more than ""normal"" results ... but several of my friends who actually got VIRUS itself have had quicker-than-usual decline.
comment 8: Four weeks post second dose of Pfizer shot.  She was more tired than usual the day after, but. I noticeable differences in declines.  Same up and down good days/bad days as before.
comment 9: My 90+ MIL lives with us and had both doses of Moderna. She has not had any decline since the vaccinations. She did however have a significant decline all of a sudden a few months before she got them. I really feel like the pandemic itself and her not getting out of the house at all really, especially in the winter,  was possibly contributory to her decline. I was really stunned by how quickly it could happen. It seemed like overnight she became noticeably worse one day. She has good days and bad but isn't anywhere near where she used to be even on her best days. I feared a stroke but she got an MRI and her Dr. said it was normal for someone of her age.
comment 10: Yes, my Mom has Alzheimers. Shes only 65. Since the 2nd dose, we noticed a steady decline. It was like night and day. She also randomly fell in the middle of the night the same night she got her 2nd dose. Shes a good walker so not sure what happened there. Im not an anti vaxer either. Not at all. But its very coincidental that she was fine and then right after getting the vaccine she was never the same again. That was a month ago.

"What tech should I get to keep dad safe? Granny cam? Alexa/Google device?? Dad is coming home in 2 days after almost two months in the hospital. He is going against everyone's advice and not moving into the main building where there is ample care, so what tech should I be looking for? I am going to have to hire psw care for him, and I'm a little concerned about strangers in his unit when I am not able to be there. For example, I have young children, and we are now quarantining flowing exposure to a positive case at school for the next two weeks. I've got my eye on a ""seniors"" clock that displays the time, date  and what part of the day it is (morning/afternoon/evening), and I intend to set up medical alert system with a necklace and call button, but I'm thinking about a video camera of some sort. Do I just get a video baby monitor? Something different? I remember seeing old posts over a year ago about doing this, wondering how those systems are working for others. 
Thanks everyone.","comment 1: I got a couple Echo's for my parents' apartment and set up the emergency calling. If anything were to happen, they could shout at the Echo for help and it would call, text, and alert me through the app. My parents could talk to me through the Echo.
comment 2: I'm using a couple of Blink mini cams now for more than six months. They can be set to motion trigger if armed, which I use at night to monitor for intrusion and also to make sure that my dad is getting up every day, or you can just use the phone app to pop in and view as needed. They also support 2 way audio which I was thinking could be helpful in the event of a fall -- I'd be able to announce that I'm calling for help, for example. This might or might not work ok for monitoring of a busier residence where you want to have video of what helpers are doing because it's not a continuous video monitoring solution -- it's better for more of a burst of activity solution. r/HomeSecuritySystems might have some better ideas for your specific situation.
comment 3: We have ring cameras set up for my 94yo mom and they're working pretty well - they detect motion.   My sister and I split the nights.  Mom likes to put a cloth over the camera in her room for when she changes.  She also takes it into the bathroom with her, aims it at the wall, for when she showers - then we can listen in case she runs into trouble.  We have 4 cameras set up plus the ring doorbell (3bdrm, 3 level home).  However, my mom would not wear a medicalert neckless because she said that it kept calling for help when she didn't need help.  She really likes saying goodnight to us at bedtime.
comment 4: Get a few wyze cameras (you can talk through them also, they allow memory cards so you can scrub the video ). They have different kinds. Get a ring peep hole camera or door bell camera so you are alerted if he comes or goes. I got my father that morning ect. clock and he loves it.
comment 5: I'm a former executive director for assisted living. 
Just a reminder that our seniors often struggle with both using and understanding Alexa/Echo. I've used my Google Home cameras and can broadcast/view my folks' house in Florida from anywhere. Accidents often happen in the bathroom, though, and no one wants a camera THERE!  :) 
Some of the personal emergency companies have devices which will detect a fall and can alert EMS. GreatCall comes to mind, but I'm sure LifeAlert and others have options. Fairly inexpensive (in the $50/mo range).  Making sure he's wearing it, and keeping it charged, can be a problem.
Newer age tech involves audio rather than relying on video which has blind spots. Artificial intelligence can learn his routine, recognize unusual sounds (including noticing that his voice seems distressed/happy, or there's an unknown person in the unit), and can alert the family. Not sure if they're marketing to the public yet, but a particular product comes to mind. I know they're available through a home care company. If you're interested, I'll reach out and get more info for you.

"What is the most important information to tell the geriatric psychiatrist about my mother? After years and years and YEARS of literally thinking this would never happen. My mom *finally* having an appointment with a geriatric psychiatrist. She's 75 and has had untreated mental illness (likely schizophrenia) for over 20 years. 
This summer she injured her foot and required in home nursing care to change the bandages/take care of the wound. The head nurse of home care was concerned about my mother's mental health and submitted a referral to Senior's Mental Health services. Thank god. The mental health nurse she's met with told me they are concerned about her mood/depression and memory issues.
She has an appointment coming up in 2 weeks. I've only just gotten in contact with the mental health nurse who made several visits to her house in the fall and she filled me in on the details, as my mom is quite ""tight lipped"" about such matters. My mom doesn't say much beyond ""I'm fine"" and ""I'll be okay"" and things like that to the doctors/nurses when she sees them, but she's much more canny when they're not around. So I think giving the nurse the low down on my mother cleared up some things and filled in her ""backstory"" for them. HOWEVER, due to the impact of her mental health ON ME... I think I was a bit too self-centered when talking to the nurse about her. 
The mental health nurse told me that the psychiatrist will probably want to speak to me about my mother (of course), but I'm afraid of repeating the same mistake I made with the mental health nurse. I talked FOREVER. It was embarrassing.
I'm thinking of creating a list of bullet points to mention to the psychiatrist so I don't lose track of the issue at hand. I'm going to highlight: her initial diagnosis 20 years ago (but I'm not the best witness because I was 12 when this all started 20 years ago), her poor hygiene, lack of concern about her physical well being (I had to take her to the hospital for her foot injury, she let it sit for a week and did nothing, it got so bad she had to be admitted for an infection), self medicating with alcohol for a number of years... I'm not sure what else would be important for the psychiatrist to know? Is there anything you'd all recommend to mention?
Truthfully, I kind of doubt that she has memory issues. She's fine around the house in her ""limited"" capacity. She's a bit more savvy than she lets on to the doctors, which I think... makes them think she has memory issues? Like, she REFUSES to answer any question they ask her about money. She absolutely REFUSES because she thinks it is beyond rude of them to ask! I know for a fact she does telephone banking, she takes care of her ""investments"" (not much, but still), she has a good idea of how much money she HAS. I'm the one that does the bill payments, practical stuff, but she is aware. Do I tell the psychiatrist this? She has told me MULTIPLE times how rude she thinks that question is!
But I can't say she doesn't have ""memory issues,"" but she's always been just... ""off"" and she's been consistently ""off"" in a general sense. I've just gotten USED TO her being mentally ill. Any advice? What would be most beneficial to tell the psychiatrist?","comment 1: Your instinct is right not to try not to overwhelm the psychiatrist, focus on 3 issue you are most concerned about.  its not your job to push any one diagnosis. 
Simply say I am concerned about her
Poor hygiene (2 examples)
Lack of concern about her physical well being  (2 examples)
Alcohol  Abuse/dependency (examples of how much she drinks)
They are asking about money because that is often the first thing that goes. Let the doctor lead the rest of the way. Ask what you should watch for going forward.
comment 2: This is excellent advice!
comment 3: It can be so amazingly refreshing to actually be HEARD that it can be tough to keep the conversation direct and on point.   I agree with the previous statement of making a bullet point list of your top three concerns (with quantifiable information such as severity of impact in her life, frequency of occurance,  repetitive injuries, etc). I also recommend another 2 more minor issues.  That way if the question, ""Do you have any further questions"" comes up, you are still clear and concise with more info to flesh out the situation..  
Best wishes to you.
comment 4: I’ve been through this!! Please read:
Take the time NOW & write it all down. Start today. Get it all out on paper or on the computer screen. Every concern of yours, the nurse’s, etc. Save all that as a document. 
Then copy that document & start editing it down. You will see themes emerge. Like what she did at my birthday party was a lot like what she did at Christmas-could be due to a lot of people being in the house? Or she just hates her sister & ends up arguing with her. Again, save that document. 
Now take a copy of that & see if you can whittle it down to 3-4 big issues. 
And email that to the doctor at least 3 days before your mom’s appointment. Then call the office & ask that the doctor please read it before the appointment because you anticipate that your mom will not be very forthcoming during her appointment. You can add that last line to your email as well. The doctor needs to know why you’re sending it in advance. 
The doctor isn’t allowed to share your mom’s medical info with you (until she’s given them written permission or you have POA) BUT you sure as heck can give the doctor all of the information that you want to about her. 
Take a copy of your email to the appointment. Take a copy of the other document(s) as well. The doctor may or may not want them. 
Once we finally got our family member in to see the psychiatrist, and it took years & years, our family member was very quiet during their appointments. However, the therapy provided to the other spouse (who was there to drive) was marriage-saving. So if your mom doesn’t talk feel free to talk to the psychiatrist.
comment 5: I put my questions on paper. I also made a list for the doctor. (Printed 2 copies)
Keep it concise. Let them ask you questions.
comment 6: My dad had paranoid schizophrenia and dementia.  Once the memory issues became really obvious, they stopped treating the schizophrenia.  He was still having symptoms, he'd tell us the watchers were there, and he was afraid.  So if you feel that memory problems are not the main concern at this point, it might be helpful to stress that to the psychiatrist.  My mom acts like her memory is failing when she's trying to get her own way, and I've seen my MIL do the same, so I think it might be fairly common among older women to act like they've got a memory problem when they just don't like the discussion.
comment 7: This isn't what you asked, but it might help and clear your head a bit to set a timer for twenty minutes, set the phone to record and just talk about how you feel about your Mom. Getting the words out and reviewing the recording can help you see more clearly what to share. What's important for the Doctor to know and what's something only you can really understand are both important things. Some of the information may be more useful to you than it is to the Doctor.

"Leaving Dad at home In the last month, my dad (early onset) has had neighbors call the police twice because he thought my mom had gone missing. My mom is his caregiver and has a routine for work that she adheres to very strictly to avoid this, but on the rare occasion she does something for herself (like going to dinner with friends tonight), my dad struggles and panics. 
He has issues with the phone (they just got a landline with pictures of family on the buttons) and even with Alexa reminders every hour of where my mom went tonight, he had the neighbors call the police. 
Any advice or similar experiences? My mom is determined to avoid memory care and keep him at home, but if these instances continue I’m afraid she’ll isolate.","comment 1: Alzheimer's patients should never be left alone. My dad was the worst about wondering off when we was just diagnosed and in early stages. We never left him alone and I can't tell you the above of times we heard the door and had to go running to make sure he didn't leave the yard. 
Maybe get a family member or hire an aide to give your mom breaks. Between my brother, husband and myself we've been able to work it out.
comment 2: I tend to agree. I dont know what stage of illness OP's dad is in but it sounds like he is at the stage that leaving him alone places him at risk. Dementia does not affect just memory - it affects judgement, reasoning, self-awareness, ability to sense danger, etc. It is also quite common for an early-onset dementia patient to have no ability to form memories of things said to them, but a modest ability to retain visual information. In my brothers case (early onset age 52), in the moderate stages of the disease we used visual cues, little photos of people with a brief note, scattered throughout the home, to make him aware of something (daughter is visiting, nurse XYZ is here to help today). But leaving an impaired person alone is risky.
comment 3: Agree.  Think of it as leaving a toddler home alone. You just dont do that.  Rotate carers, arrange respite care, etc.
comment 4: Similar experiences with my grandma. She couldn’t be left alone- she accompanied my grandpa anytime he had to go out. Once a week he’d go out with friends for a break and those days my mom would bring grandma to her house and keep her busy/occupied to give grandpa a break.

"Instructions idea needed dad has come to the point where he will think his phone runs the TV and sometimes that the remote is his phone. I can really tape or attach anything to the devices themselves. Only idea I have is to take a pic of each and make a how-to poster of what it is and how to use it. I can make signs and such but he will forget to look. I need to do it anyway, even if it just helps a bit. 
All he does with a phone is make and get calls. The remote is harder because he has Hulu and Youtube and prime. Although the remote is simple to use he would navigate the apps differently. Anyone faced this and found something to work? he hasnt watched TV all day. Right now he's just vegging in front of an off TV. No idea if hes just vegging or he forgot how to turn it on. Will drop in in a few and get it going.
thanks","comment 1: Does he consistently use all three of those apps? if not Id consider getting the ""flipper"" or other dementia-friendly remote-- they are much larger than other remotes and only have a few buttons. There are some remotes that have pictures of  the app names (nexflix, hulu, prime are on mine) but you might have better luck just switching over to a basic cable that's always on and getting a simple remote. Our cable company had a senior-friendly remote included when we switched. Now we rarely have problems, though she does sometimes point the remote the wrong way (a red arrow taped to the control may be a good solution if that becomes an issue)
As far as the phone, I found a flip phone is much less likely to be confused for a remote (or sat down and lost because it just looks like a shiny black box). In lieu of that, you may get a clunky case on which you can put a label ""PHONE"" right at the top. It might not solve the problem, but it may help.
comment 2: Thank you
   he had a flip phone but he said it was difficult to open in time. Tbh he never gets real calls, just spam. But in case one of his friends calls...He now has an adroid and all he has to do is press one button on the side. no lockscreen. 
   he used to have basic cable but was more expensive. he has a smart TV and Hulu, Prime and the Youtube app, along with the other lesser apps. I know it doesnt matter that its easy to use, all that matters is that its hard for him to remember and figure out. Its been getting worse so it seems that he is declining cognitively. What I considered is taking a pic of his devices and doing a poster and labeling one phone and one remote. I dont think it will help to write directions on how to get to the different channels. he would forget to look at it. part of his issue is he just clicks buttons without knowing where his thumb is at. So he just clicks but hes not clicking on the right button. If I can just get him to understand which is the remote and to look what he clicks on I think thats half the battle. 
   There is a voice search on Youtube but it isnt very good and he doesnt speak clearly. I just labeled the back of his phone and the lower half of the remote, will see what that does. Need to add an arrow. If I could get one with a button to get each app then maybe.
   he likes to search around all of em. 
Thank you
comment 3: I labeled the remotes and phone last night and he was watching TV when i got up. Now if he can keep understanding the menus we're in business. I think a big part of this is he has good and bad days. bad days are going to be a challenege no matter what. Lets hope for the best.
comment 4: definitely, it comes and goes. do you live together? Or you have some monitoring abilities it sounds like? 
If you have smart home stuff (like google home/chromecast devices) you may be able to set it up so you can turn the tv on yourself, remotely, if you see he is struggling.
comment 5: Yes I live with him. I usually will turn on TV when I make his brunch but its all him from that point. he is a browser as far as TV goes. he doesnt use the search function he just browses around til he finds something. Ive tried doing a favorites on each service but Youtube always signs him out and he doesnt understand what to do. Either that or he just doesnt want to try. Sometimes and it appears he cant do something, he just does it. Like somehow he gets motivated lol. I generally check on him about once an hour and if I see he's on a weird place I go help. Weird thing is he is a magnet for every adult show on hulu/Youtube/Prime. Dont know how he does it lol.
comment 6: hey, the man likes what he likes! :D
I've tried to keep my grandmother off news commentary stations that just upset her, and steer her toward Little House on the Prairie, I Dream of Jeannie, etc. Nope, every time I check she's somehow found Fox & Friends. Oh well. :/

"I can’t make them take care of themselves and it’s making me crazy. My dad is 70 and mom is 68. I’m 25f and an only child. 
My husband, 16 month old daughter, and I moved in with them last October for various reasons. (I was struggling greatly with postpartum and they were struggling to maintain their home.)
My mom has been through hell in the last 10 years. A heart attack, defibrillator put in, diabetes, breast cancer, double mastectomy, debilitating migraines, a (possible) brain stem stroke, and various other cognitive issues stemming from....a little bit of all of that. God love her, she only has probably 1-3 good days a week. But we’re on week 2 of her not getting out of bed except to eat right now. She takes so many medicines and gets very confused when she has her migraines, so I have to constantly make sure she’s taking her meds right and not skipping meds or double taking them. 
My dad is in much better shape all things considered. He has COPD and deteriorating vertebrae in his back that causes him a lot of pain. Other than that though, he’s surprisingly healthy considering how poorly he takes care of himself. 
My husband works full time, doesn’t get home until 10 or 11pm. I am a full time stay at home mom with our daughter. The original arrangement was to be a mutually beneficial living situation. I would help them with maintaining their (way too large for just them) house, and they would help me with my baby while I continued my mental health recovery. (You can see my post history for how serious my postpartum battle was.) 
What has happened, is I have been thrown into caring for both my parents and my child, while severely neglecting myself and my husband. 
My mother really can’t do much. Any time that she feels Ike being out of bed is a good day. And when she has good days, she spends all her time with my daughter. For that, I’m thankful. My dad though, is going to make me lose it. 
In my 25 years of life I have never seen him wash a single dish, he couldn’t even make ice if he tried, and he has straight up told me that he has no interest in learning how to do anything. If I don’t make him food, he will not eat. I buy sandwich stuff, microwave meals, and I always make enough food that there’s always left overs for him to warm up. But nope. If I don’t physically make him a plate and bring it to him he won’t eat. 
Most of that is kind of petty, but still another nail in my coffin. The biggest issue is the man smokes like a chimney. Both of my parents do. When we were talking about my family moving in with them, I told them that we would only move in if they completely stopped smoking inside. (Side note: they were the ones that wanted us to move in with them. They begged for months before we finally did.) They agreed and said they didn’t want to smoke in the house my daughter was in. They even had my aunt come and deep clean everything before we moved in. 
Every night when we go to bed (my family lives on the 2nd floor) my dad sits there and chain smokes in the living room. I can smell it when I walk out of our room. I’ve caught him doing it many times. I’ve talked to him about it 100s of times. He just won’t stop. Nevermind the fact that he has COPD, I’m trying to protect my daughter from second hand smoke! 
Ugh. I’m just so at a loss. I don’t know how to get through to them. I need them to want to be better. I’m scared about what will happen when we move out because I don’t think they’ll be able to manage this house by themselves but they’re way too prideful to try to hire help. 
When we move, I worry my dad will go days without eating or only eating chips and snacks when mom has bad days and can’t cook for him. That also means no one will be there to make sure my mom has something to eat when she has her bad days and is bedridden. Their house was a wreck when we moved in and I’ve finally gotten it back to normal but it took a long time and I’m sure it will take no time at all for it to get back the way it was. 
They’ll also eat food way past its expiration date or eat like, week old leftovers. It makes me gag and they get mad when I throw away rotten food. I’m seriously worried about what they’ll eat when we leave. 
I’m not sure if I had a point to this post, but I’m almost positive I got way off track from it. I’m just so worried and stressed and needed to get it out. Any kind words, ideas, or just support is greatly appreciated. /:","comment 1: Most towns and cities have senior's centers. Contact them and as for resources on setting boundaries and increasing independence. Those centers also have social workers who can help with accessing services. 
You can't do it all on your own. Your parents are likely to be eligible for services - let them know you need help. And set it up. Caregiver burnout is a real thing, and you have said yourself that you are struggling. 
It sounds like your mother needs a thorough check up from a specialist for older people. This is not normal at all, and her medications may have to be adjusted. 
Your dad is being a self entitled ass. A social worker might be able to come up with ideas on how to deal with his behavior. He is a generation behind in his thinking - my brothers are 67 and 75 and they both are able to cook, clean and take care of kids. 
For teaching intellectually disabled people how to do things, we use a method called backwards chaining. You could use it on your dad - think of it as a bit of a game. See what he will do and then provide food just a little bit further away or food that needs just a little bit more effort to put together. 
For example - with the sandwich, you could make it, give it to him but just put the condiment(s) he likes on the table so he has to do it. Very gradually change it so you are putting the sandwich fixings on the table.  Then""accidentally"" forget to put a condiment he likes on the table - so he has the choice to either get it or eat without it. The point isn't to punish him it is to help him get used to doing things himself. Eventually, put the sandwich fixings on the counter and hand him a plate. Again, forget some part of it in the fridge. Eventually he should be able to take all the things out of the fridge or cupboard himself. 
Same with soup or casseroles - start with him serving himself from a pot on the table, move it to the stovetop, put a plate of food in the microwave and ask him to take it out, start the microwave for him and let him know it will be warm in two minutes, hand him a cold plate and let him know how long to set the microwave - he can eat it cold or heat it up himself. Gradually, you should be able to leave a sandwich or a plate of food for him. 
But mostly you need to get services in and get support to set boundaries. Let them know what is ""too far"". The fact that they invited you to live with them gives you a bit of leverage. Smoking in the house where there is a baby or a child is no longer acceptable. 
I am feeling cranky on your behalf. They are barely older than I am and I find their behavior to be outrageous. Please take care of yourself. Make sure you and the baby get out for a few hours most days, and make sure you take time with your husband, too.
comment 2: These are all very good ideas, thank you so much!! I’m afraid his deal is less not knowing how to do things and more just refusing to. I just refuse to believe he made it to 70 without learning how to make basic things for himself. 
When my mother had her mastectomy, I was 21 and working 6-7 days a week running an animal clinic. I was gone by 7am and back by 7pm on a good day (usually later). He did nothing. I took care of moms surgery sites and drains, cooked, cleaned, worked, and he did nothing. That was the second time in my life I ever had a panic attack. 
That’s why I’m kind of at a loss. I’m definitely going to try to get in touch with our local senior center. I doubt they’ll be receptive though. Feels my only options are to stay here and be miserable or abandon them.
comment 3: Senior's centers deal every day with situations like yours. All I have heard of have semilars/resources/counselling on caregiver burnout and setting boundaries. 
I figured your dad knows how to do things. Backward chaining also works with inappropriate or maladaptive behaviors. It is an interesting bit of psychology to see where his limit is. Is he willing to take a plate from your hand or to pull a plate towards himself if you put it so he has to reach for it? Is he willing to take food off a common plate? Find his limit and just push it a little. It helps you with having a project and it helps him to gradually be more involved. 
Let their social worker and their doctor know they are needing more help than you can offer and they are refusing extra help. You can't do this on your own. You are being reasonable in your expectations. They are allowed to make poor choices for themselves but you don't have to fix things if they are unwilling to. They can refuse services but that does not mean that you have to take up the slack. 
If things are bad for your mental or physical health, the health of your baby or your relationship with your husband you are allowed to leave and act as a daughter rather than a caregiver. Take care of yourself first. This is not sustainable.
comment 4: I’m definitely going to do that. Thank you so much for taking the time to think and type all of this out for me. You’ve helped a lot and I really appreciate it. You’re very kind. :)
comment 5: Hey,
I'm really sorry and understand your frustrations completely. It's very kind of you to be so concerned and take good care of your parents, but it can't be easy when they won't help themselves so that it can also help make caring for them easier.
I take care of my dad full time too and I'm about your age (27). He can also be a bit stubborn, but Ensures have been a lifesaver when he was having issues with eating a few weeks ago. They're supposed to be really nutrious, high in calories, and he seems to enjoy drinking it.
If you leave the house, you can at least call them and tell them to each drink a bottle. It's minimal effort. Maybe some pre-made fruit plates that can be stored in the fridge and taken out whenever can come in handy? (although they might not want fruit, which is a different issue)
I recommend ensures wholeheartedly though.
Good luck to you and your family <3
comment 6: I’m seeing a lot of “battles” in your post. Some are worth fighting IMO, and some aren’t. Old food, tidy (not unhygienic) home, teaching dad to cook, and forcing them to quit smoking - all fall into “not worth it” category. 
The only battles I’d actively fight for would be to remove your daughter from secondhand smoke, everyone’s fed, “good-enough” housekeeping, finances organized, and meds managed. 
The latter list is already a massive undertaking. Don’t burden yourself with the earlier stuff because honestly, it doesn’t really matter to anyone but you. If someone tries to look down on you for it, then ask them what help they’re offering.
comment 7: I suppose you’re right. I feel like I’m just so fed up I’ve lost sight of what’s really important and what isn’t.
comment 8: My in-laws eat expired food, FIL drinks too much, MIL lives on candy and chips, their house is a mess, so I 100% can relate to your struggles and worry. What I’ve learned is that one can suggest, help in some situations, try to hire outside help, but if the elderly do not want to change their habits, if it counterproductive to continue to bang your head against the wall. If they don’t want to change, all your worry and stress is hurting you and not helping them. 
My personal opinion is that you need to focus on your child, husband and yourself. Your parents want you as a full time maid, cook, and care giver, but they aren’t willing to stop a habit that is very harmful to your daughter. That is not fair nor loving. I think it is time for you to move out. Your main responsibility is your child’s health and safety. Your other main responsibility is to yourself and you are setting yourself on fire to keep your parents warm. Tell your parents that you will help them arrange for a maid, caregiver, food delivery, accountant, but that you can no longer perform those jobs yourself. Yes, it will be hard. Yes, they may try to guilt you. But, please get your daughter away from the smoke and into a house where mommy can focus on her.
comment 9: This. Your parents have had a lifetime to get their act together. Now they have pushed it all onto you. It's time to set some hard boundaries. You and you family have to come first.  
Look into elder services in your area, try to organize help. But if they don't accept it, that's on them.   
I'm sorry you are going through this.
comment 10: That sounds very rough. Being a caretaker for a child is a full time job that I still haven’t figured out how anyone can do and have a job at the same time. It’s insane. Having to also deal with aging parents and their medical challenges and mental states on top of that isn’t sustainable. You need to be extra careful take take care of YOU first, then your kid, then whatever else you feel you can/want. Burnout is a real thing and you need to not fall into that trap. 
I’ve found the hero Medicine machine to be useful for my family about giving out meds on time - although I hate the monthly price it’s been a life saver. Maybe it could help with your moms meds? 
The smoking thing is awful and I don’t even know what to say. Smoking around children or people who don’t smoke is foul. :(
comment 11: I will definitely look into the medicine machine, thank you!!
I know, I really don’t know what to do. I want to leave because I don’t want my daughter around it but I don’t feel like I can because I don’t think my parents will be okay without me 😭
comment 12: The situation is a bit different but I chose to not come back to take care of my parents and instead have my family two states away.
My mom and dad (despite needing extensive help) told me “you have your own family you need to care for. Of course we want to see you more. Of course we need your help. But your family is your priority. And that’s ok”. 
It’s helped me a lot dealing with the guilt of not being there as much as I want. I imagine that most of our parents feel similarly to this even if they don’t say it.
comment 13: Not to be cold, but....which is more important to you, your daughter, who is literally the future - do you want her to have damaged lungs years later...?
...or the past? The refusal to stop smoking indoors (after agreeing to do so) is conscienceless!
comment 14: Hey an elder care attorney!!!!
comment 15: Have you had a heart to heart with your dad yet? He needs to know how his lack of taking any action or trying to help at all is causing you so much stress that you’re seriously considering on moving out. That yeah, you know the situation sucks and it’s not fair, but mom isn’t well and she needs him to step up too!
He’s needs to know that he’s showing through his actions that he doesn’t care about you and the unnecessary stress he’s adding to your plate through making you into a slave when he’s a very capable man, nor does he care about your daughter and his wife by continuing to smoke in the house!
Tell him that if he can’t chip in and stop smoking, you’re leaving. Tell him you’re going to put mom in a assisted living facility because if doesn’t care about making sure she eats and gets her meds on a regular basis that you can’t allow her to be neglected.  Your dad needs a reality check and to know that there are consequences to his choices. Maybe hearing some tough love and realizing that he might have to get separated from his wife, daughter, and grandchild might motivate him to help get up and do something! 
That said, you also need to get to the bottom in understanding his lack of trying. Is he depressed? Is he just being lazy because he’s had it so good for so long? Is he afraid that he will leave burners on? Is he intimidated to try because he feels overwhelmed in not knowing what to do? If you can find that out, that’s at least somewhere you can start, be it in getting him into therapy, purchasing gadgets specific for seniors living at home (special can/jar openers, timers, alert systems, etc.), or giving him some basic lessons in how to operate the microwave and stovetop, and leaving brightly colored index cards with instructions posted on the kitchen cabinet doors.
I’m so sorry, OP, that you’re parents are being so stubborn and hope that you will stick up for yourself and your family!
comment 16: I do not envy you. Trying to get ppl to put down the cigarettes is a thankless task - I’ve never succeeded in getting someone to put down the poison.
Hang in there, friend.

"How does CTE present itself? Is there brain fog? Are you guys familiar with early onset CTE.
I used to fight when I was younger (ages 5-16 Tae Kwon do as a sport). Within that time I did suffer 2 concussions where I was knocked unconscious. Also I prob taken a few good knocks in that time but did not put my lights out.
I perused running and ran track and field logging in about 60 miles a week from ages 18-23. Hopefully that repaired some of the damage taken when I was younger. Yet this fog came in abruptly on Aug 18. I am 25 years of age.
I was wondering does early CTE symptoms feel like a clouded consciousness. I don’t have any headaches or anything but I def feel like I am not myself and something is off and I can’t help but to think about my history of concussions. I always tend to think the worst however this fog has been over me since Aug 18 and has not let up. It’s been 6 months as of today.
I have seen 2 neurologist, had 2 Mri’s as well as 2 mra’s. There was an hyperintensity in my right frontal and the docs think the bright spot is the result from a concussion I had long ago. Over a decade ago and they think I’m perfectly fine in terms of cognition. However I know I don’t feel fine and something is def not right. Just trying to figure out why I have this fog.","comment 1: I think you're definitely right to be concerned about CTE. I'm an equestrian and can't even count how many times I fell or was thrown and got concussed. I worry about CTE a lot. 
I'm guessing that you expressed your specific concern about CTE to the neurologists? Did they seem to take you seriously? It really sucks that a positive diagnosis can only be made during autopsy. Additionally, have you considered seeing a neuropsychologist? 
On a side note, did you have COVID or ever show any symptoms? Brain fog is now a well documented long term side effect of COVID, unfortunately.
comment 2: Dang, sorry to hear about your symptoms. I had these symptoms prior to Covid so I don’t think it’s Covid. Haven’t expressed my concerns yet to my neurologist in terms of CTE bc I thought it was dementia but I def will next time I see them.
comment 3: X2 on the neuropsychologist, if you can afford it or can have your neurologist refer.  Best way to get an answer regarding the function of brain. 
I was lucky I had a baseline done after a major head injury so comparing later to cognitive issues was easy.
Post-concussion recovery and CTE/Dementia Pugilistica are two very different things.
comment 4: [deleted]
comment 5: Do you still suffer from the day to day fog?
comment 6: i have a few friends whose dementia seems to have been brought early by TBI and CTE, but i have no experience with that myself.  
Unfortunately neurologists are not omni-scient (knowing EVERYTHING).  They are people too.  That brain fog can be brought on by many other things, and (other than dementia symptoms) i have personally experienced brain fog from FibroMyalgia (abbreviated FMS) and from Celiac Disease (which causes problems from eating Gluten -- as in products with wheat, rye, or barley).
i have a friend with dementia whose TBI injuries were due to martial arts.  if you are on FaceBook i could probably connect you.
comment 7: [deleted]
comment 8: What do you mean by stop the brain fog by inducing activity? Like exercise and such?
comment 9: Also when you say brain fog, do you feel the slowness in thought? Like your in a dreamy state, or is just you feel fine but you just can’t remember things, or you forget things people just told you and you get lost. 
Bc I feel a lack of clarity, like my head is in the clouds all the time. And everything just looks a little off in my vision

"Tips for caregivers. My mom has has dementia for a couple years now, and since she got it at an early age (62) it has progresses very quickly. I was living in the States up until today, I just moved back home so Spain. I used to come twice a year but because of covid, its been over a year since I last saw her. Now, I will be here for some months and care for her. Today I am told I need to be the one encouraging her to go to the bathroom, and for the first time I had to wipe her. I always feared not being able to do this, for some reason I felt like it would be hard but it wasn't as bad as I thought but then again this is only day one. Any tips I should know? not sure if I should keep track of the times she goes so I don't forget, or even how much water I should give her. Pretty much any advice would be greatly appreciated.","comment 1: We are not at this stage but I always thought a bidet would help. You are so great to take care of your LO. I'm unfortunately needed to look into long term care for mine and it's been very hard to come to terms with this decision. Wishing you much luck.
comment 2: I feel you on this one, I am here with here right now but the goal is to find a long term plan and that might be the hardest thing we will ever had to do. Thank you for your response, I wish you the best of luck too. I know I don't know you but you can always talk to me thru here. It helps a bit having a community of people going thru the same.
comment 3: In regards to your question about water, it varies but its close to 2 liters of water a day is the recommended value for a woman.
My dads insurance covered getting a nutritionist for my dad so long as his primary care doctor referred him to one.  It only took one $15 copay to get the advice I needed to make sure he ate and drank enough.  Id recommend it if you could afford it.

Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone? I'm looking to get a fitness tracker (or something like it) for my aunt. I want to keep track of her heart rate and sleeping when I'm not there. She doesn't have a smart phone but does have wifi. I would need something that I could look at the stats when I'm not there. Any suggestions?,"comment 1: Not what you are asking for, but possibly helpful - 
We set up lots of cameras and door alarms and motion detectors so we would know if she went outside or fell. We also set up Alexa Dots in each room. We could drop in on her. We set reminders. We made signs telling her what to say. It all worked for a while.
comment 2: Yes we have the alexa echo on two rooms, adding it to a third soon, just wanted her to get used to them. She's having a hard time remembering that she can get them to do things even with the signs, but she enjoys the old pictures and we can still drop in. 
What kind of cameras did you use? We have the issue that she's in an apartment so it's hard to wire anything in, and there aren't a lot of plugs/she tends to unplug things of she doesn't know what it is. Plus she would flip if she knew we had cameras.
comment 3: We used the Alexa to set reminders to drink and take her medicine. I set reminders that said what the day a d date were. I could use the Alexa and the cameras to help her fix her remote and hang up the phone. As needs changed we adapted. They gave her independence and us peace of mind for a good while. Now I have playlists that run all night. It keeps her anxiety down. 
We have Wyze cams. They are inexpensive plug and plays. We told her they were alarms to keep anyone from getting in without us knowing. She didn’t really know they were cameras. They have little door alarms and motion detectors as well. Occasionally she would unplug, but they soon became part of the background. I live with her now. I now have two cameras and bed alarms in her room. I keep my phone open showing her all night. If she trips an alarm I can look over and see if she is getting up, or starting to fall if the bed or whatever. Sometimes she is just turning over. It saves me from getting up more than needed. 
Good luck.
comment 4: Great info, thank you so much!
comment 5: Just a warning about wyze cams.  I read they have a greater delay in motion  notification then many cams.  I cant remember the delay time but for me it was too long as I had to know right away when my dad got out of bed due to medical reasons.
comment 6: We use a bed alarm as well. It works when WiFi and electric is down. We try and have layers of protection.
comment 7: Thanks, yeah we had looked into that too but he's all better on that medical issue fortunately.  That was a killer as I barely slept during that time.  Hope you're not dying from the lack of sleep.
comment 8: The Samsung galaxy watch 3 can operate without a cell phone nearby if you get a data plan and the lte model.  Apple watch is another alternative though you need an iPhone to set it up.  
Samsung watch can monitor sleeping habits and it can measure heart rate.  I'm not sure if it will send you an alert if the heart rate is irregular tho. It also has fall detection so if she falls, it'll notify  emergency services and you.    She still needs to wear it tho.
Theres also subscription emergency services which offer fall detection and if she pushes a button, a private company will speak with her and manage all emergency response.  The issue here with my dadnisnthatnwithndementia, I don't think he'll remember to push the button.
I videotape my dads great room to make sure he ate his breakfast completely and if he didn't, I push him to eat more later in the day.  You can video and playback her sleeping if you want.
comment 9: Do you have a suggestion for a camera? Been having a hard time finding one that would work. 
She has a life alert type thing and has fallen or had issues but WILL NOT press it. She always thinks she's fine or she can figure it out herself and doesn't want to bother anyone for help. 
I've heard about the fall detection in smart watches and it seems great, but I don't have an iPhone and we are trying to avoid another monthly fee, but I appreciate the suggestions!
comment 10: I suggest not eufy cameras if you are using alexa.  I cant trigger routines with the cameras when they detect motion.  I tried the blink mini too because I need routines but I had troubles getting the routines to work with those too even though they should have been seamless as they are amazon brand.
I don't have a particular brand suggestion, but I do suggest you look for cameras that specifically can trigger routines if you think there might even be a slim chance you need routines triggered in the future.  Also, if you think allowing multiple users to have different levels and times of access is important, id make sure the camera can do that as well. I want to higher a caregiver and give them camera access during certain hours of the day only.  But blink minis don't allow for different users and eufy cams allow different users but don't allow restrictions based on time of day.  Although, I'm just getting an extra eufy came and then putting a smart plug in that turns the cam off during certain hours a day as a work around. Miss cheaper than the more expensive cameras that can do all the stuff I want.
Fyi, ou can get samsung smart watch 3 and not get a data plan if you wanted.  I only suggested the data plan because if she left an area with wifi, then some of the watch functions wouldn't work but i think it should still work within wifi.    That doesn't require an iPhone and you could just get the wifi version if you dont want a monthly fee.  Do a little research on the watch if you choose to buy tho cause I haven't actually gotten it yet.
Just an FYI, The fee is just $10 a month typically  for data with most plans.  Though like i said, if you're in wifi you don't need it.  $5 per month if you are on magenta or above plan on tmobile.  But yeah, I'm debating getting the plan myself (will research more later) as I don't have a magenta plan.  I'm going to get the lte version tho just in case I change my mind.
comment 11: Good to know, I will definitely look into the samsung smart watch. Thank you!
comment 12: I forgot to discuss cameras so I edited my last comment just as an fyi.
comment 13: I think what I can do is get a smart phone without a sim card and hook it up to the WiFi at her place. Then I can have the app for whatever fitness tracker I get on the phone and it will be able to upload the data from the tracker to the phone and then the data will be accessible online through whatever app the tracker links to. I'll have to do a little testing and some more research for which trackers upload to apps that are accessible remotely but I have some faith this will work
comment 14: I use my brain and a notebook. It's worked for several decades.
comment 15: That would work if someone was there all the time to check her heart rate, however there isn't. We've made sure her environment is safe for her and I'm just looking for something to give me peace of mind when I'm not there.
comment 16: Well, why do you need (want) to keep track of it? I think it gets to a point where we impose this nonsense on ourselves and it isn't healthy.
For example, my wife has dementia and she's going to die - maybe within the next year. Is it necessary to know every blip and fart in real time? It isn't going to change the outcome. I'm very serious about that question as it takes a real effort to modify your thinking.
comment 17: I think I've taken a fairly hand off approach. My aunt wishes to remain in her home, living alone, until she dies. That may not be the actuality of it, but I'm going to do what I can to make that happen. 
Knowing how much she's actually slept and what her heart rate is can help us guide her to get what she needs to feel better. She has blood pressure issues so being able to track it will let us know if bringing her to the doctor is necessary. 
I'm assuming that your wife is probably getting more constant care/supervision than my aunt is. We are lucky enough to have technology that can help us monitor her, thus keeping her in her own home for as long as possible. 
While it seems that you don't have any actual help with my question, I did figure it out on my own, using my brain, as you had suggested earlier.
comment 18: Well, are you trying to avoid the use of a smartphone completely, or just avoiding her having one? If the latter you could pair an iWatch with your phone for remote access. I would trust any of the Apple devices more than Windows.
comment 19: The issue with that is it won't give the data real time because it needs the phone there in order to access the data on the watch. So I would only be getting data from the time I wasn't there. 
The issue we wanted to avoid was another monthly fee for a cellphone she won't use, burI think I figured out a work around, I posted it below

"Best GPS tracker I'm looking around for a GPS tracker for my elderly mother who adimently insists she wants to stay in her own house regardless of what it means for her and her health, but at night goes wandering becuase she dosen't know where she is.
I want her to still have her own independence and go out in her own garden, but any further I'd like to be notified on my phone, as she's wandered off for miles before.
Which GPS trackers have people on here had experience with. Preferably a one I can put my own SIM card into","comment 1: Hi /u/William444555, I'm sorry to hear about your mother. That's a really rough situation to be in. My grandmother suffered from dementia throughout her 90s (she made it to 96!) although thankfully she didn't tend to wander. That balance between independence and security is really tricky.
I know a bit about these things as I work for a company which makes GPS trackers. Maybe I can contribute to the discussion. 
*Here's an overview of the different types of trackers on the market today.
*


Bluetooth trackers: 
There are lots out there but the best known are Tile and Samsung's Tag. They great for finding your keys when you've misplaced them at home. Within a range of 30 or so yards, they can be incredibly accurate. As more and more people use them, you will also be able to locate your Tile/Tag remotely using data collected from passers-by. Great for keys and small items you often misplace, not so great for vehicles or people. 


Real time GPS Trackers: 
There is a pretty wide range of trackers in this category and most are focused on vehicle tracking. A large number of the cheaper options are the same 2 or 3 models rebranded and resold by different companies under different names.


These trackers ether use 2G/3G (or rarely, 4G) networks to constantly update their location. For vehicles they can be hardwired in. However, outside of use in a vehicle, because they are updating all the time, their battery life is very short (or they use a massive battery to compensate). These sort of trackers are great for keeping an eye on your fleet of delivery vehicles to know where they are at every second, or for tracking your bike route across town. There are some wearable trackers (watches, etc.) which are mostly marketed for use with children that function in a similar way. Again, battery life is the limiting factor and they typically need to be charged every day. 
Many companies selling this type of tracker are looking to make a profit off the monthly subscription, and not the sale of the hardware. In the U.S. these subscription costs can range anywhere from $15 - $30 per month. If purchasing this type of tracker, be wary of the low upfront prices. 


GPS Alert Beacons:
The most well known brand in this category is SPOT. These trackers are designed to work practically anywhere and are a great lifeline for hikers and outdoors enthusiasts. The're usually designed to only send out an alert if a button is pressed. They can also send prerecorded messages. Great for outdoor sports, not great for elderly parents who will forget to press the SOS button. Expensive, but worth their weight in gold if you're hiking solo. 


GPS Trackers with motion sensing and regular interval position updates


This last category use the same 2G/3G/4G networks as the real time trackers, but either only activate when they sense motion, or send regular less frequent updates about their position. These trackers are great for theft prevention and recovery, as well as tracking people. You won't get the picture perfect map of every step your mother's taken throughout her day, but you'll get a ping every few minutes. The biggest advantage here is that battery life can be extremely good. 
There are a handful of companies out there which make trackers like this, (disclaimer: my own included) and some are the right size/shape to be tied into clothing, slipped into a pocket or handbag. 
I think this is the category where you should be looking. Are you based in the U.S. or U.K.?
Some of our customers are definitely using our trackers to keep an eye on their elderly parents/grandparents and, from what we've seen, they're working well. We didn't design specifically for this use, but I'm glad our products are helping families like this. 
As I don't know this subreddit's rules, I'm going to avoid linking to anywhere, but feel free to DM me or google my company.

"Tech recommendations for assisted living My grandmother is in an assisted living facility. I couldn’t say what stage of dementia she’s at but it has been ongoing struggling for family to communicate with her due to COVID. We aren’t allowed inside and it’s very hard to get the staff to make sure her phone is plugged in and on the hook. She has an echo show but sometimes unplugs it or turns off the camera/mic when trying to move it. Her corded phone is the only other way to talk to her aside from shouting through the window, and she frequently forgets to put the phone back on the receiver. Are there electronics like phones or other devices specifically designed for people with dementia or Alzheimer’s?","comment 1: I’m in Texas, we have a essential caregiver plan in place that allows me access to my father. I can even touch him.  
Please contact “Mary” with Texas Caregivers for Compromise on Facebook. Our group petitioned state government and gained the right for visits. Mary can guide you snd there is a wealth of information compiled by the group. 
I wish I could suggest electronics  ,as my dad tinkers with clocks and phones .  I have the same problem.
comment 2: My mom does the same thing. She can’t use a cell phone and doesn’t remember to put the phone back on the cradle. Also can’t use a computer. Wish I had an answer but I don’t. Best wishes to you
comment 3: Set up a fire cube to her tv with a web camera mounted on top without her knowing and put either a Logitech harmony hub or broadlink rm mini 3 or 4 cant remember which number so that you can change the channel.  I haven't used the Logitech hub but in theory you should be able to say on your own phone, drop in grandma and everything will pull together for you to skype your grandma if you set it up to work that way.  The rm mini is way cheaper and can let you control her tv too however alexa integration while there isn't as good.
The fire cube can be hidden away so she won't touch it with just a tiny ir sensor sticking out which she can't see easily.  It needs to be plugged in but if you put the tv stand against where the outlet is, maybe she won't be able to touch it since heavy movement of the stand is required.
I haven't tried this combo myself but the firecube is supposed to be able to allow drop in calls with skype.  I do have the broadlink mini and it works great but I wish I had a harmony instead of being cheap now for the better alexa integration.  I actually hook up a desktop pc so I can do way more things than skype with my dad but that takes effort so not for everyone.
Or just move the echo to the tv stand that blocks the outlet?
Note, some assist ed living don't allow cameras but you'd be using a Webcam so maybe that would be alliwed.  It's what an echo show has too really.
Esit:  the harmony hub/broadlink mini is used so you can switch the tv on and to the correct hdmi.  The firecube might be able to do this for you by itself but for some reason it doesn't work right for me and it won't switch back to the antenna inp u t after you turn it off.

Device around neck to alert of falls My mom is recently widowed and is nearly 80.  She wants to continue living alone where she is now but has asked me to research the devices that are worn around your neck and will alert others if a fall or accident.  Any suggestions or types or service plans to consider?  Thanks.,"comment 1: I have https://www.bayalarmmedical.com/ for my dad. Luckily he hasn't needed to use it. 
The fall alert feature on it's own from what I was told by a few people is not worth it unless the family member falls all the time or has epilepsy or something like that.
I do think LifeAlert is better becasue of faster response time. He used to have that but cancelled his plan when he went to Assisted living for some time but they doubled their price so it's real expensive.
comment 2: The cheapest might be to get a Wyze camera.  Ask her not if she minds being spied on but if she would like a security camera, “for the living room”.  $25 for the camera, plus any internet connection, no month to month fees.  With sound enabled a yell from anywhere in a small house should be audible by the camera.  You can even tell her for privacy reasons that you’re leaving the audio off unless you don’t hear from her for a few hours.    or if she’s really into privacy you could put it by the front door and just use it as a security camera but still have the audio enabled in case she needs to yell for help.  Just a thought.  Only you and someone with an administrator password can login and view the video, it’s reasonably private, but of course do your own research.  Good luck.
comment 3: Wouldn't somebody have to be monitoring that, though? I would feel terrible if we had a camera like that, and Grandma fell, but I was out all day running errands or something and missed it until I got back.
comment 4: Oh yeah, for sure, but I find it at least as likely that a fall would incapacitate such a woman to a degree she couldn’t push a button, even one around her neck, in which case monitoring would be the way to go.  I think with all these things you have to weigh the pros and cons, and it definitely might not be for you.  That said there are motion detectors and if you know your mom regularly goes in and out of an area and that motion detector isn’t set off then you would get notified or not that she was moving.. there are also audible alerts.  Good luck.
comment 5: Yeah, I agree. Plus, a LifeAlert doesn't help if somebody has a stroke, as my aunt did.
comment 6: Yeah this seems like a terrible idea.
comment 7: My MIL has a Lifeline. Touchy little bugger but at least we know it works. It is less than $100 a month. She had a hard time wearing it in the beginning, but now she wears it all the time.
comment 8: Insurance covered one for my Dad.
comment 9: I am a retired paramedic.  We responded all the time to calls from life alert.  They stayed on the box with the person until we arrived and then would ask us to reset the box when we were with the person.  I am now at the age that I am looking for one for me.  I am still active so I need one with GPS.  Don't have an answer for what is best, but I will say I have had lots of first-hand knowledge with life alert.
comment 10: She may be more comfortable with a watch. My dad had the necklace (inside) and the watch (outside).
comment 11: I looked at a bunch of these for my mom. I went with Great Call mobility device. It can be used outside the house. It's Verizon service. If it's lost or broken, it's the cost of the device (under 100) and sign back up for the service. Some companies don't tell you it could be hundreds of dollars to replace the device. It's easy to charge by laying it inside a charging untit. You can set it up on the computer with lots of details. 
I put a lockbox on the front gate with the hopse key in it. The service has the pin number for it and instructrions about the dog.
comment 12: We've stationed Ring cameras around my mom's place.  They have motion sensors and we can look in on her from anywhere.  Mom did not want to wear one of those devices.  She had one previously and didn't like it.   Mom also has an emergency cell phone like this:  https://www.wish.com/product/5cc8074dc36c9137ef09ece4?hide_login_modal=true&from_ad=goog_shopping&_display_country_code=CA&_force_currency_code=CAD&pid=googleadwords_int&c=6493229759&ad_cid=5cc8074dc36c9137ef09ece4&ad_cc=CA&ad_lang=EN&ad_curr=CAD&ad_price=34.00&campaign_id=6493229759&exclude_install=true&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6t6ABhDMARIsAONIYywJWTHkSUSXnICII9l9yAkX8d8HFZ9vxVcGkniGVeY8AnAFAB9r7rMaArYfEALw_wcB&share=web
She does wear that on a lanyard
comment 13: Apple Watch has this feature.
comment 14: Just FYI, my mother-in-law bought an Apple Watch just for this feature. It went off when she was making her bed, but then a couple of months later, she fell and broke her leg when she was outside with her dogs and it didn't go off. She had to yell to her practically deaf husband to come get her. It took a while. She doesn't trust it now anymore.
comment 15: There are other smartwatches out there that have an SOS call function built-in, alongside fall detection.  I've not used any but have been researching it myself and seen a few interesting options out there.  
So maybe worth still looking down this route, OP.
comment 16: MIL used the Phillips alert service for many years before she passed. It worked very well in her rural area and was a reasonably priced monthly subscription. But she had to remember to  put the necklace on every day. In this months issue of Consumer Reports, that I read last night, they have reviewed and rated many of the health alert services, I'm at work so don't have the issue with me, but you may be able to see the report on line.

"Remembering to take medication. My dad has very recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. He is 63 and has never had any health issues before this so has never had to take regular medication.
My mum passed away 6 years ago so he lives alone and unfortunately I live an hour away.
He is struggling to remember to take medication. Any solutions?
We have a monthly pill box (I can't get home weekly so this is the best solution). We have Amazon Alexa with an alarm going off at 10am and he knows this is to remind him but he still doesn't go and take them.
He's now changed medication and has to take one pill morning and evening which is now an issue as he doesn't remember the evening one.
He won't accept outside help yet as he's literally only been diagnosed for 3 months and has barely even told his friends yet. 
Also are there any groups or places you go to chat about your situation? I think I would like someone to chat to about it all as its happened all of a sudden and it's a lot to take in.
Thanks for any replied and apologies for the long post.","comment 1: We bought a round medelert off Amazon. It has a lock and moves to the next section. When it moves to the section, an alarm goes off (it's loud) and it continues to go off until the unit is picked up and turned over or for 30 min. You wouldn't have to lock it, but we do because he has doubled up before. It works for us.
comment 2: This looks exactly what we need. Thank you so much!
comment 3: There are several options including the one just mentioned. My dad uses the built-in alarm in his phone to tell him when to take meds. Then his meds are arranged in a weekly pill box divided by morning and evening meds.
comment 4: He's not good at using his phone and sometimes it's not even switched on. I think the one mentioned above will be perfect. Thanks for the advice.
comment 5: There are services that will call him when he's supposed to take his medicine and they can actually stay on the phone with him while he goes and gets the pills and takes them. Many are part of insurance companies, so you might start there with a call to see if they offer the service.
comment 6: If your dad is able to use computer or iPad, i am very partial to www.dementiamentors.org , for us as Persons Living with Dementia .  There is also video Zoom chat as a family on Harry's Friday night chat with Forget-Me-Not.

"Caring for Father Post-Stroke Hi All
I am writing to ask for ideas/advice about my father's situation. Apologies for the wall of text/mind dump.
My father (67) lives in his own about 60 miles west of my city in a semi rural area. In 2019 he had a minor stroke and was hospitalised for a few weeks for rehab, then after about 6 weeks he returned to his house (my parents separated 4 years ago - so he is on his own).
Ever since then we have noticed a progressive decline in his abilities and in his health in general. Falls are my biggest concern - he has spells of vertigo and needs to catch ahold of something to stop from falling over. This wouldn't be so bad - except that he has had falls and struggles to right himself. 
Despite his doctor not signing for him to renew his license, he drives his car to run errands (going to the shop to buy staples).
Last week he fell while trying to close the gate after driving in to his property. He apparently had to crawl back to the car to pull himself up. While that fall itself annoys me (he goes grocery shopping with an assistant once per week), I am more concerned about the fact he could kill someone while being stubborn. Oh and I could go to visit him and find him dead in the driveway. Of course, he ""forgets"" to wear the fall alarm that my mother had arranged for him.
His nearest neighbour is 100 yards away and they too are elderly. I feel that he unfairly relies on them to help him out with basic stuff - for example he pays the neighbor $100 per week to clean his house. He is incapable/doesn't care about mowing the grass or tending to the gardens.
Speaking of cleaning - left to his own devices, the man is a ""filth wizard"". When I arrive I never know how high the pile of unwashed dishes will be, how much spoiled food will be in the fridge, or if his bed will be covered in food stains.
Yes, he eats in his bed. He will chew his way through a packet of biscuits, or a family sized block of chocolate. He might make the occasional sandwich (ham and cheese). Sometimes he will use his air dryer to cook chips (fries) - the nutritional content of his diet is non-existent.
In addition to the copious pills prescribed by his doctors (arranged in Webster packs), he also will drink Coke rather than water - which does not mix with his Type II diabetes.
During the day, he spends his time sleeping in the air conditioning, and at night he is on his phone reading articles about the US election (he's an ardent Trump supporter, despite living on the other side of the world). 
He also has his DVD collection, where he will watch movies in the ""lounge room"" or on the portable disc player in his bedroom.
His back is constantly sore - hence is spends so much time in bed. Due to talks he has a sore knee. His muscle tone is terrible because despite being told to exercise by the therapist (who he told to get out of his house), he has done nothing to help himself.
A lasting side effect of the stroke is that he has trouble swallowing. He might drink a sip of coffee but be unable to swallow - so he will gag and gasp for air (and not in a good way). This in turn has him afraid to drink water - at one stage my sister admitted him to hospital for dehydration.
A recent symptom is urinary incontinence. My sister arranged some adult diapers for him - but he has given up on these. When he did have them, he would not take them to the outdoor trash. To do this involves a 250m walk down his driveway - or a drive as he would likely do, so they would pile up at his bedside.
His toilets are diabolical. I'm not sure how anyone can take a crap at that angle - yet the place is disgusting. 
He does not do his own washing. He will wear all clothes until there is nothing left - then either his neighbor will wash some clothes or we will do it when we visit.
He is of the opinion that ""it will get better"" (through wishful thinking apparently). He is not actively seeking to improve his life - much to our families annoyance.
I visited his doctor with him and noted that he would ask about his knee; but I believe he is too embarrassed to mention the incontinence. I personally think he should be checked out for Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (I have the high pressure version myself) - but it is extremely difficult for me to drive 2 hrs each way to go to these appointments.
I feel that I have no choice but to take a more active role in his life. My logic goes that if he was NOT living on his own, and was in an assisted care facility (not a nursing home per se), that his quality of life would be better because he could get daily help to be more healthy.
Today I bit the bullet and went to visit an assisted living (serviced apartment) to try to understand what options are available. I found a place that would give him a 1 bedroom apartment with ensuite - with 24 hour staff on site. Perhaps the most important thing for me is they have caterers on site - so while they might not serve the nicest food, it would likely be better prepared and better for him (especially given his diabetes). It would mean relinquishing his car, but they have a courtesy bus which takes residents to/from the local shops. They even have a doctor who visits once per week and a pharmacy that delivers.
I would certainly sleep better knowing that he is eating better and not on his own. That he isn't killing anyone on the road, or isn't lying in his back yard injured.
Having said that, its his life. I can't force him to sell his 5 acres and downside to 500 sq ft! I only want the best for him - but I know he will put up a fight.
I was hoping to get an outside perspective (am I being unreasonable?) How have you had the talk with your parents?
Thanks for reading.","comment 1: You are absolutely being reasonable. Anyone who falls and cannot get back up, is incontinent, has trouble swallowing, isn’t able to cook or do his washing needs a full time aide or a appropriate facility. He hopes his health will improve but he’s not doing anything to make that happen. I also agree that getting him to agree is going to be difficult. Does the Assisted Living Facility offer activities he would enjoy? I would approach it from the social, food, fun side. Take a virtual tour (or live if you don’t have COVID restrictions.) Let him see how nice and clean the rooms are. Ask for sample menus to share with him. Tell him you’d feel so much better if you knew he was having fun and eating well. Maybe suggest he try it for a month and he can go home if it doesn’t work for him. Good luck!
comment 2: Thanks. I came up with a plan to show him both places I visited yesterday in a very specific order. First show him the depressing OAC home, followed by the serviced apartment - he'll freak at the first but should be more relaxed at the second (my preferred option).
comment 3: His situation sounds miserable. Is it possible he's also suffering from depression? And the incontinence, is it that he can't tell he's going, or he just can't get out of bed fast enough to get to the toilet? A urinal jar by the bed might be a solution if it's the second, then he could empty it when he had to get up for something else.
My FIL was one of those old guys who just don't bother to take care of themselves or the house after the wife is gone. The solution he found was having a roommate, a younger lady who stayed in his house and cooked and cleaned instead of paying rent. She wasn't there around the clock, she still worked and spent time with her kids and grandkids. But it was good knowing someone was there sometimes.
comment 4: >The solution he found was having a roommate, a younger lady who stayed in his house and cooked and cleaned instead of paying rent.
This is a great solution.  In America (I can tell OP is not in America) there is an app called Nesterly that matches students with older people for no or low rent.
comment 5: For the water issue- my mother also had a stroke and has swallowing issues. There is a drink thickener you can add that is made specifically for this purpose, there are different levels of thickness depending on the severity of his issue.
comment 6: Thanks - I think he had these after the stroke in the hospital. Just need to make it easier to drink his than take a swig of Coke.
comment 7: First, you're not being unreasonable.  Would he even accept home healthcare to come in and assist him?  If he accepted help you could contact the Area Agency on Aging to find out how to apply for services like home health aid, physical therapy, wheels on meals, etc.  Has he been assessed for his cognitive abilities or his mental health?
If he doesn't accept help, and you're worried about his safety you can contact Adult Protective Services to come and do an assessment.
I'm sorry that has to be so tough.
edit:   I forgot to mention his driving.  Since he doesn't care if he has a valid driver's license I've read where many adult children resort to disabling the car.  Can you arrange for alternative transportation?
comment 8: Thanks. Where my parents chose to buy, a taxi or Uber will return him home - but won't do a pick up. Short of a chauffeur service he is really stuck.
comment 9: It's not his life, sorry to tell you that, but either you assume the responsibility or they die in filth or kill someone (driving).  You need a patient care facility, DON'T tell them about the incontinence, or they will never admit him.  Your father is a DANGER TO OTHER MOTORISTS and you may liable if he kills someone, the civil suit could bankrupt YOU.  Right now you need to do three things: 1) Get a durable power of attorney 2) liquidate your fathers assets 3) Admit him ASAP to a proper nursing facility and setup his social security and medicare so they are at least safe and direct deposited to the right place so if you become incapacitated his income isn't stolen.  
This will take about  3-4 months of your life if you work at it full time and start now, from my experience, but it will potentially keep your father alive with better quality of life.  With your fathers liquidated assets set up a trust to cover his expenses.  Go over the will if he has one at the same time.
Also, be prepared to have your father throw every nasty thing at the book at you to get you to stop.  You will do everything short of Tasing them to get them to comply, it can be hard, but they won't even know it happened in a year.  
Wishing you the best of luck.
comment 10: What I see from your post is that he is not doing very well in terms of his mental space after losing his partner that too seperation and then living an alone life after retirement. My dad also became very stubborn after retirement as it's like till 1 day the person is capable of handling himself and next day post retirement he has nothing to do. It's just very difficult for many people to transition from one state to another and that's where the ego brings in stubbornness. 
I don't know how things work in your country but if I were you, I would rather ask him to shift near to his best friend or family (relatively younger and havinb time on their hands kind of family\friend) and work with him to get the best days of his life.
comment 11: Yes. Focusing on making the best of his time is the angle I'm going to take.
comment 12: An assisted living facility is not the place for him, for if he were able to get admitted, he would not stay long because they do not have the round-the-clock staff. He needs skilled nursing care, period.
comment 13: Assisted living sounds like a great option. Not sure where you are and how it will be paid for. If private funds its expensive but easy. If Medicaid/state funds you have less choices. Also, Medicaid/state funded means they take assets, something else to look into. 
My mom was in a state funded/Medicaid assisted living and she loved it, she actually had more socialization with the people living there and less stress. I had peace of mind.
comment 14: Thank you everyone for your thoughts. 
We live in Australia - so we're relatively fortunate to have subsidised medical care. We WILL need to sell his house to buy in to the facility. So this is a one way street for him. 
It's time. Wish me luck.

"GPS tracker recommendations Hi all.
My father-in-law has been diagnosed, it’s not too bad yet, but it’s progressing. My mother-in-law has tasked me with finding a GPS tag type of thing just in case he goes for a wander. I’m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for a service or product that could work. 
Ideally, it’d be something with multiple tags, like it’d work on his phone and on some sort of pendant/keychain? It also has to be fairly easy to use, she’s not great with tech or English and they're in Hawaii and we're in the mainland US so I can't help with the setup.
I’ve done some looking but there are so damned many things and services that just look like scams or a way to separate desperate people from their money I’m at a loss.
And just randomly anything else we can get or set up to help them?
Any help would be appreciated.","comment 1: They have them for dogs, but I have not found them for people yet. My brother in law makes GPS trackers for wild animals, maybe he could hook you up.
comment 2: Contact your areas Alzheimers .org or dementia .org, they know all the great info & resources & tips.  Often have 24/7 helplines, although I'm in Australia so I don't know about your place.  Best of luck!
comment 3: My mom kept throwing away the wristband GPS and cellphone plan we got through Bayside. She always wore a watch, so we thought she'd adjust, but she hated it and refused to wear it . It made it really hard as we couldn't find it and are pretty sure it went into the curbside bin, and returning it with that missing wristband was costly. I think if we had to do it again, I'd just get Tile trackers and sew them into her shoes, pants, and jacket.
comment 4: Does she reliably carry a phone? I was looking into Tile for the same thing a little while ago and they track location based on the phones location, so they just give the last location it was able to sync with the phone. Unless they have new products now? My dad was never able to get the hang of smart phones and now he won't take his normal phone with him even most of the time so the Tile didn't work out. I've struggled to find something that he'll keep on him.
comment 5: No, but what Tile support suggested is that we could install the app on our phone and see last known location. In the end, we didn't bother. She became paranoid that a neighbor was trying to kill her and didn't want to be in her house. We moved her into assisted living and quickly that changed to a lockdown Alzheimer's community as she escaped too many times.
comment 6: When I was looking these up I was told by a couple of professionals that these give a false sense of safety. My dad liked to walked off so we put bells on the door so we would know if he opened a door. We also did preventative measures like put those basic slide locks at the base of the doors that we nudged open with our foot but dad never noticed them.
But! For backup I heard placing the tracker in or on the shoe is the best. Alzheimer's patients rarely forget to put on their shoes.
comment 7: We have a special watch which notifies of a fall and you can track GPS for my dad.
I think ours was called smartie watch
comment 8: Hey there werent good gps trackers when i had dementia people in my family, but from what it looks now, if your step mom is not tech or english savvy (my mom also isnt) it may end up that you or someone else actually has to do the tracking if need be. You may also consider suggesting she  sew personal info tags into his clothes. My dad took off/broke anything extra on him and lost his shoes when he went off wandering. 
Edit: in the off chance hes used to carrying a smart phone on him all the time you could turn on the google maps gps feature in the phone. Then multiple ppl can see where he is. 
Also, am from hawaii, so i will share this additional info with you in case you find it useful: 
Alz assoc.
https://www.alz.org/hawaii - free support groups, education, also trying to pass legislation to create more support for Alzheimer's ppl, such as requiring dementia sensitive training to people like first responders, in situations where folks wander off.
Actually id call them and ask for recommendations or see if you could join one or all the support groups (all online in covid times) to ask for recommendations. This is because theres a chance that services that work in places elsewhere dont work as well in hawaii, especially if they live in a rural area. You might luck out and find someone that knows her area and knows of something that will def work. 
Gov help.

comment 9: Hey u/SlipperedHermit, 
I'm sorry to hear about your father-in-law. While I'm late to the discussion but maybe I can help. I work for a company which makes these sort of trackers. GPS tracking is definitely not a perfect solution, but it can be helpful as things progress. The one we make in the US might be a good fit for your family. The app is pretty straightforward and you can set up geofencing alerts (so if he wanders off, your mother-in-law will know)
I shared this already on another thread but I thought it fit here too. A few weeks back a customer sent us this story about finding her mom. 
Don't hesitate to reach out in DM if you've got any questions.
""It was an incredibly stressful day! My parents are very independent people. Our (my sisters and I) original intent in purchasing the gps device was for peace of mind for us. My sisters and I all live outside of our home state. We wanted to make sure my mom never became lost when driving. She is becoming a bit more forgetful than we are comfortable with and is not a cellphone user. We placed the GPS in the glove compartment of my parent's car. My older sister linked it to her phone. One day, my mom had been gone most of the morning. My sister, out of state, looked on the GPS app and saw that she was not just far from home, but heading towards the neighboring state! My sisters, father and I did a group FT and decided we needed to call state troopers to locate and stop the car. With the help of your device my sister was able to give the troopers specific enough information that the vehicle was found within a half hour! And this is with the car driving on a freeway! The trooper called and let us know when he found her and was safe. My father rented a car to pick her up and the first thing she said was """" How did you find me""""? She was absolutely stunned, surprised and grateful we found her. We hate to even think how our story would have ended had we not purchased your GPS. Happy endings indeed! It really worked perfectly! Seriously, we have been singing the praises of your company ever since. We give it an 11/10. 🙏😃”

"(Vent/Rant) LIST OF ANNOYANCES Disclaimer: Im posting these here on reddit so I can get them out of my system, take a deep breath, and go back to being a good caretaker free of resentment/sarcasm/etc. No need to judge me, you hypocrite. 😉
Please assist me to compile the list by adding your own grievances in the comments ad infinitum. Come, let's commiserate. Comma Comma Comma Comma Comma commiserate... 


WHY do you take issue with disposing of disposable diapers (such that I have the pleasure of retrieving used diapers from every nook and cranny BESIDES the trash can) but you are able to throw away food that is unsupervised, however briefly, by the fully untouched (homemade) meal-ful? Whats the issue with just leaving it there for a moment? Must all countertops and surfaces be entirely bare UNLESS it's a used diaper?


I wish you would recognize that even when I'm not velcroed by your side, I am pretty much constantly thinking/acting in your best interest, toward your improved quality of life. Sometimes it's difficult to think of new ways to try and engage with you in a manner that is meaningful to both, or either, of us, knowing that I will be repeating myself within minutes can be very discouraging, and difficult to maintain for 12 consecutive hours while also staying on top of all the maintenance involved in caring for you, (not to mention, me!) from the moment you wake up to when I tuck you in at night. That is why I often operate behind the scenes, and put my energy into creating lasting improvements in your life... Much of it is research! - activities you'd enjoy, safety/accessibility devices, communication aids, meal recipes. I am always trying to improve your quality of life, I am your biggest advocate. Even when you see me on my phone, it is often on your behalf. I wish you would keep this in mind when your son calls to check on you. Because when he asks how your day was, and you answer 'Boring, just hung around at home all day, didn't do much except eat' it doesn't reflect too kindly on me, even if I've been slaving away in the kitchen for over an hour in order to serve you a well rounded, flavorful meal with plenty of variety. I start to feel like it doesn't matter how much, or little, I do, i will be condemned for my shortcomings and dismissed as inadequate regardless.

Stop unplugging kitchen appliances while they are in use.  
Please please please stop unplugging the nightlights. You fall when you can't see. It's motion-activated. It will turn off on its own.  I promise.  
Don't move furniture to unplug the TV.  Just use the button.  Or the remote.  

At least she always remembers to refill the toilet paper.
comment 2: Bahahaha yours too? I thought unplugging every damn thing was just one of my person's idiosyncracies, I didn't realize it was a 'THING'. 
Isn't it nuts how remotes are completely mysterious to them, no matter how many times you explain their function and concept, the whats whys and hows? There's this aftermarket remote operated light switch that has 3 sets of buttons on it, in order to correspond to 3 different plugs. We only use one set, so I put tape over the other ones with 'ON' and 'OFF' written on them, an arrow pointing toward the one remaining exposed button, thinking it couldn't get any simpler? But no, just now she came up to me with three different remotes (God knows where she even found the other 2) saying it was defective, furiously pressing the taped-over buttons. 😔😩 I give up...
comment 3: Unplugging is a THING.  It's really super common.  
Before we swapped out the Alexa Show, she would mash the buttons on top of it, usually taking the volume to 0 and turning off voice recognition, and ultimately would unplug the dang thing.  
We had to get rid of it because as convenient as it was to use Voice Commands, Grandma would read ALL of the suggestions aloud, like ""Try Alexa, Download <whatever stupid thing>"" or ""Try Alexa, take a picture,"" or ""Set a timer,"" or ""add dog food to the grocery list,"" (we don't have a dog), or or ""Open Daily Quiz"" or whatever that skill was.  And we were also limited to Prime Video and they got rid of the best ""keep Grandma from trying to do the dishes without soap, using the mankiest sponge from the depths of the cabinet under the sink"" tv show in their lineup"" (for the record, it was Perry Mason).  
Now we're using a TV with some sort of media stick that connects to a few different services.  We've been through a lot of shows, and lately have been having moderate success with Father Knows Best.
comment 4: I like you like that. I'm also absorbing all these details like they're water and I'm a wilted plant. Loving it.
I've got to admit, before reading the comment below this one and figuring out that 'Alexa show' must be a product name, I thought you were calling it the 'Alexa show' bc of what a spectacle it became. And, in picturing Alexa screaming at y'all Don't forget the dog food (for this purpose I am willfully misinterpreting how she changed the volume) and then the timer goes off like a sonic bomb... I must also admit... I think I prefer it. 
Okay my 'Grandma' also half asses the dishes without soap, but doubles up on insistence that she WILL NOT be kept or disuaded from doing so.
Way to count your blessings, you! Mine does not refill the toilet paper, alas. She does, however, 
smile a lot. She also doesn't have any notable sundowning or mood swings, is in shockingly good health for her age, has overall good hygiene, is not a picky eater, and she sleeps like a rock, allowing me enough down time to be her sole caregiver for 3 consecutive days without having to choose between sacrificing all elements of my own life/moving in here to be with her around the clock, or splitting the responsibilities with yet another person, thus pulling her precious limited attention in yet another direction.
Theeeere we go. Nothing like a good bitch fest to work out the brattitude and slide back into gratitude. Thanks for your help, my brother in arms. (By which I mean arms that hug)
comment 5: Hah. My Grandma has had a series of minor incidents lately. Since she can't go to the gym anymore (and refuses ""home exercise""), she's gotten shakier on her feet, and in November she fell flat on her face. Then explosive (and I mean, like, horrific) diarrhea in mid-December, and now despite our best efforts, a UTI, which has ramped up the confusion several notches. 
Sundowning has gotten more and more of a problem for us as time passes. I've lived here for uh, almost 3 years, and it started gradually but now she gets anxious in the evenings/as it gets dark because she feels like she's forgetting something (yes, everything) or that she's supposed to go somewhere.  
We tried various calendar systems, but if she knows something is planned for the day, she will panic as she remembers something is happening but not what, and that panic will just follow her all day. (even if the event is detailed on the board, she will forget it / panic about it / forget the board is there and just continue to feed the anxiety loop.) So we ended up with a whiteboard with a permanent little message that we update daily:  
> Today is [month]/[day]
> [weekday]
> Nothing is happening today!
> Love, [Grandson's Name]  
And we moved a clock that shows the day/date in addition to the time to be directly beside this little board (so she doesn't get up to make sure the information on the board means today, because it can't mean today because isn't something happening today?).  
When we had messages like ""Haircut at 3:30"" she would start getting ready every time she saw the message, no matter what time it was--getting dressed to go out, looking for her purse and checkbook, and sometimes just walking out the door to find her own way there.  Or ""Dinner with [Relative],"" she'd see that and wonder what I'm going to be doing about dinner if she's going out to supper, so she'll seek me out every thirty seconds to make sure that I know I have full run of the kitchen and liquor cabinet.  
It's really sweet of her, and it's become something of a ritual, where she insists that I help myself to everything, anything in the house, and I say, ""Yes Grandma, when you come home, we will have eaten everything!"" And she laughs and goes along with whoever has come to pick her up.
comment 6: We have an Echo Show sitting on the dining room table. Usually it's good for watching the news or something on YouTube. My grandmother tries to read the suggestions, but she never triggers Alexa. She says Alex or skips the name. She will ask me what story was just quickly displayed and is gone before I can look. She hasn't touched any of the buttons yet that I know of.
BTW I loved watching Perry Mason and made it thru the available episodes before CBS All Access ended for me.
comment 7: [deleted]
comment 8: It's possible. She has five children--her grandchild and their spouse are her primary caregivers, but I moved in when it got to be too much for two people.  I've known the family for more than a decade
She never learned my name, but she remembers that I'm a friend.

comment 10: Yeah, I believe it. And I do tend to respond to jokes literally on the internet, even with little smileys to suggest that it's not really a literal comment.  Because ... I'm just ... like that.
comment 11: +1 for the unplugging thing. My dad would call me every day to say the TV was broken, when actually he'd unplugged it and the Sky box and couldn't get it back on the right channel. I lived over 100 miles away. I had to try to explain the remote control over the phone to his carers
comment 12: From this morning: if you must shit all over your hand because you insist poop isn’t normal and you had to stick your hand down there to investigate what was coming out of you, and you happen to actually remember to try to wash your hands (instead of coming up to me and waving your poop covered hands in my face like usual) can you PLEASE not turn the water in faucet on full blast and literally spray every inch of the bathroom with poop splatter that I have to clean up at 7 am, after the approximately 5 hours sleep you let me get? That’d be great, thanks.
comment 13: We almost retired from the ""family caregiving business"" last month because Grandma had explosive diarrhea in the night and left a trail of poo prints down the hall.  
The mop will never be the same again.  Well probably not.  We'll never know for sure, we got rid of it.
comment 14: I have certain “lines in the sand” and what you just described is one of them.
comment 15: I appreciate you.
comment 16: I opened up the newspaper today and the huge front page picture was of my dad getting a haircut at the barber! His caregiver took him but forgot to tell me. So much for social distancing.
comment 17: Not using her walker, rolling walker or cane. Insisting she doesn't need any of them, even though she's very unsteady on her feet and has had too many falls lately.
Stubbornly refusing help when clearly she needs help at times with walking, standing, dressing, getting lost in the house, turning the volume/speakerphone on her cell phone so she can hear the caller.
Not wanting to go to bed because she isn't home, but she will go through drawers and mail of this house that she thinks isn't hers.
Trying to feed everything to the cats irregardless if it's something they would or should eat.
comment 18: My mom fed most of her meals to the cats and dog, or tried, but they weren't in on the plans and didn't always clean everything up, so she'd get caught and say she accidentally dropped it. We actually started putting all critters out of the room until she was done eating because of this and the fact that her border collie weighed around 75 pounds and could barely waddle.
comment 19: > Trying to feed everything to the cats irregardless if it's something they would or should eat.  
My cat was diagnosed with diabetes about a year after I moved in with 'Grandma.'  He never got terribly obese, he just had that bit of a pooch between his back legs, sort of like what female cats get after they've been spayed.  
Welp, now he has to take insulin twice a day (and he hates it) and we set out a bowl of ""Decoy Catfood"" to help prevent Grandma from fussing with his food.  
But he's a ravenous starveling monster and he's taken food out of her hands.  Asshole cat, always has been more of a dog.
comment 20: One time my mother left her soiled adult diaper right on top of a very visible trash can in the women's bathroom of a restaurant.  Thankfully my wife came in right after her and was completely horrified to discover this.  Completely baffled why she didn't at least put it INSIDE the trash can.  
So yea people with dementia do some WEIRD stuff.
comment 21: Why must you have dozens of wads of toilet paper and paper towels stuffed into your nightstand? 
Why do you insist on opening the blinds for light, even when it’s dark outside, letting the neighbors look in on us?
Why do you refuse to change out of your dirty clothes? 
Why do you blame us for everything you don’t understand? 
I know the answer is always dementia.
comment 22: We live with my husband’s grandmother (with dementia) and disabled and deaf aunt, and I have 20 month old and a 2 month old-so it’s a lot of people to care for!
-my baby is a boy. He is dressed in very masculine clothes. Please stop calling him “she”.
-if my children are crying please just ignore all of us. Don’t ask them why they’re sad, or tell me that they’re crying, I’m already stressed and trying to handle the situation in an emotionally healthy way and your comments are very unhelpful and very annoying.


also, my children’s names are not extremely common, you just think it’s the most popular name because you hear it every day because we live here with you.


speaking of such; we live here. Yes we’re going to sleep here tonight, yes we have a bed, no we didn’t just come into town, we’ve lived with you for about 9 months now.


-all of the doors are locked. I promise.
-please stop saying “yes I know” when I tell you to do things like use hand sanitizer before taking your pills, you obviously don’t know because every time I don’t tell you you don’t do it.

and lastly Jane (grandma’s disabled daughter who lives here as well, and not her real name) is totally fine. I promise I feed her/ she’s totally capable of getting herself her own breakfast and lunch. If you don’t see her in the chair right next to you then she’s upstairs in her room- but you should probably check the chair literally right next to you first before you ask.

comment 23: My MIL thought my home is a hotel at the beach. We live in the middle of a forest. The house is surrounded by trees. She’d sit on the upstairs deck and comment on how nice it was to see the ships go by. I had no idea what she was looking at - because it’s a FOREST. She also thought I worked at this hotel, and that she was married to my husband - her son. So, she pretty much always wanted to go home (“It’s been so nice, but we really need to get back”), and would spend hours every single evening trying to bully DH into driving her home (the location of which changed constantly), and getting angry with me for stealing her husband.
comment 24: Hahaha whoa. This sounds like a fever dream... Just, completely surreal. I'd eventually start questioning my own sanity! Like, who am I to argue? Maybe I am just the bell hop in the Arboreal ocean hotel, and I've stolen this poor sweet cougar's luggage so that she can check in any time she like...but she can never leave...?! Or maybe I need some damn rest... 😝
comment 25: Wow! I feel like my mom is almost ""normal"". Thank you for being honest about your day to day lives. I really appreciate this insight. 
I'd like to add: why must you be convinced that you're having a heart attack or something major, when upon close observation, you are fine? But thank you for waking me up at 2 am in a fright. 
Why must you be obsessed with picking up things on the floor, yet you have a nest of crap around you that you are extremely possessive of and I'm not allowed to touch?
Why do you insist that you are ""fine"" and that ""you can take care of yourself"" but you haven't made a formal dinner in years, eat very late at night (if I don't provide dinner), only do laundry if I say something negative, (ie gripe and complain) and spend your days being in front of the TV, reading a book or doing your dot to dot books?
Why must you mess with my head and go through moments of ""normalcy"" followed by long stretches of being blissfully unaware of everything going on? At the same time? Why must you argue with me over anything? 
Mom, your stories and memories from the 40's through the 60's are repetitive. 
Mom, I'm getting burned out being responsible for you. I don't have the mental bandwidth to make sure you have mental stimulation, take care of your schedule, your finances, your health and hygiene, plus raise two teens (same issues with them), manage a business would a full caseload of clients, and care for myself emotionally and physically. Something's has got to give.
comment 26: dementia is inexorable.
comment 27: Oh my gosh, so true.  Why does the counter and table have to be completely bare... does dementia turn them into minimalists?  I'm glad Christmas is over because my grandma would always refer to the Christmas decorations as ""too much junk"" lol
Same with the used diapers.  Always hidden somewhere, but WHY!?
I didn't realize the unplugging thing was common with others too.
We just got an Echo show and are trying to work it into use.  So far, getting my relatives to figure out how to drop in on video call has been difficult.
I solved that problem of her miscommunicating to relatives what she did that day by emailing a regular report every now and then and updating the google photo album of daily life pics.  It was really frustrating she would tell people on the phone she hadn't eaten anything that day when she just had a full meal.  And then because the phone volume needs to be turned all the way up, I'd hear ""What's (my name) doing over there?  She's supposed to be taking care of you!"" If I picked up the phone to tell them the truth I'd get judged badly for ""eavesdropping"" ...ugh
comment 28: Haha 'WHY??' was exactly the underlying sentiment which caused me to start this post, and in this sub. Because I knew y'all would understand /sympathize, and bc this is a question /frustration that our dementia-afflicted loved ones are not bothered by, not even a bit...At least, not anymore. They are not bound by our fetters of reason and logic! They're not restricted by our earthly 'trash bins' or 'lids' (shout-out to u/boethius70 hahaha)! They're free and their minds are clear and empty as a summer sky, and so are their countertops!
comment 29: - PLEASE FEED YOUR CAT. I buy food for it. The bowl is always empty every time I visit. completely empty. I ask and get 'the cat has lots of food' yes but you don't give it to it.
I don't want to take your cat but im going to have to take your cat.
I do have a billion vents but that's one I think about at home
comment 30: Gosh, I have the opposite problem, mum keeps feeding the cat all day, and way too much.  Cat was going on a diet every 6 months cos she'd start getting obese.  I hid the cat food, then she'd get her hat & search for money to go buy some.  I have to keep the main cat food stash in my room, just dole out little bits every few days, and a few times a day take it out of cat food bowl & return to tupperware.
comment 31: Great post, good idea, thanks!! 
Waking up at 11pm & mopping the kitchen floor - 3 times - with liquid handsoap.  (I have to keep all the housecleaning products locked away, for safety.) 
Picking up & using the bib always right next to your plate, and tucking your bib in firmly, so as to not spill food on clothing at every meal.  Tucking the bib in the first time I remind you rather than NOT tucking it in the 5 times I remind you, thus it falls in your meal, then you drop bits on yourself, resulting in then we have to go do the whole ""change clothing"" tiresome rigmarole thing. 
The . cat . does . not . go . outside . after . dark.  You don't have to ask me a trillion times every night if Kitty might want to go out, cos she's looking out the window, I will NOT ""maybe change my mind"" about it.  Especially when you then say  ""oh well I think she should stay inside after dark too, I just thought maybe YOU might think she ought to go outside"".  AAAARRRGGGGHHHHHHHHH    NO, I don't think so, you don't think so, End Of Story!!! 
Don't cut off all the geranium & daisy flowerBUDS saying you're ""deadheading the old dead ones"", ""isn't that what you're supposed to do so they bloom better?"".. Well they won't bloom AT ALL when you decapitate them BEFORE they even bloom!!    I've hidden all the clippers, I've hidden all the scissors, now she goes and gets a kitchen knife.  I go off for a few hours respite for myself, come home to disasters.  
Too many other, legion of frustrations, to enumerate.
comment 32: Wow!  This thread is like therapy for me.  Although my gripes aren’t nearly as bad as most of the others, living with them 24 hours a day is stressful!  Here’s some of mine:


the buildings we are passing in the car have been there for 30 years or more. They are not new. You have lived in this community for 70 years. Please stop commenting every single time we go out about all the new construction 


please stop reading aloud EVERY SINGLE SIGN, bumper sticker, license plate etc . Just shut up!  Please!


Please stop using rags to wipe your ass. We have toilet paper and wet wipes.  I’m sick of finding these rags that you rip out of towels in your bathroom. Also, please stop throwing your wet diaper across the room. We have a diaper pail for that - sits right by the toilet. 


for now, my entire life revolves around taking care of you, your shitty house and your shitty yard (she lived with my dad for 8 years in an assisted living facility before he died so the house and yard feel into disrepair). You being nasty to me, as well as extremely paranoid that I’m taking advantage of you, is going to send you to a facility sooner than later 


no. You can’t live alone. Please stop telling me how you can. You have no cognitive ability left to understand all I do for you. Meds, scheduling and taking you to multiple doctors, shopping for you, cleaning up after you, cooking 3 meals and other snacks for you, entertaining you, doing your laundry, keeping you stocked with diapers and everything else, fixing and maintaining your house and yard, managing your finances, etc etc   You haven’t done these things in 15 years, at least. (She is 96).  And never a thank you. 


why do you hoard?  Why keep dirty tissues?  Why insist on keeping all junk mail from 1980?  Why do you keep old boxes, wrappers, etc?  Why keep all the other junk? She can no longer go in her daylight basement. There were rooms in the basement that had so much junk you couldn’t walk through the room. Since she can’t go down there anymore due to the stairs, I’ve emptied 70% of the junk into 3 dumpsters. Another lesson I’ve learned - I will NOT expect my kids to spend their lives going through my junk!!  I will downsize dramatically before I get too old. (I’ve moved 2 times in the last year, so I’m well in my way to doing that). 


So many more frustrations. These are today’s.
comment 33: I empathize so hard with so much of this. Do you have kids now? How do they fit into the picture..?
comment 34: My kids are grown and live 4-8 hours away. They are much more worried about me than her as I’m alone all day every day with her.  One of my daughters and one of my sons (I have 4 kids) stayed with her for a week each last year and it was a disaster. Never again  - they don’t deserve that!  I won’t go into details about what she did but it ruined their opinions of their grandmother.
comment 35: MIL has a thing for folding up paper napkins. In fact her fridge was full of totally rotten food wrapped up in napkins. She's in a memory care home now. We took her fridge , yeah I cleaned it lol.  You know what I found in there last week......a bit of food that would probably never be eaten wrapped up in a paper tissue. I threw it out immediately. My husband is behaving weirdly enough as is. I was CREEPED out.
comment 36: THE SCREAMING!! the all night screaming! As soon as she’s out down she immediately starts screaming bloody murder, I cannot imagine how this woman’s vocal chords aren’t permanently destroyed.
Also the banging of the walker all night long, she’ll hold her arm outside the bed and bang it on the ground in her sleep ALL NIGHT LONG and if you take it from her she screams as loud as she can ear piercingly for as long as it takes for you to give back
comment 37: Aaahh! When I was caring for my mom this was probably my biggest gripe - my mom had a whistle that she wore around her neck to call for help, and she would use it ALL THE TIME, for the smallest request, with no discretion and no regard for the time of day. The only thing worse than the fact that this shrill noise would invade my brain non stop, was the fact that if my dad and I were both home, he would ALWAYS pretend not to hear, even though that is literally impossible. He knew that my tolerance for listening to her suffer was lower than his, and that I'd eventually cave in and go help her first. My god this dynamic drove me insane. For a while I'd take pennies out of my change jar and hurl them down the hall at his bedroom door, so hard that I thought they'd punch a hole through the door LMAO

"Checklist for Caregivers I consider myself to be on the spectrum of what is considered a distance caregiver. I live ~35 mins away from my mom and see her at least weekly. Of course, lots of concerns have come up with this arrangement. Last year, I made a post about finding an ungodly amount of lint in my mom's dryer. Using everyone's words of encouragement and advice, I ultimately created a list of things to check for her and added a few more things so that we all can have a mega list. I also work in health care and did a mini list for that as well. Feel free to help expand this list.
Lint catcher in dryer
Dryer vent
Check mold prone areas for mold
Check bathroom and bathroom supplies for mold (rags, wash cloths, loofahs)
Check for leaks especially under sinks and around water heater
Sponges
Bug or rodent droppings
Pests like termites
Light bulbs
Air/furnace filter/vents
Nearest street lights work at night
Smoke/CO detectors
Unopened mail / unpaid bills
Kitchen appliances working
Steadiness of step stools
Slipperiness of rugs/mats
Build up in shower head
Drain emptying speed (gradual clog?)
Garbage disposal
Slipperiness of bathtub/shower
Wires or cords in walking path
Condition of wires/cords
Extension cord appropriate use
Even stairs/no holes or deformities in carpeted steps
Need for night light
Chimney/fireplace is clear
Gutters are clear
Sliding doors sliding well
Doors opening and closing well
Freezer frost build up
Test drive sprinklers
Septic tank inspection
Medication organization and expiration
Refrigerator temperature
Remove old food in fridge/pantry
Check food in pantry for bugs/ants (especially pasta/flour)
Dust on ceiling fans
Emergency phone numbers listed somewhere
Space heaters properly used/maintained
Few days supply of food during hurricane season
Need for medical alert devices
Healthwise
HA1c level
Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels
Vitamin D levels
Cholesterol levels
Kidney function levels (BUN, Creatinine, GFR)
Blood pressure trends
Urine analysis
Foot ulcers
Bed sores on back, buttocks, or hip
Weight loss/gain
Chewing/swallowing difficulty
ALWAYS ask for a copy of labs
Side effects and potential side effects of medication","comment 1: This is amazing! Thank you for compiling this list! It actually looks like a list we should all have to check on in our own homes, as well. Good luck on your journey as a caregiver.
comment 2: i would add checking expirations on medications, i cleaned out a box full of it from under dads sink bc he was “saving it”
comment 3: This is great. Thank you
comment 4: This is overwhelming, I’m doing what I can but the non critical stuff is going to fall by the wayside
comment 5: I think this list could also be organized by frequency, which might make it more manageable. Sone of these may only need to be done once a year, so split it into two lists and tackle it that way.

Any recommendations ? Hi so my grandmother has dementia. And all she wants to do is watch tv. And she lives upstairs and constantly is coming down stairs to have someone change the channel or put in a movie. Like every 5 minutes. Even if I tell her no she will come back and ask again. I was just wondering if theirs any devices that allow me to change her channel from down stairs or have her like notify me that she wants something and I control it from my phone ?,"comment 1: Apple TV can be controlled from a smart phone.  If it's a smart TV, you can open YouTube videos on your phone, and ""cast"" them to the TV. But your phone must remain open and on.  If that's inconvenient, any old iPad or iPhone on the house's wifi would work.
comment 2: yeah there are several apps you can use, just type ""universal remote."" you can also cast media from your phone/laptop to her TV (assuming it's a smart TV), so you could set up a playlist and just hit ""next"" whenever she wants.
comment 3: Install an app on your phone that is compatible with the Tv so you can change channels wirelessly.

"GPS Tracking recommendations Dad got lost for the first time today. I need a discreet tracker that isnt bulky. He insists he is fine(he is not) so preferably something he cannot leave at home or forget. At first i thought to attach it to his key chain, but he will be losing his license in 2 weeks most likely.
Any ideas?","comment 1: If he's got an iPhone and you do as well, you can turn on ""Find My Friend"" on his phone, and then locate it with your phone. I use this with my mom. Otherwise, there are a bunch of GPS/parental supervision apps you could download and install to keep tabs on his physical location.
comment 2: Unfortunately he left his phone at home so maybe we need something we can bore into his belt.
comment 3: There's tracking insoles for shoes. They charge by leaving the shoes on a charging mat every 2-3 days.
The first time a loved one wanders is so scary. Big hugs to you. Take care of yourself and hang in there.
comment 4: Check out Tile trackers.
comment 5: Tile and other Bluetooth trackers only work with a mobile phone. Go out w/o the phone, no tracking.
comment 6: The Tiles I bought for my mom were synced to my phone, not hers. Yes there are limitations to the tracking (only 400 ft). But if you are able to walk out after them, it can help to locate them in scenarios where they are at a neighbors house or in the woods behind your home, etc.
comment 7: My Dad wears a Care Smart watch from Verizon. We are all able to track his location via their app on our cell phones. It works great, and he puts it on every day. We have a daily checklist for him which includes taking it off to charge at night and putting it on first time in the morning.
comment 8: Some of my friends are researching a GPS in the shoe.  Personally, at my stage, like Calamity-Gin i use iPhone and ""Find My Friend"".
comment 9: Same thing happened to our dad. He woke up one night and decided to go for a drive. After waking up and noticing he was gone , 4 hours later we get a call from the state police in Nevada, we live in calli. He had no Idea how he got there.  We bought a car tracker from www.trackmytruck.us . Same thing happened 2 weeks later and we were able to find him instantly. They are cheap and units are tiny plugs right into the car.

"Does anyone else’s “patient” have trouble holding their phones In bed? My dad is loosing a lot of his dexterity in his fingers and strength in his arm to even hold up his phone and use it. 
Does anyone else experience this? Is there something I can get him to not have to work so hard to use his devices? He does have a neck gadget that’s a neckbrace that you sit the phone in and it sits out in front of you. But is that his only option?","comment 1: There's a product called Pop Socket, it attaches to the back of a phone/case with adhesive. It pops out to give a handle. Its worth a look, my kids use them a lot. (There are a lot of knockoff products that work just as well.)
There are also adjustable grips that attach to a firm surface and hold the phone, but they wiggle a LOT when touched and really arent stable. It may be of use if he uses it to watch movies or other non-interactive media.
comment 2: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ZT4VA0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_3PTcGbXBKDBTZ
This stand has been great for my mom for her phone and tablet.  It can also hold up flashcards for therapy  and collapses to a really convenient to store/carry.  It's not the same as holding the phone, but can be a good option if there is an over the bed table that he uses.

"I'm terrified that I have dementia I've always had a lack of common sense and coordination with my surroundings and basic generic events; however, lately I fear that it's something deeper, as if memory decline or dementia. I have a really short attention span, and I am scared that it's getting worse. I cannot concentrate when I am around my friends, and I lose track of some texting conversations. I also have been forgetting what my parents or friends say when they ask me for favors. (I think it might because I only care about what happens to me and not others). I generally as a teen had a hard time doing this, but I am scared that it's something deeper. For example, during the summer with my ex-girlfriend, I struggled sometimes to keep up with conversation, and it hasn't happened before. I've also noticed that I was stuttering every now and then during conversation and forgetting a word here and there. It's been happening a while since I've been having anxiety over whether or not I have dementia or not. I am only a young adult (18 years of age) and suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. However, what is really making me worry is the fact that I feel like during quarantine, my general mental cognitive skills have just been mundane or - I dare say -  declining. Maybe and hopefully, it's my OCD overthinking, but I have been doing mental rituals to 'test' if I have dementia, but perhaps it may be something deeper.","comment 1: [deleted]
comment 2: I've been screened for ADHD and Autism as a kid, but there was no definitive answer. My parents always said I exhibited 'different' symptoms of social anxiety and memory problems as a kid, but they concluded there is no way I have ADHD because I am gifted academically. However, I have a strong suspicion that it might be related to ADHD because I always had a short attention span and struggled in conversations. Also, yeah I talked to my therapist and he told me its 100% OCD, but I seem to doubt it.
comment 3: I was experiencing something similar. I got really scared when I drove through a red light and didn’t notice until my passengers yelled. 
I changed my diet because of a gastrointestinal problem (IBS) and noticed a change with my foggy brain symptoms. I definitely felt more alert and clear minded.  I think cutting out sugar and grains may be the key. 
I would recommend taking a look at your diet as a factor.  Think of it as a simple experiment. There’s a lot of information on YouTube when you type in “Diet and Brain Fog.”  The diet I follow is the autoimmune protocol paleo diet (AIP).
comment 4: There's are a lot of completely treatable issues that can seem like dementia. Like my daddy always said, ""don't borrow trouble"". See a doctor, explain what's going on and I'm willing to bet it's something else.
comment 5: This doesn't sound like dementia, it sounds like anxiety, obsessive compulsive, and probably some kind of ADD/ADHD. Talk to your doctor. See if you can try a medication for attention, in addition to adjusting whatever meds you're on for anxiety-- anxiety alone can cause feelings of fogginess. So can hormones, lack of sleep, isolation, depression-- tons of things that are almost certainly not dementia. 
Listen to your therapist.
comment 6: Are you on any medication?
comment 7: Depression can cause temporary dementia symptoms, as can loads of other things.  i suggest you get to the doctor and get it checked out because quite a few of them can be TEMPORARY if you get it addressed quickly.  -- But if possible this may qualify you to get a NeuroPsych test.  For yrs i have suggested that folks get a NeuroPsych when you are as close as possible to the top of your abilities.  That way, Once decline is occuring, they have something to compare results with when you were cognitively well.

"Mom w/ early dementia victim of romance scam We just moved my septuagenerian mom in with us from across the country. She has some form of early dementia, though she is not a fan of ""too many psychological questions"" from her doctor, so any full diagnosis is going to take some time. (We are in the building rapport stage with her new doctor.) I have been taking care of all of her life stuff that she let fall at the wayside, including figuring out her finances. I have known that she was involved with an internet scammer for a couple of years, but honestly could not stop her. After she gave him some money and bought some gift cards we convinced her (I think) to stop giving them money. I have access to her phone, and they are in constant contact and have recently been asking for more money. In addition, I think this person might have gotten way more money, as my mom's retirement is empty. She didn't have that much money in there and was never planning on really using it for retirement, but still. I have not been able to track down exactly where the money went, but it's definitely possible that it went to these scammers. 
It is time for this to end. We are planning on reporting the scammer to the FBI. I various details to share with them. I am just not sure what to do regarding my mother. She sees this person as her love. And she is very defensive anytime I mention them. She had a fairly loveless marriage and has been pretty lonely since my father died a couple of decades ago. I am worried that they will just find her again. She is only so good at being sneaky, but I am still worried. I am also obviously worried that they will steal more money from her, though I have access to her bank accounts and pretty much know what's going on. 
She has been a bit depressed since moving here. She was not being very COVID careful, and so on top of moving here away she is missing social time. I do not think she will just stop talking to this person because we ask. I am worried that if we tell her we need to block them that I'll send her into an even deeper depression. The dementia aspect of this is new to us and has also been overwhelming. I have been putting off this task, but I could really use some advice.","comment 1: Id report that guy right away.  He may be scamming others as well.
I wonder if there is a social worker or some other professional the cops could refer you to.
I'm not sure what the best thing to do would be.  I lean toward not telling her the truth.  She just moved in with you from a cross the country so you are her only social contact right now.  Wouldn't think her being angry at you would be the best thing right now.
comment 2: I have the EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  Its been going on for years.  She has lost over $150,000 CAD to this guy.  We finally convinced her to accept our help when she had nothing left.  She now gets an ""allowance"" every week for groceries,, etc but this guy still has his claws in her.  He is apparantly coming to visit her tomorrow.  This is not the first time he has attempted to come visit and doesn't show up.  
We have reported it to the police, but ultimately there is nothing more we can do.
comment 3: > She has lost over $150,000 CAD
jesus christ, those can easily be the savings of a whole life...
comment 4: My parents sold their house a few years ago during their divorce so most of that was from the house sale and then her inheritance from her mother passing.  She could have had a great retirement with that.  The scammer, and the disease have both stolen that possibility from her.
comment 5: I don't want to depress you but there is not much any law enforcement agency is going to do. You have to proactively limit the amount of money your mother has and very possibly, let her crash and burn (lose all her money, because if she believes she is being loved, why would she listen to you?, you are just somebody who doesn't want her to be happy).
I hope reality proves me wrong but I don't believe those scammers are ever going to get caught: where do they operate from? are you sure they don't use proxies, fake numbers or reroute calls?
Anyhow good luck.
comment 6: U probably will be ok to let her still speak to them, as long as they are not getting her money, she can just say she no longer has access to her money and
see how long they will linger then!  To
take her away from them suddenly will
be traumatizing for her (I speak from my own experience). Better to let it die a slow death😊
comment 7: Thanks for the reply! I couldn't actually keep her from sharing her financial info so we made up a story that the FBI called about this guy and she had to end it. She actually seemed at peace with it really quickly. Like she knew the guy was trouble, but couldn't make herself it end it of her own accord.
comment 8: Great, she probably knew in her head, but not in her heart❤️ She may be just pretending though, hard to give these guys up! Speaking from xperience🤬

"Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior? TL; DR: What are the pros and cons of hiring someone (probably a stranger) to serve as a remote assistant to a senior citizen with memory loss?
My mother is elderly (over 80) and has started to have short-term memory loss. It's gotten more noticeable in the last 6 months or so, and she has started to acknowledge it. My brother and I both live at a distance from her, though he is close enough that he can make the round-trip in a day, and he visits every few weeks. She is not home-bound, she drives well, and is very intelligent. We do not think she is any danger to herself. Due to the pandemic, she is alone a lot of the time, especially now that it is winter and she can't easily have visitors outside in the yard. Friends and relatives phone her often--one of them daily, several multiple times a week. She has local friends who bring her groceries weekly. She is also able to run to the grocery store herself, where she is cautious about going very early and making the trip short. However, she is not great about remembering to wash her hands, remove her mask properly, etc.
She needs help with computer and iPhone issues fairly regularly. She's always been tech challenged but it is more critical now, with phone and Zoom being the main ways of interacting with people during the pandemic. She reaches out to my brother a lot for tech help (and to me occasionally on it). She reaches out to me on financial questions fairly regularly and sometimes on medical. 
My brother and I both observed her memory issues getting worse. I began pursuing trying to get a diagnosis and any medical help that seems appropriate. She was able to get a Zoom appointment with her family doctor, who seemed excellent. (I attended, too.) He prescribed comprehensive blood testing. Everything was normal. He has referred her to a neurologist. That will be next--she would prefer to wait until after she's vaccinated. I made sure she registered for the vaccine as soon as she became eligible.
Just when her memory issues got to the point that I thought she should get medical evaluation, my brother began  advocating for her to get a remote assistant to help her with technology problems, scheduling household repairs and maintenance, remembering appointments, and keeping track of medical issues. He would like to hire someone overseas (inexpensive).
My mother is not eager to have a remote assistant. She thinks that will just be someone to supervise and have to try to share everything with electronically. Her biggest source of frustration is technology, and second is trying to get things done where she has to depend on other people being reliable and doing the job well. She has a lot of trouble scanning documents or emailing photos of things.
I asked my brother if the reason he wants a remote assistant is because her questions are becoming burdensome to him. He said no but I think he has backed away from that answer. My husband, who works in IT and is super patient, has offered to help her with computer issues. She is happy to have that resource and thinks the world of my husband, but she hasn't reached out to him yet. I think she is used to contacting my brother and I don't think he has discouraged her from doing so. 
Here's why I'm posting: I am concerned about the safety of a stranger knowing that she lives alone and has memory issues. That person would know when she has an appointment and is out of the house and could also potentially try to scam her in other ways, such as financially. (At this point, my mother controls her own finances, though she is gradually bringing me in to help.)
When my brother first suggested the remote assistant, I raised my safety concerns with him. I also suggested that if we do hire someone, we should set the cost aside. We both know that she is well off and cost is not an issue for her--she is happy to pay well for work for her. I have said we should put safety first and hire someone one of us knows and trusts (I gave him 3 names of underemployed friends who might be interested) or perhaps a friend of a friend who is well-vetted. My brother's position is that anyone can rip you off whether you know them or not. I subsequently also offered to help more (which I am doing) and I have offered my husband's help with the technology issues (which my brother has not responded to--instead he's emailing me things like medical releases we should give a  remote assistant).  
Sorry this post is so long. I would love any advice on any of the following: whether I'm being overly concerned about my mother's safety, approaches to dealing with my brother on this assuming that I'm not being overly concerned, possible alternative ways to address my mother's issues, any stories of success or failure using remote assistants, and anything I might be missing. Thank you in advance!","comment 1: My grandmother is almost 90 years old. I’ve been one of her primary caregivers for many years. 
I cannot overstate how incredibly vulnerable your mother is and how predatory people are going to be attracted to her situation like flies. 
I’m totally serious. I cannot take my grandmother anywhere without some stranger offering to come to the house and do work, or being overly nice and insert themselves into her life, or some other weird shit that they would never say or do to me (39/F). 
We’ve had people over to do routine maintence at the house, or make deliveries, and I walked in and one was asking her for donations to his church... that he ran out of his house... and it got more inppropriate from there. 🙄
Granted, your mom is far from the 90 y/o category. And it sounds like she can handle herself, but I’m here to tell you that you cannot trust other people, especially if your mom is “well off.”
PredTors start falling from the sky when people get old. Don’t invite a stranger into your moms affairs.
comment 2: Wow, that sounds awful! Thanks so much for the warning. I don't want to catastrophize, but I do think ""hey, we'd like to hire someone to run the affairs of an old woman with memory loss"" would draw the scam artists like moths to a flame!
comment 3: I’m certainly not trying to be drama.  But it’s a real problem that has gotten the worse the older she has gotten. 
I have 2 people that are regular visitors, a lady who comes to clean and a man who mows the yard. Both have been working for us for years and came highly recommended.  I do not think for one minute that they would steal from her. But they have both asked her for money multiple times. Her hairdresser of 20+ years has asked her for money. 
She is in a position at 90 years old and failing memory that she does not think she can refuse. So I refuse for her. She’s dependent on them. Sometimes I’m not sure if she’s giving them money that I don’t know about, even though we’ve talked about her not doing that. 
It gets complicated really fast.
Edit: with covid it’s even more complex. The masks and not wearing masks. Ugh I’m pulling my hair out.
comment 4: I really feel what you're saying. It's SO much harder in the pandemic.
I guess at some point you could try to get some kind of access to her accounts--at least emailed statements from the bank--so you know if she's giving away money that you don't know about.
I totally get trusting longtime workers not to steal from her. Asking her for money is not the same thing at all. But for me, it would be a betrayal of trust. It sounds like a manipulation of an older person who they know is likely to feel she can't refuse. But then the tough thing is if you let everyone go who asks her for money, who do you hire in their place? The next person might be less trustworthy. It's distressing.
comment 5: So im a caregiver. I take care of peoples parents or grandparents and not all of us are looking for something to gain. I would say it would be all about how incorporated you are. I work in peoples homes and nursing homes. In nursing homes i generally make calls for residents suffering from Alzheimers bc they all hate the nursing home. Honestly nurses in nursing homes do the bare minimum and it is hard to track their abuse bc as one nurse told me not too long ago “they fell on purpose” so... i take videos, pictures of poor nursing, and i keep residents in contact with their families bc most hate it here and it keeps them level. As for in home - i have met many families who will work all day but come in to check on things. They handle the finances and i do everything their family member cannot. If you let someone in and just let them oooh and aaah over the family member this is what leads to manipulative behavior. Don’t jusy pick nice caregivers but have higher standards. Do they fill you in and know what they are talking about? Are the timely? Do they do this as a passion? If you need help you need help - so just be participating in what you want
comment 6: Thank you very much! Those are excellent suggestions if we get to the point that she needs help in person or nursing care. As of now, she does not.
What do you think of the idea of a ""remote"" assistant who only helps by phone and online (due to COVID risks)? This is what my brother is suggesting. This would be not be nursing care but more like a ""secretary"" to help with record keeping, remembering appointments, financial matters, etc. Thank you!
comment 7: It is an interesting idea. I would say for DEFINITE - keep finances strictly for the family. Money can be a motivator for many and honestly, I would advise all families to keep finances personal - and even then it can be sticky but at least its much less torrential than a stranger. Honestly i feel that once it is an established understanding the kind of appts and groceries and such needed that may not be a bad idea. Good luck!
comment 8: Thank you very much! I appreciate your advice.
comment 9: I would tell your brother since you want the remote assistant I get to choose who the remote assistant is.  Thats a fair compromise and not a hardship at all since your mom can afford it.
Don't let that remote assistant take care of finances even if it is a friend.  
Also, I think you may be better off getting her a simpler phone or launcher on her phone.  Other people have posted about them here where the buttons are peoples faces essentially.
The hard thing is if people are helping her with electronic devices, sooner or later, they can probably gIn access to her devices so if they are the slightest bit tech savvy, can figure out all passwords to her bank accounts, etc.
So yes, you definitely want someone you trust.
comment 10: Thank you very much! That's a great suggestion about a compromise.
You make a great point about getting access to her passwords. Thanks again!
comment 11: >I asked my brother if the reason he wants a remote assistant is because her questions are becoming burdensome to him. He said no but I think he has backed away from that answer.
I think your intuition is bang on here, sadly. It’s not unusual though, for siblings to struggle with responsibilities, point fingers, etc... 
With that said. Especially if your mom is well off, you’re right to be concerned about scammers. 
Your brother is suggesting basically giving this “remote assistant” POA for financial matters (along with tech and other practical help). 
I would NOT go for that. No one outside the family should, in my opinion.
You yourself could take the financial stuff on, your husband could help with tech (maybe find some more intuitive/easy/senior-oriented solutions). You could hire a personal support worker  (who is bonded, through an agency) to help with managing meals, medication, and personal care. Probably someone else would do cleaning. That would be ideal. 
As far as talking to your brother about this - he sounds like a bit of an inflexible autocrat. I would try to reassure him that you’ve got things covered (seems like you’re trying this :/). Maybe a third party could mediate this. In my area, seniors are referred (by anyone but often through a hospital or doctor) to a government agency that manages care in the community. There is a coordinator to speak to. Someone like that might be able to help with this conversation with your brother and come up with other solutions as well.
comment 12: Thank you very much. Your responses are super helpful. It has made me realize that maybe I should ask my brother again if her question are just too much right now. He has a lot going on currently in his personal life. He is also the one within driving distance, so he is the child of hers who checks on her in person. That in itself is a responsibility. 
I can tell him in more detail what I can take on besides financial and medical issues, including that I can be her iPhone tech help. We can try to shift to my husband being her primary help for computer and TV tech issues. The other things I can think of are recordkeeping issues--which if someone remote can handle them, I can--and household repair issues, which are more complicated. But I think most of the household repair can wait until after the pandemic. Once my husband and I are both vaccinated (and she is), we plan to drive up there. That will presumably be spring or summer, when it's easier to get work done on the house anyway. The main issue until then is shoveling snow, which a neighbor helps with.
comment 13: I should mention that my mother has a long-time trusted cleaning woman. However, at the start of the pandemic, my brother and I urged my mother not to let in the house people who are not isolating in the pandemic. (My mother is very susceptible to viruses.) Once my mother and her cleaning woman are both vaccinated, she would have cleaning help again. I believe she still pays the cleaning woman through the pandemic, and she is one of the people who brings my mother groceries (and actually some homemade food) regularly.
comment 14: > scheduling household repairs and maintenance, remembering appointments, and keeping track of medical issues. 
Like no, absolutely not... you can’t trust strangers to this. SO many mistakes and omissions are routine in these areas. 
Your mom will need an advocate who cares. 
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to push for tests, question prescriptions (either with a doctor or pharmacist, even having them go over filled prescriptions that were wrong), double check that paperwork is correct... I’ve been at my dad’s bedside in hospital, witnessed adverse reactions and had to shout to get a nurse or doctor... had to force them to write what happened down. I’ve had to reiterate an allergy every single time he’s gone even though it’s supposed to be in his chart. Have queried EKG results and labs and caught errors... 
For the place - One of you is going to have to physically go and check on things. At least once a week ideally. 
For her appointments- that’s easy enough, Google Calendar is fine.
Medical - no chance would i offload this to anyone else.
comment 15: Thank you again! You sound like a terrific advocate for your dad. I think having a family member as a medical advocate is so important. 
I don't know if Google calendar will work for my mom. She doesn't always keep her  iPhone on her in the house (she has a land line, too). Even when she sets a phone alarm for an appointment, she sometimes naps through it. Though, honestly, if she doesn't wake up for a scheduled call with me, I don't know why she would wake up for a call with a remote assistant or because an assistant reminded her.

"I'm two days into being a caregiver, and I'm already terrified. What advice do you have for a newbie? Last Friday, I moved in with my grandmother. I'm definitely here to help my grandmother, but the main caregiving I'm doing is for my uncle. My uncle is middle-aged, over 6 feet tall and, over 300 lbs, but he has the mental age and capabilities of maybe a 2 or 3-year-old. He's completely non-verbal and has severe anxiety and OCD, which he's only just barely gotten medication for. Fortunately, he doesn't hit or break things much besides tearing up clothes he doesn't like and peeing on the floor a lot. Could be a lot worse.
Honestly, I personally could probably just keep my head down with his caregiving job (clean up messes, feed him, get him his meds, etc.) and it'd probably be fine. I'm only going to be doing this til around mid-April. But I want to leave things better than I found them. If I could just get my way, I'd put my uncle in Depends so if he has an accident or tears his underwear it's not a big deal. I'd put child-locks on some of the doors and most of the kitchen cabinets and the fridge. But just the little bit of cleaning I've done has already conflicted with his OCD bad on a couple of occasions. And when he isn't happy or doesn't get his way, he beats his own head. He's already got three giant lumps on his forehead from a lifetime of this behavior, they're the size of ping-pong balls. Those goose eggs are never gonna heal.
I just feel torn between my uncle's comfort and happiness and my grandmother's safety. My uncle doesn't mean to jostle her, but his fine motor skills and lack of understanding results in him being much too rough with her for her age.
More experienced caregivers, what would you do?
Should I just leave my uncle to his own devices and clean up the aftermath? Or do I make my displeasure known? Do I yell? Do I explain?
Do I force him to do what I want? Where do I find the middle-ground? What battles are worth fighting? 
How do I keep my grandmother safe?","comment 1: Wow, you careload is way over my experience and pay grade.

"Monitoring bracelet Hi everyone,
I'm interested in your recommendations for wearable tracking/monitoring devices for my father, who has Parkinson's Plus and Dementia with Lewey Bodies. My main wishes for features of the device are:

GPS / cell service tracking (covering a large service area, just in case he gets far)
relatively user-friendly app for caregiver (my step-mom wouldn't be inclined to use anything too complicated)
fall alerts
some kind of lock feature to prevent him from removing it independently
an idea of initial investment and then monthly costs for monitoring/service (but we are pretty  flexible)

This is intended to be one of a series of safety stop-gaps so that he can continue to live at home, at least until the pandemic gets under control and we can look at more long-term care options. I realize a device with everything on my wishlist might be hard to come by, but I'd like to hit as many targets as possible altogether.
If this has already been discussed recently in a post with up-to-date products, I'd appreciate a link. Thanks for your insights, very grateful for the knowledge of others who've come before us. Stay safe and best wishes to you all and your families.","comment 1: My brother got my parents each an Apple watch. He can see where they are at all times.

"Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers Howdy, this is a master post of what I've learned about caring for a relative with Dementia.  I'm not a health care professional, I've just been through this four times and want a post to give to those who are new. 
This post combines six other posts.  Constructive criticism is welcome.  It's written without Covid in mind; it changes things, of course, but most of this is still applicable now and the rest will be again.  
There's not a lot of sugar-coating here so if you're in a bad headspace, read this later.  
Dementia is a progressive, incurable disease that results in death.  Half of everyone who lives long enough will develop dementia.  There are multiple types of dementia, but absolute diagnosis of the specific type usually cannot be made until after death.  Specific things will make dementia worse: infections, dehydration, surgery, radiation/chemo, hospital stays, changes in routine, traveling, broken bones, alcoholism, etc.  Most sufferer's progressions follow a similar pattern, but everyone's specific journey will be different.  Note that this progression can take months or decades.  
There are things that can be done, we think, to prolong or prevent the onset of dementia symptoms.  A diet low in sugar and alcohol but high on plants and fiber like the Mediterranean Diet can help.  Exercise is essential.  Those who speak two languages are half as likely to develop dementia, and people with higher educational attainment develop debilitating symptoms much later than those with less educational attainment. 
&#x200B;
Begin the journey
Once you suspect dementia, get your elder the best Long Term Care Insurance you can find.  Use their most recent physical you can get; if it's too old, get a new one ASAP.  Do not mention to the doc your suspicions about memory issues; family seems to pick up on these 1-5 years before they show up on the actual diagnostics, and it'd stop you from getting good LTC insurance.  Read the contract and see how long you have to wait to get a dementia diagnosis after the policy goes into effect, so to not invalidate the insurance. 
This is the time to get your legal paperwork in order.  Get your Power of Attorney or equivalent, and get the different forms the different institutions require.  Your bank will usually have a notary on hand who can notarize things for you.  Speaking of Banks, consider moving finances to a Credit Union.  CUs are non-profit: they don't make money off you by charging fees.  This small difference every month can save a lot of money for later, when you really might need it.  Care homes are expensive.  Also, get your Long Term Directives in order.  What does your elder consider important to her quality of life?  What daily activities does she consider necessary: if she can't do that, it's not worth it?  Does she want CPR?  Life support?  For how long?  How does she want her body handled?  Where to be buried/ashes to be scattered?  Your Doctor may have a booklet that will help you go through all of this, which can be filled out, notarized, and filed with your doctor/hospital so they have to honor her wishes. 
Then get a dementia diagnosis.  Many times a simple problem like a UTI or other infection can appear as dementia-like symptoms, so rule out other (solvable) problems first.  If your relative is resistant to going to the doctor, offer to take them out to lunch, or ask them to keep you company while you get a prescription from the hospital's pharmacy, and then take them to their appointment.  Yes, it's devious, but nothing happens without a diagnosis.  
Once you're sure of dementia talk with your resources both professional and family.  Your healthcare may have a Memory Care or Elder Care group that can help you understand what's going on and what's going to happen.  Bring your relatives, or bring them back the brochures.  There will be a lot of very difficult questions from relatives/friends who are not in the loop, such as ""what can we do"" and  ""what's the cure"".  The answers are ""take care of her until she dies"" and ""there isn't a cure"", which they won't like to hear, but will have to accept from the professionals.  So having someone else answer those questions is usually a lot easier.  If they know generally what the progression is you're less likely to come up against issues with them later.  So many relatives think ""Oh, they're just hanging with Grandma, how nice!"", when the truth is so much darker.  Half of all caregivers will develop diseases or die while caregiving; it's often one of the worst, most stressful things we will do in our lives.  Get a support group going for yourself, early, while you're still able to find time.  Get a therapist if you can.  
Look around for what help is available where you are.  You go to alz.org and use their resources.  Out where I am we have a lot of local resources for home care and supplemental care, I hope you have the same or better.  You can find this by Searching for ""Elder Care"" and your city, county, country, province, etc.  Day care, respite care, and other programs are, frankly, essential. 
This part is important and ongoing.  Start looking at where she is in the progression of the disease and make plans for the NEXT step.  Not planning for the future is the biggest mistake most families make.  They're so incredibly busy just barely taking care of today's needs that they're not ready for the next step.  My aunt was  literally hoisting my grandmother onto her back to get her from her bedroom to her chair in the front room, and then took care of her during  the day... and that was all she could do.  When Grandma caught a cold, the coughing kept her from holding onto my Aunt's shoulders so she couldn't get out of bed.  That led to the beginning of bedsores, so she had to go to the hospital.  Instead of letting it get to that point Aunt should have had in-home carers, lifts, equipment, supportive mattresses... so many things would have made life easier for both of them.  But Aunt was too busy -- or overwhelmed -- with the massive job of caregiving.  Prepare for the next step while you can. 
Apply for government-paid in-home caring/recompense/assistance now, because by the time your requests are approved, she'll probably need them.  
Apply for a place at the best memory care facility you can find/afford now, because you can decline placement over and over and over, and just be put back at the head of the list for the next available spot.  During Covid we found that the places with Union workers had the lowest numbers for Covid infections, controlling for many variables, due to the workers having access to PPE, so that's a consideration you might want to look for.  Your country/states' Department of Social Services will probably have a rating on all their care homes that might be helpful. 
Many places are big enough that they provide multiple services, From Respite to simple Assisted Living to locked wards, often via different wings.  Respite is like checking your elder into a hotel for a weekend: the facility will take your elder for a bit to give you a break, and will help familiarize her with the facility.  These facilities will be able to transition your elder from one stage to the other via professionals.  This is very helpful because caregivers just compensate and compensate and compensate, burning themselves out far past the point where they should have transitioned.  Keep in mind that these places run from 60K to 200K per year.  That insane price, along with the proof that elders are healthier longer at home, are why most people keep their elders at home with them for much longer than we used to.  But sometimes a care home is just necessary.  There are placement services which will take your elder's requirements (ostomy care, diabetes, hoyer lifts, meds, etc), distance from your home, and prices into consideration and get you a list of facilities.  They're very helpful and usually take recompense from the homes themselves so they don't cost you anything. 
Save what you can.  Talk to your mom and get recordings of her voice.  Get tapes of all the family histories and stories you'll ever want to hear.  Get her involved in alz groups as an aid or an assistant  so when she's a participant she'll still want to be there.  Find out what her favorite music is, download it onto an easy-to-play format for when/if she has bad days.  Get out the old pictures and see if she can identify the mystery faces. 
If you have access to it, look into high-CBD products to see if your elder has a good reaction to them.  Dementia progression typically includes depression and anger, and most patients also experience sundowning, sleeplessness, and/or agitation.  CBD can help with all of these if it's well tolerated.  Please check with your doctor first, there are a few medications that interact very badly with Cannabis.  I have personally had very good luck with Mary's Medicinals' ""The Remedy"" and a high-CBD edible but had to try a few things to find what actually worked.  And boy howdy they really do help. 
These are things you can do instead of worrying.  I do these things because not doing them is a bad idea, and they help me work through the grief.  Activity helps dispel fear and anxiety.

The Progression
The sufferers and caregivers who do the best with this disease are those who plan for the future.  They know what the next stage is and they've already done the research and signed the papers.  The best prepared progression is usually:

""Impaired  cognition"" noticed by family, usually in ""help me find my car, I don't remember where I parked it"" situations.  Electronic GPS like a Tile can help here.
POA/Healthcare POA signed by sufferer
All financials nailed down, local laws researched, support group/network for caregiver found and activated
DNR, ""quality of living"", death, corpse arrangements, burial arrangements discussed ahead of time
Long-Term Care Health Insurance attained (ASAP, the longer you wait the more expensive it will be)
Shared home prepared for sufferer to live with caregiver (separate doors, ramps, extra rooms, extra baths, ADA furniture, doorways, hallways etc)
Patient diagnosed with dementia, usually ""mild to moderate"" stage
This is usually when their driving starts to suffer.  Taking away their keys usually provokes horrible rages, there is another option.  Go to your country/state's Department of Motor Vehicles site to submit their form for retesting an elder's capability to drive.
Medications to deal with side-effects prescribed, such as Sundowner's, violent tendencies, hallucinations, etc.
Medications to help with actual Alzheimer's prescribed.  They are usually not very effective, but are expensive and have serious side effects.  Some experimental treatments, such as specific forms of light therapy, are showing promise but these will not be available from HMOs for 7-10 years  from now.
Driver's License revoked, usually automatically after diagnosis & medication
Apply to state/fed/insurance for any assistance, from financial to in-home.  This may take many tries and many years.  Talk to your hospitals' Elder Care Representative.
If sufferer is violent, hallucinating, or wanders, talk to local authorities so they can be prepared.  This may not be appropriate in certain jurisdictions or for certain families. 
Get an electronic Tracker, bracelet, or other identifier for any wandering patient.
Around this point a few sufferers take their own lives to spare their loved ones from dealing with a body without a mind.  This is not common with Boomers and Silent Generations as they generally believe suicide to be a sin, but we're seeing it become more and more common in patients who are younger.
This is the point where we used to institutionalize our elders. It was very common in the 70's and 80's and even 90's to put them in Care Homes.  Now we know that they decline MUCH faster when institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home, where they get better  care.
In-home care becomes necessary during the day.
24/7 in-home care becomes necessary or the patient needs to be admitted to a Memory Care Facility.  This is a locked ward where trained professionals deal with hallucinations, violent tendencies, etc.  This step is usually triggered by a tragic incident, such as patient wandering and being found by authorities, patient harming caregiver, patient injuring self, etc.  Memory Care Facilities are not cheap, they can run between $4,000 - $14,000+ a month.  << this is where  caregivers with insufficient preparation or insufficient healthcare access burn out... badly.
Patient loses memories entirely, needs help with every daily activity
Patient loses ability to feed self
Patient loses ability to swallow

We are at the point now where we realize our LO's primary caregiver was never really told exactly what Alzheimer's Disease is, what it looks like and what to expect, and he's struggling to understand why her behavior is changing.  I may rely on this post again and again to try to communicate to him what to expect moving forward.

comment 6: Thank you so much!
comment 7: This is amazing. Thank you so much.
My mom was temporarily diagnosed with Dementia after the first wave of COVID, but after a hospitalization, in-home care, and months of improvement, it was downgraded to a mild cognitive impairment. She did improve a lot but I can clearly see how we will be back at that diagnosis stage again someday. I'm trying my best to prepare for the inevitable and this is extremely helpful. Thank you again.

This is bullshit, and induces guilt in caregivers who are already burned out and beginning to develop their own health problems related to long term stress.
Many people thrive when put into a care facility. For many it's the increased socialization. There is an entire staff to watch out for and take care of their increasing needs. Even a nice facility is cheaper than in-home care, which is often unreliable. Fact.
And IF somebody does decline, how do you know it's ""faster""?? They are ALREADY declining no matter where they are. 
Sorry but you are absolutely wrong on this one.
comment 10: It's obvious our experiences have been very different.  I'm sorry that my post upset you.  Would you like a sympathetic or solutions-based response?
comment 11: I've not finished reading yet; but would like to make a comment on your comment regarding most cases not being able to be specifically diagnosed until after death. 
This is absolutely wrong and I work with people who have many different types of dementia. All of which have had a specific diagnosis pretty early (a year or 2) into first getting diagnosed.
comment 12: Interesting, my doctor told me differently.  She said that it's very common to make guesses, even very accurate guesses, but that absolutely indisputable diagnosis is impossible without an autopsy on the actual brain.  Unlike other organs, one cannot do exploratory surgery on the brain.
comment 13: I wish to his they really did revoke the driver’s license at time of diagnosis.
comment 14: You can advocate for it to be law where you are.
comment 15: I am so tired from ass wiping that I can barely advocate for a cup of coffee.
comment 16: I hear that
comment 17: This is a great post. May I add a couple of things?  
In mid-to moderate dementia, financial issues become common. Our elders forget they didn't pay a bill, and think they are being stolen from when the company asks again to be paid. They forget how much money they took out from the bank, and think the teller stole it from them. They become much more susceptible to scammers and fraud.   
Unfortunately your bank cannot share details of their financial accounts with you unless you are a signatory on their account. Before the dementia is too far along, try to persuade them to make someone else a signatory on their account - basically, you just go to the bank and they sign paperwork to allow you to access the accounts. This will allow you to monitor what is happening, pay their bills, and take care of them. If you are part of a family with issues, it can be wise to have 2 different people sign on to the account so you can watch each other and prove you aren't stealing from mom yourself.   
In addition, call the 3 credit monitoring agencies and have their accounts locked. This will prevent someone taking out a new loan in your elder's name without additional verification. It can still be done, if the scammer gets the elder to approve it over the phone or in writing, but will help prevent casual loans from scammers.  
Lastly, make sure your elder has an account created for them on the social security website. Not having an account has become a common way to steal tax refunds and identities.
comment 18: This was brilliant info and I incorporated as much of it as I could.  Thank you so much.

"Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers Howdy, this is a master post of what I've learned about caring for a relative with Dementia.  I'm not a health care professional, I've just been through this four times and want a post to give to those who are new. 
This post combines six other posts.  Constructive criticism is welcome.  It's written without Covid in mind; it changes things, of course, but most of this is still applicable now and the rest will be again.  
There's not a lot of sugar-coating here so if you're in a bad headspace, read this later.  
Dementia is a progressive, incurable disease that results in death.  Half of everyone who lives long enough will develop dementia.  There are multiple types of dementia, but absolute diagnosis of the specific type usually cannot be made until after death.  Specific things will make dementia worse: infections, dehydration, surgery, radiation/chemo, hospital stays, changes in routine, traveling, broken bones, alcoholism, etc.  Most sufferer's progressions follow a similar pattern, but everyone's specific journey will be different.  Note that this progression can take months or decades.  
There are things that can be done, we think, to prolong or prevent the onset of dementia symptoms.  A diet low in sugar and alcohol but high on plants and fiber like the Mediterranean Diet can help.  Exercise is essential.  Those who speak two languages are half as likely to develop dementia, and people with higher educational attainment develop debilitating symptoms much later than those with less educational attainment. 
&#x200B;
Begin the journey
Once you suspect dementia, get your elder the best Long Term Care Insurance you can find.  Use their most recent physical you can get; if it's too old, get a new one ASAP.  Do not mention to the doc your suspicions about memory issues; family seems to pick up on these 1-5 years before they show up on the actual diagnostics, and it'd stop you from getting good LTC insurance.  Read the contract and see how long you have to wait to get a dementia diagnosis after the policy goes into effect, so to not invalidate the insurance. 
This is the time to get your legal paperwork in order.  Get your Power of Attorney or equivalent, and get the different forms the different institutions require.  Your bank will usually have a notary on hand who can notarize things for you.  Speaking of Banks, consider moving finances to a Credit Union.  CUs are non-profit: they don't make money off you by charging fees.  This small difference every month can save a lot of money for later, when you really might need it.  Care homes are expensive.  Also, get your Long Term Directives in order.  What does your elder consider important to her quality of life?  What daily activities does she consider necessary: if she can't do that, it's not worth it?  Does she want CPR?  Life support?  For how long?  How does she want her body handled?  Where to be buried/ashes to be scattered?  Your Doctor may have a booklet that will help you go through all of this, which can be filled out, notarized, and filed with your doctor/hospital so they have to honor her wishes. 
Then get a dementia diagnosis.  Many times a simple problem like a UTI or other infection can appear as dementia-like symptoms, so rule out other (solvable) problems first.  If your relative is resistant to going to the doctor, offer to take them out to lunch, or ask them to keep you company while you get a prescription from the hospital's pharmacy, and then take them to their appointment.  Yes, it's devious, but nothing happens without a diagnosis.  
Once you're sure of dementia talk with your resources both professional and family.  Your healthcare may have a Memory Care or Elder Care group that can help you understand what's going on and what's going to happen.  Bring your relatives, or bring them back the brochures.  There will be a lot of very difficult questions from relatives/friends who are not in the loop, such as ""what can we do"" and  ""what's the cure"".  The answers are ""take care of her until she dies"" and ""there isn't a cure"", which they won't like to hear, but will have to accept from the professionals.  So having someone else answer those questions is usually a lot easier.  If they know generally what the progression is you're less likely to come up against issues with them later.  So many relatives think ""Oh, they're just hanging with Grandma, how nice!"", when the truth is so much darker.  Half of all caregivers will develop diseases or die while caregiving; it's often one of the worst, most stressful things we will do in our lives.  Get a support group going for yourself, early, while you're still able to find time.  Get a therapist if you can.  
Look around for what help is available where you are.  You go to alz.org and use their resources.  Out where I am we have a lot of local resources for home care and supplemental care, I hope you have the same or better.  You can find this by Searching for ""Elder Care"" and your city, county, country, province, etc.  Day care, respite care, and other programs are, frankly, essential.

comment 2: Great stuff. Thank you for corralling all this information. From first glance, you may want to mention if family members are in favor/or not of putting loved one on a feeding tube.  And that hospice coming in to ease the transition to death is also a possibility.
comment 3: Ah, good points.  Thank you.
comment 4: Thank you for putting this together. I wish I had this resource at the beginning of this journey. I would have applied for long term care and I heavily regret that now.
comment 5: I don’t have it in me to read through all of it right now, but this seems really good and comprehensive! I want to have some tasks to do and some achievable goals, otherwise I’m just cataloging symptoms and occasionally spiraling
comment 6: Thank you so much. This is invaluable information, and helps me realize how very far along we are, and the steps we need to take from here on out.
comment 7: Thank you, I have been guilty of denial and wish I had read this 5 years ago when My dad's symptoms started to become apparent.
comment 8: That's a very human response, you're in the same boat as a lot of good people.
comment 9: I wish I had found this last year. Never would have thought of that insurance stuff on my own. 
Thank you for sharing!
comment 10: What would you suggest for those that will eventually run out of money for a memory care facility??
comment 11: We paid for a lawyer because of this. The local ALG.org chapter told us to call Agency on Aging, who told us to call the local ALZ chapter. That endless circle became too frustrating to deal with so we called the ombudsman who couldn't really help and told us to get a lawyer.
My mom qualified for VA Aid and Attendance to help lower the cost, but we applied in November 2019 and are still waiting. We were told she would see her first payments in April-ish, but as of March when COVID hit, we've been passed from one person to the next and now they're ghosting us completely. We escalated it to our senators to try to get help.
Medicaid is next. We were told to get into the system ASAP. They've denied benefits each month, but she's at least in the system. I highly recommend that you choose a memory care facility that takes Medicaid from the start. No one told us that, so we put our mom in a great community that she loves, but money is almost out and we have no choice but to move her. Now because she hasn't lived there as private pay first, several places told us that they wouldn't accept her as their current residents have priority. We've waited six months and finally have a room in a place that's an hour away, but they first want to examine her records and see if she's a good fit. If they end up turning her down, we're down to two places left that would even put her on a waitlist.
comment 12: Then they go through the government-run system.  It's harsher, less care, worse outcomes.
comment 13: I think it's more appropriate to publish this as a blog somewhere (there are numerous free hosting sites) and link to it.  I read about the first 3-4 paragraphs and then reminded myself I don't come here to read BOOKS.
"
"She died last night. We knew it was coming. Her vitals were all wrong. I called my siblings two days in a row, warning them so that they could come over and say their goodbyes. 
Nobody came. 
My children and I stayed up late with her, taking turns holding her hand. We put my toddler in the bed with her and granny stroked her hair and held her close.
My oldest child warmed up a soft, lavender scented teddy bear in the microwave and tucked it into granny’s arms. Granny was still clutching it this morning when the nurse came to pronounce her dead. She was also still wearing the little rubber band bracelets my kids had made her, for her birthday back in October. 
When I found her this morning, my sons were asleep in the floor beside her bed. The tv screen was blue from where it had eventually turned itself off after they’d fallen asleep watching Pinocchio. I called the hospice line crying but cut the call short so I could relocate them before they awakened to find her dead. I berated myself for whatever potential psychological trauma could result from all that. 
The nurse came and wasted the meds, had me sign as witness, tossed the bear to me, and people took granny to the funeral parlor - all before my sons woke up. They had stayed up with granny until two a.m. and ended up sleeping in. 
Mom showed up shortly afterward, and helped look through stuff. Asked about the drugs and seemed annoyed about the nurse disposing of them. 
Later on my daughter and I went to granny’s old house to get some books and pictures. One sibling was already there creating a take-away pile and acting hysterical about some perceived slight by my mom, while my other sister was also apparently stirring up drama from her house, screaming at people and carrying on about this and that. It’s amazing how they both managed to make today about themselves. I’m embarrassed my daughter witnessed all that. I still haven’t heard from my brother, who is the attorney in fact. 
That’s fine, granny was the last emotional tie connecting me to those people anyway. I don’t mind writing them all off at this point. 
I held it together for a long while as my daughter and I gathered books. What an impressive collection she had. Damn she was cool. 
Of everything I saw and have been through today, it was a coloring book that did me in. One of those cheap coloring books from the nineties.
It reminded me of the ones she always used to bring over for me. Then I remembered how she’d call me every birthday and start singing “happy birthday to you!” right after I answered “hello?”
She would also call every year right before Halloween to let me know “It’s the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown!” was playing on tv and on what channel. 
She was at every track meet, pageant, basketball game, birthday, PTA performance, you name it. 
She’s been a fixture in my life ever since her son married my mom when I was three, and long after they divorced. She has been more of a “family” to me than any of my biological family, and the most dutiful and admirable person I’ve ever known.
Anyway yeah, the coloring book sent me over the edge and I cried all the way home, probably making my daughter as uncomfortable as my sister had made me.
I love you, Granny. I wish your life had not been so hard. You deserved so much more than the hand you were dealt. 💕","comment 1: I heard it said many times.  It's always the good ones that go first.  Your Granny sounds like one of the good ones and a blessing in your life.  It's sad how families turn when the matriarch passes.  Be strong for yourself and your kids!  Don't get dragged into that pettiness.  Enjoy the memories of your Granny and pass them on to your kids.  You and your family are in my prayers.

comment 3: You are Welcome!!!  Godspeed
comment 4: I'm so so sorry for your loss. I can't stop crying while typing this because it brought back so many memories of my dear grandma. She also had dementia, my mom and I took care of her until she died from a heart attack in 2014. Just like you my grandma raised me and as you were describing all those sweet things your grandma did for you I couldn't help but remember all the sweet things my grandma did for me since the day I was born. I feel like this isn't fair, they deserved way more than this but there's nothing that can be done...Let's just hope they are in peace now, wherever they are. Ignore your family, I know it hurts but my family did exactly the same. No one cared about her while she was alive but on the day she died they were all over at our house picking stuff to sell and make money. I'm sending you a warm hug and I'll keep you in my thoughts.
comment 5: That made me cry. She sounds like someone really cool that I would have liked to know. I understand how 'family' can be. My mom was the only one who loved and cared and she's gone. After my Dad passes the rest is out. I find this site a great help
https://www.griefhealingdiscussiongroups.com/
Celebrate her life and her love, hold on to the memories and share that with your kids. You're in my prayers, take good care.
comment 6: She deserved a grandchild just like you. She was so blessed to have you and your children to love her and care for her. Blessing for you and your family during your grief.
comment 7: Sending you love. You were so thoughtful and courageous in her last moments. 
My mom has declined rapidly in the last month and I know what’s coming and I’m terrified and devastated and baffled by the prospect. You sound so composed in your post, even thought you might not feel it. 
Hang in there.
comment 8: Sorry to hear about death of your Granny.  THANKSgivings that you were able to show her the love and connection she needed.  ((hugs)).
comment 9: I'm so very sorry for your loss and your grief. I'm glad you and your children were there for her to make sure she knew she was loved.  
Death brings out weird things in families. I hope sometime you can forgive yours, and that will deserve that forgiveness.
comment 10: You and your children were so fortunate to have had her in your lives,and I'm certain she felt like she was the lucky one. Dont let your family drown out the feelings you and the kids are experiencing now. They are natural expressions of loss. 
This may sound nuts,but pay attention to little things around you,I honestly believe the veil between here and there ( wherever ""there"" is) is very thin at this time & we are able to receive...I hesitate to say messages..because I dont mean words, but ways they let us know they got to the otherside alright.  My mom passed unexpectedly a year ago and so many things occurred afterwards that were clearly messages. I'm thankful someone told me to be aware or I may have missed them. Which is why I'm telling you.  I hope it doesn't offend you in any way, I just really appreciated having that opportunity and I'd hate for someone else to miss out on it if I could help it.
comment 11: I am so sorry I can't wrap you up in a big hug. But please know virtual hugs are coming your way from New Zealand. So so sorry.
comment 12: You stayed. That means everything. Thank you for going through that with her and I hope you find the same peace you allowed her.
comment 13: This disease sucks, death sucks, but if I had the choice in the way of leaving this world.  Dying surrounded by love ones is definitely is the best way to go.  You created a peaceful environment for your granny to complete this life.  Ultimate respect. 
I have had two uncles pass from Alzheimer's. Now I have my father, my aunt, my uncle (by marriage, her husband) with dementia.  One part of me prays that a miracle cure comes and saves them.  Other part says don't get your hopes up.  Another part says brace for the inevitable.  Another part says, they did their duties, its time for them to have peace and I will reconnect with them another Astral plane.
comment 14: I’m so sorry for your loss and that the family acted that way. Praying for peace for you 💕🙏
comment 15: So happy she had you and your family for her transition. I hope ypu find peace in your happy memories. There is no accounting for the behavior of others. It sounds like you did the right thing by her. Hugs.
comment 16: RIP, my condolences
comment 17: sending 🧡
comment 18: You showed such love and kindness in her final hours. I hope I have the strength to do the same. I'm sorry the rest of your family can't show the same to you. Many hugs to you ❤️
comment 19: I am so sorry for your loss.
comment 20: You were there for her in her final moments, she had her grandkids with her too and that lavender bear - seriously if she could had left a final note for you it would have said ‘Thankyou for being with me in my final moments I wasn’t so afraid because you were all there with me, I didn’t die alone thankyou that I wasn’t alone’
🤍🙏🏼🙏🏼

comment 22: I am so sorry for your loss!   Thank you for being with her at the end.  She died knowing how much she was loved.
comment 23: I’m so sorry for your loss. She sounded like a beautiful person. I’m also sorry for the undignified way in which the nurse behaved. It’s so important for healthcare workers to understand the sensitivity and gentleness required at times like this. What’s clinical to them is your heart breaking. I believe that we go on in some way, though I’m not sure how. But certainly we go on in the hearts and memories of loved ones, and I know that the impact she had on you and your life will live on. ❤️
comment 24: Very sad, very beautiful.
comment 25: this was a hard read. sorry for your loss
comment 26: I'm sorry for your loss. My wife and I take care of my elderly father with dementia. It is tough and non of my other siblings stepped up for the task. We feel alone and you've reminded us of what God has entrusted us with, caring for my dad. It's a privilege I will be more grateful for and cherish. Thank you for sharing your story and God bless.

"Father has dementia, Mother is an abusive narcissist with power of attorney! Please help, I don't know what to do.
For as long as I can remember, my mother has been verbally abusive and she is a big time narcissist. My father was never the one to stand up to her, and despite the abuse, he never left her. They are quite codependent, and do not have any friends. Since my father stopped working two years ago his mental health and cognition has declined exponentially, and he is now unable to take care of himself.
My mother is immensely stubborn and uncaring and that has really become a problem for my dad. She is his primary caregiver and has power of attorney. My mother still tries to run her small business as well as maintain two houses (residence in the city and cottage in the country) and consequently my dad's care often gets pushed to the backburner. She has bad knees and hips and can barely walk and so she often has my dad run around for her. She definitely needs help but she refuses any suggestion of help, whether it be a cleaning lady or even a local kid to mow the grass. And now, with the pandemic, she has found the perfect excuse to not have any outside help or to take my father to the doctor. She will get him dressed in the morning and will clean his sheets if he wet the bed, but not without screaming at him and berating him for something out of his control. She will make him food, but only when she's hungry. She won't let him take a nap because she says he will be up all night. He often goes for little walks and has gotten lost a few times. I thought after the first few times he was brought back by the police, my mom would have invested in some kind of tracker or something. But any suggestion I've made to help with this problem has been met with no, there's no point or it's too expensive.
I live pretty close by and I visit when I can, but every time I go I see another way in which my father is neglected and it hurts! He has been wearing the same two pairs of pants and they are too large for his frail frame and worn at the heels. When I ask why she won't get him some new pants she says he has enough clothes. My dad used to wear a big bulky pair of boots that kept his feet warm, but my mom now has him wearing a worn out pair of boots that aren't warm enough just because the other ones ""take up too much room"" her front hall. I tried replacing his cotton socks with warmer wool ones and she took them away. She hasn't got him to clean his dentures in MONTHS. He hasn't had a haircut in a while and he looks in terrible shape. My mother is sick and abusive and she should not be in charge of my father's care, especially since she priorizes everything else in her life above his needs. 
Maybe I'm just too much of an empathetic person, someone who is able to see all these things that no one else does. But I am incredibly angry and disgusted with her. Not only is she not taking proper care of him but she refuses to even consider any of my suggestions and has actually actively undone the things that I do for his benefit.
I tried to help at first but it's exhausting fighting her so I gave up, hoping for a better outcome with time. But I can't take it anymore. I want to involve somebody, the authorities, a lawyer but I don't know what I have the right to do. I have no backup on this from my brothers as they would rather turn a blind eye. He's getting old, there's nothing to be done, is probably what they're thinking. But I want my father to stop being punished for things that he can't control. To stop being berated and belittled. I want my father to live out whatever time he has left with some dignity.
Any advice would help me. I feel so alone in this. If anyone has dealt with similar issues I'd love to hear how you coped.
Thanks","comment 1: Not sure where you live but consider contacting your local version of Adult Protective Services since it does sound like your father is being neglected and abused.
comment 2: Agreed, but I’d gather evidence first: start a log of your visits (dates, any neglect you witness), take photos (especially of any bruising), record her screaming & conversations of her refusing to care for him. Then contact Adult Protective Services. Even if it’s not to the level of abuse, APS investigates neglect as well.
comment 3: Absolutely report her. My mother is also a narcissist and they are relentless nothing stops them from getting everything their way. I just want to wrap your dad up in a big woollen coat and get him a bowl of chicken soup that poor man. Her petty actions need to be reported. The things you’ve written can definitely be conveyed to a person at the protection agency. Call your country’s dementia advisory service and see what they suggest too. Just hit them all up on reporting your mother to anyone and everyone that will listen
I hope you get somewhere soon

"My mom has cognitive problems. Is it dementia or something else? Should she get long-term care insurance right now? Any good book/resource recommendations? My questions are:   
1 - Does this sound like it could be beginning dementia or something else? 
2 - Do you have any advice about or experience with long-term care insurance? 
3 - Do you have any good resources or book recommendations for people suffering from cognitive difficulty, or for their families/caregivers?
Any input or links/resources will be appreciated!
My mom has been having some cognitive issues for several years. She is 56 and retired at 54 because she was not really able to keep up with her job and it became too overwhelming (she worked in IT, same job her whole career). I feel like her personality has changed somewhat also and I feel bad about this, but for the past few years I've been feeling like it's not worth talking to her about anything because she won't remember anyway.   
My (F, 31) brother (24) and dad (57) live with her. They are in denial and try to claim it's just ADD/ADHD and that her brain doesn't pay attention even when it seems like she is, so I went to the doctor with my mom in October and she tried an ADD drug that did not help her at all. She is an intelligent person but she was diagnosed with ADHD when she was kid (at that time it was referred to as Minimal Brain Dysfunction) although she never got any help or treatment for it and it didn't seem to have any real barriers to her schooling or IT career until later in life (late forties/early fifites).  
When we went to the doctor for ADD/ADHD in October, the doctor didn't seem to think advised her to get a neuro-psychiatric evaluation but I told him not to order it yet and not put it in the notes because she might want to get some type of long-term care insurance and doesn't want to disqualify herself from that. It's expensive though, so it's a major decision, and I know my dad is doing research and trying to make the best choice.  
She also has developed a hand tremor in one hand only, in the last 6 months (her estimation). My dad swears she always had this, but she definitely didn't. I only noticed it when she was swiping her credit card at the doctor's office, and the doctor noticed it as well.   
Overall I feel like my mom lives a normal life and she does remember some things. She is also able to keep up with the family laundry and still knows tricks to get out different types of stains, etc. She can do grocery shopping if she has a list, but she might miss a couple things (which happens to everyone sometimes). She can cook simple/standard things like Tuna Helper, grilled cheese, spaghetti, etc. but gets overwhelmed by cooking more than one thing at a time.   
She is generally able to set appointments and keep them as long as she writes them on her wall calendar correctly, and I think she checks her calendar every day (then makes notes to herself). However, an example of some cognitive trouble is -- when we went to her doctor in October, she went to their old office location that had been closed for over a year and was really confused when she couldn't find the building (it's now a different business). Then she thought they moved across the street so we went there, no luck. I googled where the doctor practiced and the first address given was a hospital that is familiar to us, so my mom said ""Oh yeah, I remember going there - you just park in front and check in"". So we drove to that hospital but my mom couldn't figure out how to get to the front parking lot. When we went to check in and gave the doctor's name, they said he didn't have an office there. Eventually we got the office address and went there, and my mom confirmed she has been there before but just couldn't remember where it was. I later realized the reason why the hospital rang a bell for her was that she had been there a few weeks earlier to accompany my dad to a colonoscopy appointment.   
She also hit a couple curbs while driving that day (I drove after that). It was like she knew her brain was failing her and she was scattered and uneasy about it. When we got home after the whole ordeal I told her I wasn't mad and it wasn't a big deal to reschedule, etc. but she couldn't relax and she thought she was having a heart attack. I think she was having a panic attack. I do think she is definitely having issues with anxiety, and probably depression too. I think she has tried some anxiety and depression medications but says they don't help.  
Here are some examples of the cognitive issues I've noticed:

Has to take notes when she talks to anyone (in person or on the phone). If you ask her a question about a phone call she just had (like with grandparents), she has to refer to the notes and she can only tell you the answer if she can find it in her notes. Also, if she has to relay information into a short text message to notify other family members, it takes her several hours to do so when it should only take a couple minutes.
Asks the same questions within minutes. Then asks the same questions throughout the day, again the next day, on and on forever. She pretty much doesn't remember any conversations. It puts a strain on everyone. It's hard to maintain a patient and pleasant attitude when you've answered the same question 3 times already in the past 20 minutes all day long. I feel like we are good at answering repeated questions until about the 4th or 5th time and we all start to lose our cool.  My mom doesn't know it's the fifth+ time she's asked so if she gets a sense of our annoyance, she'll say ""well you know I don't remember things, be nice to me"". And we're annoyed and thinking, well if you know you don't remember anything, why do you even ask questions at all? What is the point, really?
Not able to plan anything or solve basic problems
She can't plan out Christmas gifts or do Christmas shopping anymore, unless she is just assigned a couple of specific things. She used to plan family vacations and get togethers, but now planning anything involves too many details for her to keep track of. She cannot be in charge of anything.
Even simple things like two people carpooling to one place, then driving separate cars, etc. would be an example of a detail that she can't keep straight in her mind. So even minor things like camping nearby or going biking then to a restaurant is something my dad would have to plan the details for. And someone would need to keep her on track like remind her which car she should be in, which car she came in, etc.
Not able to learn how to play new games, even ones for young children (5-6 year olds) that only have a couple of rules.
Example: I bought ""Taco, Cat, Goat, Cheese, Pizza"" which is a children's card game. Even after playing several rounds she was unable to remember how to play or what the objective was, yet the kids picked it up quickly. She then opted to sit out from playing because she recognized she wasn't catching on (this is what always happens, but at least she tries). She also used to like puzzles but when I brought one for us all to do as a family she gave up pretty quickly and just started holding up single pieces and asking people if they know where it goes, which was very unproductive and not a normal thing when people are doing a puzzle as a group.
Everything is overwhelming to her. She cannot find the time or willpower to sort through a pile of mail, make a Christmas card even though she wants to send one out, etc. even though she is retired and doesn't do anything all day. She retired two years ago and literally has not accomplished anything or taken up any hobbies or anything. (and their house has a lot of clutter corners/piles and unfinished projects)
Causes fights and confusion among family members because she will offer to do something, then act like she didn't (or vice versa - decline/refuse to do something then act like she never declined).   

Small personality changes
1. Strangely attached to things and she never used to be that way. When I tried to throw out some of my old stuff I found, I later found that she had gone through the papers I had recycled and items I planned to donate and kept them. There was a Bugs Bunny stuffed animal that she put at the foot of her bed because it ""makes her happy when she sees it"", which is a pretty bizarre thing coming from her. She puts random cute stuffed animals around the house as decorations and she never would have done that before unless they had some kind of special significance.
2. I also think she has a more ""jokey"" personality than I ever remember. She seems to make jokes about everything, or interject brief funny commentary about things on TV, but they're never very funny, it's usually stuff she has said before, and sometimes it doesn't even make sense. Maybe this is to compensate for not really being able to converse in other ways.

Occasional strange fixations. Example -She wanted to buy Venus brand razors but they had to be a certain kind, and she didn't know exactly how many she wanted, but it couldn't be too few or too many. We had to drive to 4 stores so she could settle on 5-pack of Venus razors (3-pack was too few, 8-pack was too many -- even though she'd use them eventually and buying in bulk is a better value). In the past she would never do something like this, she'd likely just buy what was on sale and call it good. It was just weird.  

I have a lot of examples and I've started keeping a list, but this is the main gist with a few examples. Thanks in advance for any thoughts or suggestions you want to offer.","comment 1: Ugh, I feel like this is my future. I’m 47 and already met with a psychologist to get assessed. So far it’s just ADHD and CPTSD. I have really bad reactions to most drugs especially stimulants so I haven’t even tried that. 
The jokiness comes from being so exhausted from feeling anxious about no longer having it together you laugh at it. 
I can so relate it’s painful. She’s tired. Her body’s tired and she can’t react the way she used to so she’s doing the best she can. 
Hugs.
comment 2: I'm so sorry you can relate to this yourself and I hope you are able to get some help. I'm sure you are right about the jokiness. I really should talk to her more about the emotional side of dealing with this, she doesn't bring it up. Hugs to you! <3
comment 3: Sounds like some pretty dramatic changes in your mom. Sounds like a good plan to get info on LTC insurance prior to adding to her diagnosis. Sorry, I have no experience with that, but I’m paying loads of money for my grandma’s memory care, so I’d say it’s worth a discussion with a good agent. 
Sounds like she’s mostly pleasant and accepting of your help and suggestions now, so I’d say definitely get some things in order while you can. 
Sorry your dad and bro are minimizing the situation- perhaps since they live with her, the changes are less noticeable because they’ve been gradual. 
Best of luck in getting the answers you need.
comment 4: Thanks for your comment, I actually hadn't thought about things that way. I think you are right about it seeming less noticeable to people that live with her because it's been gradual. And you are right, she is pleasant and accepting right now, it's sad to think that will probably change if/when things progress further. Thank you
comment 5: There is clearly some sort of neurological issue occurring. There are many types of dementia and there may be one here. There may also be a completely unrelated neurological deficit. The longer you wait for diagnosis the longer you will wonder. While I appreciate the need to get long term care insurance in place she needs to get the neuro-psychological eval done ASAP. There could be a treatable medical issue causing these changes and the longer treatment is delayed the more damage will be done. At this time her safety (and the safety of others) is the number one concern. I would strongly encourage you to not allow her to drive and to make sure the doors in the house are secured at night so she doesn’t get confused and somehow wander away. I know that may sound extreme but, it’s much better than having something occur and wishing you had done something to prevent it. Wishing you all the best, you clearly love your mom a lot.
comment 6: Thank you for confirming and validating to me there is a serious issue, and thank you for pointing out the safety of herself and others as well. I will definitely take that into consideration going forward.
comment 7: I didn’t even finish your post because I saw enough to be very concerned for her. Monday, call a few places to see if they would insure her for long-term care insurance. I did that, and the first office I called was honest and told me she didn’t think she’d be able to get him insurance just based on the medicine he takes. He is only 53, but he had a heart attack a few years before.  She called me back the next day to tell me she checked with several insurance companies and none would insure him. I gave up assuming that would be the case everywhere.
Since then, we got his diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment of the frontotemporal lobes. That means he is on his way to having frontotemporal dementia, it’s just not advanced far enough to be considered dementia yet. FTD is the most common dementia for people your mother’s age. Check it out to see if it seems to fit what you are seeing. 
Next week, schedule the neuropsychologist appointment. The sooner the better. You all need answers and to be able to prepare for future needs. Having a diagnosis has helped me understand how to handle what’s going on and has allowed me to better support my husband as he struggles to deal with it.
Let me know if I can help you as you work through all this.
comment 8: Thank you very much for sharing your experience and I'm sorry about your husband. I haven't heard of FTD but I will definitely read up on it. I wish ""the sooner the better"" meant there was some treatment or way to reverse or slow the progression, but I understand that's usually not the case with these sorts of things. But I will keep pushing it because like you said, a diagnosis will help us move forward and prepare for the future.
comment 9: OP, I am very sorry for what you, your mom, and your whole family are going through. It sounds incredibly tough. I truly wish you the best. 
I am no expert at all, but I strongly suggest asking about long-term care insurance at r/insurance. Sadly I think it’s a lot more complicated than buying a policy before a formal diagnosis—I’m not sure of the nuances but a lot of people over there will be able to explain. 
Again, I wish you and your mom the best.
comment 10: Thanks for your comment. The comments on this post made me cry this morning, and I do appreciate the care and well wishes. Thank you
comment 11: I understand your concern about insurance, and my heart goes out to your family, but you need to take her to the neurologist to get her the help she needs asap. Long term care insurance is pretty much a thing of the past. You are holding on to a dream of hacking the system & getting discount long term care. Even if it was still available, you have to sign up when you are youngish & healthy. My parents have it - they bought it decades ago.
My dad has had early onset senile dementia for years now. Being under the care of a neurologist for the whole journey has extended his good years and his life significantly. He has also had a couple minor strokes - already having a neurologist and brain scans was priceless in dealing with those. Get your mom the medical help she needs, please. Whatever she is dealing with may be treatable, and it sounds pretty serious. As for resources - get a diagnosis first, then research. Best wishes.
comment 12: Out of curiosity what makes you say LTC insurance is a thing of the past? I'm only asking because based on the public information available, insurance companies paid out $11B of claims in 2019. I'm just trying to get some recent insight on your experience.
comment 13: Oh sorry if I wasn't clear or came off presenting myself as an authority. My opinion is entirely based on a couple conversations with older family members who are the kinds of extremely prepared and responsible people who buy all the insurance for all the things, (and wouldn't it be nice if they were all like that). It's my understanding that LTC insurance proved to be unexpectedly expensive for insurance companies. Companies rely on a certain amount of their customers stopping paying their bills and therefore not getting their benefits, like how gyms calculate a certain amount of their members never going to the gym. Well way way more people used their LTC benefits than they thought were going to. So they are still paying out existing policies but good luck finding a company willing to sell you a new LTC insurance policy. They aren't profitable. Is what I've been told. If you know different speak up!
comment 14: Fascinating. I'm actually doing some homework myself. From my understanding, the older insurance polices were not priced accurately enough, which was the proximate cause of the constant increase and fluctuations in premiums. By any chance do you recall what the annual premiums were that they were initially paying, and what they got adjusted to? Also, do you know if they had inflation protection in any of their policies? I do think LTC is a national problem that no one really wants to address. The population is getting older, and living longer. Even if Medicaid does pay for LTC there is no guarantee that someone in need would receive it due to the qualification requirement. And Medicaid requires you to liquidate most of your assets to qualify. In your case, as a consumer, how do you think you would cover any of the home or facility based care you would need possibly in 20 years? Especially since people are living longer, and retirement money can get drained very quickly. From my homework In home care, home health aid is the cheapest option of care for people that want to have some kind of independence. The national rates for a home health aide are hovering at $20-$25 per hour. In a best case scenario of needed a home health aide only for 40 hours a week, the cost would be at a minimum $3,200 a month on top of standard living expenses. Once again I'm more curious, and am looking for personal experiences.
comment 15: Thank you and you are probably right about the insurance. I'm sorry about your dad but I'm glad to hear that his ""good years"" have been extended under the care of a good neurologist. I kind of assumed it was a no hope situation because I didn't really think there was treatment. Obviously I need to do more research and find a good neurologist in her area.
comment 16: I'm so sorry you're noticing all these changes. I am sure it's very stressful, but it sounds like you're doing a really good job of trying to figure out what's going on and being there for her. It is great that you are tracking the changes you're noticing. That is very helpful.
On the policy – It's very likely that they would want to perform a physical exam before issuing a policy. This may make it hard to impossible to receive one, but you're certainly welcome to try. No downside that I know of for attempting.
On a diagnosis – I just want to note that you can tell your mother's doctors anything. That may be a violation of her trust, but it is not a violation of HIPAA – which it's sometimes described as being. If she has any trusted doctors, including ones she hasn't seen in a while, you can just send them a short summary of this information by email or fax and ask for their help encouraging her to come in for a visit.
comment 17: Thank you. I live 4 hours away from my parents and started keeping track about a year ago when I really started noticing some concerning things last Christmas. When COVID hit and I had the ability to work remotely was when I pushed for them to pursue getting a diagnosis because I would be able to go to appointments with her. I was scared to bring it up but my mom was receptive and she wants help. We're headed in the right direction and the comments on this post help me feel validated that there is definitely an issue, so I will be pushing them to figure out the LTC so we can move forward.
comment 18: Taking your mom to a doctor will help to tell if it is dementia. They have tests that they can perform, on top of what you have experienced with her, to determine what is going on. 
As for the LTC, you will need to look into the policy she has. Some policies make you see a doctor to find out which ADLs (activities of daily living) the person is in need of, as well as how many of them, before the policy is active. Also, there is typically a waiting period for when it will kick in. During the waiting period, you have to pay for care out of pocket. Once the waiting period is up, then there is typically a reimbursement. However, if you wait too long, it is more out of pocket during the waiting period. Most LTC companies have you go through a company when you hire help as well. You can start looking into different companies to see who does and doesn't take LTC. Home Instead is one that does and is found around the world. (You can also ask the LTC company for a list of care companies they work with.)
Scheduling the doctor appointment and getting more information from the LTC policy mom has is step one.
comment 19: Thank you. She actually doesn't have a LTC policy right now, but my parents have met with an agent and think they will be able to get one. I appreciate the information you provided about waiting periods and care companies.
comment 20: >under
I am sorry for what happens with your mom and your family. It is more stressful for caregivers. I hope she is treated already and goes towards a better direction. 
As far as for ltc different companies and different products have different solutions. It is hard to say which one fits you the best or if she is issuable. Even for the waiting period different products have different definitions and some don't have waiting period. Anyway it is very complicated. You should find an agent who knows a wide range of product to find the best one. It is also important to know which state you are in. 
I have a word for yourself. It might be too late to buy the ltci for your mom but you should consider it yourself when you are younger and healthier.
comment 21: Heavy metal toxicity.
Look into getting a hair test.
Look up Andy cutler protocol.
If that doesn’t work, look into the Bredesen protocol
comment 22: Did you end up having your mom evaluated? How did it go? Wishing you well.
comment 23: That doesn't sound like dementia or ADHD. It sounds like some other kind of neurological disorder. Is she seeing a neurologist or psychiatrist? If not, you need to request a referral asap and they need to do a full neuropsychological evaluation, including imaging. 
That said, definitely get the long term care insurance as soon as possible, as it is likely that whatever she does have is degenerative in nature and that she will need long term care at some point. It may be expensive, but it will be less expensive than paying out of pocket. 
Also, the humor thing is likely a coping mechanism.
comment 24: Thanks, she has seen a psychiatrist for anxiety and depression only, and I forgot to mention that she did go to a neurologist before she retired a couple years ago and the neurologist said she didn't have dementia and that dementia would be much different (like going downstairs and not remembering how to get back upstairs). My dad kind of hinges on this when he minimizes it. I would say it has progressed slightly since then and a second opinion is definitely needed.
comment 25: She needs to get back into a neurologist asap and she needs to see a psychiatrist/neuropsychiatrist regarding these issues. If it is degenerative, which it likely is as you say it has progressed, it can hopefully be slowed and the symptoms mitigated by medication and therapy. But that won't happen until she sees the appropriate doctors. Even if they can't find a diagnosis, they can still help more with the symptoms than her regular doctors can, so she definitely needs to see them soon.

Shes mild case (idk what kind if there is diffrent ones) atm but the issue is she loves walking with covid we are scared to put her in a home (possible 2 year wait/line) so we try to keep her as long as possible. Not every moment of the day we can watch her. Any type of tracker would be great, she obv not tech smart n never had a cell phone but a watch shes had everyday so she would wear it and not think twice about it","comment 1: Apple Watch requires an iPhone. Fitbit Surge w/GPS and Bluetooth trackers require a smartphone. Then there are GPS devices, many with monthly subscription services- check pros/cons carefully & see if they require a minimum time contract. (Some are 3-yr prepaid minimum contract where the cancellation fee equals the prepaid amount!)
https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/safety/technology-101 has the questions to consider before you choose your tracking method.
https://www.caringvillage.com/product-review/top-10-products-track-elderly-location/ has pros/cons of remote monitoring/tracking plus reviews 10 specific devices. https://www.seniorlink.com/blog/the-50-best-gps-trackers-for-seniors.  None of these will work for us because our LO with dementia lives alone, can’t keep a device charged, and won’t wear any device because she sees no need for one. Hope you can find a solution that works for you.
comment 2: I purchased a T-Mobile Timex Family Connect watch for my mom, who would say she's going for a walk and you couldn't stop her.  Problem is, she was living with me in a state she's never visited and totally far away from her birth home.  But to her, the family was right down the street.  
I purchased the watch from T-Mobile for $125 - and with a monthly line fee of $15 a month, that is if you currently have a T-Mobile account.
It's designed for kids, so it's perfect.  However, it has, like all the phones do, apps that they can play with.  Here are the features:
GPS tracking, setup a Geofence for safe areas and when they exit that safe area you get a text message;
SOS button, which when pressed, calls the main guardians that have been setup in the device
IT'S A PHONE - so they can call whoever they want and you can call them (My mom never answered as she just did not recognize the phone was ringing and thought it was music)
GPS is really good.  When she's walked away, it guided me directly to her (once she was two miles away) 
You can set lock out modes during designated times you configure on the watch, however, as I discovered this prevented the person from making and receiving calls and that's not good.  I thought this would allow me to lock out tinkering with the phone while still be GPS and phone functional.
Cons:
It behaves funny on WIFI networks and will provide some false positives when on the wifi network - you might get alerts that the watch has left the area because it connected to a cellular tower 1 mile away.
Games - allows them to be distracted, but also can cause mishaps as they get focused only on the watch, even when walking.
Configuration - you cannot lock out configuration settings on the device - so it can easily be changed.  I've asked Timex if they can put in a control that assigns an administrator so that only designated people can make changes.

"I'm so scared My mum (56) was diagnosed in February last year. I dont live with my parents anymore and every time I go and visit it seems to get worse. 
My dad works all week so she's left to her own devices most of the day and just sits there. I'm so worried for her. I want her to get more help but I dont know how and she doesn't seem to want help.
I'm so scared and it upsets me everytime I think about it.
Sorry for the ramble.","comment 1: I'd talk to your dad about maybe getting some homecare while he's at work so she has some companionship and someone that can make sure she keeps up on daily self care tasks. My dad took a sharp decline when he was left alone and once we got him someone to keep him on a schedule he perked back up.
comment 2: I agree with this. My dad also declined after lacking social interaction from quarantine but we recently started sending him to an adult activity center during the day so he stays engaged and has made new friends. Just another option to look into.
comment 3: Look about aging and disability agencies in your area - they might be able to help you find resources for your mum
comment 4: Same.
comment 5: have her do crosswords or sudoku puzzles, it will keep her mind engaged and slow cognitive decline. also try to have her walk around and maybe spend some time outside. What is her medicine game?
comment 6: If you are able to, you should visit her more or get family or friends to come keep her company. She will decline faster if she is not stimulated.

"Best Headphones for my 75 y/o Dad? My Dad has recently become more technologically challenged as he has aged. I am trying to find over the ear headphones that will be very easy and simple for him to use on his iPad and MacBook Pro over Bluetooth primarily for FaceTime/Zoom.
He struggles with switching the Bluetooth connection between devices with other headphones that he owns, so I am trying to find something that would be very easy for him to use. Would something like AirPods Max be easy for him? Or what suggestions do you all have that will let him easily communicate with his family and friends?
Btw, he prefers headphones to using the speakers on his devices
Thanks!","comment 1: Bose Quiet Comfort headphones remember devices and can have active connections to two devices. They will try to connect first to the last connected device and if not found move down the list automatically to try other remembered devices. So these may be worth trying. I use mine regularly with a macbook, ipad and iphone.
comment 2: I second this!
comment 3: Honestly, for simplicity you really cannot beat any headphone which simply uses the 3.5 headphone port.  Nothing to charge, no Bluetooth to connect, and it is super simple to know which device the headphones are connected to.  
Unless he has the very newest iPad Pro or Air, he should have a 3.5 headphone port on each.
I would recommend spending $20 on a simple wired set, and perhaps get something else done the line if those really don’t suit him.
comment 4: Great idea!
comment 5: Air pods are not over the ears, but I am shocked at how consistently they always pair directly to my phone.. even over riding my car pairing
comment 6: Thanks for the feedback! I am referring to the new AirPods Max which are an over the ear style headphone.
comment 7: I’d imagine you want something that is easy to use but don’t want him too insulated where he can’t hear the “outside” around him. Imo AirPods
Pro might be the best thing. If he is suffering from hearing loss, hearing aids with Bluetooth built in exist now.
comment 8: I am going to look into this! Thanks for the tip
comment 9: Np. We went with Starkey livio edge ones. It has some “artificial intelligence” built in that makes things extremely easy for dad.  For example you don’t need to change settings based on your surroundings. Has other bells and whistles but you can explore further if you like. I will say though, it is a big investment. Good luck.
Edit: just have to say, it’s sad hearing aids are considered “ cosmetic”. After further research, hearing loss can impact the brain and also speech. May be worth looking into his insurance and how much, if any, they’d help.
comment 10: I have the airpod pros and it automatically connects to your closest apple device. If you want to switch to a different device, it’s a fairly simple process. I’d recommend these but again, these are the only wireless headphones I’ve tried.
comment 11: Can the AirPods Max automatically connect between MacBook and iPad like they do on iPhone and iPad?
comment 12: Yep! Connects to my phone and MacBook automatically. I’m assuming they should do the same for iPad, but I don’t own one.
comment 13: That’s great feedback! Thank you. I just hope he can figure these out easily if we go this route. It’s frustrating and saddening watching my dad over FaceTime struggle with his headphones every time we call.
comment 14: Yeah, it’s really useful. He just needs to put them in his ears and it automatically connects to the closest apple device. If he needs to switch, he can just click the volume button on the MacBook top toolbar and select “X’s AirPods”.
comment 15: Just chiming in here that the auto-pairing/switching can be a real challenge when an aging parent is trying to answer a call. Under the time pressure the pairing switch can be a significant frustration and hurdle. I'm considering getting setting up a separate phone docking station for my dad because currently the phone is right next to the Mac and at 82 years old the pairing anxiety continues to be an issue even 6 months out.
comment 16: /r/headphones might have some good recommendations.  They love niche requests like this.
comment 17: I tried to post there, but my question was removed as I was looking for purchasing advice.
comment 18: I love these headphones -- they are a wire cutter pick for sound control, and work great when listening to music (or anything else). They are comfy and easy to bluetooth.

"Aging live-in FIL is beginning to refuse water / other beverages... TLDR: 70/yo male, widowed since 2005, hoarder, does not take care of himself well normally. Was diagnosed with schizophrenia, depression - was generally untreated until 2019. Family history of dementia (sister has it BAD at 80).  Hospitalized after being found in his home a year ago, was on the floor several days. Recovered mostly after 6 months. Scored 12/15 on a mental aptitude test administered in long-term care... Currently living with his daughter and myself. Doing well under the circumstances currently. Hasn't seen a bill or anything financial for a year now. I've handled it with his bank account. No POA yet - covid ruined that for now... had a few ER visits for catheter, had a bout of dehydration a few months back, happening again apparently but for him thinking he ""pisses too much"" (bullshit...)
Situation: Oh boy here is the book... be ready:
My FIL has always kept to himself and on occasion contacted me and my wife. Caveat: He’s always resented my wife because fertility issues made him think she wasn’t his… (this runs DEEP) We would call him; he'd call back a few weeks later. We used to live an hour away. My career took me 4 hours away. 2017, moved away... FIRST MASSIVE RED FLAG...
10/2017 - Tried to visit us, screws up the college I work at and I plainly describe how to get to our place.... 3 hours later we get a call he turned back home and ""had enough of this shit"". 7 hours later (3AM) I get a call from him ""I'm still in your wonderful state!"" WTF dude.... after guiding him on google maps asynchronously for 2 hours I FINALLY got him back on track to home. 13 hours later calls us that he’s home and going to an auction later in the day…
Fast forward to 18 hours later... get a call from a sheriff in a county 2 hours south west of his home. He got in a minor car wreck. He's OK but his story made no sense. I confirmed his story was atrocious and told him to take they keys and put him up in a hotel. His brother eventually went to see him as we were 6 hours from where he ended up.
My wife and I drive all night to get to him and finally get some food in him. He's better, so we drive him back home. His truck was impounded, and he worked to regain his license. He of course blames us for this mishap. We communicated off and on throughout the year or so, but it was inconsistent.
October 2019 - gets his nice SUV stuck up to the doors in mud near the Des Moines river - blows the engine and trans trying to rock it out, THEN calls for a tow. (found out about this 2 months later).
Nov. 30th 2019 - found in his home conscious but barely alive. His brother found him, rushed to the ER with a body temp of 94. More than likely had a stroke, and passed out also because of malnutrition. He'd lost a lot of weight too... He weighed 160 when admitted. This guy was pushing about 240-250 only 4 years ago and believe me, he does not work out. After a long recovery process on June 29 2020... he's recovered well enough to leave the long term care facility draining him of 6 grand a month... to live with us, like he said he wanted to do while he was in the home and in the hospital. Editorial note: NO ONE other than us in his family bothered to step up at all in this process…
I drew up a care contract to help his transition and we also contracted with in home care 5 days a week (not RNs). We also got hooked up after 2 ER visits for catheter issues with in home Nursing on demand. Good progress has been made getting his catheter out, improving his health and well-being, and his appetite has improved…
Now that he's getting better, I don't think he can live alone anymore. He's lived by himself for over 15 years, and he's gone a little... feral to put it nicely.
I have a POA drawn up, but with COVID my bank stopped their notary service, and I'm thinking he might not be inclined to sign, even though I have been handling every part of his life for over a year now. Personally, I did what I had to do to keep him afloat during uncertainty.
I am unsure if he knows the in home care people actually cost money... I think he knows...
A couple months ago he stopped drinking the kool aid we gave him (he doesn't like plain water). We had no idea why. He got so dehydrated he couldn't sallow an Arby's roast beef sandwich (which he plows through usually). One of his caregivers FINALLY got out of him why he didn't drink the kool aid - he didn't like the flavor. Did I mention he plays games and lies to us about what's wrong a lot??
We switched flavors and all was going well until yesterday. Now he thinks he ""pisses too much"" drinking the stuff. I took him off flowmax which he was on but might give him too many urges... he was peeing generally well when his catheter was in.
He's said well I'll just piss in my (adult) diaper... dude... that's literally not taking care of yourself and grounds to move you somewhere else!
I'm monitoring him now and he did drink 10oz of Pepsi last night, and always drinks his morning milk of 16oz. What are some strategies or tips for this situation?","comment 1: First of all - COVID has changed notary rules and you can now have virtual notaries over Zoom! Try Notarize or NotaryCam if you can get him to agree to the POA.  
Any way to trick him into getting hydrated through popsicles, fruit, or salads?
comment 2: Good to know about a POA. He's drinking more now which is good. Good appetite as well and I'm home with him the next few days along with my wife so we can hawk him.
We got apple sauce, jello, apples and sometimes grapes in our repertoire. He's not much of a salad type of guy. Popsicles might work well.
I think I'm going to try more soup with him too.

"Grandpa moments This is honestly just going to be me keeping track of the weird things grandpa says and does while I help with his care. I just need to tell someone, anyone.


Told me my driving was going to get us killed.... we were parked and the keys were out of the ignition.


Suddenly wanted to be dropped off right there and tried to open the door while we were driving...  lock buttons are wonderful.


Gave me the sex talk about what happens when a man loves a woman(they have sex).... told me this twice


Said I was a handsome man..... I’m a girl


Told me young girls like me shouldn’t be trying to be with older men..... I’m not dating anyone. 


These are just off the top of my head but i needed to tell someone.","comment 1: 
That was his way of saying you needed to move the car
he was tired of riding and wanted to walk home
Hmmm, should have asked him if a man and a woman can have sex if they don't love each other. 
In some cultures perhaps you'd make a handsome man, who knows?
Tell him you're just trying to find a rich Sugardaddy to pay your expenses. 

You should write them all down if you can remember em. make it into a cartoon strip or a short TV series. I get it from my dad as well. makes it fun trying to figure out what he wants lol.
best of luck.
comment 2: [deleted]
comment 3: That would be sooo helpful, would make counteracting their delusions somewhat straightforward instead of being 80% guessing game.
comment 4: Hang in there!  Dementia is a nasty disease. We have hit a wall after having my father in our house for the last 2 months. He is 82, a narcissist, low self-esteem, low self image and plain old POS!  We offered our home to him instead of going to assisted living/memory care.  I had a horrendous relationship with him over the years and even worked with him for 30+ years.  But wife and I wanted to give him a little dignity before we were unable to care for him. Thought him being around his grandkids would help him, he's only been nasty towards them.  Saying he should have never told them how good Costco's ice cream was.  Wanting to keep it all for him. When caring for a family member with dementia, anything goes. He is old, cranky and always negative.  My wife just stated today that she has never heard my father ask how anyone is doing!  Pretty pathetic considering we've been married for 15 years.  I have never heard him he say he loves my sister or me and I'm 53 and sister is 57.  Just remember they have a disease and they will say anything and one has to try to separate is truth from reality. My father has been studying a driver's pamphlet thinking he will get his license back. NEVER!!!  But we let him study away.  Best wishes for you and you grandpa.
comment 5: Yeah, driving with Dad in the car is interesting. Am thinking it's hitting his depth perception as he screams at oncoming cars which are at the other end of the parking lot from us. Does the same with cross traffic if we're waiting at a light, figures everyone is going too fast I guess.
Had him try and bail out only once, but he was in the backseat at the time and still had enough awareness to know he couldn't fit out the window after discovering we'd child locked the back doors. That was a quick pull over, he managed to get roughly his upper quarter outside before we quit moving.
comment 6: Understandable. It's a disease that affects people around the person affected quite badly.
Mum said a lot of weird things before she passed away.
That the pillow of her bed was a machine, and my brother looked like a machine.
That she was sitting on a rock and saw us all under water below her.
The hardest bit was demanding to see dad... he'd died a few years earlier. Every time my brother told her he's dead, she seemed to relive the grief of him dying again. I always tried to deflect her but he bluntly told her ""he's dead, we've told you this a million times"". That was hard.
She'd tell us she'd ran away from the home and gotten lost before they found her. Talking to the home, they had no record of her leaving.
Once, she didn't recognise me. Then, moments later she did.
The nursing home let her phone me. All I heard was her screaming non-stop for five minutes. I kept saying unless she said something I would hang up. She eventually mumbled something and went back to screaming.
I hung up. Later that day my brother told me she had no recollection of doing that.
The rest of that day, I was upset and did little work.
Both my parents are dead now. I felt numb for quite a while. We'd fallen out ages ago and were distant. I remember the bad times more than the good.
"
"First Time Posting, Not Sure What to Do This is my first time posting on Reddit, and I apologize for the LONG post. I’m on my phone, so hopefully the formatting is ok. Thank you in advance to anyone who reads/comments! 
I’m a woman in my early 40s and the only child of a wonderful woman in her mid 70s. We live in two different states, about 10 hours apart by car. I love my mom and am very grateful for her.
That being said, Mom has changed a lot in the last few years. She’s gotten more judgmental and negative about some things, monopolizes conversations with others (interrupting to talk about herself or give an opinion, etc.), and when anyone says anything complimentary of me, she always takes credit for it, as though I have not learned or done anything on my own in 40 years.
Mom is physically better off than many people her age, but her health has declined some, and there are issues she does not address at all that she should, including hearing loss and severe arthritis. She seems to be more forgetful and is constantly looking things up and writing things down. She has countless pieces of paper, sticky notes, and calendars in multiple locations. I assume this constant note taking is a coping mechanism for not remembering things as easily anymore. She spends A LOT of time with her head buried in her phone or iPad either scrolling Facebook, reading something on the internet, or playing a game. She doesn’t really use Facebook to keep up with loved ones since she never posts or comments and rarely messages with people. It’s just mindless scrolling and game playing in my opinion. I honestly think some of it is depression related, however she’d probably never admit that, and if she did, I highly doubt she’d seek counseling. Medication is out of the question because she’s very anti-medicine.
Here’s where we get to the tricky part. Mom divorced her last husband (she’s had a few) a few years ago, and she kept the house, which was her first mistake. It’s beautiful, but it’s huge and requires lots of upkeep and at 20 years old, it’s quickly becoming a money pit. Mom is a dog lover and has two small dogs who are 15 and 16 and in very declining health. They require an abundance of work and patience. My mom is very dedicated to the dogs and takes wonderful care of them, but she does yell and get frustrated at times because they can be soul sucking. Her yelling is stressful and scares my dog, who is a rescue from an abusive home, and I have had to remind her multiple times not to yell.
We have spent the last year together either in my home or Mom’s. I have done a lot of the work for her dogs because some of it is hard for her due to her arthritis and skin issues. These dogs are each under 7 pounds and frail. They don’t have accidents daily, but when they do, it can be a nightmare. It’s not just a puddle that needs to be cleaned and sanitized (we both have tile flooring). They step or fall in it, track it, have poop on themselves, whatever. It can become a whole cleaning process, often requiring a bath/shower for the dog and/or whoever is doing the cleaning. They make a lot of laundry. Leaving them can be a nightmare. I have tried to do the majority of the errands and shopping since the pandemic began since Mom is obviously more high risk. The dogs require a lot of proactive action in order to reduce some of the workload, and my OCD mind is always looking to the next step to try to avoid a problem. Mom does not always listen to what I tell her to do to manage them, even though I’m usually right with my suggestions, and her stubbornness often results in a mess I end up cleaning. She will literally be lost in her phone and not paying attention when something avoidable happens. I often come home to a problem. The dogs eat up a lot of her day, the rest is her shower, meals, and her phone. Sometimes not a lot else gets accomplished. Her house requires too much work for that. She isn’t a hoarder, but the house is full of lots of furniture and things, some of which she never should have bought, most of which she doesn’t use, and she admits that she wants to downsize and doesn’t want a lot of it. I’ve made her clean out cabinets and get rid of old stuff. She had food in her pantry that expired years ago, cleaning supplies she hadn’t used in years, etc. There’s still plenty more she could get rid of, but she often finds reasons to keep things. She can’t find certain things, including a picture of my late father I have wanted for years, because this house is so full of stuff. One older person does not need well over 4000 square feet of large furniture and belongings! The work that needs to be done to get her into a smaller house is something I don’t know how to accomplish.
Today was the one year anniversary of a traumatic and life altering event for me. I kind of just wanted to be by myself, think a little, and maybe watch something mindless on TV. Mom of course wanted to do something on the other end of the house from where the dogs were napping. She took one dog with her and left the other one alone rather than ask me to keep an eye on him for a bit. Of course he peed, stepped in and tracked it, and I had almost an hour of cleaning to do. I spent Christmas Day bathing her dogs, cleaning poop, washing their bedding, washing her bedding, and making her bed. She did cook a small dinner, which I appreciated, but she wanted to do that, and then of course she got frustrated in the process. I really didn’t want to clean anything dog related today after all I did yesterday. I just wanted to take the day to deal with my trauma from a year ago. It’s hard not to get mad and resentful when some of the work I end up doing could be avoided if Mom would be proactive or pay better attention. If she wanted to leave the dog alone, she should have taken him outside first. This isn’t rocket science.
Even before COVID, Mom really didn’t reach out to her friends much or do a lot of things socially. I’m basically her only social outlet. This has caused problems for me socially over the last few years because when she comes to stay with me (usually for a few months at a time), I often feel guilty for leaving her to do something with friends, etc. Her somewhat overbearing presence was an issue in one relationship I had a couple years ago, and it also prevented me from spending some time with the person I dated most recently. I try not to get resentful about that, but it’s hard at times. Mom recently told me she wished I could sell my house, move in with her, sell her home, and then move back to my state since the climate is better. That seems like a lot to ask of me. I don’t want to move around and don’t necessarily want to live in her current location or with her. Obviously if she needed care I would live with her, but as of now she could manage on her own in a smaller home.
I’m getting ready to go back home, and Mom will be on her own for the first time in a year. I am concerned about how she will fare emotionally, and I’m also concerned about the workload since I won’t be here to do the nitty gritty work with the dogs, wake up with them at night since she doesn’t seem to hear them, or do the planning ahead to avoid a problem. I also think with no one around, she will sit and do even more mindless phone scrolling, and she’ll never get to a point where she’s ready to sell her home and move, which she should have done years ago. I hate to think of the what ifs, but if something happens to her, I’ll be so screwed with the amount of work in her house, not to mention the associated costs while I try to sell it, which can take time in her area. If I had a child, I would never want to leave him or her in a situation like that. Not to mention, why wouldn’t she want to simplify her life? She’s expressed that desire yet does nothing to get herself there. If it were me, I’d be rushing to get into a smaller home so I could actually have time to enjoy my retirement. I know no one my mom’s age who lives the way she does.
I try not to get mad but have certainly expressed anger and frustration on more than one occasion, and some of it hasn’t been pretty. I’m trying to work on that because I know I can cut deep with my words. I am at a loss on so many levels. I guess what prompted me to finally post was the issue today that was so completely avoidable because Mom could have just walked the dog prior to leaving him alone, and he would have been fine. I almost felt like she was sabotaging a day when I just needed to do some healing, and I felt very disrespected, although I don’t think it was malicious on her part. I almost think she’s so used to me handling the problems that she doesn’t worry about them happening. I’m not sure how to handle things as I prepare to leave her alone. Any advice is appreciated!","comment 1: I know it doesn't fix everything but...
Dog diapers. It sounds so stupid but I'm dead serious. They have disposable ones or reusable ones you just chuck in the washing machine. They're super helpful for older, disabled, and young/small dogs recovering from surgery. If the dogs won't leave them alone (which tends to be more of a young dog issue), my vet recommends dog pajamas or straight up baby onesies if your dog is small enough (carefully cut a hole for the tail). The dogs will look stupid af, but you won't be cleaning up after them like before or stressing over them constantly.
comment 2: The dog diapers are a great idea, and I have discussed that with my mom because she used them in the past with another dog who passed away at an old age. The problem with her two is the dog who would need the diaper the most has some skin issues, and my mom really doesn’t want her to sit in a dirty diaper or need additional bathing because she already gets bathed enough. The other dog was a rescue and has misshapen back legs, we believe due to abuse in a previous home, and it’d be pretty hard to get a diaper on him. Thankfully he is able to control his potty habits pretty well. So it just boils down to lots of supervision, and of course the dogs have impeccable timing and always need something when you’re in the middle of a task!
I think one of those places you’re describing sounds great in many ways, however I’m not sure my mom is quite ready for that. I also don’t think she’d pay the high prices. I think she could swing a small home and yard on her own with someone to come and mow the grass for her. It’s just getting her into a smaller home that I don’t think she can tackle. Downsizing and moving seems like an insurmountable task at this point, especially with me not being close by to help her. I get frustrated because she should have moved years ago when the work required to do so wouldn’t have been as hard on her, but she was hell bent on remaining where she is until more recently. It’s like I’m still a child sometimes and can’t possibly make a valid point or two, lol. She is slowly getting better at taking my suggestions, but that has been a hard fight.
comment 3: You have every right to feel the way you feel. I am also an only child to a 71 year old, widowed mom who was staying with me for a little and is going back home, so your guilt and feelings of obligation hit home for me. Is she open to having someone come by and help with the dogs? If so, and if you have the money, you could consider hiring someone to swing by every other day or however you feel comfortable to help with the dogs and whatever else your mom needs help with. Might also help to have the doggos reevaluated by a vet if you haven't already, to make sure you're doing all that you can for them.
comment 4: Thank you so much for your lovely reply! I’m sorry you are going through something similar, and I’m so sorry to hear about your dad (or maybe stepdad). My father passed away when I was little, but my parents were already divorced. I miss my dad a lot. How is your mom’s health? Does she do alright on her own?
My mom is not very open to having a lot of help with things. Other than her yard man (who hasn’t shown up in weeks, so I’ve been doing yard work), she has no help here. I doubt she’d want to spend money on a dog sitter, and quite frankly, I don’t feel it’s my responsibility to do that. In many ways, my mom is in a hell of her own making, and she doesn’t take suggestions well. And if she did have a pet sitter come by, she’d spend a lot of time chatting with them and wouldn’t use the time wisely to do things she needs to do while she doesn’t have to keep an eye on the dogs. Time management is a huge issue around here.
The dogs get regular vet care, and she has spoken with the vet multiple times in recent weeks. My mom is of the opinion that if they eat (she hand feeds both of them twice daily), drink, and go potty, they are living, and their quality of life, and hers, is secondary. The older dog can no longer seem to control her bowels, and my biggest fear came true last night when she had an accident in my mom’s bed. Guess I’ll be doing lots of laundry today!
I’m certainly not trying to not take suggestions, I just know how stubborn my mom is. She is the person who spends money on things she never uses, and they sit around in bags or boxes forgotten about. She says she can do this or that, but when it comes down to it, then she will struggle. Sigh.

"Bathroom etiquette for disabled people I live with my brother, who has a neurodegenerative disorder that causes physical and mental handicaps. He can barely walk and has severe balance issues. 
Recently he has stopped closing the bathroom door and washing his hands. I understand why; he can't take his hands off his walker. But it's a bad scene for a variety of reasons. 
What can I do to make it so he can close the door and keep his hands clean? Is there a device I could build and install on the door?","comment 1: You can take the door off the hinge and put a small shower curtain up (with a collapsible rod higher than he can reach. Doesn't have to be fancy, but something that makes it private as far as walking past and looking in. At the very least, someone could follow behind him and close the curtain. Another option is splitting the curtain in several spots (maybe like 4 big parts) and attaching magnets that will ""let go"" when he pushes against them. Or small garment/fishing weights. Gives the illusion of privacy but isn't just an open area anyone can bother him in.  
For washing hands, maybe a dispenser - automatic. Maybe just sanitizer. Maybe a foam dispenser that can absorb into his skin. Maybe just wet wipes he can run his fingers through. My dad forgets to wash but he'll wipe his fingers on a wet-wipe since he's already using that for wiping in general.  
If you have the money/space for a remodel of the doorway, you can look into a bathroom remodel for him. Most people in the home health sector just give these inexpensive solutions because they don't cost much and are easy to implement.
comment 2: Look online. You can get a cheap wire basket to hang on his Walker and put antibacterial hand wipes or gel in it.
comment 3: If this is at home, I’d shrug it off.
If it’s in the public place, I would just stand nearby like parents do for their little kids.
You could put a sign on the mirror as a reminder... there’s probably auto - closing hinges but you’d have to check and make sure (municipality wise) if this is up to code (if you’re in the US). Just a wild guess, but I know in the US, local government can be picky about these changes inside a home
comment 4: That's a good idea. I'll look into local statutes.
comment 5: I wonder if a simple piece of cord could be tied around the door knob ... long enough the he can get where he needs to be then pull the cord to at least semi-close the door.  Or a cane or yardstick to gently push the door closed.
Sanitary hand wipe cloths can be put into his walker bag so he can clean his hands when he gets back to the bed.
I also wonder if part of his not closing the door is fear that if he needs help you won't hear him or won't come right away.  In my house we got a pair of CallToU buttons that hang around the neck and buzz where every you put the receiver.    The entire family seemed to relax after that because we all knew that at any time for any reason they could 'call me' for help.
https://www.amazon.com/CallToU-Caregiver-Transmitters-Receivers-Attention/dp/B077SYPD5K/ref=sr_1_7?crid=1Q4KQF7FX8LU7&dchild=1&keywords=bell+for+disabled+person&qid=1608670393&sprefix=bell+for+di%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-7
comment 6: Thanks for the advice! I'll get somw wipes next time I'm at the store. 
I hadn't thought about that, I'll get some of those buttons.
comment 7: I had two in hospice at the same time - my Mom and my husband.  You can set the bells to different ring tones so we always knew who pressed the bell by what it chimed.  
For me, as caretaker, it meant I didn't have to always have my 'ears' tuned tot hem.  I could relax and trust that they would use the bell when necessary.
After each of them passed I gave their bell onto our hospice nurse so that she could lend them to her other patients.
comment 8: The door closing is easy enough, there are door closers that are pretty inexpensive and install with a couple of screws. It would attempt to close on him as he is walking through, so make sure that it wouldn't lose a problem. An even cheaper alternative is to just get a long spring and screw it to the door and frame on the hinge side. Not a lot of closing power so it probably wouldnt latch, but it could maintain his privacy. 
Hand washing would be more complicated. Portable handwashing stations are big and intended for festivals and jobsites (at least the ones I could find). There isnt a convenient option, but perhaps a pitcher of warm water poured over a basin or bucket so he can wash his hands when he can sit may be an option? Hand sanitizer could work in a pinch, but isnt as effective.
comment 9: Hmmm. Sounds like somebody needs to be on stand by for when he is finished to insist and assist those hands being washed vs feces on hands, to walker and to anything else he touches. Same stand by can close and open the door. Hopefully he can actually wipe his bottom good but there are gloves to wear to help him with that.  He needs to own up to where he needs help. I would sanitize his walker too esp where he grabs it, once in awhile wipe it down. Likely he does other stuff without washing his hands properly. Coughing into hands etc.

"Our family is split over how to handle my grandmother's dementia, no one will listen to each other and the fighting is making things 100% worse. I don't really know what I can do at this point, I have moved to the UK from Aus 10 years ago and have slowly watched my grandmother deteriorate every time I go back to see them.
She completely lost grip on reality when my grandfather passed 3 years ago, in the last 2 years since my last visit she has gone from someone who couldn't cook but would remember to eat snacks, remember who we are, walk around the shops - to someone who refuses food, is physically violent, and spends most of her time rewashing the same pile of laundry.
This side of my family have never gotten along well but they have spent the last 5 years yelling at each other, winding my grandmother up to see who's side she will take and basically acting like children - and doing the worst things you can do around someone suffering from the disease. They yell at her when she forgets things, they tell her she's losing it and that they will put her in a home (as punishment), they have massive arguments in front of her, and now they wonder why she has started to be violent.
I have spent the last 12 months pleading with my mother to call a help line and start to learn more about the disease but even a few months ago she admitted to me that she didn't want to accept this was happening and the help line would make it too real.
The worst part is that the stress of this is clearly causing my mum to deteriorate in the same way, she has always had a bad memory but now she has complete blanks, she struggles to use small devices like her phone, she gets completely disorientated and stressed in new surroundings. I am really worried but no one will listen to me when I say they need more professional support.
They have now decided to put my nan in a home but one of the siblings is telling her that the other two are out to get her and don't care about her so they're putting her in a home. I can't see this ending well. She was in hospital a few weeks ago and attacked 3 nurses to the point they had to put security on her door. I feel like there is nothing I can do..","comment 1: Your grandmother needs a medical evaluation and a guardian or someone to act as her power of attorney. If she has a person assigned already they have a duty for her care. If grandmother doesn’t then see a lawyer specializing in family or estate law to get you on track with information and legal steps. Differences among family add to the stress and often care decisions cannot be made by consensus. You may be the voice your grandmother needs.
comment 2: Thanks for your reply, my mother is her legal guardian and has been for many years due to a language barrier, but she is also over 60 and just really struggling to handle things when her siblings continuously throw obstacles in her way. She doesn't listen to my advice, she says it's just too hard or too late.
I guess I don't know if it even is possible for my grandmother to improve from this violent state or if she will only get worse from here?
There is definitely no consensus and the fighting is making things worse. I have tried to suggest they see a family counsellor or mediator, which can be arranged by the dementia helpline but they refuse to call as they think counsellors are only for crack addicts.
comment 3: Maybe you could take your mother to a lawyer to see what her responsibilities are as guardian. A plan from a neutral party will bring clarity. I’ve done this first for my father and now my husband who has become increasingly violent through the stages of dementia. I’ve dealt with oppositional and vocal family and refuse to argue with them after the decision was explained.
comment 4: I think standing her ground will be the only way but it's hard with her mental state as I know she feels a lot of guilt that things have gotten so bad. You are right that a neutral party will help ease the tension, a lawyer is a good idea I will look into that - thank you very much
comment 5: You can support your mother to be strong. My daughter is my support. She went to some appointments with me and now is the contact person for my husband’s angry siblings. There are 6 of them. She emailed them to contact her with questions. Their dissatisfied  calls and texts would bring me to tears. My children have allowed me to cope with this phase of my marriage.
comment 6: Sounds like you are really lucky to have her while you go through this terrible time. I'm really sorry it's happening to you but want you to know that your words have given me hope that we can remain strong through this.
I am stuck in the UK at the moment due to corona but I will make time to spend a month or two back in Aus as soon as boarders open to see if I can take some of the stress off for her. Until then I will continue to call her regularly and try to organise a lawyer or mediator to speak with the family.
comment 7: Thank you. You may want to consider virtual appointments and zoom calls where you are present. I have found the pandemic has made professionals and families more flexible . Have peaceful holidays.🎄
comment 8: The violence will probably improve as her conditions improve. Right now she's very stressed because of how your family treats her. Establishing a sense of safety, both physical and mental, and compassionate routines will help her be less violent. Unfortunately it's a part of the disease sometimes and probably won't completely go away. I would consider what your family is doing to be abuse and neglect and I think it's very serious. They are exacerbating her condition and causing suffering and if they can't stop she should be separated from them for her well-being. She deserves to be safe and treated compassionately. This makes me feel sick to read
comment 9: It's actually really hard for me to hear about when I'm so far away, I feel very deeply for my grandmother who along with my grandfather had a big part in raising me and my cousins. I know that it all comes from a place of love and fear of losing her but I just don't understand why they are being so immature about it after we have already lost so much. 
I need to accept that she needs to be removed from them because they're never going to get it. I have a lot of guilt about not being there.
comment 10: So sorry to hear that, sounds awful!  :(   I care for my mum since some years ago, my sister makes dreadful dramas & scenes, so I can relate a little.   Yeh, it's very tough, for your mum.  Alzheimers.org & / dementia.org UK have loads of resources, info, tips, & telephone helpline.  You can also check out Dementia.org.au.  They are there to support folk - the memory lossed as well as their family / carers / friends.
I understand you are in UK & family is in Aust - it's quite same-same basics though I should think, you ought to check out their sites & even speak with them on the phone, before going spending tons of $$$ on lawyers just to waste half the time on them telling you what you can learn for free from those sites.  Do some research, talk to alzhms / dementia, then you'll likely at least have a list of questions or concerns / considerations ready to ask lawyer. 
I wish you best of luck!
comment 11: Thanks very much that is all very useful and reassuring to hear. I think I should give them a call for sure.
comment 12: Yre welcome, it's a really tough situation!  Also, you absolutely should make sure as soon as is possible, that your mother completes POG & POA (powers of guardian & powers of attorney) with a proper lawyer.  Hopefully appointing you, obviously.  Too many people leave this too late, & end up in hands of Public Guardian - not best option, often.  
Some oldies will argue about doing this, thinking ""I don't need to do that yet, I'm not THAT old.""  But really, anyone at any age should have completed POA & POG.  If you're knocked unconscious by a cyclist & get addled for coupla months, or in coma from traffic accident, it's too late to do it, can't be done.  I hope you prevail upon your mum to get it done - and NOT appoint her other family members there, sounds disastrous
It's a nightmare, this situation of can't get back to / into Australia.  I have friends from Melbourne were visiting India for a month in Feb, they couldn't bring forward their flight before the plague hit, they're STILL stuck in India.  I can imagine how awful & frustrated you must be feeling.  Nobody expected this bloody plague to hit - it's not your fault, you can only do so much from afar - then we just have to leave it to fate.  Sucks but...  I used to live in Europe & India, would spend at least half th year outside of Aust, so while I was here, would set stuff up for mum's home support & care while I was gone.  Sis used to often try interfere.  Mum eventually degenerated of course, then I moved back here permanent 3 yrs ago.  Sucks.  Anyways, I feel for you!! 
Is your grandma on govt pension?  If so she should be signed up for home care assistance (as my mum is - it was a battle getting her to accept home help) ?  It would give your mum some relief & respite.   It's quite a process & a wait-list, but sooner get on it the better. I understand you think she'll be better in a live-in facility, (I WISH my dad would go residential)  just floating another idea, if that doesn't come off - again, wait-lists.  In either case, she needs assessment by Royal District Nursing or whoever oversees yr mum & grandmas area, for receiving home assist, or respite in a residential facility.  Dementia.org.au can tell you info all about that.  
Often, if the person starts to spend an afternoon or 2 per week, or a day or 2 per week, in oldies facility for respite, they will get more used to the idea - your grandma might even start herself to prefer to move.  I don't know what's yr grandmas native language?  But there are oldies facilites in Aust specifically catering to a bunch of other native language speakers (eg Italian, Greek, Viet, Chinese, etc). 
With my psycho obstructive power-crazy sister, I often have to ""fight smart"" - maneuver things before she gets wind of it, before she has chance to oppose or put up an alternative psycho-kooky-self-interested option.  Sometimes more the steam-roll approach, (not with my mum, with crazy sister) often the ""fight smart"" - keep it secret till it's done, so she can't object or throw obstacles.  Good luck!
Best of luck with everything!  Take care of yourself too, best of luck supporting your mum, as well as grandma!  Merry crappest festive season ever!!  :)
comment 13: Haha thanks so much, Merry crap-mas to you too. It's really nice to hear someone commiserate with being so far from family. My cousins tell me there wouldn't have been much I could do from here as no one listens to reason any way but the guilt will probably never go. 
I think we all wanted it to work with her staying in her house that we all grew up in but now I am starting to think that she will never feel better in that same environment that also saw my grandfather pass under not too different circumstances (they refused to admit he was passing from cancer and took his medication away so that he was in constant pain). She has had carers come for her but she's so worked up from all the family drama she's started acting as though they have come to kill her and being violent toward them. 
It's really hard coming from an immigrant family where no one trusts authority or doctors and have these extremely traditional mindsets just because they had to endure so much adversity when moving to Australia. 
My sister is back in Aus and I guess the best thing that's happened from me pestering all of them is that she has now started to see the signs in my mother and has agreed to help me get her proper care.
comment 14: Your grandmothers emotional state seems very tied to her environment. Though aggression is a normal symptom of sundowning/dementia, I definitely think she can get more emotionally stable. When my mom first had to go to a short term rehab facility after being in the hospital and getting diagnosed with dementia, she was very violent, screaming every night for HOURS and thinking everyone was going to kill her. She was more out of control because she was scared and alone and confused and with covid we couldn't see her enough. She has taken a 180 turn with the proper environmental changes and medicine/vitamins/nutrition. I 100% think your grandma can get more stable. There are also medications to consider if it is very very bad to calm delusions/psychotic episodes.
The thing is it would get worse either way, dementia is a progressive disease. Your mom isn't guilty of anything. This is VERY HARD to go through. If your mom calls any helpline they will console her. Try conference calling one with her so you are on the phone too. She needs to get through the denial and the guilt - no knows how to handle this perfectly. 
Going home for a while to help your mom and standing up to her siblings for her will go a long way. This is a lot for a woman her age to handle. If your mom is the guardian, she is the decision maker at the end of the day. The court deemed it so. So people can share input but its not their legal decision or liability. Empower your mom and gatekeep talking to her siblings for her if you can - that something you can do from where you are. 
Does she live with your mom?
comment 15: Thanks very much for this, it's reassuring to hear she has the potential to get better emotionally. 
She doesn't live with her, at the moment all siblings are struggling to manage to care for her between the 3 of them and carers now refuse to deal with her because of the violence. It's just a really bad situation from many angles.
I have been doing my best but it's easy to start feeling helpless when you're so far away, I think you are right about the help line and something I hadn't considered to bring up again.

"I'm Just Exhausted My MIL is about to turn 70.  About 5 years ago she moved in with my husband and I as we were struggling financially and she was leaving her 5th husband.  We had lived together previously and for a few years it was fine.  Any issues that came up were resolved with talking and respecting each other.  Recently though, things have nosedived.
The last 2 years have been a constant struggle and I feel like I can't even enjoy my own home.  Things got so bad over the COVID crisis I am not sure how much longer I can do this.  I work as a social service provider and feel like I'm failing at home. 
I'm the only one working as my husband is in school and 2 terms away from graduating. MIL is retired and even before COVID had limited activity.  My MIL has basically stopped helping out around the house leaving me to do it in my spare time.  My husband tries to help but his course load is very difficult especially with distance learning.  There are so many behaviors I feel overwhelmed when at home or thinking about coming home. The most obvious behavior my MIL has taken on has impacted my husband significantly.  Since she doesn't have social obligations she started losing track of the days.  We started to keep a calendar in the fridge so that's subsided but now she has begun to interrupt conversations, begin talking to my husband when he is taking a test in zoom even after he informs her he is starting.  
She had stopped reading social or physical cues and will continue to speak even if others are talking. She has lost a lot of social respect.   She needs constant guidance when out and about, like when she walks right up to other people in the store and starts coughing loudly!  We have had to physically guide her back while waiting in line as she stood about 19 inches behind the person in front of her as she didn't hear or heed our verbal reminder.   She will ignore social distancing but openly complain when others do the same to her.   A few weeks ago I had some really exciting news so I went to tell her. I explained then she completely changed the subject and basically ignored what I said. This is happening more and more and really hurtful. 
MIL choose not to wear her glasses when cooking which means there are incredible messes I have to pick up when I get home from work.  Every day I come home to the counters cluttered,  food stuck on ""clean"" dishes,  packaged food in the fridge needing to be cleaned up, and food and spills running down the appliances and lower cabinets.  I have tried to keep up the common areas in my spare time but it got so consuming I would feel like crying whenever she went into the kitchen to make food. I want to get a cleaner for the kitchen twice as month but there is no way we can afford it.  In my job I work with senior services and her they refuse in home assistance unless the senior is unable to wash on their own.  We have talked with her many times about being more mindful as well as wearing her glasses when cooking but she doesn't seem to care about her impact on us. 
Along with that thought, she has recently been causing me to feel very guilty about spending time with my husband.  We will take time to talk alone in our room or go for a drive and will mention how she is always left out or alone.  She has begun talking more and more about dying alone or how she doesn't have anyone to emotionally bond to.  We have suggested on multiple occasions setting up socially distant meet ups with friends but she shoots us down.   Even after explaining that there is virtually no risk she refuses, however still insists on going to the grocery store. It feels like she now fully expects my husband and I to fulfill emotional needs that isn't on us to fulfill. We have stopped inviting her to watch movies with us or play games she used to like because she never said yes.  She admits she had been depressed but won't talk to her doctor. We have offered to go with her or to set up a virtual meeting but again she doesn't seem interested in wanting to change anything.  We talked six months ago about both her and I getting some counseling.  I did but she chose not to even after agreeing. 
She has also developed some really irritating compulsions that continue even after speaking to her about them. I struggle with PTSD from childhood abuse and have misophonia.  She has had this compulsive nontinal whistle/ air blowing for about 2 years,  but after checking in with her about it she had only gotten worse.   I don't want to think it's on purpose but it's EVERY time she's in a common space and I have to consistently leave the room which she takes great offense to.  
Additionally, I'm sensitive to touch unless it's my husband. Recently she had taken extreme offense to me retracting when she walks up behind me to scratch my back or shoulder.  She will follow it up with ""I guess I'm just touch starved.  It's been years since someone hired me!""  Well,  not only isn't that true but she is well aware that I've struggled significantly with PTSD.  It's only been in the last year that she makes me feel guilty about this. 
My husband and I feel that we have to walk on eggshells around her each day.  We feel that she is holding us responsible for not only ensuring she is physically taken care of but emotionally as well. In the next two years my husband and I plan to start the adoption process through the foster care system and there is absolutely no way we would be approved with her in the home. As the time draws nearer and home is less and less a refuge I find myself running out of mechanisms to cope with.  At this point she has me feeling like I am the asshole in the home by not constantly providing all her needs.  
Additionally, I'm sensitive to touch unless it's my husband. Recently she had taken extreme offense to me retracting when she walks up behind me to scratch my back or shoulder.

I don't know what to do. This sub has been helpful to see in not alone but I don't know what to do here.   Any suggestions?","comment 1: It is tough, I  agree. Is a senior living community an option? Especially if you are starting a family.  Can she afford her own apartment near by? If she is cognitive, your husband has to have end of life conversation now. What does she want in the future? I pushed the issue with my parents when they were about to retire.  It has saved us alot of time and drama. My mom has since passed on her terms and my dad is in a senior home.
comment 2: I would definitely look into senior housing of some sort. She needs supervision doing basic things (cooking). And her refusal to see a doctor means she knows something is wrong and doesn't want it confirmed. 
And YOU NEED A BREAK!!! You are dealing with people's problems all day at work and then come home to more problems. I'm sure your husband is busy, but he needs to step up more. This is his mom, and he needs to confront her. Does your husband have any siblings who might be able to take care of MIL for a week or two so you can get a break? You need a day at the spa, or just a couple of days away from MIL. Get some self-care!
comment 3: She needs to be in her own place, supervised. It does not seem likely she's going to get better.  And if you want a child, the sooner you take steps toward finding her a place, the better. There is no reason to feel guilty about this. She is either choosing not to respect you, or she is in mental decline and can't behave properly. In either case, you are not at fault. You can adopt a child, or you can allow your mother to be your child, but not both.
comment 4: Have you ever had her mental capacity tested?  It could be that she is starting to suffer from the effects of dementia or Alzheimer's? I would ask her GP to perform a MMSE on her?  Take a list of the things she used to be able to do and now has difficulty plus all the personality changes that have occurred in the last couple of years.  She could have also suffered from a TIA or small stroke as that can cause personality changes too.  
There is also something called a Care Manager who does an assessment for services for people.  
We just went through this with my MIL and I have to tell you it's one of the hardest things we had to go through.  Once we got her diagnosed things got easier only because we realized that she wasn't doing things to be difficult, her brain just changed.  She is now living in memory care but its still hard.  I know right now it may be overwhelming but in order for you not to get burned out, you and your husband need to think about changing things because it's probably not something that will improve that much.  Try to identify as many things you can farm out like grocery shopping, meal preparation, laundry, cleaning etc. I think it would really help your mental health.
comment 5: On thing that helps us - don’t take things they say personally.- its the dementia talking, not the person. I have seen the sweetest, nicest, most educated people say the most vile things - but it was the dementia talking, not the person the used to be.
comment 6: Honestly, it sounds like you are taking on more responsibility both for care and decision making than your husband in this situation and that seems like a major part of the problem to me. It’s his mom. If the situation is creating a dynamic in the home that is bad and escalating, he has to take a leadership role in the resolution. 
I’m sorry. I know how hard this stuff is. Be kind to yourself, especially in your head.
comment 7: This was long so maybe I missed it but have you had her evaluated. These are not normal changes
comment 8: Call an elder-care attorney.  The first consult is free.
Have a pad and pencil ready; be prepared to get her out of your house and on her own (with carers)!
Good luck!
comment 9: Time for a neuropsychological evaluation.
comment 10: Meals on wheels for the cooking?  That would be good for you and her.
comment 11: A couple of those can be signs of (probably unrecognized, unacknowledged) hearing loss:
• continuing to speak when others are talking
• “listening” to you, then changing the subject and ignoring what you said
It seems like there’s little doubt she is going through other cognitive and emotional changes, too, but if hearing loss is in the picture, the reduced informational input caused by it can exacerbate the other changes.

"My sweet honey A few days ago I came home to find that my sweet honey had passed away. 
4 wonderful years we shared together. 4 short years when we planned on having forever. 
When Dave and I met things were very casual and fun. We had both been hurt in the past and were not looking to rush into anything. 
We instantly hit it off. 
I had never laughed so hard, smiled so much or been so happy before. Every second I spent with him the more I realized that what we had would be special.
Dave was a type 1 diabetic for over 10years when we first met. He had his insulin tracked pretty well with the help of his ominipod and years of practice. I knew very little about the disease but quickly became quit the expert. 
Our relationship blossomed and we both realized that we would never be apart. 
It was so natural. We fit so well together and I told him he was my forever and he told me I was his “end goal”. 
He met my 4 year old son and the two of them hit it off and instantly became buddies.
We were a little family. 
As our relationship blossomed, unfortunately so did Daves illness. His organs began to fail and he started dialysis 3 days a week while waiting for a transplant.
Even with all the hospital trips, dialysis, and sickness we still had each other. 
And we made each other laugh. Even in the darkest times. We were going to get through it. 
Last March, Dave got the call we had been waiting for. They had a kidney and pancreas for him. 
Even though we were scared because the world was in the middle of a pandemic, we knew this was his 2nd chance. 
The surgery was a success and within 4 weeks he was home recovering with me. 
We spent a WONDERFUL 8 months living together. He grew stronger every day. 
It was so nice to not have to worry about sugars or dialysis. Unfortunately this took a turn for the worse about a month ago. 
He developed phenomena and spent the last 3 weeks in the hospital. 
His body fought off the illness but also started to fight the new organs that didn’t really belong there. 
The pancreas was able to be saved but the kidney was stubborn and would not wake back up. 
I picked him up from the hospital Wednesday and was so happy to have him home. Even though he had to start dialysis again, we were positive that we would get through this together. 
Just another road block but we would get through it like everything else. We were so strong. So so strong. Never in 4 years did we fight or argue. 
We even talked about celebrating him being home by getting sized for rings. We planned on buying a home together this summer. 
So many plans..... and everything was just taken away. 
I came home from work Thursday and found him in bed. He was gone. His beautiful blue eyes were open but no light was left in there. 
I tried to save him. I did CPR until the paramedics arrived and they took over when they got there.... but he was gone. He had passed a few hours before. 
Although he fought like hell, his body was just tired. 
My sweet Dave. I love you so very much. You are and will forever be my person. You made me so happy and although you are not here you will always be in my heart. Always. 
I ordered your ring, exactly like you said you had wanted and will wear it around my neck until we meet again. 
I love you honey. Always","comment 1: I'm sorry for your loss. Thanks for sharing your beautiful love story.
comment 2: My heart hurts for you. I’m so sorry you are going through this. It sounds like you had a very full time  together, filled with so much love. I wish for you both that it could have been longer. Be good to yourself right now in the midst of all this grief. ❤️
comment 3: Thank you. 
He really will forever live in my heart. 
This subreddit helped me a lot. It was never easy being with someone who was so sick.... and at such a young age. He was only 34. 
But I’m so thankful I was able to spend the time I did with him.
comment 4: I'm so sorry for your loss.
comment 5: Sorry to hear that. Peace be to you.

"I suspect my grandmother is developing dementia and need to know how to go about it A few years ago my grandmother was in hospital (aged 88) and because of the medication she was under, she kept showing common tropes of that of a person with dementia (delusion, forgetting peoples names, etc.) and was placed in a ward with patients of the same illness.
She checked out of hospital after about a month and went back to normal every day life. She broke her hip last year and had to be in hospital again for about three months. She behaved the same kind of way she did last time and it took her a few days to fully recognise her house when she finally returned home (for the most part she would only recognise a couple bits of furniture).
She's 91 now and she's aware her memory isn't what it used to be. She'll spend a great deal of time when I visit talking about the exact same things (religion, what she's watching on TV, etc.). I noticed last time I was there she confused me for my brother and kept referring to us by the wrong name. She also told us that she's lived in her house for the last sixty-odd years and raised six children there, as if my brother and I never knew that.
A few months ago she asked to take a picture of my granda and brighten it up in photoshop since she never liked how it came out, and I brought it back a few months ago. Last time I was down at her house with my brother she was convinced it was my brother that had altered the picture and even gave him money for it.
I want to try and visit her as often as I can and I want to know what I can do to when I visit her (how to stay patient when she gets confused, how to keep her on track with the conversation, etc.). I know this may sound insensitive to some people on this sub and I apologise for that, but I don't know where else to go","comment 1: Staying patient is important, and it's easier once you recognize that you can't keep her ""on track"" anymore. Go with the flow, talk about positive things, divert. I worked in a care home and one of the ladies there wanted to talk about her dad's shop (where she helped out as a child) at every possible opportunity. But that topic made her happy and helped her calm down. :) For your grandma, the house and raising kids might be that ""happy spot"". It's not so important that she remembers exactly ""which one"" you are, even though it feels sad of course.

"Guess I shouldn't quit my day job ... or advocate for myself. Yikes. So I (26F) am in the process of selling my father (with dementia)'s house, we have showings scheduled all weekend and are staying in an Airbnb. 
Everything went so harmoniously the first part of our trip. Unnaturally so. My fiance (27M) and I were waiting like there was a ticking time bomb about to go off, knowing SOMETHING would go wrong. He'd overestimate his capacity or lose his temper or all of the above. 
Lo and behold, it happened. Today I am running on four hours of sleep and communicated several times to everyone that I NEED today to rest, I do not feel capable of long car trips or walks and I've had some very emotionally distressing personal things happen in the past 48 hours. 
Of course, this is the day my dad woke up early and made tea and had a lot of energy and desire to be out and about. He gets antsy easily and usually at home, is able to spend time outdoors/work in the garden. (He also isn't great at sensing what his body is realistically capable of doing without hurting himself, which has been an ongoing source of stress) 
He said he wanted to go for a walk. I explained that my fiance or I could go with him, but I personally do not feel up to it, and can't speak for if my fiance does. He was okay with, but not thrilled with, the idea. So my dad said ""well I'll just go by myself"" which led to a whooole discussion about how he might not recall where the Airbnb is, I don't want him getting lost, or losing track of time - there's times he'll be walking around all day without being aware of it. Then he got stuck on this as me taking away his independence, and keeps saying in a loop ""all you want me to do is sit and watch tv"" (which YES, would be so much easier, and usually satistifes him when he realizes he wore himself out) 
He ended up leaving for a walk. We set conditions; if he wasn't back in 30 minutes, my fiance would look for him. Since I was so frustrated, I forgot to make sure he had a mask and the address of the Airbnb. Immediately I realized this, wrote down the address, and had my fiance bring it to him. He had to walk pretty far; apparently he was walking fast - he asked someone if they'd recently ""seen someone who looks just like me"" - they said ""yeah, the guy not wearing a mask?"" :( :( (side note - we live in the Bay Area, where we've had a mask mandate since March, this has been an ongoing source of difficulty for him to remember and comply with consistently)
My dad came back in better spirits not long after, but felt insulted that I needed to make sure he had the address. I had apologized and de-escalated, and was ready to let everything go, then he kept trying to argue with me. So I said ""I'm going to listen to music and work on house stuff and not engage in this conversation anymore"", and stopped. 
I gave him some time before talking to him again and offering to make some tea for us. He accepted and we talked for a few minutes, somehow the subject of me singing came up. He said ""I've never heard you sing"" - HE HAS. I was extremely into choir in high school, I remember singing to him songs in German and Italian that I knew at the time, and played guitar/sang for him too. At the time he was never impressed and would talk about other singers he liked more. But since he insisted, I let him know I had some songs that I wrote available to listen to on Youtube, and agreed to play one (with the caveat that they were like 8-10 years old, I was a teenager, not highly skilled, etc). 
My fiance at least had nice things to say. I noticed it had a lot more views than I remembered when I was younger so that was a boost to my self-esteem! Then my dad says ""don't quit your day job!"" ... I really have been wanting to get back into singing/playing guitar, I stopped due to lack of confidence in myself, I really don't need my art to be insulted by anyone right now, especially not my dad.
I know his distorted perception of reality could very well apply to my singing, and that he never got to be around when I was a child to understand that's not something you ever say to your child, no matter how old they are, when they show you their art. I don't know if he said that to intentionally try to get a rise out of me, or if he really thinks that's an acceptable thing to say.  
My fiance understanably also got upset seeing my own father insult my music (he's a musician too and 100% gets how hard it is) and we all ended up arguing again :( I was able to de-escalate by focusing on the nice things my fiance said to me, and his offer to give me constructive feedback in the future, and by disregarding my dad continually insisting that he did not insult me. 
I just want to have some peace and calm and not have our relationship be so tumultous. The whole reason I'm selling the house is to be able to pay for his care; he definitely needs in-home help, or to be put in a facility (which is our long term goal). I also am going to be stuck financially relying on him as we move to a lower cost of living area; I have PoA so logistically I can handle it, but I am so not looking forward to him dangling that over my head and saying that means he can say or do whatever he wants with no repurcussions.   
I know this is a lot. Does anyone have tips for coping with stressful situations like this, or how to set boundaries that I be treated with respect in a way that doesn't further escalate the situation?","comment 1: Wow, you are trying so hard and doing an amazing job helping your dad! Being a caregiver is the ultimate thankless job and you need to be gentle with yourself. It sounds like you have an amazing partner which will help tremendously. At moments like this step away, take a minute, give yourself a time out, fake a phone call, whatever it takes to buy yourself some breathing time. It’s so hard caring for your parent because you have all the baggage from your relationship that you remember but they probably don’t. I suggest thinking of your father as a whole new person, separate from the father you grew up with. That will help with some of the reactions regarding what he did or didn’t do when you were younger. Finally I suggest agree, don’t argue. If dad says you shouldn’t quit your day job and that you’re a terrible musician just laugh and agree. Remember, his brain is damaged, probably not the best judge of artistic ability. Sending you positive vibes and hope for a quick sale to the house!
comment 2: > how to set boundaries that I be treated with respect in a way that doesn't further escalate the situation?
This doesn’t apply anymore, unfortunately.
Setting limits via reasoning doesn’t work. The reasoning part of him is going.
What you’re left with in terms of strategies is accommodating, redirecting (key!!), and defusing. 
You must never take anything personally. His ability to self-censor is going, you’re going to see more impulsivity. 
Depending on what kind of dementia he’s got you may also see less empathy. With FTD for example, the anterior cingulate (which is implicated in empathy) may be affected. It’s the brain. 
I think you’d benefit quite a bit from reading more deeply about his diagnosis - where I am it’s the alzheimers society that’s the best resource. They also provide guidance on how to respond to dementia-directed behaviours. 
Please don’t take it personally :)
comment 3: This. 🖕🏻I was called the c word and so much more by my previously loving mother who was only there sometimes now.  Reason is gone, they mix memories and reality and you have to understand that it was really not him as he was saying these things.  I know how hard this is and you need to keep going back to remembering that even though it hurts and talk to others for yourself. You have been asking!
comment 4: Well now you're just going to have to post a link so we can give you the warm fuzzies you didn't get from your dad.
Because you're doing an amazing job, and you deserve warm fuzzies. Right, guys?
comment 5: It's so hard to care for a parent when you can't get past a lot of the baggage that comes even in a loving father-daughter relationship. I'm in the same situation with my dad and we have had lots of arguments in the last couple years that left us both with lots of hurt feelings.
But you have to remember that they don't think logically anymore. There is no such thing as establishing boundaries or rules anymore. Dementia does not respect that. You cannot use logic, you cannot argue your way into getting what you need or want. Arguing always, always, always backfires. 
Instead, you have to agree. You have to pretend that they're right. You have to say little white lies to get them to do what you want, while making them think it's their idea in the first place. 
Pretend you don't hear the hurtful things, as hard as that is. It's not ""him"" anymore. I know how hard that is. Is he on any anti-depressants? They have been a huge help with my dad and his moods where he lashes out.
comment 6: Yes he’s on Zoloft, has been on and off for several years. I always feel like there could be something better out there for him and hope he can get better meds once we move and settle in
comment 7: Just say ""That was cruel and I don't talk with cruel people"" and leave.   He didn't need any actual care, there's no reason to be in a conversation with someone who's mean.
Now THAT is boundaries.  You might benefit from reading up on the difference between Guess Culture and Ask Culture people.
comment 8: This is terrible advice.
It won’t work because it’s premised on expecting an irrational person to behave rationally. 
All this would do is set OP up for more pain and disappointment.
comment 9: > It won’t work because it’s premised on expecting an irrational person to behave rationally. 
It does not require rational behavior.  In fact it does not attempt to modify the patient's behavior at all. 
""You're being mean/angry/abusive/cruel/silly, we can talk when you're not mean/angry/abusive/cruel/silly"" is an very accepted method of communicating with irrational patients and keeping yourself from being abused.  However the last part of this does indicate that the patient's behavior must change for future communication.  My post includes none of that at all, because dementia patients aren't capable of future planning or emotional regulation.  
&#x200B;
>All this would do is set OP up for more pain and disappointment. 
Leaving when someone is cruel isn't a bad idea.
comment 10: The labels “cruel” and “mean person” suggest there’s intentionality there, highly doubtful. 
Leaving when upset is ok - although I still think accepting in principle that odd behaviours will occur is more helpful - but why bother making a point of saying anything? All that does is a) upset the person with dementia, and b) reinforce to OP the idea that she’s been hard done by, that there’s cause for resentment.  It nurtures the sense of injury and outrage. When what we should be cultivating is indifference to such “insults”. They don’t mean anything really. 
What we say to even ourselves about things matters
comment 11: Training/forcing one's self to be indifferent to abuse -- and yes, verbal abuse matters -- is bad for mental health.
> The labels “cruel” and “mean person”  
Nowhere did I label anyone as cruel.  I labeled behavior as cruel/mean/etc.  I agree that it's unacceptable to call someone else a mean person -- that's abusive.  When someone is cruel, the first step to dealing with the abuse is identifying it as abuse.  Because it is. 
I'm afraid you're confusing therapeutically identifying worrying behaviors with abusing the person's actual identity.  There is a world of difference between 
""you're weird, u/Pigeonofthesea8, and you're a bad person or you have some weird after-effects from what is probably a history of abuse"" 
vs the more accurate
""you're projecting weird behaviors onto me, u/Pigeonofthesea8, reading weirdly into what I wrote, and advocating that caregivers passively accept abuse.  That can lead to serious mental health issues.  This conversation is not healthy, and I'll only continue it when you are able to read and respond to what I actually post.""
comment 12: >”That was cruel and I don't talk with cruel people""
“Mean person”
Quoting you directly, I am not confused. 
I profoundly disagree with your approach here. 
The way to cope with agitated or dysregulated behaviours is to a) try to anticipate needs and/or redirect them, and to b) frame the kind of comment OP felt hurt about as the expression of a brain affected by disease. 
This is what’s advised by the Alzheimer’s Society and any evidence backed guidance I’ve read.
Literally any other approach applies moralism to a phenomenon that simply cannot be captured by common-sense  morality. 
Some dementia patients get sexually aggressive with staff, how do you describe and account for that? It’s dementia. Absolutely they get a hall pass. 
That is not to suggest staff need to stay and passively accept that kind of behaviour directed towards them. They have other ways of coping, which includes leaving but doesn’t involve calling them leches or worse... 
OP has now identified that her father had been stuck inside. Knowing that this is a possibility, a way to mitigate future behaviour is to schedule walks. Obviously one can’t prevent everything that’s not pro social but that kind of thing can help head some of it off the pass. 
OP again please read evidence backed information on how to cope with dementia.
comment 13: I will say, when I’m at home, this is usually my strategy (I try to do this in the nicest way I can; I’ll say something along the lines of “that wasn’t a very nice thing to say, it sounds like you need some space and I’ll give it to you”). He is the kind of person who really values privacy and alone time and I can tell part of why he was lashing out was from being stuck in close quarters with us for days. 
I try to balance de-sensitizing myself a bit (since this is only going to keep happening and likely will get worse as he progresses) with the understanding that if ANYONE else who doesn’t have dementia ever talked to me this way, I would not want them in my life. I know how he says and acts could be a reflection of how he’s feeling inside and try so hard not to take it personally, but having extended contact like this is a bit much for me. Now that I know I’m going to try to avoid situations like this as much as possible, to keep the peace.

"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond? Hi all,
My dad was diagnosed with MCI (pre-dementia?) early in 2019. Things are going well, but I could use some advice on one set of symptoms: a lack of interest in things he used to enjoy and a generally passive attitude toward physical decline.  
Brief history: He used to go to the gym if not every day, every other day. He was chatty. He walked the dog. He ran errands and loved keeping track of appointments on the house calendar. He worked part-time.
This is pre-2019. Early in the diagnosis there was a period where things were very dire. Suicide attempt, manic episodes, hospitalization. Things have improved incredibly since then and I am so grateful. Now, the only concern is how we (mom and I) should react to the stabilized ""new"" way of life. 
Most of the day he spends watching TV. Whatever's on, pretty much from morning to night. He doesn't like leaving the house. He declines offers to go on walks. He declined the idea of getting an exercise bike. He drinks beer and forgets how many he's had, he forgets to eat. Physically, has rapidly started showing his age and losing muscle mass. Mentally, his long-term memory is stable but his short-term memory (what did you have for lunch?) is gone. He often admits he's just passing time. He has resisted and declined therapy.
Does this sound familiar to anyone? What's the best way to respond? 
One thing I've come to realize as I type is that the ""approach"" so far has been to try and coerce him back to his old way of life: chores, walks, phone calls to friends. This strikes me as very unempathetic and I am embarrassed to admit it. Not surprisingly, it has generated more fights than anything else. 
Ultimately if this lifestyle makes him happy, and he chooses it, I can make myself comfortable. I just don't get the sense that he is happy. I worry he's wasting away on purpose. 
If there are resources you've found helpful or terms I should research I would really appreciate that. Any kind of response is welcome as this is a new and pretty painful dimension of my life right now. Thank you.","comment 1: Like others have said, it sounds very much like depression. I would advise discussing with a doctor.
One thing that you haven't said, or maybe you did and I missed it, was how his memory is. If his short term memory is poor you could try ""tricking"" him into thinking that he is about to do some of his old chores, prompting him to do them.
For example, when he gets up for something you could prep his coat, put the lead on the dog, get your own coat on and say something like ""thanks for getting the dog ready while I got your coat. Come on, let's go for the walk you wanted to go on"". It sounds pretty dastardly, but if it works and he goes out and enjoys himself then there's no harm done.
comment 2: His short-term is very challenged, but I do like that approach. Going with him on the walk may be something I hadn't picked up on--maybe he is more receptive when there is a ""plan""? Will definitely test it out.
comment 3: He does sound depressed. Maybe a change in meds is in order.
My dad too has also gotten to the point where he's happy to hang out in front of the TV for long periods of time. In our case, my dad believes the people in the TV talk to him, so he interacts and converses with them. It helps to think that he is feeling somewhat like he's chatting with friends. He also has a writing pad and pen and he writes down nonsense stuff that he overhears , not sure what he thinks he is doing but he likes it.
I used to want to push him to go out for walks and stuff, but I realized that one of the KEY things for dealing with dementia patients is to never try to coerce them into doing something they don't want to do. It's just a guarantee of conflict and confusion and bad feelings. You can suggest, but if they say no, just drop it and let them be. Arguing will get you nowhere. 
I've stopped feeling guilty if he just wants to sit and spend hours in front of the TV, or just staring out the window. He is drifting off into his own world, as sad as that sounds. It's a world of his memories, and we don't know, maybe they make him happy? We can't understand how their minds work under our logical ways of thinking. What makes us happy may not be what they need.
Good luck!
comment 4: Ah, I think I can see some of my dad in your dad. The image of the writing pad is really poignant. 
What you're saying about coercion is spot on... nowhere is exactly where we've gotten. He isn't too confused yet, more apathetic as others have suggested. So hopefully there is time to meet him where he's at. 
You put it really beautifully in that last line. Thank you for sharing and good luck to you too!
comment 5: There are ways to get them to agree to things if you can somehow make it seem like their idea. Or, literally wait 10 minutes and ask again. I've found that my dad will reflexively respond ""no"" to some questions but when I rephrase or change the subject and come back to the original question he will agree. 
Also, don't be afraid to use little white lies to get what you want. ""Dr. Smith told me that you have to take a bath every other day. Would you like to do it now or wait until after lunch?"". Providing a ""choice"" is another technique that's worked for me.
The key is to remember that it's very important to them to feel they are still in control and making their own decisions.
comment 6: This is not a diagnosis. It seems like he maybe be suffering from mental health concerns beyond MCI or dementia, depression comes to mind.
comment 7: I am so sorry for you!  My mom had similar issues.  First thing, would talk to his primary doctor because this sounds like a further stage of dementia my mom went through.  Memories longer term stay longer, short-term memory goes first.  In addition, personality changes and more withdraw happen in later stages.  Talk to his doctor about all of this because it sounds well beyond MCI.  I am so sorry to be the bearer of potential bad news - I hope you are like I was and just wanted straightforward information from others.  Please update after the talk with his doctor.  One word of advice, he can refuse letting you attend his doctor appointment or phone call, or he can allow you to do so.  I would not tell him your goals, just ask if you can have consent to talk to his doctor, help him update prescriptions, coordinate appointments, etc.  I know this sounds horrible as stated, but it will save you a lot of grief as a caregiver later when needed. 😢
Edits: clarity
comment 8: All good. This is a much better state than he had been in before, so despite my gripes I am quite grateful. I have added ""doctor"" to the top of the list. Fortunately he isn't resistant to medical treatment, just talk therapy. Thank you for sharing your experience.
comment 9: He sounds depressed, and honestly, if I had dementia I would be depressed. Talk to his doctor. Unfortunately, apathy is one of the symptoms of dementia.
You need to find activities that aren't short term memory reliant. My guy likes swimming - well, he likes wading around in waist deep water. Try bowling, or tennis, or basketball, something where you only have to think about what is directly in front of you. Maybe go to a driving range? No math and keeping score - just a basket of balls he can practice his stroke on.
We do board games around the holidays and we had to do a complete overhaul away from strategy games to stuff he would enjoy. We have an electric potato that shocks you when the music stops, giant jenga, and a balancing game with sticks. Fun for all ages and all based in the moment, no or limited strategy. He loves it. He loves being part of the group, the feeling that no one is accommodating him, and the fact he can genuinely win. I should have known that is basically just a quiz game relying on long term memory, he enjoys that as well. 
Hobbies - does he have any old hobbies you can make accessible? Like if you labeled or attached a photo of the contents of every drawer would he resume making lures for fly-fishing, or woodwork, or model making etc.?
Chores - This was a u shaped curve for us? There was an immediate drop off in chores completed. Now there has been a radical escalation out of seemingly nowhere. Now counters are wiped, cans are crushed, sodas are replaced in the fridge, etc. Great! But also, concerningly, he goes around shutting every door he can find, laundry get chucked in the machine without being sorted, dishes get put away in interesting places, and he will not stop turning off lights. He also keeps spreading hand towels out on top of bathroom counters to dry, not sure where that came from. And, oh my god, shredding mail for ""security purposes"". Good lord, I hope no one got a jury duty summons. He is very firmly reiterating his independence and it is not going particularly well.
Food - put out snacks and ready to eat foods front and center. Does he eat apples? Bowl on counter. Will he nuke himself some leftovers? That needs to be in transparent packaging at eye level when he opens the fridge. Stick a bowl of nuts near his seat near the TV.
comment 10: Oh my. I assume the shredder has mysteriously been misplaced now.
comment 11: Ah no, it is now clear to the whole ""house"" apparently that a shredder is vital to the smooth running of the household. So now we also have a backup shredder. For when the first one's safety mechanism forcibly shuts it down for half an hour (due to overheating). No need to wait!
comment 12: He sounds much like my dad. He has always puttered and his thing has always been washing the dishes. Which is great, I have a dishwasher but what the heck, one less thing. He even dries them and puts them away.
Except that I noticed that he doesn't actually use soap, or the sponge when he washes. Many times he'll barely run the dish under the water and then wipe dry. My dish towels are greasy and stained because he just wipes the frying pan instead of using soap. And he forgets where to put things away, so he just makes neat little piles of things on top of the stove. 
I figured it is one of those ""pick your battles"" things, there's no point in taking this chore away from him, it's not that big a deal in the scheme of things. I just re-wash the stuff. It makes him happy and he feels he is contributing to the house somehow.
comment 13: I agree. He has had a great life and objectively still has a lot of faculties. But I imagine the awareness that it's slowly slipping, or isn't quite all there, has to be debilitating.
I love your descriptions of these activities. The potato made me laugh out loud. You've hit some of his favorites that I hadn't considered: driving range was on my list, but an overhaul of games and an exploration of hobbies would be awesome. He still has a lot of his book smarts so trivia is absolutely in. So are model kits from when he was younger, maybe Wii bowling.
I think we're on the early half of the chore U, so for now we'll keep that small. Wishing the best for your guy (and your mail) over the holidays!
comment 14: Thank you and you too!
In what is surely unrelated news, I have noticed a drastic reduction in Christmas cards this year, so it seems my correspondence duties will be minimal. What an unexpected and pleasant surprise! :)
comment 15: My mom had the same process. MCI in 2019, became manic and went to psych hospitals twice, then became depressed for awhile, then got Alzheimer’s diagnosis this year with severe anxiety as her main issue. She isn’t socially active and won’t help herself with any anxiety cognitive therapies or activities, no matter how much we or experts try.
We do short activities and games and try to coerce her into simple chores. Covid makes it worse.
comment 16: Same, until the nursing facility with regular meds (she is doing better there than the last ten years at home).
comment 17: COVID has definitely been a factor. He was a homebody before, but this has cut him off from a lot of his occasional outlets. Not being socially active is something I've worried about for years before the diagnosis. Your description speaks volumes. Unfortunately that dimension seems the least readily addressed--I'm not in touch with many of the people he used to know, and if I were I may not be the person to rekindle those relationships.
I'll be thinking of your mom through this, wishing you luck. If you want to talk feel free to PM.
comment 18: It is possible to suffer from both depression and dementia. It happens more often than we might think, but it's not surprising - anyone would be depressed in your father's situation. Depression in the elderly is undertreated, and it would be worthwhile discussing this with a doctor. There are several medications that might help.
comment 19: Well put. Taking it into account I'm surprised I hadn't considered it more, I think I dropped the ball a bit. When visits or consultations become available this will definitely be part of the conversation--thanks.
comment 20: As others have said, it could be depression. It could be the short term memory loss interfering in his ability to make decisions to go and do things, then executing it. It could also be that being in a strange environment in terrifying. As my mother's disease has progressed, she grew more and more reluctant to leave the house. I finally realized that her ability to process and react to a ""new"" environment was failing - even if the ""new"" environment"" was somewhere she had been thousands of times before.
comment 21: This is a great point. I wouldn't be surprised if that played a role--the forgetting I think is a big hit on his confidence. He doesn't seem to be overtly afraid but the reluctance could come from a number of places, and he could be hiding the fear with indifference. I won't prod him on that and will try to leave that up to the doctor. In the meantime I'll try and be more attentive to see if any of his behaviors mirror what you're describing. Thanks for sharing.
comment 22: Sounds exactly like my dad and he has refused all therapies (physical/speech). We have changed meds but he has stayed the same and has rapidly declined. He is VERY weak. All you can do gently encourage and talk to the Dr. I honestly think my dad wants this to be over with quickly. :( I'm sorry if this wasn't helpful, I'm just sharing my situation. My dad has Alzheimer's with Parkinson's.
comment 23: It is absolutely helpful. If it gets to a point (I think there's still time) where he outright refuses, I imagine it's important to be realistic. If gentle encouragement is all you can do, that's all you can do. 
This is a weird place to be in--caught between ""regular adult doesn't want to do X"" and the cognitive point of no return--but what you've said helps me see where we might be going.  Best of luck to you and your dad in this.
comment 24: I feel like when people have dementia, they tend to avoid activities that are quite complicated. It could be a confidence issue. They don’t feel up to it since there are just too many steps. 
My grandmother is currently on the middle stage of dementia. A few months ago, it was almost impossible to get her out of the house, have a shower, she will make excuses like ; she’s isn’t feeling great today or have a headache.  
I slowly realised what the problem was and have managed to take her to dinner at a restaurant occasionally, walks in the wheelchair ( she can walk but it’s more comfortable for her ) and short shopping trips to the malls and she really enjoys it. The most difficult part is convincing them that they will like it. 
For my gran, before a shower, I will get all her clothes laid out, the towel ready and I walk her through all the steps of getting herself out of her clothes, wrap herself in a towel and walking to the bathroom. I will test the water temperature right before that so it’s at a comfortable range when it hits her skin. She gives up easily at the moment so any discomfort will discourage her. Before we go out for a meal or shopping, I try to get her when she’s in a good mood before even suggesting. You have to make it seem like an easy task for them. 
Hope this helps!
comment 25: I appreciate you describing all of this--particularly your thought process. The attention you paid to her mood is my biggest takeaway. Excuses are absolutely something that we deal with, and seeing you mention it rings a bell. Maybe it is a hidden confidence thing?
I can try breaking it down and looking out for any barriers that might deter him. Hopefully an improvement is in the cards.   
I really admire the level of attention you've put to her, it sounds like she's lucky to have you. Thank you for sharing.
comment 26: Qigong ie ultra-simplified taichi could be a solution. It's not pumping iron but the willingness still has to be there.
I paid top dollar for a Spring Forest course and with the magic of internet, it's free. Look how easy it is for this one exercise:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6HjbMne37Q
Do you think your father would be willing? 
I should get back to qigong too now that I mention it! It's been a while since I practiced it myself! Thanks selfishly for the reminder! 👍🙏🙇‍♂️

"Got mom a Great Calls phone... I purchased my mom a flip phone to replace her 2nd broken smartphone. She wrecks charge ports and this new phone has a charge base.
The problem is, this phone has an emergency services button on the bottom for...you guessed it, emergency situations.
Today was moms first full day with the phone and in 4 hours she has called the line at least 11 times. I say at least because those are just the ones she has hung up on and they call me to verify that she's okay.
It seems like a great service.  They are fast and friendly. 
But, how do I prevent this from happening all day?
Any tips? I'm at work right now and do not have access to the device. So I have. No idea if I can just disable it yet or just cancel the service.
Thanks","comment 1: Get her a landline.
comment 2: Yep. Second this.
comment 3: Jesus...why didn't that even enter my mind. 
Good advice. Thank you.
comment 4: Be careful and make sure that the number is unlisted and has scam alerts activated. My grandmother gets 10x’s the amount of scammer and political calls on the landline than she does on her cell phone. Also, if she’s having problems with the phone, you need to get control over her bank account. You wouldn’t believe how easy it is for scammers to talk the elderly into giving them their banking information and social security number. We’ve had to completely close my grandmother’s accounts and just this week we are looking at whether she’s compromised her account again.
comment 5: Yeah..she gets over 60 calls a day.😐
I did find a way to disable the emergency service button in settings.
I will try to turn it back on once(if) she gets used to the device.
comment 6: My mom literally called this on hers and somehow the number put her call through to 911. Meanwhile—-she was at a rehab after coming out of the hospital so the police showed up at her apartment. The super called me asking what was happening and I told him to tell the police she was not there and was in rehab, and they were like “we have to answer the call; we have to go in”, so they crowbarred their way into her apartment with me on the phone and the super asking “who’s going to pay for this?”
comment 7: Why didnt the landlord go let them in?
comment 8: You’re right. Just fixed that mistake. Said landlord when I meant super. I don’t think he has the keys.
comment 9: Then him and the landlord can fix it, or they need to find the forms online to have the city/town/county/whatever to reimburse them for the damage.
comment 10: Ok gotcha.
comment 11: I had problem with mom constantly overriding the electronic thermostat for the furnace.  I finally put a bandaid over the buttons.  She finally left them alone
comment 12: B-AP is so right, went through this all as well.  My mom was giving $20 tips to grocery cashiers... it is very difficult to get them to relinquish control so would seek help in getting that started.  Offices for the Aging usually have some resources to help.
comment 13: I am so sorry for the 911 calls as well. Really common before my mom started throwing out the phones and alarm buttons, etc. and I moved in.

"[OFFER] Printable Excel spreadsheet for daily medications for all of 2021. For any caregivers / redditors that take multiple medications a day / Redditors worried about elderly parents Howdy! I have been making an excel spreadsheet for my 88y grandma for the last few years. It lists all of her daily medications, details, check boxes to mark times she's taken etc. It's divided by month and by day. Each page includes the day of the week, date, etc.
I think this would be really helpful to anyone who does caregiving or takes a lot of medications and needs help keeping track. It's pretty detailed (grandma is particular).
It's also made to print so you could keep it in a binder or whatever. You can just edit the medications to whatever your needs are. I'll send it over to anyone who's interested free of course! Let me know :)

"I need help, what are my rights as someone who is on ECMO and intubated, but able to communicate during the pandemic. My accessible phone was taken away, my healthcare proxies can't help my communicate my needs now 
my daughter provided me with an accessible phone, I can answer calls using my face, handsfree. i can also decline calls using my face. 
I have never attended even so much as an appointment without my daughters to help me communicate. It's not just a language thing, people just don't understand me, even when I speak English. I ended up on ECMO, because I was complaining of heart pain from 11am to 11pm, and no one believed me until my daughter jumped on a call after visiting hours during a hospital stay, and spoke for me. 
The phone is on a gooseneck stand, attached to the hospital bed. 
I need the phone to face me, so I facial recognition can recognize me 
I don't require ANY help to use this phone, my family has been clear that folks can end calls and move it out of the way IF and WHEN it is in the way. IT HAS NOT BEEN IN THE WAY 

What's happening now: 

The staff kept sedating me and restraining me because they couldn't understand me and thought I was agitated, so my daughters (who are also my healthcare proxies) started jumping on a video call with me, and helped out with communication. The nurses asked my daughters to stay on calls and even called them up, because the staff couldn't understand me. They don't stay on the calls because I end calls and indicate when I need to rest and when I don't need them 
Now I am scared, because they have taken my accessible phone away from me, even though I require no help to use it. All I need is for my phone to be at face/eye level, so I can accept and reject calls and communicate by nodding, shaking head and blinking. THE NURSES KEEP TAKING MY DEVICE OFF THE STAND AND HIDING IT IN TOWELS. 
I walked into the hospital talking, walking, laughing, joking with my caregivers/daughters. I am now left without damage to me Liver, Kidneys, Lungs, Heart. They punctured my lung accidentally a few days ago and don't know how. I have been developing a chest infection afterwards, its been worsening. I don't understand when I tell them my legs or at least one leg and arms need stretching because they hurt, unless my daughters tell them. They tried giving me Fentanyl for leg aches. 
I don't want to be sedated all the time, I am scared without my family. I have not been allowed to speak to them, I tried to tell the nurses I want my phone and they won't let me have it 

What are my rights? Under the law I am classed as disabled because of my heart condition. I want my daughters to help me communicate, the hospital has banned in person visits, but now they are trying to ban my phone communication with my daughters who are my caregivers and healthcare proxies. Note: My daughter has typed out this message, I have approved every word.","comment 1: I would check with the Disabilities Dept (DDA or MOD) in your state.  Provisions were put in place by most states that folks with existing disabilities that need the help of a caregiver/family member for their communication during hospital stays would have access to them at all times.
comment 2: Thank you for this, I'm going to look for such a dept in MA
comment 3: Where are you? Country/state/city?
comment 4: I am in the USA, Boston, MA
comment 5: Find out if the hospital has a patient advocate. They can be your first step in addressing these kinds of issues. 
The next step would be filing grievance, there should be something about this process on patient rights and responsibilities paperwork, or possibly on a sign in the room (behind the door perhaps). 
As always, consulting with a lawyer is an option. Consults are usually free, so take that into consideration.
comment 6: Daughter here; for my father, who passed away just a few months ago, because he was without us (his caregivers and healthcare proxies), I tried every route, including the patient advocate, but the pandemic is a weird place to be, because not only the patient advocate, but the chaplain, the nursing director, and ethics would not help or advocate for us.
comment 7: if you ran into the same problems with your father is there perhaps another hospital in the same network you could contact to see about transferring your mother to?
comment 8: The problem is that this IS a different top ranking hospital. Its really terrible, but I think every hospital is the same around here. It's a repeat of the same events and conversations.
comment 9: I don't have any advice, but I wanted to validate your experience. I don't know which top hospital you're at in Boston, but I can confirm that often these top-ranked hospitals have extreme arrogance that accompanies their position. Often smaller but affiliated hospitals seem to have much more compassion and empathy. I know this doesn't help with your current situation, but I wanted you to know you're not alone in being mistreated by a so-called top hospital. It's terrible.
comment 10: Daughter here, its hard to find folks that understood and know this situation, appreciate you sharing.  Arrogance is an understatement, we were literally in a meeting with them, during which they told us that we should not be asking questions about the healthcare provided.
comment 11: This is hell. I think at this point, it sounds like you need to call a disability rights lawyer and/or your local government rep. The regular channels are clearly failing. I'm so sorry.
comment 12: Daughter here, I wish lawyers were able to help, but they can't, its the pandemic and they usually help when things have already gone bad and you've lost something, and I don't want to lose my mother.
comment 13: Get your lawyer involved.  Hospital should allow at least one caregiver/family member at a time. Hospital where my mom was (we have her home now) in FL was good and respectful that way.  Also have your daughters (whoever is POA) go directly to the CEO and General Counsel with a list of what you want, why and staff responses.  Know what you're willing to give into and what is a must before going to them. 
This should show you mean business.
comment 14: Lawyers are no help at the moment.  I always thought I could do that, but I've been proven wrong.  I don't know how to get my state rep involved in an immediate way.  I am glad that your hospital in FL was respectful.  I am literally listening to nurses sedating my mum because they don't want to suction her and she is keeping them busier than last week.  It's so weird, because its 1:1 care.  I hate this.
comment 15: I would start calling risk management. I’ve never seen an on-call dentist but my dude replaced my step-fathers lost dentures after doing two hospital / house calls during a pandemic.
comment 16: We had a meeting, where risk management basically told us not to ask questions...

"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System? Hello,
First time posting here.  
My dad is 81 and has light/moderate dementia.  He is okay as far as long term memories, and still knows me, my brother and my mom, who all live with him.  He can take care of himself with most things and is fairly independent as far as showering, using the restroom, etc. Though he doesn't cook for himself, drive, etc.
We live in safe neighborhood with minimal traffic and our street goes in a loop.  My dad often gets bored and goes on walks.  Our house has 6 sliding doors and a front door so he will leave without us noticing or sometimes he will be in the backyard and then he will decide to go on a walk. We aren't necessarily worried about him getting lost as of now, however, the issue is he never lets us know that he is going for a walk. 
We know as his condition worsens, this will be more of an issue.  Locking all the doors or constant monitoring will likely be what we need to do down the line.. But for now, we just want a way to be notified when he leaves the house so we can know when he left and stop him if needed, accompany him, etc.  
He has a Verizon Care Smart watch
https://www.verizon.com/connected-smartwatches/verizon-care-smart/?cmp=KNC-C-HQ-PRO-R-BP-NONE-NONE-2K0PX0-PX-GAW-71700000073797633&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2af-BRDzARIsAIVQUOeGEAjXP4WZpkNzzOSvHv7Zbi9Yy6y8NiuCMC8Q-tVrCtcENIU00HcaAtKwEALw_wcB
But it really doesn't do a good job of sending notices. More over, even though Verizon is by far the best cellular network for where we live, on a device this small the signal is very weak and drops out often.  
Anyone have any suggestions or thoughts on these products?

https://www.alzstore.com/gps-tracker-watch-elderly-p/0950.htm
One more note: I realize there a some tracking devices that are not watches but still wearable.  Unfortunately, anything that isn't wristband or watch is unlikely to stay on him.  Especially if he wakes up early, dresses himself and leaves the house. 
Thank You","comment 1: I have no expertise on tech. I do know that my local police dept. keeps files on ""wanderers"" (read: people with dementia/schizophrenia/bipolar/developmental disorders). You should call or drop by during normal business hours and see if yours does. Ours asks for photos, description of identifying marks, descriptions/licenses of car/bikes/motorcycles, and any local past workplaces or favorite haunts. If your Dad goes missing one day, and you call the police letting them know he is missing - you cut out at least an hour of delay of sending photos and possible routes to the people who will be searching for him. You can also list yourself and your cell as family so if the cops independently find a confused senior before you guys even know he is missing - they know who to call.
If you younger folk move out - call the police dept and see they have the ""are you okay"" program. It's a phone call that auto-calls seniors every day at a preset time. If no one picks up, it notifies the cops who drop by to see what is up. Most times it's just an accident, grandma didn't make it to the phone or is feeling lonely. Cops love talking and having a coffee or cookie with grandma or grandpa, a wonderful positive interaction during their day. And if grandma falls and grandpa is not with it enough to call 911, it can save a life.
When it comes to tech I find it's a mixed bag. Mine carries a cell but he can't figure out how to answer calls, only place them. I usually just leave a message as it is non urgent. He's okay with a fitbit. Anything new would be immediately discarded. Is it likely yours would wear it?
comment 2: >iors every day at a preset time. If no one picks up, it notifies the cops who drop by to see what is up.

Thanks for advice.  As far as wearing new tech: If we remind him to put it on, yes, he will keep it on.
comment 3: Sorry friend you need a locksmith. My grandma walked out the door, dragged her feet until bloody through rocks, then across the road and hugged a frightened neighbor. We all had to quarantine because of it. If he can't remember to tell you he's leaving, can he remember to socially distance and mask up when walking past a pedestrian? Not a risk I'm willing to take. 
I had to get every door and window locked. Now she threatens to smash the windows but hasn't gotten that far.
comment 4: Sorry, that's rough.  Thankfully, he hasn't gotten aggressive like that ever.  And he is not at he point of harming himself.  He can still care for himself.  Its just a matter of him forgetting to let us know he left for a walk.  For example:  he will be in backyard, walk around a bit and then go to front yard and start walking around the neighborhood without letting us know. 
At some point it may be 24 hour care, locking doors, etc.  But until we get to that point, just wanted a way to be aware when he leaves the house without getting into alarm systems and locks (yet).  As far as covid, yes, these days that's a concern. So we would either walk with him so we can make sure he is social distancing or remind him to just walk around backyard and keep an eye on him.  
Some sort of perimeter alert would help but systems I've seen haven't been ideal. 
Thanks

"inpatient care housing coverage Hello! I'm not sure if this would really be the right forum to post this, so I apologize and mods please feel free to delete this if you find it inappropriate.
I'm 20 and know almost nothing about insurance. I've tried reading through insurance handbooks and coverage plans but are having a hard time understanding it, and I've also chatted with my aunt who was a nurse for 40-odd years and worked in hospices a lot and the things she tells me about insurance are things you can't find unless you find out through first-hand experience. So, I figured I'd take to talking to real people.
I'm gonna get wordy, as I'm not sure what details matter or not so please bare with me!
The situation is that I have a sister (23), who is heavily disabled. She cannot see, talk, or walk. She has brain damage from a viral infection contracted during childbirth from my mother's herpes. I do not know all of her exact diagnoses, but I believe she has (on paper) cerebral palsy, and epilepsy. I'm sure more that I'm unaware of. She is on one liquid medication taken twice daily for her seizures, I don't know the name of it. She also has a suppository on stand-by to be taken when she has her seizures. Unsure if it matters, but her seizures aren't very frequent and usually happen while she's asleep (there's been maybe total 4 times where she's been awake that it's happened, and that's been during times she got overheated). She can't do much for herself, she uses diapers, is in a wheelchair, has to be picked up to be moved, and needs food prepared for her. She can use a spoon and feed herself though.
Currently, she resides in AL with my mother while I am in CO. My mother, without getting into detail, has progressively become less and less of a fit guardian for my sister, and since i moved out 3 years ago and are no longer there to pick up the slack I am looking into options. I do not have the time or money to care for her myself, so I wanted to look into sueing for custody of her and then putting her into a home until I finish college, and have a good job to take proper care of her with an in-home nurse. (which will be around 8-10 years, as I'm going into medicine). Though, I am open to avoiding the sueing and talking with my mother about other options and keeping my sister nearby her, and custody in the hands of my mother, as they are close, and it would just be easier on me. The only way I can go a more cival route with my mother though is if I have everything worked out and squared away myself, and with the people I'd need to talk to before going to her, so, I'd still need to figure all this out myself.
Inpatient care though, as I'm sure you're all aware, is horribly expensive. And has a track record of being atrocious to patients, especially those who can't stand up for themselves like my sister. My aunt told me that she needs 3 dianoses (unsure which, she didn't elaborate), and then approval to be taken in by a home where they will take her diability check (which is around $800, I believe), besides $30 that the family will get to cover general expenses for my sister.
I basically wanted to just ask how true that is, if anyone here knows any more information about it, how to find a good home, any cheats to get better coverage, or better insurances for this type of situation that she would qualify for, and if there is a state that would be better for her. She could stay in AL, CO, or OR (as I'm moving there for my masters). Or just anything you think would be helpful or important to know. I'm unsure if it matters, but I make around 11k/yr, usually around 18k/yr but with COVID I've been on unemployment this year. My mother makes around 30k/yr I believe, and my sister is claimed as a dependent for her, however my mom has also been on/off jobless and homeless, so I'm unsure how accurate that is. 30k is honestly the highest point in what I predict she makes.
I'm going to ask other forums that might be better for some other information in this post, so just answer what you're comfortable with. Sorry it's a bit broad, and anything helps. Honestly if you even just have a story of you dealing with a simular situation just so I feel less alone in it that'd be welcome too, haha.","comment 1: I strongly recommend you ask in /r/legaladvice you are traversing law, welfare and multiple state lines. I suspect the best answer will depend on how amenable to this change your mother is. While law and social work will be involved law might be more of a factor if she doesn’t agree. Good luck. You are a Saint. As a mother and somewhat young person I just want to say you are biting off too much. I would never wish caregiving on anyone and frankly you are sacrificing your life... time, energy, and ability to spend what little you have left on anything other than your sister or school. You matter & you weren’t put on this world to be your sisters keeper.
comment 2: Thank you! When if it comes to having to sue her ill be sure to do that. Im pretty new to reddit, so knowing forumns that are trusted is nice.
You are very sweet, honestly the first time someones told me that and it felt genuine. Sometimes i feel so awful for what i dont do for my sister, but hearing things like this really help me feel less bad and realize theres more options for me than working towards this one thing haha. 
Thank you, really. I wish you the best.
comment 3: Wow. Are you dead set on this course of action, or still in the research and development stage? What led you to this decision, when most would turn a blind eye if and when possible? What a blessing to have a sister like you who is willing to spend what little resources she has on protecting a sibling who is not able to protect herself. An angel among humans, you are.
Don't answer if you're not comfortable, but on what basis would you sue for  custody? How is your mom a less than sufficient guardian? Sorry I'm all questions and no answers, just wanted to give my two cents and let you know you are heard
comment 4: Youre very sweet, thank you. I dont mind questions. 
I am pretty dead set, but i dont want to do anything until I know I can keep her safe and continue to pay for everything she needs, not to mention know where I'm going to live as my education is going to require me to move to Oregon in about 4 years. 
The basis i would sue for custody is if i had the resources, if my mother was 100% unwilling to compromise and/or isnt speaking to me anymore, and continues on the road shes going. I think this has a pretty slim chance of happening, though. Like i mentioned in my post if i had literally everything squared away and she wouldnt have to do anything, i think itd be fine. Even moreso if i could keep my sister in alabama. 
My mother has had a lot of issues with substance abuse in the past, and its been getting steadily worse since she and her long term boyfriend split in 2016. Shes coping the way she knows best, things havent been easy on her but shes not the nicest to her children. Shes quick to being a bit violent when frustrated, not dangerously so but any amount i dont like. Its fine when its me, not so much when its my sister, for obvious reasons. I hear from my grandmother though that shes become a lot more gentle with my sister since i moved, which is good to hear. 
However her living situation hasnt been consistent since the split up, we have bounced between homes and living with my grandmother on/off whenever we couldnt find anywhere else to go, and i worry about the day my mother cant figure something out and is actually homeless. she also has a tendancy to neglect my sisters personal hygiene (bathing, brushing teeth, ect) a lot more, and now that shes working my sister can go upwards of 9ish hours without having her diaper changed (my moms now boyfriend cares for her, and is very sweet with her but my mother wont let him change her. Worried about it being sexual, god knows why. Hes not like that and my sisters in no position to consent nor be looked at in that light) Its moreso a case of will my mothers actions get her killed or jailed for an extended amount of time / get my sister taken from her in general, and can i avoid that before it happens because waiting till it does will be more difficult to fix. 
I know though that my sister is in greater spirits since getting out of school / since i moved, and i dont think she really notices the neglect. Doesnt make it right, but it does make the situation for me at least not need to be done asap. Its a complicated situation im not happy with, but its the best i can do at the moment. If i had my way id just buy my mom house and a personal nurse for my sister, then i wouldnt have to worry about what things my mom does in her free time affecting my sister while not having to split them up as im sure my sisters the last thing keeping her from going completely off the rails. My mother loves her dearly, and isnt an awful person. Shes just a bit difficult, and doesnt have the resources that would help both her and my sister. 
Also! Id be her brother, not sister :-)

"Keeping track of the day Hi. A family member of mine has early dementia and has a lot of trouble keeping track of the day. He’s still able to work and function but something that hinders this is he has trouble keeping track of the day. Every day we call him to make sure he knows to go to work and we have short arguments about the day. A calendar is too confusing to him. Even checking off the boxes is too big of a task. 
I’m thinking of developing an LED calendar that shows today’s date and doesn’t have any room for interpretation. He needs very simple instructions like:
“Today’s date is Sunday November 29th. 
You work at 11 AM
It is currently 9 AM”
He should be able to press a button to see tomorrow as well, so he knows what time he has to wake up if he has to work. 
Thoughts? This may need to have two versions. One audible and one text. He has trouble reading sometimes.","comment 1: I found with my mom, once her concept of time was gone, it only made her angry to remind her of it.
comment 2: [deleted]
comment 3: I found with my mom, the more I could free up the need to make decisions, the more temporal ability she had available. My solution was eliminate multiple choices and make them 2 part. This gave her the freedom to choose without it becoming overwhelming. Hopefully this helps. She had vascular dementia, concentrated in the prefrontal cortex.
comment 4: He might be helped by a dementia day cycle clock or calendar day clock- available on amazon
comment 5: [deleted]
comment 6: We eventually got one for my dad who couldn't tell if it was 8am or 8pm, whether it was dark out or not.  He would go to bed at 6 pm and sleep 2 hours and see that it was 8, so he'd get up and try to eat breakfast.  The ""clock"" we got only said ""now it is Thursday morning"" or ""now it is Thursday afternoon"" etc and you can set it for however long you want it to say night or morning etc.  It worked for a while.  It's funny how he wouldn't believe us when we said it was still nighttime, but he'd believe the clock.
comment 7: We're slowly approaching that territory, too. Thanks for sharing your experience. You don't know how much it helps. We feel entirely alone in this and even others talking about their story and not offering advice helps immensely.
comment 8: Smart devices like Amazon Echo (Alexa), Google Home, etc, can be set with Reminders like “Time to leave for work.” An internet or Amazon search of “dementia clock” gives variations of a picture frame clock that sits on a table or hangs on a wall, with a large display my mom with dementia can read (for now): MONDAY  Aftermoon  3:35 PM  November 30, 2020.

"Do any of you use and recommend an at-home fall detection/medical alert device? Apologies if this has been posted, I am having a hard time finding any real person reviews on these devices :(
I am comparing brands such as Bay Alarm Medical, Medical Guardian, and MobileHelp. They all basically charge $20-30 for basic at home services where the user can press a button on her bracelet or necklace to call for help. I am unable to really understand if these companies are reputable. They seem more interested in making sales. I am looking to make my grandma safer. Thanks in advance for your advice","comment 1: I did similar research a couple of years ago and ended up with a company called “Great Call.”  I went with them because their device has fall protection and I can track her on my phone. They will also call me if they are unable to reach my mom if they detect a fall.  We know the fall alert works because the device got caught in her sweater and went flying as she was changing her clothes. They have great customer service, her old device wasn’t holding a charge anymore so they shipped out a new device free of charge.  I think I pay about $35 for the monitoring and I feel that it is money well spent for peace of mind. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions.

comment 3: My mother had the one made by Phillip's. It works great, both when detecting a fall or just pressing the button. She rarely goes outside, but as luck would have it, once she did, and fell. It was out of range and didnr detect. I would say it works like a charm but you have to teat it for range, and there seems to be some kind of dongle nor attachment you can purchase sep as rarely to enhance range if you need it and I wish I had done it, however I am here with her now and she only needs to use it if I go grocery shopping.
comment 4: thank you!
comment 5: You're welcome, and sorry for the many errors in my poat.
comment 6: Whoops. need to put my glasses on.
comment 7: Liberty is the one we use, but that is because my husband is a vet and we get it free.  They have been fantastic, and I don't think they charge much.  I do know that when I press the button to test it, they immediately come on and call me by name (I am on the account) and make sure everything is okay.
They also sent out a replacement free of charge, and we have it set up so that they call me first, if they can't reach me they call my son, and then the police

Advice for recovering stroke patient that likes to wander at night I’ve mentioned previously that my boyfriend had a stroke back in August. Recently he’s taken up wanting to go for walks in the neighborhood late at night. It’s happened a few times when everyone has been asleep and once while I was at work. I actually had to use the phone tracking app we have to find him the last time. I went and picked up at a gas station two miles away from the house. Any suggestions how to handle this behavior?,"comment 1: You're lucky he took his phone that time! Are there baby-proof systems you can put on the doors to notify you when they door gets opened? I don't know specific names but I have seen people talk about that here.
comment 2: I can definitely look in to those.
And yes I was happy he had his phone with him. He somehow got it in his head to go to that gas station because of an old routine. Back before I got my car a coworker would drop me off there and he’d pick me up there in his truck.
comment 3: That must be really tough to be dealing with all this. You seem to be doing a great job so far... This community is great for resources.
comment 4: Look into Project Lifesaver. It’s in many communities globally and it’s wonderful. They can track someone who wanders. It’s often free because police/sheriff departments find it cheaper to find a person this way than do a full search and rescue.
I also have an alarm system on my exterior doors. I turn it on overnight, but I can also have it chime or announce when any door is opened.
Definitely hide car keys. Sometimes simple slide- or hook & eye locks can make a difference. The person might not be looking for those and simply turn around when the door doesn’t open the normal way.
Good luck!!

"Tracking device Canada I’m sorry if this has already been asked a bunch but I couldn’t find anything helpful. My grandmother now has severe dementia and often wanders off on her own to buy groceries and then gets lost. I need some way of tracking her so if she does I can find her, for example a device that I can put in her purse or something. Do you guys have any advice? 
I live in Ontario, Canada if that helps at all.","comment 1: Your local police department/Alzheimer’s society should have a program that comes with a GPS bracelet (in York Region it’s called Project Lifesaver through the York Regional Police). It can be costly but worth it!
comment 2: Check with a local search and rescue team, they might have sponsorship to set her up for free on Project Lifesaver.
comment 3: Tiles? Look on Amazon. I’m getting my mom some for Christmas for her keys, wallet, phone, iPad. Also if she carries any devices around you can do find my friends and track her. You could put a tile on a bracket and ask her not to remove it. But I realize she might.
comment 4: I’ll look into it. Thanks!
comment 5: Trackers like Tile, Chipolo, Cube, TrackR, etc, work while connected to a mobile phone or tablet. I can track my mom’s car keys, but only if her phone is charged and Bluetooth connected. A person with dementia will eventually lose the ability to keep a charged phone with them. Then you’ll need a GPS locator, which requires a monthly/yearly subscription. They can track continuously (typically more expensive) or set intervals every so many minutes. You’re still depending on the person with dementia to wear or carry it with them. Even if the tracker is  in a purse, you’re counting on them to always remember their purse.
comment 6: Righto yeah at the moment she always has her purse with her and we are looking into getting some sort of care for her if things progress to worsen but just looking for something in the meantime. Thanks for the advice!

"Caring for my mother with dementia. Mending the broken pieces 
In the Summer of 2014 my mother was diagnosed with Dementia. At that time she was 63 and living with my grandmother in Southern California. Later that year, my sister and I made the decision to bring her out to Colorado to live with me, until her death in Spring of 2019. I find myself today, almost 7 years since her diagnosis, at a loss, unable to grasp who she was, or what she really meant to me. I have become completely numb, totally incapable of love. Not knowing how to feel things anymore. I’m never particularly happy, never particularly sad. Everything is just grey. Recent events in my life have finally put large cracks in the dam holding back all the emotions I have been harboring, throughout the years. 
Knowing what I was about to face, writing this story, was always the plan. Somehow I knew it’s exactly what I needed to find myself again. 
This is the sorry about her and what I experienced, as I start to peel back the layers, understanding them and finally taking the time feel them. 
To begin this story, I must capture the essence of her and the relationship we had. I was born into this world by an extraordinary woman, not only was she a God fearing moral person, she was the person that always protected me. She never deceived me. In times of confusion, she would always steer me down the right path. She was mother, she was my rock! I don’t think I can recall a time she ever yelled at me in anger. Don’t get me wrong, I did get yelled at as a kid, No! David was the most common phrase in my house growing up. It was never out of anger tho, only frustration from what I had just done, or was about to do. 
I was a handful, always into something. Turn you head for a second and I was taking something apart, climbing up on the kitchen countertop or being a ham, performing a circus act in the hallway. I was a tornado of discovery, driven by an active imagination, with enough energy to fuel a power plant. How she survived, the trials and tribulations I put her through, I will never know. All that I know is that she did it with grace. She completely knew me, inside and out and had this peaceful way to guide me. I was born with a very strong will, she must have learned early on, the only way to lead me was by example. It was always the why and never the how. What it took for her to always remain loving and clam, in the midst of the chaos, I would create. This is what makes her the most extraordinary person I have ever known. 
What it truly feels like to be loved by your mother, is the love you can see on her eyes the second you walk into the room. Time completely stops and all you can feel is love she has for you. This is how my mother loved me. 
THE FIRST YEAR 
I’ll never forget the moment I decided she was coming to live with me. We were on a family vacation in Hawaii and I stopped by her room to check on her. She was washing her contact lenses in the the sink. She already had one in her eye while washing the other vigorously under the running water. Looking at me with a puffy red, squinted eye she said, “honey, this really burns”. She was washing the contact lens in the tap water of the sink. She must have been in there for a half hour, repeating the same process. Moving her away from the sink, I grabbed a hand towel and ran it under some warm water. Calmly placing it over her eyes, I reassured her everything was going to be ok. We then headed to the eye doc for a last minute eye exam. We got her pair of glasses, some pain relief eye drops and were on our way. 
Seeing my mother in panic of pain and her not knowing how to stop it, was the moment reality set in. It was very similar to the “loosing cabin pressure” sene in Fight Club. That moment I knew it was my job to take over. A week later, she came out to Colorado. 
Oh man did my mom love Elvis, our vacation in Hawaii was epic. We saw a Elvis impersonator and she thought he was the real deal. It was like a time warp back to the 60’s for her. Singing and dancing the whole time, she couldn’t sit still. After the show she got to meet him, we took some pictures for her and he gave her his scarf. Just before we left he gave her a kiss on the cheek. She was completely glowing the rest of the trip. The scarf he gave her was wrapped around her neck or on her wrist the rest of the year. I must have washed that thing a thousand times. 
I tried to make everything about Elvis when we got home. Picked up a giant diner statue at a swap meet and tons of Vinyl records. Elvis was playing regularly around the house this year. There’s a 50’s diner close to my house, where we would have breakfast a couple times a week. She always had the same thing, strawberry french toast with scrambled eggs and a strawberry milkshake. 
I remember being very ambitious that year, I was on a mission to find a solution that will slow the progression of her disease. We went to doctor after doctor trying to get a solid plan of attack. Her insurance was still a California HMO plan the and was nothing but thorn in my side. Every doctor had a different opinion and they all seemed scared of their own shadows. They were all unwilling to try alternative medications or treatments I found in Europe. After countless visits in multiple practices we found a young doctor willing to try something new. He had a let’s give it a try and see attitude. This was a breath of fresh air and I started to get my hopes up again. Two weeks later he left the practice and we couldn’t see him anymore. We had to start all over again, that was a very depressing moment, I started smoking again that day. 
I was on a job site talking about my mom with a client and she turned me on to a article about Peter Falk. Apparently Peter developed early onset dementia after a dental visit and died soon after. Knowing my mom suffered from periodontal disease her whole life, I scheduled a dental check up for her the next day. 
The appointment a the dental office went very well. The staff was amazing, I was able to stay by her side the entire time keeping her calm and making her laugh as a means of being distraction. After a panoramic X-ray, the doctor had a ton of questions. I remember the doctor thinking she had been in a horrific car accident or something. The X-rays looked like a scene from a science fiction horror movie, screws and wires everywhere. 
My mom had a cosmetic surgery to correct a overbite just a year before. I didn’t know how extensive it really was until that day. They also had her on a daily dose of Benadryl for almost a year. With the connections to Benadryl and dementia, I found during a previous hunt. I convinced myself, that’s exactly what’s to blame. I told myself this countless times and started to become angry. 
Chain smoking a pack of cigarettes later, I realized I had created a false hope. When that hope was crushed, I just started to blame. After some deep soul searching, I remembered what I was taught growing up. My mother taught me, nothing is to be gained from anger but a battle fueled by rage. The only thing you can hope to accomplish with that mindset is, annihilation. Battles are won though compassion and understanding. She would have told me, “Life’s a crap shoot, there are no guarantees for anyone, just make the best with what you have and move forward.”
She had another had saying, “when the going gets tough, the tough get going.” That I never really grasped it until that moment. My outlook on the situation completely changed and it only became about making the best of it. Nobody is to blame, it just is. If she’s happy and safe, that’s all that matters.
Getting back to this mindset is exactly what I needed to be reminded of today. 
Sometimes life beats me down and I loose site of who I am. 
Mom and I were starting to get a routine going then. It took a couple weeks to figure it out. 7am is breakfast. She likes to have a cheese omelet with a slice of toast most days. I can usually sneak in a protein shake, if she’s hungry enough to eat the whole omelet. The nanny comes at 8:30 to give her a bath and hang out for a couple hours. That usually lasts until 10. I’d head out to work until 1 and usually come back to mom in her room changing clothes. She’ll put on everything in her closet clean or dirty. It’s very hard to keep track of the clean clothes vs the dirty ones. It’s ok for now I’ll just do laundry every day, she has fun playing dress up, I thought to myself. We usually head out to lunch around 2. There’s a local bar/restaurant that know us well. We always sit in the same spot and she always gets the same food grilled cheese and a Heineken. We hang out for about 45min while I control the music form an app in my phone. She had no idea I’m doing this and gets surprised every time Elvis comes on. We make it back to the house, walk around the half block to see the Horses, she calls them the big dogs and finish the day with Friends on TV until she’s ready for bed. It’s one of her Favorites and will keep her calm if she has a beer in her hand. This routine stays relatively consistent the whole year. 
I start to notice little bits of her cognitive function disappearing, she looses about 10 words each week. This is pretty hard to watch unfold. Conversations started with complete sentences and her, mostly aware of her surroundings. Now she just has a few little phrases to describe everything and no idea where she is. I first started to pay close attention to the decline when we were brushing our teeth in the main bathroom together. I handed her a toothbrush with some paste on it. I always make a quick joke. This time it was, now this isn’t for your nose. That one always made her laugh. This time she didn’t, she instead smeared the paste all over her face. Looking at her completely confused, it felt like my heart hit the floor. It took everting I had to keep it together. I called her a silly goose and said, that’s not supposed to go there, as I washed her face with a towel. I was completely overwhelmed by sadness. I smoked a couple cigarettes in the garage and continued on with the day. That was the first year. 
I’ll post more in the comments as I write about it.","comment 1: I was full-time caregiver for my mother with dementia. I gave her a pair of undies to put on. She brought them to me and said that they were wet, which they were not. I kept reassuring her they were dry, to no avail. Eventually I heated them up in the microwave for a few seconds and gave them back to her. She was thrilled and put them on. Then she brought me every pair of undies from her drawer and wanted them all put in the microwave.
comment 2: Those light hearted moments are the good ones. My mom was like a raccoon and picked up anything shiny. She had a giant collection of random shiny stuff in her dresser she would wear as jewelry.
comment 3: Yes, please write more!! Please! This is amazing. You are amazing. I'm going through this right now with my mother. My husband and I just moved back home to live with her this spring so I could take care of her. She has some kind of dementia, we're unsure of the type at the moment. Oh boy, can I ever relate to everything you've written here. You are a beautiful writer, and I can't wait to read more!
comment 4: I definitely will keep writing. Hopefully I can give some insight and little tricks I learned along the way. Keep your head up!
comment 5: There’s a Facebook page called Mending the broken pieces where I was originally documenting stuff. I just reactivated it. Maybe you can find some helpful stuff on there.
comment 6: I feel for you. I lost my mother the same way, only she lost the ability to speak after about a year. At one point she called me and said she couldn’t find Dad. I lived about 50 miles away, so I asked her if anyone was with her. She said ‘yes’ so I asked if I could speak to that person. She handed him the phone and of course it was Dad. He took care of her the best he could but eventually had to put her in a nursing home. It was heartbreaking for all of us.
I’m so glad you were able to take care of your Mom and it sounds like you were awesome. So loving and caring, trying your best to make sure she was secure and loved. What a wonderful gift of love.
comment 7: 50 miles is 80.47 km
comment 8: Thank you so much for this. I’m losing my mother to this disease currently, and this speaks to me so deeply. Please keep writing.
comment 9: I definitely will! Keep your head up. You’re fighting the good fight.
comment 10: This is such a wonderfully compassionate & honest retelling of your combined story. My heart goes out to you, & I can't begin to tell you how much of it resonates with my experience. Please, continue writing & I'll gratefully keep reading! Sending hugs across the interwebs. Xo
comment 11: Many thanks! Sending hugs your way too!
comment 12: The second year
The routine for this year stays about the same. As she losses the ability to communicate she becomes angry more often. Around 5pm every night, she paces the house yelling and screaming for about an hour until she finally makes way to her room. The feeling of being totally helpless in this situation wears on you. I tried everything possible to calm her down, my usual shenanigans or calm voice don’t work during these episodes. You just have to let it run it’s course and try your best to ignore it. If you get upset or try to stop it. She instantly shifts to complete sadness, full of tears. This very heart breaking to experience. Being completely helpless is one of the worst feelings ever. 
Work out gloves are the norm, she wears them everywhere. They seem to serve as a mental block. If she doesn’t have them she’ll obsessively look at her hands with confusion and sadness. I assume her mind was trapped in a time where she was younger. The appearance of her hands seem foreign. 
Simple stuff started to become too complicated for her to do on her own. The daily dress up was starting frustrate her. Shirts are on inside out or half worn upside down. There was a morning where she came to me in tears saying, “this doesn’t go, this doesn’t go”. She couldn’t figure out what pants to wear. 
I turned her sadness around by saying. “It’s ok mom, that’s just a stupid one,  we’ll go get a good one.”  Phrasing is simple now she understands, anything negative as “stupid” and anything positive as “a good one.” 
We hopped in the car and headed to the Mart of Walls. I grabbed 10 pairs of soft sweat pants and 10 hooded sweatshirts in the smallest size they had. Knowing small wasn’t going to be small enough, we went directly to the seamstress down the street. That lady was awesome! I paid a little extra, she had them sized perfectly and ready for pick up in a couple hours. When we got home, I cleaned out her closet and removed all the old clothes. My theory was, too many choices are causing confusion, she then gets very frustrated. The clothes she has now, all look the same and are the colors she likes. 5 blue  hoodies, 5 purple ones and 10 pairs of grey pants. Pants folded neatly in the dresser and tops hanging on the rack, purple on the left and blue on the right. I had the nanny give her a bath and left her alone in her room. She came out 20 minutes later completely dressed, with a smile on her face, pointing at her clothes saying, “this is a good one.” This was a small victory.  
Looking back on things, I should have done this the first day, it would have saved tons of stress. What I thought was fun daily dress up, keeping her mind occupied, was really just a game of confusion. 
That was the second year.
comment 13: Wow. What a special experience, and a triumph for you for once to have been able to fix it, and cure what ailed her. You know, many people would have been too busy, distracted, self absorbed, tired, burnt out, lazy, too something to have even thought to do that -replace her entire wardrobe - let alone actually go through with it. That is absolutely amazing and so kind. She really raised you right
comment 14: It just seemed logical to me.
comment 15: I'm here for part 3 if you still want to share
comment 16: Still working on it. Hopefully here soon.
comment 17: The 3rd year. 
The dementia seemed to rapidly advance, cognitive function is almost completely gone. She has a hard time feeding herself and can no longer get dress on her own. She’s also extremely combative with everyone but me. I ended up letting the nanny go, mom was getting very aggressive with her. She really doesn’t like other women, especially around me. Days are filled with a roller coaster of emotions. Mom will be sad, happy and very angry just seconds apart from each other. The angry spells usually lead to her storming out the front door and walking around the block. You have to let her go outside, if you try to stop her, she’ll stand at the front door screaming and pounding. Letting her roam usually calms her down. I usually follow behind, as to not be seen and let her find the way back home. She usually sticks to the same walking pattern we did daily in the first two years. I watch to see if she’s  confused or scared, it’s easy to spot, her walking pattern will appear more erratic instead of purposeful. When spot this, I usually shout out a goofy comment to get her attention, something like, “I think the beach is the other way”. Soon as she sees me, everything clams down and we walk back to the house with her holding my arm. This happens almost every day. 
She got out one morning while I was in the shower, I must have forgotten to pin lock the front door. The panic when I got out of the shower was real, she was gone and so was the dog. Fortunately I passed out flyers explaining her condition a month before. I received a call from the local PD as I was walking around the block looking for her. I turned the corner as I got the call, the officers had her corralled at the end of the street. They were very polite, but seemed a bit confused by what she was saying. Her jibber jabber at this time was a bit crazy, if you listened really close it almost seemed like she was trying to say something, it was just jibber jabber tho. 
I had a family member watch her one evening and he had a nervous breakdown 3 days later. He saw Jesus in my basement that night and thought he understood exactly what she was saying. The jibber jabber was definitely enough to make a person crazy, if you listened to deeply. About a month later, I had a friend watch her for the weekend, she also ended up having a nervous breakdown. The combination of her emotional roller coaster and the jibber jabber, was enough to make a person crazy. Looking back I have no idea, how I kept it together the whole time. 
After the great escape, I felt it was necessary to upgrade surveillance system in the house. I put cameras inside main living areas, one in her room and a couple outside. The new system notified me when the cameras saw motion, and had a mobile app so I could look in when I was away. This was extremely helpful to have. With the new surveillance system working, I felt confident it was ok to take little breaks when she was in bed. I could keep an eye on her from anywhere and get notified if she got up. I would wait until she had her evening medication and was asleep. The Seroquel at night would completely knock her out for 4-6 hours. I wouldn’t travel far, or for very long and made sure I could make it home in 15 min flat no matter what. This definitely limits what can or can’t do. I found a regular spot close to the house, never drank more than two drinks, and was never gone for more than an hour. Its a nice escape to have a place where you know everyone, and everyone knows you. And, was a very important component in maintaining my sanity. 
As time went on, I noticed how I was forgetting who she was before the dementia. I think it started with, removing old pictures on the walls, and forms of digital media. Eventually, it lead to me completely blocking out every past good memory of her. I’m not sure exactly when it started, I just really noticed my disconnect in the 3 rd year. She had a manic episode and I didn’t feel anything when she started to cry. I just remained calm and dealt with it as usual. This must have been my subconscious mind protecting itself. The pain of seeing her in this state and knowing who she once was, became too overwhelming. I didn’t know until recently, that blocking out emotional attachments like this, would apply to every aspect of my life. This is definitely where everything started to become grey. 
Her physical health was also starting to decline. One morning while giving her a bath she fainted. It was hard to wake her this morning, usually she’s alert by 6am. This time she had trouble walking bathroom. I got her into the tub and keeping her awake was a challenge. After the bath, she couldn’t stand on her own. I carried her to the bedroom and covered her with a blanket. It was time to take her to the ER. I ran out to the car and got it warming up, leaving the passenger door open. After getting her dressed, I carried her over my shoulder wrapped in a blanket to the car. A call to the hospital on the drive and they got her in right away. They did a multitude of scans and blood work. Turns out it was a UTI. The gave her an IV, some antibiotics and we were on our way the next day. This happened 1 more time this year, almost exactly the same way. It was in the middle of winter tho.
It totally sucks, because she had no way of telling me she was in pain. I remember feeling horrible, like I hadn’t done enough to prevent it or paid enough attention to subtle details. 
There’s nothing reasonable you can do to prevent the UTIs once you start using diapers. I changed them frequently and always made sure she had enough fluids.
At this point some people called me Stoic. Looking back, I’m not sure if it’s was stoicism or not, I no longer had the ability to emphasize. Fortunately, I had a good childhood and was given a solid moral compass. My strict moral code is definitely what kept me in the green when I could no longer empathize. I drew hard lines within myself of what was and wasn’t ok, this was all based upon what I was taught growing up. I owe mostly my mother for this, but also my father and grandparents too. They made sure I always knew right from wrong and through example taught me what kindness was. 
That was the 3rd year.
comment 18: Wow, you have been through so much. What a brave person you are
comment 19: Thank you for sharing your story!  Although my mother passed from a malignant brain tumor in March of this year, I can definitely relate.  When you say, "" I find myself today, almost 7 years since her diagnosis, at a loss, unable to grasp who she was, or what she really meant to me. I have become completely numb, totally incapable of love. Not knowing how to feel things anymore. I’m never particularly happy, never particularly sad. Everything is just grey."" this is exactly what I am feeling now (covid isn't helping).  My mother was not in her ""right mind"" pretty much immediately after her diagnosis in January 2020 until she passed in March 2020.  We didn't get to have a proper funeral and I haven't really mourned her yet.  Veteran's Day was her birthday and I think that was the first time I really cried.  I am having a hard time as the holidays are approaching though, and I know it will be hard.  Thank you for your thoughtful story.
comment 20: My mother also passed this year, in February. I now care for two clients, one of whom has dementia and is slowly losing her language abilities. Sometimes her behaviors are very frustrating and I lose sight of the woman she was, still is, underneath the symptoms of the disease. Thank you OP, for reminding me to be compassionate and caring, to see her more as someone who could be my own mother. I love your detailed account of your experience, the constant joking and putting her at ease, the sweetness that soaked every choice you made in dealing with your mom. She was very lucky to have you. I literally have tears in my eyes. Thank you

"Evaluate idea Hello everyone!
Looking for some directly related opinion for something. The company I work for is pitching an app idea to help people that are suffering from Alzheimer's.
We are pitching a memorization app - an app that can help people remember who they are by using their device’s data - photos, memories, messages or even music - either the family provides the music that the patient used to enjoy or maybe just the music that was very popular doing some important phases of his life. Just remind the person to take a short quiz, ask them basic stuff and correlate the data to watch for any progress, notify them from time to time to go through some of the quizes. We were thinking about splitting it into three phases - if the patient is at an earlier phase he gets notified to do them at himself, after the results are not as good, he can do it together with the family or nurse and in the end only someone else can do it for him.
We are still at the phase of evaluating the idea but we would love to hear any feedback - would it be useful, would it feel too intrusive, is there something out there already that serves the same purpose, even furhter reading might be more than useful.
Thank you and take care!","comment 1: Sounds too complicated.  My spouse can't handle much tech any more.  So I get stuck with all the troubleshooting, reading fine-print manuals, etc.  Even though I can do that work, I don't want to.
How would your app improve upon a sympathetic and observant caregiver?
comment 2: One issue I foresee is that my mom, even after years working in banking, stopped touching a computer when she reached the mid-stage. She didn't even want one in the home. She wouldn't touch a phone either. Google Home was far to foreign to her, even though the ease of just saying ""Hey, Google play X"" would have made it so easy for her to listen to music. We ended up putting in an old-fashioned radio and she was much happier with that.
comment 3: I'm wondering if the technology avoidance happens to a large number of people affected by the disease. We will try and make some inquiries to the alzheimer's association, check out if any of this makes sense .
I don't know anyone with Alzheimer's personally but my father suffers from mental illness and during the stints he had in an institute he was heavily sedated and sometimes used to phone me asking me if I will be visiting him that day only minutes after getting home from the visit. 
If an app can help you avoid such moments I think it's worth the try!
comment 4: both my grandmas were never really into tech so  avoided it even more with alz. however, i worked for a retired business man in his late 80’s who loved doing the Magic Puzzle app on his ipad well into mid stages.
comment 5: My mum is the same, but I do wonder if that will change in the coming years. As the next generation ages, we’ll see more and more AD patients that have grown up with tablets and smartphones and I think they’ll be more accepting of the idea of an app.
comment 6: Exactly our thoughts on this!
comment 7: I really like the idea; my question is what is the app ultimately for? Is it to create an enjoyable experience for someone with AD, to reminisce about things they used to like? Is it something to improve their memory and brain function by testing them to remember things from their past? Is it a tracker of a patient’s cognitive abilities so that loved ones can see how much they’re remembering on a week by week basis? 
From your post it seems like it could be any or all of those things, but I think the way the app would work could be very different for all of them.
comment 8: The idea is not fully fleshed out, at this stage it's just a proposal. We're trying to figure out if the app can actually help with the memory and brain function so we're trying to gather more information on how/if it might help with the patient's memory
comment 9: My opinion costs money. You don't get advice for a for profit company for free
comment 10: That's fine, it makes sense. Thanks anyway

Just remind the person to take a short quiz, ask them basic stuff and correlate the data to watch for any progress, notify them from time to time to go through some of the quizes. We were thinking about splitting it into three phases - if the patient is at an earlier phase he gets notified to do them at himself, after the results are not as good, he can do it together with the family or nurse and in the end only someone else can do it for him.
We are still at the phase of evaluating the idea but we would love to hear any feedback - would it be useful, would it feel too intrusive, is there something out there already that serves the same purpose, even furhter reading might be more than useful. 
Thank you and take care!","comment 1: Maybe I have misunderstood your intention, but my experience with my mother with dementia is that she absolutely hates being asked questions that she knows she should know but cannot remember. This is a sure way to put her in a state of high anxiety. So would not recommend any quiz relating to personal details that may have been forgotten.
comment 2: I would consider not making it like a quiz, but simply an easy to use app for someone with dementia to experience memorable photos, videos, messages, and music. Family members and approved friends can add to the data. Notifications of new memories and specified times to open the app could be used. 
My nonprofit currently has users load photos with descriptions onto our web apps. We then create Memory Books or Cards and send to their loved one with dementia free of charge. Your idea is  certainly an excellent expansion of that idea.

"Grandfather wanders off frequently. Hello everyone. My grandpa was recently diagnosed with dementia and every chance he gets, he sneaks out of the house and we are having a very hard time constantly going out to search for him. I was looking for a gps tracker and most of them are watch based or a beacon that he has to have with him all the time. The problem is he is really clumsy and probably throw them away or hide it when nobody is around. I wanted to know know if anyone has faced similar situation or knows about a product that will be hard for him to get rid off. I would appreciate any suggestions that you guys might have. 
It really hurts seeing him lost a part of himself every day. There are moments when he does not even recognize familiar faces.","comment 1: Door locks with a key required for both sides at night.
An alarm for the door that goes off when door is opened during the day and 
Hire a caregiver.
comment 2: Hey there. We struggled with this early on too. Have you heard of Project Lifesaver? I don’t know if it’s available in your city but something worth campaigning for if it isn’t. There’s also shoe inserts with gps from several companies. Blessings.
comment 3: Hey drunkguy, I'm including a link to a page where I listed all the things we've used to put the house on lockdown in case any of these tricks will work for you. I don't have suggestions for tech solutions as once we got the house locked down, Mom didn't wander off again.
Good luck!
comment 4: Haha! Forgot the link. Doh!

comment 5: Contact your local Aging and Disability Resource Center (if in US) or aging agency.  We used a program run by the county sheriff's department where he wore an ankle bracelet that would have been quite hard for him to get off on his own.  The monitoring was free but you had to buy about $350 of equipment.
Then my husband stopped wandering.  It was like he outgrew it or something.  I am keeping that equipment in case he starts up again.

"I think I found the reason for my dementia. In September, I had gotten a bike for my birthday, but no helmet. I was always riding it, and usually ridden it kind of dangerously down the hill in my house. I have a swing set, and I had tried to  avoid it, but I couldn't slow down or move away in time. I had hit my side of my head on the metal bar ladder on my swing set, but I think my bike, and/or my hands helped not make the accident as painful.
I didn't really think much of it, due to the accident not really being painful, but I think after the accident, after 2 weeks, I had started getting cognitive impairment, my memory loss was almost instant, but my typing and speech were declining slowly. 
My memory is getting slightly better, but my sleep schedule has been gone off track(I can easily sleep in the day, than at night in some days). Time still feels slow and warped to me(the past is sometimes closer to the present than I realize, or further away), and I still have trouble with typing and speech, but it might be slowly getting better.
My doctors and family weren't really useful, and I had to rely on the internet to know what the problem is, and I'm sorry if I annoyed you in any form.","comment 1: Listen-go see about your head injury. Your lucid dreaming posts and dementia posts all started around the time you say you had your injury. Before that, there are several posts along the lines of computer simulations and games. All of this put together suggests (to me) that you seem to have an obsessive type of personality to begin with. It's a good thing that you got a bike for your birthday so that you can spend more time outside, in reality. If you don't, this is a recipe for a future mental disorder that can become irreversible. Being split from reality can lead to dementia later on. Living in Fantasy Land is not good! Make friends, be yourself and get outside! Trust me-I speak from experience. I'm not right in my head (never have been), but it's gotten worse, and I'm not sure myself if my deal is reversible. I'm 49 years old, and most of my issues are drug and alcohol induced. I wish someone had gotten on my case about being myself, not living in Fantasy Land, etc when I was your age. I don't think I would have indulged in the substances like I did. I don't have very long (relatively speaking) with having enough of my faculties to continue without a caretaker. Not any time soon, but likely sooner than most. That's The harsh reality of my situation. There is a possibility that I can keep this at bay for many years to come... we'll see what the specialists say. But please go get your head checked out, and try to live as much as you can! You're not bothering me by posting what you post-it seems you do want answers. So get your head checked out, live life, don't do drugs, and be yourself! If people don't like who you really are, fuck 'em! To Thine Own Self Be True! Good luck, young Padawan!
comment 2: I wonder if the injury, in addition to the Caretaker album, caused me to begin having hypochondriac symptoms, because as soon as I started having the symptoms, I continuously researched about my symptoms for 24/7 for 3+ months straight.
I need to learn to get this obsession behavior controlled.
comment 3: Research can be procrastination in disguise... go see a doctor
comment 4: Time is my biggest enemy right now. I would try and go to the doctor ASAP, but the appointments are always once a week, and I have no control on when to go to the doctors.
comment 5: I believe you could be on the right track with this. The way to get that behavior under control is to go on facts. You don't know all of the facts yet. The doctor will help you learn the facts, but you MUST provide the doc with the right information---only the facts. Like your injury, and subsequent symptoms.
comment 6: Ok
comment 7: Dementia is a progressive disease for which there is no “getting better”. I’d say you most probably have a concussion.
comment 8: [deleted]
comment 9: You’re right, there are. There’s actually 5 main predispositions to the disease. However it’s acquired, there’s no “getting better” from it. Skills that are lost or impaired don’t improve. The fact that OP mentions things that were lost after the injury are “getting better” is the clearest indicator that something else, most probably a concussion, are the cause. Not a progressive illness.
comment 10: [deleted]
comment 11: I’ve been working with dementia patients for the last 10 years and am actually a specialist in my field. Not looking to get into a dispute.  Have a great night ☺️
comment 12: whoops speaks the truth. I'm 49 and have my own concerns/issues, and I wish more people would try and soak in as much knowledge as they could. It would help people like me who get told ""You're fine-you passed our cognitive tests with above average intelligence."" Well, I'm NOT fine by any stretch of the imagination! There are exponentially more WTF moments in my life than the below-average imbecile, I admit. I've done tons of research because this is subjective for me. I'm not trying to put anyone in their place, but if people would ditch this ""I'm an expert, I don't need to read that bullshit"" attitude, people like me could possibly get the help we need.
comment 13: It's more of a feeling, but I can't really tell. I'm kind of bad at finding the right words for some sentences, leading to mistakes like these.
Some symptoms seem to just get worse on some days, location, or it could be worse depending on the time of day, so it's hard to tell if it's worse or better.
I'm hoping it does show actual, clear signs of it getting better.
comment 14: [deleted]
comment 15: Here's my experiences with my doctors.
My first doctor that I talked to, when I was talking about my possible b12 deficiency, and cognitive problems, he instantly said I didn't have it, without doing any forms of tests. He gave me to another doctor who is a phycologist. My phycologist gave me a cognitive test that is incredibly easy, except for the time one, to disprove I have any cognitive problems. He then proceeded to put me with another doctor. They never say what I have, besides anxiety, which I only had gotten from realizing I had gotten my symptms.
My diet consists of junk food as snack. For dinner, it's usually subway, pizza rolls, and rarely is it Pizza, or Tacobell. For breakfast, I kind of stopped eating it because I don't like it(it's cereal). For drinks, I usually have to drink soda. Even with all these food, my stomach is like a blackhole, and I can consume food after food, and I would never get very fat.
For school, it's quite easy, I'm failing a class because of the teacher's lack of knowing about technology, and my memory problems keeps causing me to forget about PE(I have to do it online), and how my teacher wants me to do attendance online during home school. I don't really try, I usually procrastinate, and I still do really well.
My sleep, before, was always at 12:00 PM to 1:00 AM. After I had the symptoms, it's pretty much a dice roll on when I could sleep, and I can't stop being tired in the morning, and I usually fall back asleep.
comment 16: I meant to say this earlier today, but forgot. The cognitive tests are ridiculously easy—unless you have some form of cognitive impairment. I was there when my husband took his, and seeing him struggle with parts of it was shocking for that very reason. 
Since you are so young, what did you find hard about the time part. Do you mean the part where you draw a clock? I have wondered about that since young people don’t often use a clock with hands. My daughter is in her early 20s and working on her PhD, yet I tease her about not knowing how to tell time. I can only imagine what she would do if she was told to draw the clock.
comment 17: I didn't do the clock drawing test version, just the test where they have you talk. I was confused on the 11 after 30 part.
comment 18: Is it head trauma?
comment 19: I had a concussion about 4 years ago. It wasn’t necessarily a bad one and my doctors weren’t concerned. At first I didn’t notice, but I began having trouble thinking. Things that I could previously quickly recall or grasp would take a concerted effort and far more time than I was used to taking. I would have to stop and think through a process to figure things out instead of it just happening automatically. This lasted about a year before clearing up enough that I stopped noticing. It was quite noticeable to my coworkers even, so I started telling people I was recovering from a concussion so they would think I was dumb. 
I hate to jump to conclusions, but I think this is what you are experiencing, except you are becoming obsessive about it and looking for explanations that are far worse than recovering from a concussion. As I was dealing with my concussion, I kept thinking about all the kids who get concussions through sports and how they have to go to school and learn new things each and every day. It must be frustrating and exhausting, but it will get better.
comment 20: I agree with you about concussion. The symptoms after 2 weeks appeared, and no matter how much I sleep, it doesn't go away, and it's been 3 months, so I believe it could be a concussion.
Wouldn't concussion be a form of dementia if it affected your cognitive skills?
comment 21: No, a concussion wouldn’t be considered dementia because a concussion won’t continue to make your cognitive skills decrease. Dementia will continue until you can’t do anything. A concussion is going to temporarily impair your function. Dementia is so much more and so much worse than what you are experiencing because it gets worse over time and makes it so you cannot take care of yourself or function out in the world. My husband doesn’t even qualify as having dementia yet because it’s not bad enough yet. However, his condition will continue to decline so much that it will kill him. A concussion does not do that unless you’ve had so many or one severe enough that it leads to dementia (like what is seen with pro football players or soldiers who get bombed).
comment 22: What about this post here?
https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jqpaqu/dementia_can_be_caused_by_head_injury_and_isnt/
comment 23: There is a big difference between a concussion and a traumatic brain injury. You’ve been seen by more than one doctor, if I’m remembering correctly. If you had a traumatic brain injury, they would have noticed. You wouldn’t have been able to pass that cognitive test for one thing. And even if you had barely passed it, you’d be making all sorts of excuses for why it was harder than one would think to try to explain your confusion about the test. Instead, you acted insulted that they gave you such a simple test. My previously intelligent husband thought he did well on the test but also was very defensive about how poorly the test was explained and designed. It was neither. He just couldn’t do it all well.
comment 24: My doctors don't seem to know a lot about the brain, doing very little tests and not saying what I could have, so I'm just very confused, but thanks for clearing it up more.
comment 25: [deleted]
comment 26: There is a huge difference in a combat vet getting dementia from something mine an IED and someone getting it from a hit to the head that didn’t even hurt. I realize this is a personal mission of yours to spread info about dementia from sudden brain trauma. I value that. Please be careful about who you could be affecting when you are on your soapbox though.
comment 27: It kind of did hurt, it was like a headache on the left side of my head that lasted for more than 10 minutes, it wasn't incredibly painful, but it was noticeable.
I have a really high pain tolerance/threshold. so maybe it was the reason why it didn't hurt as much.
comment 28: [deleted]
comment 29: I did read it. You should go read his post history to get a better understanding of him and his intelligence. He’s smart. I cannot believe he has a cognitive impairment like dementia.
comment 30: [deleted]
comment 31: Look, this is a kid who is obsessing about all sorts of strange medical possibilities including dementia. He has been to see doctors. They say he doesn’t have dementia. I’ve checked out his post history. He says he when he hit his head it didn’t hurt. I would think if it were enough to cause dementia it would have hurt like a mutha. He became an atheist just because he listened to an album of songs about memory loss and Alzheimer’s. I’m an atheist, so I’m not judging that, but hearing that he no longer believes in god because he listened to an album about memory loss is further evidence of possible obsessive behavior. Other obsessions he has are with synesthesia (thinks he is blind to sound) and dreams. He also has a history of depression. Bottom line, you are not doing him any favors telling him he could have dementia from hitting his head when he said it didn’t even hurt when he hit it.
comment 32: I think I underestimate/overestimate everything, I did feel pain when I hit the bars, I even got a headache on the side of my head, but I wasn't really concerned about it.
comment 33: Are you hoping it's some type of dementia? It seems like you are arguing in hopes that someone will agree with you that it's what you have.
comment 34: I'm just so confused on what's happening to me, it could be why I keep on going on different tangents, and mixing everything up. Also, almost every single thing I look up keeps bringing me back to dementia or relates to dementia is also confusing me.
comment 35: Half of the post on this sub are hypochondriacs self diagnosing dementia... Gets really annoying.
comment 36: My doctors never diagnosed me with being a hypochondriac, even from earlier in life.
comment 37: I could be me being a cyberchondria, due to me always researching every single thing I have.

"Advice on dealing with my ornery FIL who's living with us indefinitely TLDR: 70/yo male, widowed since 2005, hoarder, does not take care of himself well normally. Was diagnosed with schizophrenia, depression - was generally untreated until 2019 Hospitalized after being found in his home almost a year ago. Currently living with his daughter and myself. Doing well under the circumstances currently is (probably) dehydrated and losing appetite. Unsure when to intervene with calling a nurse.
Situation: Oh boy here is the book... be ready:
My FIL has always kept to himself and on occasion contacted me and my wife. Caveat: He’s always resented my wife because fertility issues made him think she wasn’t his… (this runs DEEP) We would call him; he'd call back a few weeks later. We used to live an hour away. My career took me 4 hours away. 2017, moved away... FIRST MASSIVE RED FLAG...
Tried to visit us, screws up the college I work at and I plainly describe how to get to our place.... 3 hours later we get a call he turned back home and ""had enough of this shit"". 7 hours later (3AM) I get a call from him ""I'm still in your wonderful state!"" WTF dude.... after guiding him on google maps asynchronously for 2 hours I FINALLY got him back on track to home. 13 hours later calls us that he’s home and going to an auction later in the day…
Fast forward to 18 hours later... get a call from a sheriff in a county 2 hours south west of his home. He got in a minor car wreck. He's OK but his story made no sense. I confirmed his story was atrocious and told him to take they keys and put him up in a hotel. His brother eventually went to see him as we were 6 hours from where he ended up.
My wife and I drive all night to get to him and finally get some food in him. He's better, so we drive him back home. His truck was impounded, and he worked to regain his license. He of course blames us for this mishap. We communicated off and on throughout the year or so, but it was inconsistent.
Fast Forward to Nov. 30th 2019 - found in his home conscious but barely alive. His brother found him, rushed to the ER with a body temp of 94. More than likely had a stroke, and passed out also because of malnutrition. He'd lost a lot of weight too... He weighed 160 when admitted. This guy was pushing about 240-250 only 4 years ago and believe me, he does not work out. After a long recovery process on June 29 2020... he's recovered well enough to leave the long term care facility draining him of 6 grand a month... to live with us, like he said he wanted to do while he was in the home and in the hospital. Editorial note: NO ONE other than us in his family bothered to step up AT ALL in this process…
I drew up a care contract to help his transition and we also contracted with in home care 5 days a week (not RNs). We also got hooked up after 2 ER visits for catheter issues with in home Nursing on demand. Good progress has been made getting his catheter out, improving his health and well-being, and his appetite has improved…
Hard stop to this week. We switched him to a Tuesday, Thursday Friday plan on the home care help (4 hrs a day) because he is doing better. He does not drink a lot of fluids and it hit Thursday this week. Gave him 2 Arbys beef n cheddars that he usually devours, and barley ate 1. Said he could not swallow… he had 8oz of fluids over 8 hours. His appetite has been less than usual over the last few days, and we are mandating fluids over food right now.
I’m frustrated with him because of his lack of thirst, and him and his daughter don’t have a great relationship and just end up pissing each other off. At what point do I get the nurses involved?","comment 1: Sounds like he needs to be evaluated for dysphagia asap. Might tell you if he's aspirating on liquids (not uncommon with those situations). Might have a decrease in PO intake because he's protecting his airway.
Also wanted to tell you that you're doing so much for him and you guys may be feeling under appreciated. Make sure you also take care of yourself and don't burn yourselves out.
comment 2: He's doing well eating his pizza at lunch today and he went through 18oz of Milk with his oatmeal this morning. I will get a nurse in if it gets worse.
He had really bad dysphagia when he was hospitalized and we had to beg him to get a feeding tube put in. The therapy was incredible. In 2 months he was eating solid food. I think they stretched his esophagus too though, he might need that again.
Thanks for the note about treating ourselves. We're trying to relax, but ""getting away"" is tough in COVID times. Wifey and I will occasionally get out of the house and go on some country back-roads to just get out.
comment 3: To me it sounds like he would benefit from nursing care now. You and your wife have taken on a huge thankless responsiblity which I'm sure will continue to become more challenging. It sounds like you have been able to do quite well for him and that's amazing but it at what cost to you and your wife?  Would it be possible for your FIL to be admitted to an adult group home or a nursing care facility?  I have two sisters who suffer from a mental illness and I know firsthand how tough it can be without much hope of getting better so I can't imagine what it must be like if you add all the physical health issues on top of everything. 
I would at least start researching and home nursing companies and talk with them about what your FIL needs.  They will be able to tell you if you need to add nursing care.  If you live in the states I would contact your local Area Agency on Aging to see if they can offer any suggestions. 
Best of luck to you.  These times taking care of an elderly parent is incredibly difficult so please remember to take time for yourself and your wife.  Remember you can't keep someone else warm by setting yourself on fire.
comment 4: Change your name, burn your phones, purchase fake death certificates, and then move across country. No, seriously. 🤔👍👍👍
comment 5: Mexico might be nice
comment 6: Hang in there, dont push yourselves to the breaking point before getting help. there are resources available, like the doctor or social services that can help with decisions. It is utterly frustrating not knowing exactly whats going on and how to help. Add on they may fight ya every step of the way. They dont understand that without your help they probably wouldnt be here today and certainly life wouldnt be pleasant. My own dad most days wont drink much water. We've been over and over it. he has constant weakness and bad balance problems. Couldnt get a swallow test for him because of covid. I do my best.  Rough days I give him Bodyarmor and that seems to help hydrate him pretty good. Fruit is good as is soup. Maybe a milkshake. He also gets a Boost each morning. 
Appetite...he also doesnt eat much. One thing he will finish is pancakes. If he can get around ok and has been just sitting all day see if you can get him up and moving. get him out in the fresh air. Those can help the appetite as well as other things. Hang in there and wish ya the best.
comment 7: My dad was the opposite with liquids, the schizophrenia meds made him so thirsty that he'd drink gallons of water until he had seizures from low sodium. If we turned off the water to the sink, he'd drink from the toilet. 
My advice would be to get FIL settled back into a care home as long as he can afford it, or find out what he needs to do to qualify for Medicaid to pay for it. You and your wife shouldn't have to sacrifice years of your life to care for a grouchy old man who never gave his daughter the love or even the respect she deserved.  
It's actually nicer for them if they can get get situated in a long term care facility while they can still have conversations and walk around and participate in activities. My mom wouldn't put my dad into a facility until he was pretty bad off, and he spent his last years scared all the time.
comment 8: If he’s eating sodium rich foods and not drinking much liquids, he may be mildly constipated which would affect how much he eats. Does he take a laxative or stool softener? If not, can you get him to drink something like Metamucil? 
Food can’t go in if waste isn’t going out
comment 9: Good point! We got him hydrated and he's eating better I did have him on a mild stool softener but took him off thinking it would take away liquid from him.
comment 10: He will need more liquid with a stool softener, but without it he might not be eliminating properly. Crappy shituation all around.
"
"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it. This is my first post, and I am filled with guilt. Please bear with me. It is long for context.
My dad has been diagnosed with dementia, and I have long suspected that he is a narcissist. I had a very superficial relationship with him prior to his formal diagnosis due to his narcissistic traits. His other children do not speak to him much because of this, and they have not been willing to help. I have been his sole caretaker since 2020. This is the hardest thing I have ever done as he is verbally and psychologically abusive.
Today, the pharmacy delayed a prescription that my Dad started in my absence. He stated that he had gone to the doctor and spoke with a PA, who switched him back to one of his former heart medications. This would be the second refill of the renewed prescription. I thought about it for a while, and I started to wonder if the prescription was delayed because my Dad is not supposed to be taking this medication at all. This would not be a surprise. My father has stopped and started medications randomly as well as created scenarios around why he started/stopped the meds in the past. 
I went to him and told him that the refill may have been delayed due to a possible drug interaction, and that I would ask the pharmacist tomorrow. This led to a long conversation where he asserted that he had already been taking this medication for 30 days and that it wouldn't make sense for the pharmacy to take issue now. I disagreed. I said that I was here 30 days ago, and that he did not have that medication in his medication bag. He argued a bit, so I asked for the empty bottle. He said he must have thrown it away. I abruptly ended the conversation, as I felt like I was falling into the ""reasoning"" trap that caregivers are told to avoid so that the patient doesn't get agitated.
I thought about it alone some more, and suddenly remembered that I DID see the new medication 30 days ago. I had asked him about it then, and he told me who refilled it. His story didn't line up in a few ways, so I checked the refill date and it was indeed recent. So it did not seem like he just randomly opened one of his old pill bottles and start taking it. I had been relieved and forgot all about it.
Upon realizing I was wrong, I felt awful. I had been so stern with him and suggested that what he was saying about having taken the medication for a month already was wrong. I weighed telling him. I need him to trust me, so I felt it really important to be honest. But I also worried that this would make him more adamant about being correct when he truly does mess up his meds. The need for him to trust me won out, and I went to him and told him that I was mistaken, and that I do remember seeing the medication in his bag.
He gave me a sort of sly smile that I have never seen before. He said, ""Do you see I'm not senile?"" I never said he was senile, but he does have dementia and it manifests quite a bit in sometimes serious ways. I just said ""I never said that. i just want to make sure you're not taking medications that interact."" I turned to go and then he said, ""I don't play with my medications. I take those right."" That stopped me in my tracks. Crap. He doesn't take his medications right. He takes the wrongs one/takes them improperly quite a bit, AND his mixing up of medications was the chief concern of his doctors when he was discharged from the hospital. It was the reason why they said he needed a caretaker in the first place. I know caregivers make mistakes, but I think this one was particularly disastrous. 
I tried to let him no that he has occasionally been mistaken about his medications, and I just try to double check things now. This led to a really, really, bad argument that I had to walk away from. He does not agree that he ever suddenly stopped meds. (He has, and it scared me.)
I feel guilty and like I do not know what I am doing. I have probably just destroyed my chance at him cooperating with me regarding his medications long terms. It was so hard to even get him to stick to a medication schedule, use his pill box, and not take whichever meds he feels like.
Sorry for the length. I just feel so disappointed in myself and worried about how this will impact the future. I don't even know what I am asking for here. Maybe I just needed to share.","comment 1: I am so sorry, what an awful situation. You are being so hard on yourself. Whether or not telling him was a mistake, you did what you did out of concern for him. You have nothing to feel guilty for because you have done nothing malicious, unthinking, etc. Also, depending on how far his dementia has progressed, he may not even remember this interaction. You are in a horrible situation and you are going above and beyond. Be kinder to you.
I don’t know if this could help, but I believe there are pill dispensers that only open various sections at specific times. Maybe tied to an app? Could getting something like that prevent him from picking and choosing his pills?
comment 2: I feel your pain. My grandfather was very similar. He was a very strong-willed man who didn't want to admit that anything was wrong with him. He ended up blaming the doctors because the medication was never perfect.
I'd recommend asking your pharmacist if they do custom medication management packaging. like this
That way you can be absolutely sure that he has taken (or at least opened) the right ones each day.
Also, cut yourself some slack. You're in a hard situation right now, and you're still working hard in exchange for little thanks. Be sure to take care of yourself too.
comment 3: Eh. You’re thinking too deeply on this. White lies, careful monitoring, kindness, patience. It’s all you can do.
comment 4: [deleted]
comment 5: While it's not uncommon for people to have ""good"" moments and ""bad"" moments, it is possible he's playing his dementia up or down to manipulate people too. Try not to waste too much energy reading into him. You may never understand what's going on inside his head. Just focus on keeping the two of you safe and happy.
comment 6: I think you did just fine.
comment 7: Sounds like my dad. I could tell ya stories but will save it. Dementia and Narcissism is wicked.  they can work together pretty well. best to not admit youre wrong. they dont have compassion and understanding. they see it as weakness and a way to hook into you.  never show emotion, be a rock. Act like its no big deal. Like you could care less. Pick your battles. use persuasion instead of going head on. And the slope is slippery and dark and murky. Trust yourself always, always.
best of luck

"Apple - you really suck! So somehow my mother either set up her iPad passcode, or one of the IT person’s in her assisted living facility set it. Um....HELLO? she has memory issues so how about you leave the passcode and the goddamn two factor authentication bullshit alone.  I disabled those for a reason!
There needs to be a dementia app where caregivers can go in and remote connect to their loved ones devices. She does not have the capability to do anything more than play a few games and follow her grandkids on Facebook. 
This clip from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off sums up the frustration of the past hour of texts and calls - we gotta find the humor where we can.
https://youtu.be/CdcFYNe9U7A","comment 1: You can lock a iPad into a single app but that’s the only help I can give.  I agree with you we should be able to remote in.
comment 2: If its still locked, my dad had an Iphone several years back, same issue. I was able to unlock thru Itunes app.
comment 3: I’m actually in the process of a restore right now. :)
Thankfully she can leave her assisted living facility for short visits. If we go back into a shelter in place, that is when we will have some serious issues. She uses her iPad for hours at a time with a paint by number & other apps. Thanks!
comment 4: Sounds good. Just a thought. Can you setup facetime for her and someone at the facility start it for her?. Might be really cool. 
Give her a big hug for me, take care.
comment 5: Thank you!! I appreciate the suggestion & big hug delivered!
comment 6: Wife with dementia uses an iPad which works great. 
This isn't an Apple issue. This is a you or other caregivers issue. Apples' security features are the only ones I'd trust in this kind of situation.
comment 7: She is in assisted living and I work full time, so for convenience (and as a means to avoid an anxiety attack and 40+ texts in two hours) the passcode & 2-factor authentication was disabled. If I could have her living with us to provide more hands on care I would, you must be fortunate in that respect.
Her user ID and password are on a post-it taped to her devices so device security is not my first concern for her to play paint by number. She is unable to maintain a booklet with passwords as in one day she ends up changing her password several times. One day 32 password alerts came to my email in three hours.
The few apps she uses for entertainment don’t concern me as far as security goes, she has never set up personal financial info on any of her devices and I am her POA so her bank account flags me for all transactions & her two financial advisors have to run any transactions through me. 
If she didn’t do it then someone helping her with IT at her facility did. So yes, now it is my problem to fix, but it’s not a problem I created, so I hope you can find a level of understanding my frustration.
comment 8: TeamViewer support will let you see her screen but not control it.  I'm not sure if you can get in if she hasn't entered the password tho.
Yes apple sucks in this respect.  You can do more with android and,way more with windows.
comment 9: Thanks! 
Viewing her screen would be helpful at times, no doubt. I appreciate the suggestion.
Others have mentioned Android as well. That may become her next option as she is at a stage of dementia where she can get enjoyment from simple apps. It will be a sad day when she no longer can understand simple apps because she likes that they give her with something to do. She has already had a significant decline in being able to read novels, her favorite hobby. Right now children’s literature is doable, although she is a bit embarrassed to be reading at the level of Little House on the Prairie books :(

"Aging father I live with my mother who is 65 and my father who is 74. I’m 25 (turning 26) who graduated college and started working in a lab which involves and hour commute, while also trying to finish my last 4 credit class to enter a physician assistant program. My father is noticeably declining, getting increasingly more lonely because me and my mom are always working. My dad is left to his own devices during the day, which concerns me and my mom sometimes because he will forget where he put his keys or leave the stove on and go outside. We feel helpless because we need to work to support the three of us. We do not think he has seen any of his doctors(besides his cardiologist, maybe) since covid started. My mother tells me he is experiencing incontinence, and I’ve notice his lack of underwear going through the wash. I also noticed he is forgoing some other personal hygiene habits which makes me think someone needs to keep a closer eye on him. He attends to school board meetings at the local high school (no via zoom) and writes emails that half make any sense and are  disjointed. The house isn’t clean and whenever we touch surfaces they’re sticky. I’m thinking that even though this lab job gives security I should go back to my job that paid less but the drive was 15 mins instead of an hour. I’m hoping to get into a program to care for both of them, or be able to hire a caregiver when I’m at work. My mom tells me that she doesn’t want me to be trapped taking care of them but I want them worry less about life overall. I feel like if I give up this lab job and I don’t make it into PA school I risk losing out on being able to support them but lose the time with them because of the drive. 
Lab= potential of 30$/hr(salary) currently $18 & benefits . Schedule is flexible 12-8. (1hr commute) 
MMJ Product specialist= $15/hr, no benefits but retirement plan. (15 min commute) 
I was hoping to be offered a spot in a program so my friend who wants to work in a lab (who has a medical condition that hinders her capability to walk) could take my place. Does anyone have any advice that could be helpful, I feel like I need to just buck up and clean and cook more but this class and full time job has really taken it’s toll. I only see my bf once a week which is my only time I feel like I get a break from my parents. Too add to everything mention above, I lose my insurance in a month, happy 26th birthday to me.","comment 1: I take care of my elderly parents, I know how confusing and difficult it is. But if your mother is only 65 and still working, she is fully capable of making the choices to care for her husband. It's great you're concerned and keeping an eye out for him, but it's not your responsibility to do your mothers work of she is able. If you really want to help, provide resources or support for your mother so that she can get help for him. Convince her to hire in-home care and so on. Maybe point out things that are happening with your father that she's not aware of and other such similar ways to help .There are ways to be helpful and supportive without taking on the actual work yourself. Trust me, things with them are going to get far worse as they get older. Save your energy and enthusiasm for when things get really bad and even your mother can't be helpful. It's also likely that at this point, he or both of them might not be accepting of changes or ""help"" and will be very resistant. It's also good your eyes are open to this kind of thing right now so you can prepare yourself for the future. Talk to other people that have been through it, find some good online forums for research or support and know that there are no easy answers for any of this.
comment 2: Thank you this was really helpful. I’m trying to get to a point where I can take care of them by being able to offer resources.
comment 3: Is there any kind of elderly day care available? Sounds like this would be a solution for you.
comment 4: By the way, when I lost my job (and therefore insurance) this past summer, I applied through healthcare.gov. I got a decent insurance plan at very little cost that will carry me over until I get a job that will come with insurance. Open enrollment starts November 1st but I think you can apply anytime.

I also have a camera. I could call her on the Echo if she forgot to hang up the phone. I would use the camera and be able to give her directions that she understood. I also used it to set reminders for her. It worked very well until she progressed and needed more help.
comment 2: I don’t know anything about it, put I heard in another group that the Amazon Echo Show will let you video call and you will just show up on the screen so you could get through that way.
comment 3: Personally, I wouldn't complicate it. I would get her a new phone that isn't cordless. One that she is used to from when she was younger, one she instinctively knows how to hang up.

"GPS device for senior Hi,
&#x200B;
My dad is in his late 80s and should not be out by himself with his high blood pressure and a history of stroke which has lead to a couple of black outs / falls injuring himself.  He's also very obstinate and does not listen to his family and very independent hence going out on his own when he really shouldn't.  We're trying to put a GPS device on him so we can at least track his whereabouts without to be with him all the time which is impossible due to logistics.   
I was recommended the Apple Watch but before we go that route, is there anything less tech and simple?  We don't mind paying a monthly service fee.   
&#x200B;
Thanks","comment 1: Does he carry a smartphone? There are family tracking apps you can install that will give you all of that info without the need to purchase another device.
comment 2: He doesn't carry a smartphone, just a regular flip phone. Technically challenged, unfortunately.  On Amazon they have these:  https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=gps+device+for+seniors+star&ref=nb_sb_noss
&#x200B;
I'm just not confident their tracking software is as intuitive as Apple's ""Where's my device"" trackers are which is pretty robust.
comment 3: I’m not sure about the devices on amazon, and I would personally be hesitant to try a cheap knockoff for a device you really want to be fail-safe. 
I have looked into this company a bit: The Light Bug. I like how long their battery lasts, and the fact that they have been around for many years. The screenshots of their app/interface also look pretty intuitive. 
That said, I haven’t gotten to the point of needing a GPS tracker for my parents, so I haven’t tried any out yet. But if you can find a way to reliably attach a tracker like that to something your dad will definitely be carrying with him whenever he leaves the house, it should work pretty well.
comment 4: I tend to agree about cheap products especially electronics.   The device you linked looks very robust and industrial however they seem to be out of stock at the moment.   I'll see what they say about replenishment but at this point my fall back is the Apple Watch since it has fall detection.   Thanks for your contribution.
comment 5: There are several devices that might work depending on the individual:  https://www.seniorlink.com/blog/the-50-best-gps-trackers-for-seniors
comment 6: THanks for that site.  Looks to be chalk full of useful info.

Does anyone have experience using a bidet/handheld bidet to clean an elderly women who has frequent accidents and can not clean herself? Recommendations? Is using a bidet/handheld bidet to clean my grandma who does not have control of bowel movements and can not clean herself safe? I am worried about this leading to a urinary track infection or infecting her hemorrhoid. I'm interested in hearing other peoples experience using one. What type do you use? What should I look for when getting one? Is getting one that hooks up to warm water recommended?  Has it made the task of cleaning easier? Thank you!,"comment 1: Get one that you can attach to her regular toilet. Amazon has them. When my grandma was in her final months with rectal cancer there was a lot of messy bathroom trips. Luckily her bathroom is set up to where the shower hose reached to the toilet. My mom would use the hose to clean her because wiping too much hurt her. It worked out well. I would definitely recommend a bidet.
comment 2: Thank you. I think we are going to give the shower head extender a try.
comment 3: There is one that you can attach to the toilet. You need to connect it to the hot water line of your sink and to the cold water line that goes to the toilet tank. They are not that expensive. My roommate had one installed in the last place I lived and I did use it a few times just to try it. I guess it would be helpful if someone has trouble cleaning themselves.
comment 4: I have and use one every day. From just my perspective as an owner of one, not as someone who's used one to clean someone else, I can see where it would come in handy. I would suggest getting one that has the ability to warm water because cold water there is quite a shock if you're not expecting it. That being said, there are a few things that you might want to consider:
First of all, water doesn't generally come out warm unless someone's just used it before you. Therefore you're going to want to get one with a self-cleaning feature (most have this) and let it run for a few seconds before turning it on to spray her posterior to allow the time to warm up.
Second, warm water bidets have a knob to adjust the temperature. They can be bumped fairly easily on some models. I would suggest using it yourself and adjusting it to a comfortable temperature, letting it run for a minute or so to be sure it's not going to get hotter, then put a piece of packing tape over the knob to stop it from being changed. A scalded bottom if it gets set to straight hot water by accident, especially if the person has trouble communicating that it hurts, is not good.
I've heard that using a bidet can be good for hemorrhoids if you're not blasting the water pressure. I've read that gentle water pressure is much like a sitz bath and cleaning without rubbing with toilet paper to irritate things and leave behind ""lint"" can help alleviate itching. As for cleaning the more frontal area, most have a setting for front and back to redirect the spray. I'm a bigger woman and to be sure everything's getting cleaned, I lean forward a bit to help the spray hit the target better.  
All in all, I can see a bidet being pretty helpful. Use it yourself for a bit to become familiar with it before helping her use it. Good luck!
comment 5: Thank you!
comment 6: We have one for my gran, she loves it, she has limited dexterity so we worried about her being able to use it, but she is able to turn the nob. Granted it is a rush of cold water and I think she'd prefer warm but other than that she likes it and it gets the job done.
comment 7: When I was a caregiver for a family friend they had one. It was a handheld one that just hung off the tank and it made things so much easier. I still would have to take her into the shower afterwards if it was really bad but it was so much easier than using toilet paper. 
I now have one at home that is a seat on the toilet and while it has some awesome bells and whistles I don't find it as convenient when dealing with cleaning another person. I am strongly leaning to moving it to another toilet and getting a spray one for the main bathroom
comment 8: Thanks that is really helpful?
comment 9: I bought one for my disabled (and overweight) friend. She said it works great, but the water's cold. I tested it when I installed it, and YES IT'S COLD but it works great. I highly suggest everyone get one because TP is just inefficient and wasteful. I got this one.

"I'm at a loss, what do I do? Serious advice/recommendation needed! (Explicit language) US. I (34f, not living with, but visiting daily during the week) need some advice to help my mom. My dad has been very forgetful, he's happy one minute, pissed the next. He has days where he's awesome and aware and the story teller I remember from when I was a kid. Then there are days when he thinks my mom has run off to be with ""that guy"" (no idea 🤷) again. My kids and I always go over after they get out of school, help with dinner, and go home, usually spending 3 or 4 hours per day. My mom used to work in nursing homes and has done a ton of home health jobs, and she's positive he's got dementia/ altzheimers.
Examples;
He has a heart problem and should NOT be walking more than two miles per day. He walked to my
Uncle's house 7 times in the past 4 months, which is nearly twenty miles one way. On three of those occasions, he passed out walking home. Doesn't remember any of it. He says he walks because SHE (my mom) doesn't answer him when he asks her to take him. He has never asked. I feel like this would be a good time to mention that he doesn't drive anymore because he went out and couldn't get home by himself, it took over a year to get my mom to admit it's not normal.
He regularly confuses my son for my brother, who has been dead twenty years this July.
He regularly calls my daughter by my name.
He will be telling a story, get partially through and get angry because whoever he was talking to is telling the story wrong. Yes, you read that right.
He took off and was gone (this happens often, he walks) for several hours. When he came back he was really tired, but he told my best friend (who lives there to help out) that the third house he walked into, the guy told him to get the eff out of his house or he was calling the police. Apparently he was looking for one of the cats.
Another time he told us that he had been up to the local high school watching the track meet. And that he thought it was (my brother's) track and field day, but he just couldn't find him anywhere. Again, July my brother has been dead twenty years.
He really treats my mom like she's literal garbage most of the time. He does it to me too, but if I'm not there, she gets it worse. It's not physical that I've ever seen. I don't really know that she would tell me if he did get physical.
The problem is, when mom tries to talk to the doctor in front of dad, he gets pissed. Says he's fine, just a little forgetful. He gets mad about a lot of things, really.
Anyway, I'm at a loss for what to do to help my mom.  I'm hoping that someone else has some helpful information about what to do next. My mom does not want to put him in a nursing home, so please don't jump to that.","comment 1: So sorry, sounds really tough. It's wonderful you visit everyday, good on you!   For sure, it's often difficult to speak candidly with doctor in front of the person, and for sure it's very common that the person resists and denies. 
Your mom should speak with the doctor privately of her / your concerns for your dad, you also ought to go speak to yr dads doctor, about yr dad and perhaps also the effects on your mom - nobody needs to tell your dad you're doing that.  Then all the talk is done not in front of your dad, and the doc himself can do his thing - testings &/ whatnot - for yr dad. 
Check out &/ phone call Dementia . org / alzheimers .org for info & tips how to navigate this part of the journey, and lot of other info regarding all facets of living with memory loss, for the person and family & friends.  Best of luck!
comment 2: Sorry to hear about your dad. My dad was also very sensitive and touchy about any insinuation that he may have dementia. He always, always denied having memory issues. To get the conversation moving with his PCP, I called and spoke to him privately about my and my mother's concerns prior to my dad's appointment. At the appointment, the PCP handled it very well, asked my dad a few questions in a subtle way to get a feel for how things were going. At that point my dad had lost his driver's license after a car accident so this led to a referral to a neurologist. Even after seeing the neurologist and seeing his MRI scan my dad still didn't get it and was  flabbergasted that we all thought he had dementia. Then not to long after he had a period of clarity and realized that he did have a problem. And now, he doesn't know me, sometimes. It's been about 3 years from diagnosis to now.
comment 3: Thanks!  (It's my mum, actually.)  Oh, ok, you did that already.  Yep, they'll usually argue till they're blue in the face there's ""no problem"" - very frustrating.   
When my mum got diagnosis, I did some free short courses / workshops with Alzheimers Australia (now DementiaAus) for carers / family / friends of memory lossed person.  It was quite helpful for me.  I've been her 24/7 carer for years already, her progression is slower than your dads.  Sometimes I'm in danger of burnout.   
Here in Aust we have govt services (free, if on govt seniors pension) to support folk at home, oldies facility respite, etc. There are some oldies groups for social support, activities, mens craftworking sheds, so they can have social interaction, & carers / family get time-off.    My mum goes out twice a week for 4 - 5 hours with govt-run group specifically for dementia folk,  it's really great.  If you could find some weekly group for your dad to join?  Your mom too, get her to join some nice hobby/social group.  Idk but, I guess your country would also have Carers associations, at least advice/resources info for support for family?   
Does your dad have a ""safe return"" bracelet at least?  There's no GPS, its just a metal bracelet such as diabetics / epileptics have - bought from & registered with alzhms org, cost like $60, its engraved the persons unique ID number, that ambulance / police can access the private contact details. If they go wandering lost, or knocked unconscious without ID for eg.   It's impossible to get them to not go out for walks if they want - just have to let them go, trust it'll be ok. My mum is very mobile, I got her high-vis vest to wear when she's out walking alone up & down our street. 
I guess at some point, as your dads condition deteriorates, your mom will have to bite the bullet & find live-in facility for your dad, I don't know how it works there.  Some folk go stay at facility 2 nights a week for eg, ease into gradually;  then have a week or 2week stay now and again.
In the meantime, try get your mom to take at least a day / half a day / a night off every week, idk, if she could go stay with family or at your place with the kids & you or another family member stay with dad; and/or you & mom go on some nice outings.   This 2020 with so many places on lockdowns & so on, it's tough.   good luck!
comment 4: My dad has parkinson's, and is often too  embarrassed to be with people even those he's known for years, because of the shaking. He has a diabetic bracelet and a heart bracelet, it's kind of a two in one and he will not wear it. Most of the time he won't even take his phone with him. I have joked about a tracking chip, mom didn't think it was funny 🙄 
She will not leave him alone because she's afraid he'll get hurt, and he doesn't ever want to go anywhere with her. My friend and I have both offered to stay with him overnight or even just a few hours, but the longest she leaves is to get groceries.
It's pretty frustrating when you can't talk to one without them getting angry, and you can't talk to the other because they're basically in denial.
comment 5: Oh, dang, you're really between rocks and hard places!  My mum herself joked we should put a tracking chip in her, when she found out such things existed lol... Well, you can lead horses to water but can't make them drink.  I hope you have or can find a good counsellor, to keep you from tearing your hair out!  Very frustrating, trying to help folk who claim they don't want or need it.
comment 6: It's definitely frustrating for sure.
comment 7: Does your dad know that he has Parkinson's? Dementia and hallucinations are usually part of the progression of Parkinson's disease. I am surprised he can walk 20 miles, wow.
comment 8: Yup. He was diagnosed 7 years ago. He's always been active, can't stand to sit around and do nothing.  Funny you mention hallucinations. My mom woke up one night and noticed he wasn't in the bed, she went out to the kitchen, and he was standing looking out the window. He told her to be quiet, and look down the hill, there was someone standing there holding a flashlight.
She looked, and the light was the neighbor's back porch light, she tried to explain that to him but he got mad and screamed at her so she just went back to bed.
comment 9: She also said that last week he woke her up at 4am saying my brother's teacher was at the door...
comment 10: I feel like it's my mom's place to do that, but also I think she's left it for way too long. I will look at their calendar and see if he has an appointment coming up, and I'll call to have them put a note in. Thank you for the idea.
comment 11: Thank you for the websites I will definitely check them out!
comment 12: First of all, he obviously has dimentia. Get that diagnosis. Nothing productive can happen until then. A phone call to the doctor to fill them in beforehand could be helpful. Your mother's health depends on it so take measures accordingly. Dementia eats away at the brain so do not consider it a betrayal to your father to seek relief. This is the next natural step.
comment 13: Would your mom consider respite? To give her and everyone a break? She’s exhausted and can’t think straight and no doubt you are as well. What happens if he starts to get aggressive with any one of you? This is seriously something you need to consider if your mom won’t even discuss a home 
Would they consider an assisted living situation together? So they stay together in their own home and still have independence with the help when needed 
I feel for your mom his treatment must hurt her so deeply. What does his medical people say? I suppose I would worry when he may need the type of help that is beyond your mom to offer physically
comment 14: I honestly don't know. My best friend lives with them, but she's never worked with the disease before so she doesn't know what to do. I don't know what to do besides ignore it when he's being a jerk. My friend and I have tried talking to my mom about it and she just gets upset. We're not mean about it, but trying to get her to admit she needs help, is like milking a rock. It just isn't happening.
She won't do assisted living because she has to be in control.
I really don't know what to do about it, I'm just lost.
comment 15: Oh man I’m so sorry it’s so hard. Just came home from visiting my mother with dementia in her aged care home and she’s at the tail end of a psychotic episode not pretty. She’s pretty awful to deal with on a good day let alone a bad one. So for me I would actually loose my mind if I had to look after her myself. 
Is there a dementia support line you can call in your state for advice? Talk to her GP? You need help and for your mum too. There will be options so just breath and remain hopeful. 
Seek advice from any government or organisation that specifically deals with aged care issues - start googling and get yourself a notebook. Start with calling someone on Monday
comment 16: Not sure about a support line, but I was given a couple of websites to look into, and plan on doing that tomorrow.
comment 17: Please do - you will feel better to just start the process. It’s a very exhausting difficult decease and the health care system will truly require mind gymnastics to work out - mind boggling complexity. Stay strong and just start tomorrow. 🙏🏼
comment 18: ====
comment 19: It is super common for dementia patients to get angry at the suggestion of dementia. A good neurologist should be interviewing your mom in a different room so she can tell the truth without upsetting your dad. If possible, seek out a geriatric neurologist, especially at a research/university hospital, where they are better trained on dealing with the diagnosis period. 
The anger and flash emotions are really common as well. It's a phase. Eventually they forget to be hateful. 
My grandma maintained that she was just having ""a little forgetfulness"" and was angry about any suggestion of anything further. Honestly I think they just get scared because everyone knows that dementia is rough on families. 
I'm sorry you're going through this.

"What options are there for care of disabled person who needs 24/7 care and you can’t afford a paid caregiver? I am at the brink. Background: DH (58) became disabled 16 years ago due to surgery to remove a brain tumor. Bleed on his brain during surgery causing paralysis of left arm and leg, and subsequent seizures caused permanent short term memory loss. Also has severe chronic pain Walks with a quad cane. Has urinary incontinence so wears pull-ups. Over the years he got worse and I needed help so 5 years ago we moved from the west coast to Midwest where he has family. We lived with his mom who, it turned out, wanted to be the “good/fun person” and I remained the “bad one” tending to all his issues. I thought it would be better there, but it wasn’t. He has been in physical, occupational and cognitive therapy numerous times but always quits.
We went back to California earlier this year to stay with my mom for a while. A couple months ago he fell and broke his hip. Hospital stay then inpatient rehab. I didn’t hear him get out of bed one night and he fell (wasn’t wearing his leg brace he needs for walking and holding something in his hand with it cane rendering it useless) – resulted in brain bleed & seizures – another hospital stay and inpatient rehab, but I had to take him out against medical advice because he got in a physical altercation with a nurse. He needs 24/7 monitoring/assist which I provide, and have every monitoring device imaginable to try to keep him safe (baby video/audio monitor, bedrail, clip-on alarm, bed alarm, etc). I am not joking when I say he cannot be left alone for A MINUTE! He thinks he’s fine and the second you are gone he’ll get up. A couple days ago I he was getting dressed and I told him to not get up until I got back from the kitchen. I left the room with the baby monitor and he gets up fast and falls. Another trip to the ER – luckily no damage. I should have learned my lesson because today he tried to get up again while I was out of the room. I was literally screaming for him to sit back down while I ran back to him. 
I don’t know what to do. I literally need to be by his side 24/7 but it’s not realistic. We can’t afford a caregiver and he refuses to be safe (thinks he’s strong/overestimates his current capabilities). I’m not working right now but his decisions to be unsafe are driving me over the edge. We can’t afford for me not to work much longer. Our only income is his social security and it is just enough to make us ineligible for Medicaid. 
I am seriously about to lose my mind. I am getting maybe 3 hours of sleep every night because the noise he makes using a urinal in bed wakes me up every 1-1.5 hours like clockwork.
So back to my question posed in the title. He needs 24/7 care right now and I cannot sustain this level of effort by myself, but we are broke. Are there resources I’m not aware of?","comment 1: You will need to have a 30 minute consult with an Elder Care Attorney.  The answer is not one you are going to want to hear but better that is comes from them.
comment 2: You're California residents now? Has your husband been declared disabled by Social Security? Have you contacted Medical to see if you qualify due to his disability (and not your income)?
I only ask because it really seems like he would qualify solely based on his disability.

comment 4: Damn...I'm so sorry, you're really in a bind. Does he qualify for anything in Michigan? Or any other state? 
What type of healthcare do you use for PCP visits, therapy, etc?
comment 5: [deleted]
comment 6: Have you spoken to someone at Medical? I think it's worth a try as some websites mention a ""share of cost"" option that you might qualify for even with the social security income. I really hope you find a solution, and I hope my link actually works!
comment 7: You can use a baby monitor for elderly care as well. I know quite a lot of families who have elderly person in their household do so. The monitor provides a way for the elder to call for assistance when needed.
I use the Bebcare Hear digital audio baby monitor to help take care of my 90 year old mom at home. It works really great, because I can also talk back to her like a walkie talkie.
comment 8: If you're in CA, you're going to want to consult an Elder Care Attorney.  And get the man some Indica cannabis (CBD or edibles or anything) to keep his butt planted, you need some heavy duty couch lock stat.
comment 9: I can only answer for Ca because that’s where I live, but has he been declared disabled, is that what his SSI is for?
He would need to be a resident, but If he is disabled, he qualifies for Medi-cal and you can be paid though IHSS (in home supportive services) or someone can be hired to care for him in the home.
comment 10: [deleted]
comment 11: How is he able to get social security before the required age? 
Who provides his health insurance?
comment 12: Are you sure it’s not SSDI.     Social security the elderly kind would be unusually before 62
comment 13: [deleted]
comment 14: Did you try the medi-cal working disabled program.       Or try reading this.  https://ca.db101.org/ca/programs/health_coverage/medi_cal/faqs.htm#_q651.   Seems like maybe the medically needs program might work

"Simple Communication Strategies for a Patient or A Loved One with Dementia Alzheimer's. Hello everyone, I hope you are keeping safe and compassionately giving care 🧡🧡🧡
Today I want to share a few strategies on how to communicate with Alzheimer’s patients. I hope this will help those caring for loved ones with Alzheimer’s and can’t seem to figure out how best to communicate with them.

Limit potential distractions while talking to them. It would help if you made sure that there is nothing to distract the patient while having a conversation. Switch off the TV, radio, or any other devices, get rid of stuff that could divert their attention, or ensure the environment itself is not distracting.
Speak naturally and use non-verbal cues. Do not speak to the patient like an infant with a high pitch or by getting close to their face; it is very humiliating. If you want to get their attention, a gentle touch and calling them by their name works perfectly. Non-verbal cues such as gestures, eye contact, and facial expressions are also important in connecting with the patient.
Talk one thing at a time. It is important to discuss one topic/subject at a time to avoid confusing the patient. While communicating, remain connected and present to ensure the patient maintains their line of thought on the subject matter.
Focus on simple conversations. Learn to keep conversations short and simple by breaking information into smaller chunks. Do not repeat statements; instead, rephrase them. Do not jump in when the patient struggles to find a word; they will be confused. Patiently wait for them to remember the word with subtle hints here and there. Repeating familiar words or names also helps build the patient’s familiarity with these words or names.
Be Creative. You need to be creative in countering their resistance or frequent confusion or reality. For instance, a retired patient can demand to leave for work because it is their duty. This could mean they are not engaged enough, and they need something to keep them busy. Come up with creative activities that will keep them occupied. Another example is when they decline to take a bath, you can offer them options, like an alternative time for them to take a bath. Should sound like this, “Jane, how about you take a bath at 2PM or does 3PM sound better?”
Be patient, compassionate, and avoid being aggressive. Communicating with an Alzheimer’s patient can be very difficult, especially due to their unpredictable emotional and mental states. Be patient as you learn how they communicate. Use active listening, take everything they say into consideration, and act on their requests as long as they do not compromise care. Avoid arguing or talking back; instead, learn what triggers emotional change and interpret their responses and attitudes to certain situations.
Understand that you play a crucial role as a caregiver. Interacting and communicating with an Alzheimer’s patient will have some good and bad days. However, as a caregiver, you should aim at providing the best, even on the bad days. The patient relies on you for comfort, emotional, and mental support; therefore, learn to listen and communicate with them truthfully.

Please feel free to ask any questions or share any more strategies that have worked for you in the past.
Have a beautiful day, and keep loving and caring for your patients or loved ones 🧡🧡🧡","comment 1: The potential distractions was a big one for my mom. If we were in a crowded place, or too many people talking at once, she couldn’t follow and would get frustrated.
Also, some sensory things, like if something was too loud or crazy.
comment 2: Distractions really work against effective communication with Alzheimer's patients and yes, they do affect them emotionally. Some become frustrated while others are verbally aggressive. Thank you for sharing 🧡
comment 3: These are great. 
I slipped up remembering these today and it ended up with an ugly episode with my dad over a simple mis-communication. I have been very stressed over something else going on in my life and my patience was thin, and no one triggers me more than my father. It eventually blew over but it serves to tell me that as a caregiver this entire disease process is a long and difficult road and we need to constantly keep learning. I have to remind myself to just step back and not let emotions take over, because it's not him, it's the disease that's talking. You can't argue with a disease.
comment 4: Sorry for this experience. Remember that even as you give care to your dad, you should also take care of yourself. Self-care can include taking some time off caregiving or talking to someone over what you are going through. Caregiver burnout due to personal issues is very common and it can affect how you give care which eventually affects your dad. Take it easy and be patient with yourself because you are also learning. Remember, even on the bad days, there are good days worth celebrating or remembering 🧡🧡🧡
comment 5: Thanks. I did have a little cry and then left to run some errands so I did get some fresh air and time to myself, which helped. And when I came home he was apologetic and things are fine for now. I'm also lucky that I'm married to someone who is super supportive and understanding and who I can talk to and vent to.
comment 6: Glad to hear and know that you have an amazing support system. You are doing just fine and I know you are dedicated to giving the best care, just keep doing your best and trust the process  🧡
comment 7: Exactly what I am going through with my mother.  Thank you for the reminder. It’s so hard not to get triggered by my mother. The struggle to stay unemotional is real.
comment 8: It is hard to stay unemotional especially when a parent is involved because they have been taking care of you. Patience and compassion will keep you going, love on them and give them your best as they did  🧡

"Struggling as a caregiver, you're not alone I'm a full time caregiver for my Grandma. Recently she's come home from the hospital and seems to be in the final stages of dementia after her most recent stroke. I've been caregiving for her for over a year and I've setup cameras 2 years ago (I have 1.5 years of video of me caregiving for her). I'm basically a prisoner here, I have to self-isolate for 13 more days because she was in a room with someone who had covid.
But even if she wasn't, I would still be here. I've generally self-isolated before then as a response to traumatic situations. I don't think that was smart. I've hidden my authentic self and become more bitter than most people. But, I'm trying to open up.

https://rtsp.me/embed/7sn9DS9E/
https://rtsp.me/embed/d8tQ65ZN/
This is my way of healing. I've been trying to track and chart her care and my care as well. I wrote an app for it. So this is what some of the months have looked like...

If anybody wants to talk to me, my skype is kyryl.medvedyev@gmail.com and my discord is KyrylM#1825.","comment 1: Aside from caregiving, which is it's own set of problems, there's been things which compounded how difficult it is: family being apathetic, financial sabotage, terrible self-care, dealing with the system. I have a lot of experience with it, and honestly, I don't want to be alone or with people who don't share the same love I have for my Grandma. So come talk to me, share your griefs and your joys.
comment 2: [deleted]
comment 3: Family can unfortunately make things so much more difficult even though they should be making things better. I'm sorry about your sis, we had a similar situation where my aunt caused a lot of problems for us when my Grandma became disabled. I had to get her kicked out of the house because it would've been impossible to care for my Grandma.
Group therapy sessions are very helpful, they helped me a lot when I started. I drove specifically 45 minutes away so I can talk to some people in the same situation. It sounds like you're on the path of burning out, you will really really be much more useful to your Mum if you take care of yourself. An hour to yourself is 2 hours for her, that's just how it works. You can't just ""push through it"". Are you getting any personal support work assistance from the government? Maybe you don't need it so much because your Mom is still mobile. But if you can get it, then that's an extra hour of free time for yourself.
Try to get back in contact with the friends you lost, that will also help. Many won't understand the burden if they haven't been in a similar situation. But that might be good, you can see life from their perspective and not feel so bogged down in your own world.
comment 4: [deleted]
comment 5: I'm guessing it's a worse scenerio because your Mom will always defend her? I think that's what good Moms do
comment 6: I do have a forest that's sort of near here, but I don't know if I'll be able to take her. It's getting quite cold. I've been thinking of getting her a VR headset so she's not ""stuck"" here. But that's a bit difficult, finding the time to research the technology and the finances (the government is really annoying with their beaurocracy).
I don't know if this is a problem for you but: sleep, exercise, nutrition, and don't isolate! it seems you have been. But those four things will keep you going.
comment 7: VR makes me dizzy and nauseous. People with stokes and brain damage can easily feel dizzy. Personally I wouldn’t do it. It’s very disorienting. Nature shows on TV are a lot more comforting.
comment 8: I would also suggest cameras as a general rule, especially since your Mum is mobile. You don't know what kind of danger she puts herself in when you're not around, and you can't follow her everywhere like a puppy. But it seems to me like that would be difficult to negotiate with your sis and Mum.
But it would also provide you with some memories.
comment 9: Thanks, yeh, sister doesn't tolerate cameras.  At least I've made the home & property safer, removed sharp gardening & other tools, mats & sharp-edged furniture, take the dials off the stove when I'm not there, etc.. It's a bit like making a place toddler-safe. I'm usually around anyways. We take photies / selfies out, I print them out & make collages, go colour photocopy them A3 size, to put on the wall or fridge our adventures...

"Anti-choking devices My grandmother (late 90’s with Alzheimer’s) is showing signs of dysphasia- putting too much in her mouth, pocketing food or chewing it way to long without swallowing. She has had a few episodes where she nearly choked on food even with me closely monitoring her eating. I sweep her mouth and clap her back and she has been able to cough enough to clear it, but that’s just lucky. 
Has anyone bought or used an anti-choking device? I’m looking at these two as an emergency option. I would try the Heimlich if all else fails, but at her age and size (she’s like 4’6”) I also worry about injuries from that itself if I can even perform it correctly. 
Lifevac
Dechoker","comment 1: Is she open to a swallowing test or feeding tube? I'm a caregiver to someone with a feeding tube now and these devices were never options that came up when she was having trouble swallowing, which included two Heimlich maneuvers.
Edited: she may not be able to do a swallow test with dementia because you need to follow instructions. Before a feeding tube, you may also try PT exercises to make swallowing easier, changing her diet to pureed food or thickened liquids, changing liquids to honey or nectar-thickened liquids, and assessing which foods cause choking (it can be non-obvious ones - my patient needed the Heimlich for rice and muffin crumbs).
comment 2: Same here! No one ever mentioned these products to us either. However it seemed the jump to NPO happened so rapidly for my mom. Something I was thinking about was how my mom never was counseled on the fact she will never be able to eat again. It took a huge psychological toll so find it interesting to hear how other patients handled not being able to eat anymore.
comment 3: Thanks for your reply and the suggestion for PT exercises! I had forgotten about that.  I will have to find out about the swallow test, so we will know when a feeding tube might be appropriate. For now, she physically can swallow, but at times she seems to forget to do it or how. She still enjoys certain foods so I hate to take that away too soon. I’ve switched to very soft only, allow one bite at a time and verify myself that it’s swallowed, so meals are taking 2-3 hrs now 😫 
will probably start replacing more foods with  puréed.
comment 4: If a feeding tube is an option for her medically, I wish we had done ours earlier. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing - she could get 90% of her food and fluids through the feeding tube and still eat 10% for pleasure, which will be great for you as the caregiver. I remember the very long meals…
comment 5: Thank you for that info. Sometimes I use protein shakes or smoothies as a meal replacement when I really need the break.
comment 6: Dechoker is very good.
comment 7: Good to know! Have you had to use it for a rescue? Does the patient have to be able to do anything while it is being used?
comment 8: No! IMO its best to use from behind, bc if they are choking they are panicking and may not understand that you are helping them. Using your breast bone as a support for their head while you get a suction around their mouth is super helpful.
comment 9: Thank you so much! I hope I never need it, but I feel better having more options available.
comment 10: Don't be afraid to keep multiple of whatever choice you decide to go with!
comment 11: Wow what great devices! I didn’t even know they existed! Wish I had known about this sooner. Sadly my mom (PD) who also had dysphasia is on a feeding tube now.
comment 12: I’m sorry to hear about your mom. I dread my grandmother getting one if it becomes necessary. She’s a fidgeter and I just know she’ll not understand what it is and pull it out every chance she gets.
comment 13: Oh gosh that’s so tough. I know that has to be so stressful. I hope you can gain some insight on  if these products can help your dear grandmother. They sound promising.
comment 14: Thank you!
comment 15: Thickit helps.
comment 16: Thank you, I'll keep that in mind.
comment 17: It makes it harder to aspirate. I like to use jello. it has sugar, which they like, lots of water, is fun, familiar and comes in colors. Sending more love
comment 18: I was thinking I should start buying puddings and jello. Thank you ❤️
comment 19: And applesauce! Sometimes I add emergenC to jello to increase electrolytes.  And love
comment 20: Ahh good idea!
comment 21: Rather than use a tool to fix choking after the fact, I would look into getting your grandmother evaluated by a speech therapist. Speech therapists work closely with swallowing disorders. It may be that your grandma requires a specific food texture to avoid aspirating. Thickened liquids can be beneficial to help avoid aspirating on beverages and pureed food or mechanical soft diets are also options for those with dysphagia. A speech therapist would be able to evaluate your grandmother and tell you which diet is best. Altering her diet will prevent choking and make mealtimes much safer. (I am an occupational therapy student so please let me know if you have any other questions).
comment 22: Thank you! I do plan on checking in with her doctor and doing the evaluation.  How do they actually determine a physical issue vs cognitive impairment?
comment 23: From my experience working with a speech therapist in a nursing home, it's a combination of evaluation techniques. They will probably give her a few different liquids and watch her swallow them and feel her throat to see how she is clearing the food. In addition, they might conduct some type of cognitive assessment as well, such as the MOCA, to determine if any cognitive impairments are present. The combination of both of these will help a speech therapist see where the underlying issue is. As others have mentioned, there definitely is the swallowing test with an ultrasound that can be utilized. My dad got this when he was admitted to the hospital with aspiration pneumonia and that was how his swallowing difficulties were diagnosed. I think they only did that because he had pneumonia, though. Hope that makes sense!
comment 24: Yes that’s super helpful. Thank you 😊

"Damn you Apple! I wish Apple would let caregivers install a senior package for an iPad that allowed caregivers to operate their care receiver devices remotely. My mom uses her iPad for a few puzzle apps, Netflix, email, texting and occasionally answering Face-Time if she is having a good day and can figure out how to answer. 
I wouldn’t care if I had to travel to an authorized Apple store to verify with my POA that remote access is for my mom’s devices. But I’m sick of the two-factor authenticator and other update bullshit that skyrockets her anxiety and it never fails, it happens after the regular assisted living staff have left for the evening. Yes I have auto updates enabled which works consistently for apps but not software updates.
SNL was spot on with their Amazon Echo Silver skit! 
Rant over!","comment 1: Agree!!!!! I also want an iOS-Senior. ‘Dumb’ down the apps. Streamline choices. They can do this!!
comment 2: One of the Residents at the nursing home where I work has a PC laptop that sits on her desk. Her grandson has remote access to it. Total game changer, especially during COVID where visits are limited. Would love this to be a reality for more people.
comment 3: Yeah, remote access to my mom's desktop is fantastic. I’m using Splashtop and it’s been invaluable. No matter how vague her explanation of what she’s seeing or having trouble with, I can just see it myself and fix it. If only I could do the same with her phone. People say iOS is easy and intuitive, but my mom very easily gets stuck.
comment 4: I completely relate. My mother was very disappointed to discover that I do not have remote access to her phone.
comment 5: [deleted]
comment 6: This would be awesome! No one could reach my mom for several days, because she had turned her phone to vibrate and no matter what I told her to do to fix it, by the time we finished our call, she forgot. I was finally able to tell one of the aids to do it for her. Meanwhile, her VM is completely full and she has no clue how to listen to them or clear them out. 
Fortunately she learned to use Siri at some point and no matter what, she seems to be able to remember to use it to call me and my brother.
comment 7: I’ve had to buy (and learn how to use) and Android for just this purpose. Now my grandmother has an auto-answering Skype device, so I can chat with her via video.
comment 8: Confused about the updates part.  Can’t you just turn off auto updates?
I feel you tho.  I so wish my dad used android phones but he can’t handle the change.
comment 9: I can’t go into her living facility and perform the iOS or app updates (still restricting visits in apartments) and when she sees the red circle notifications for an update she won’t stop texting or calling about the phone until those notifications disappear.
- it says it needs an update, did she break it, will she break it, why does this happen, “they” are trying to drive her crazy, can she still use it, did I know the phone needed an update, why can’t this just be updated without her having to do it, will it stop working...
Repeat these questions, or add others, in no particular order at least three more times over the next few hours during a work day and that is your answer to why I have it set to automatic updates. :)
I even put together a few pages of step-by-step instructions for how to update using screenshots (in a three-ring binder for easy access) but with her dementia I think she had a hard time recognizing what she is seeing. I first noticed that, pre-pandemic, at the grocery store when she couldn’t identify a product she was looking for and it was literally right there in front of her on the shelf.
comment 10: I think with teamviewer either teamviewer support or just teamviewer can’t remember, you can see her screen in real time even if you can’t control it.  Could you tell her what to do that way?  It’s still painful I’m sure but better than nothing.
Maybe there’s a simple UI for Android that matches the iPhone?  I haven’t looked for that tho.
comment 11: Maybe. Thanks for the suggestion!

"Cognitive decline while recovering from an injury My dad (69) fell and broke his leg a couple months ago. And during recovery his cognitive abilities have taken a sharp decline. At first we thought it was the pain meds, but now he is off of them and he is still having a lot of confusion.
He has a hard time learning the exercises he needs to do. And also struggles a lot with expressing himself, keeping track of time, telling people what happened to his leg, knowing the plan for the day, and so on. At night he even has forgotten my name several times. And will get really vague complaints like “my shoes aren’t right” but he says he isn’t in any pain or discomfort.
Keeping him entertained is tough cause he’ll get frustrated that he can’t do something or can’t keep up with a show and want to do something else, but can’t think of anything to suggest.
One really weird thing is that my mom got him to do a puzzle, but he just mashes the pieces together fitting them any which way until he gets bored. He seems to like it though, so we let him do it.
We end up watching him most of the day cause we are worried he’ll forget and try to do something dangerous.
I’m staying with him as a caregiver while my mom is out of town and it is just heartbreaking. We are all hoping he will regain some once he is walking again, but he is just struggling so much. And I think when he sees it getting to me it makes him more confused and starts blaming himself.
I’m open to advice, but mostly just wanted to get this out there and share.","comment 1: One simple but overlooked thing to check would be if he has a UTI. When people get new mobility issues they sometimes dehydrate themselves because bathroom breaks are a hassle, and UTIs in older people sometimes have seemingly unrelated cognitive issues that aren’t often attributed to that. Worth checking before the doctors escalate it to more serious long term issues. Good luck!
comment 2: Came here to say this!
comment 3: Came to say it too! When I finally got my mom back to the hospital & couldn't stay with her due to COVID19. The doctor called & asked how long she'd had such severe dementia! She had never been diagnosed with it! In fact 6 months ago was living independently & driving! UTI's at that age really do a number on them. Hopefully once treated is completed, he will recover back to his normal self!
comment 4: [deleted]
comment 5: Have you heard of Jelly Drops?
I don’t have any personal experience yet, but it seems like a brilliant idea, and a great way to keep someone hydrated.
comment 6: Have you taken him to see a doctor? It could be an infection, a stroke or a myriad of other things. Start with a full medical workup.
comment 7: All I know is that falls often proceed cognitive decline (when the caregiver looks back on the pattern.).
And also that injuries lead to inflammation, and systemic inflammation could affect his brain.
comment 8: Falls for the elderly are usually the beginning of the end. Not trying to be unkind here so please do not misunderstand. As to why this is (an internal rhythm winding down?) but it is so hard to deal with! Rehab is a chore in younger years, but imagine being older and all the issues that come with it.
God bless you and your pops. He is lucky to have you.
comment 9: What precipitated the fall? The above comment to pursue a full medical work up is a good one.
comment 10: Not to be alarmist but maybe a brain injury when he fell?  My mom has a subdue also hematoma and it really affected her. She already had dementia and apparently there’s a lot of empty area in the skull and stretched veins and older people’s brains can get knocked around easily even with a small hit. Or maybe he is just in pain and cranky. Or a UTI. But if it’s a big behavioral change it may be neurological. A neurologist and a CT scan would be able to tell.
comment 11: If they have ANY assets, talk to a local elder care attorney. Local government should be able to find one. Try the Bar association.

Scam? Anyone know if   transcranial photobiomodulation    works?  This company Vielight keeps posting how wonderful and proven their $1700 device is.  I can not find any information on the internet that this is a proven method for anything.  It should smacks of snake oil sales.  This has been around for years as either a laser or red light and other various treatments.  I understand the theory.  However it reads like a gobbledy gook bunch of nonsense.  any thoughts.,"comment 1: There is no cure for dementia. Medicines like memac can help marginally but not much at all anyway.
comment 2: I tend to lean toward scam but I'd discuss it with my loved one's neurologist.  It looks like it's in clinical trials but then I question why it's already available for purchase.

"Useful gifts for seniors with dementia? Last year I bought my nan a 'day time clock' that has huge LEDs and is recommended for dementia patients as it displays the date, day, time and time of day (morning/afternoon/evening).
I have to say it's one of the best things she's ever had and really helps her to ground herself when she gets a bit confused about when she is. I want to get her another gift that will make her life better (without blatantly being labelled as 'gifts for people with memory issues') as I passed the day time clock off as just a snazzy digital clock, 'just like my Alexa nan! '. It's saved my grandad having to suffer being asked what day of the week it is about 20 times a day so a win-win! 
She's always going on about how she misses reading, but can't work a kindle and her eyesight is so poor she struggles to read normal print. I'm looking for large print books but am struggling to find anything I'm confident she'd like. I always remember her reading Mills & Boon books when I was young and assume it's not particularly difficult reading so wanting to get something of that ilk. I'm not against getting her large print versions of things she's read years ago as it can't hurt to jog her memory reading the same thing again? 
Do you have any recommendations for useful gifts for the people in your life suffering with memory loss? Something that improves their quality of life? A good place to find large print books?
Any help will be greatly appreciated!","comment 1: If she loves reading, maybe she'd be receptive to audio books?
comment 2: Could you get her a few large print books from the library to see what she likes? Also I’d recommend a book of short stories: my Mom can’t remember the plot if she puts it down, but short stories can be read in a single sitting.
comment 3: Same with my mom. She was an avid reader. We are trying some youth books like Little House in the Prairie but she says she has a hard time following the story. She says, “I can read the words but have to go back and re-read it to see if I can remember the story.” 
This disease really sucks.
comment 4: Garfield and calvin and hobbes omnibuses maybe, so the pictures can help jog comprehension or be enjoyable by themselves?
comment 5: She still has a great sense of humor, so that is a good idea!
comment 6: then I recommend Bloom County and perhaps Far Side as well. Far Side is probably better for pure visual jokes but Bloom County as a special spot in my heart.
comment 7: Magazines with lots of pictures.
comment 8: I got my dad some jigsaws. The pieces are larger so easier for him and it wasnt obvious that it was for people with dementia. He loved doing them and my nephew had fun helping him.
comment 9: We tried that last year, but my grandmother says her hands shake too much so wouldn't really try to help. And when we finished a puzzle, she insisted we glue it and stuck it in a frame. I did like the bigger pieces I'd found on Amazon. Bright, colorful pictures. I selected a few animal puzzles as she loves all critters.
comment 10: The equal to Mills and Boon in the US is Harlequin. 
Harlequin books Large print
comment 11: Thank you!
comment 12: I just wrote about some short stories collections for seniors and a funny Dr. Suess book about aging. There are also some tips about audiobooks,etc. at the bottom.

comment 13: When they are further gone with dementia, don't be afraid to give women with Alzheimer's (and sometimes men) a lifelike baby doll. I cringed when the nursing home gave one to my mom, and it made her so incredibly happy. She took such good care of that baby and it brought her joy. Now my sister is in a home with Alzheimer's and has her own doll-baby, and it too is bringing her joy.
comment 14: For Christmas a couple years ago, we got my grandmother a stuffed raccoon (on my mother's suggestion).  She absolutely loved it.
comment 15: A memory book! https://youtu.be/6d4S66imDnM 
You can make them on PowerPoint with large font.
comment 16: And here are some books I’ve used with my clients before (I’m a speech pathologist). They’re age appropriate (not childish) and designed for reading with another person, because they have conversation starters throughout (questions like, “have you ever seen a loon?” (A bird in the story)), but I find them really fun and the clients do too. Maybe your mom would enjoy it. Large print and very clear pictures.

comment 17: This is great, thank you so much!
comment 18: If you search Amazon there are specific books for persons with Alzheimer’s & Dementia.
comment 19: Yeah I've looked at them but they all seem a bit... In your face which I'm not sure she'd appreciate. Was hoping to get something more on the DL!
comment 20: I totally get that! I bought a couple of youth books, including the Little House on the Prairie series and said I was loaning them to her so I can read them when she is done. She started the Little House books but mentioned that she can read the words but has to go back and re-read it to try to remember the story. It’s so sad. Reading was her favorite pastime.
I think the next books I am going to try are children’s encyclopedias with lots of pictures. I think Nat’l Geographic has some that don’t look too childlike.
comment 21: Great, I'll look at Nat Geo thank you :)
comment 22: I got my dad an Dementia friendly mp3 player from a company called alzproducts (I think but can check when I'm on my laptop later). It looks like an old fashion radio and has just two controls - one to turn it on and one to skip tracks. It fits loads of music so I filled it with the stuff he loves like Leonard Cohen, Simon and Garfunkle, Seasick Steve and its been great. I got it a couple of years ago and it still gets plenty of use. You set the volume on the bottom with a tiny dial so its set and can't accidentally be turned down.
comment 23: This is an awesome idea!
comment 24: I'm on my laptop now so can give the link to it.
Heres what I got.  Both my parents love it and it fits loads of music on it and is so simple to use.  Even uploading the tracks to it was very easy and there's a video you can watch that shows how to add music.
comment 25: This is fab! Thank you so much
comment 26: the libraries are open in my area for sidewalk pickup so I've been ordering large print books on the library app and then going to pick them up. If you have a library in her/your area, maybe check out what their covid precautions and pick up options are.
comment 27: Music that was popular when she was young(er.)

"Taking care of my dad after a fall which resulted in brain bleed. Hi, My dad fell down a couple weeks back and was diagnosed with brain bleed. He had to have two small holes drilled in his skull to drain the blood. The doctors say he needs 24/7 monitoring and someone always in the house to make sure he doesn't fall down again. I'm looking for a fall sensor that he can wear that also has a button that he can press that will activate a couple alarms around the house. I don't need this to be connected to a cellular network or call out to an ambulance. I just need something dependable that works locally in the house. 
I'm a bit overwhelmed with all the different devices online and I'm wondering what you guys would recommend. 
Thanks.","comment 1: No advice on the monitor but I'm sorry you are going through this.
My dad fell on the ice 3yrs ago and cracked his head open. He also had to get blood released through 4 holes. He's made a good recovery but has a shorter fuse.
Take one day at a time.
comment 2: How long did his recovery take? My dad was slurring his words and had trouble functioning. We realized something was wrong and he got surgery. He's able to speak much better now, but doctors say sometimes he has good days sometimes bad days. They're helping him with some physical rehabilitation and are recommending a walker to get around. I've heard some people say that their experience was that they got much better after 30 days, although it's still a recovery that will take a long time.
comment 3: Close 3-6mths I think.
comment 4: Fall sensor not offhand. Alarm yes. Amazon sells a wireless doorbell that has a bell unit and a push unit for the door. You push  the button and the bell goes ding. Or any number of sounds as well as flashes a light. You can affix the door unit to a necklace or such for around the neck and place some of the base units around the house. I can hear it fine two rooms away. take into consideration volume of music or tv etc. 
if you carry your cell with you see if theres a unit that will send an alert to your phone. Or if you can setup something to alert a Alexa like device. 
Good luck

"Following this subreddit as a hopeful psychiatric nurse. Writing this post because of my dad. This might be a bit of a confusing post, but I’m just looking for answers. I’ve been following this subreddit for some time, seemingly for no reason. I don’t have anyone in my family currently diagnosed with dementia, but I am very interested in helping those with cognitive disorders and following this subreddit helps me understand who I may need to help in the future. I was called to psychiatric nursing due to the fact that I suffer from other mental health problems and discovered that my education along with professionals who had been in similar situations were the only things that really helped me. Now... I’m visiting my father for the first time in years. He’s a war vet and has been diagnosed with PTSD and a TBI, along with suffering from substance abuse since before the war. During this visit I’ve seen how his mental health has declined. His girlfriend takes care of him. He was and is obsessed with history and can remember an insane amount regarding ancient history, but not what we talked about 5 minutes ago. He gets very frustrated and angry with himself, is virtually unable to drive. He lives halfway across the country from me and there’s not much I can do for him. I just saw that TBI can trigger dementia... is this something we should be looking out for? Would his doctors be tracking this already? I’ve sensed that he hasn’t had the best care from his doctors and that there’s a lot of self advocacy that needs to be done. His memory has gotten so bad and he has forgotten the a huge amount of the past 20 years. At 60, I know this is something that isn’t going to get better. Is there any advice on what I should do or talk to his girlfriend about? I’m not even through with my nursing school prerequisites, so I’m nowhere near a professional. This is really a shot in the dark but if anyone has anything to give I would really appreciate it.","comment 1: I’d just send her a bunch of Teepa Snow YouTube videos. She’s great. Has great advice. You could say something like “Hey Dad’s GF, I saw this video and the memory stuff Teepa Snow talks about kinda reminds me of Dad. What do you think?” Keep it casual and open ended. See what she has to say. Get a conversation started.
comment 2: Teepa Snow is really good, she helped me a lot with understanding everything my dad was going through, also try Careblazers they give a really good none complicated explanation of everything.
comment 3: You sound like a good person.  Sounds like the brain damage is catching up.  Here is the timeline I've found best for preparing for Dementia, I hope some of it is doable for you. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hwntds/it_begins/fz0s4ig?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
comment 4: Oyyy were at #7 it seems like. Due to the fact that he knows he has severe cognitive issues because of the TBI he is very open to help. Thank god...
comment 5: Good diet and exercise has been shown to slow the advance of dementia.  If you can get good habits started early they have a better chance of sticking.  See if you can get his partner on board.  With all of our loved ones we could see an undeniable uptick in their functions after exercise and if we could control their diet.
comment 6: This is a very good point.
My father's dementia didn't come on noticeably until he was 79-80. He's always been very lean and healthy, didn't smoke, didn' t drink, never over indulged in anything.
Except for one medical issue we took care of last year, he's in excellent physical health and could keep going for a long while. It's a bit of a challenge on the other hand, though, because he feels physically well and thinks he can still do many things that he probably shouldn't be doing much anymore. I honestly can't keep him to sit still for very long.
comment 7: I agree to a degree. My mom was a health fanatic, exercise, eating healthy ,bodybuilding... Very lean. 72 and diagnosed with mild to moderate. Cognitively we have noticed the decline in a matter of 6 months. Sundowners is a something to be reckoned with 🥵
comment 8: Thank you all so much! This is really helpful
comment 9: Traumatic brain injury and alcohol do NOT mix well. The dementia and brain damage increase expotentially. I have see men in their 50's who are cognitively very poor and unable to care for themselves.  First he needs to follow a good diet and no alcohol or drugs. Teepa has good videos to help deal with the memory issues in a non confrontational way. Unfortunately, denial and anger can increase as the disease progresses. I wish you the best, He should see a Dr and get a referral to a Geri pychiatrist who specializes with these diseases.

"(Warning: Wall of Text) My (28M) parents (72M, 69F) who are in a bad financial, health, and housing situation refuse to make changes. All of the responsibilities are falling on me, and I feel like I’m at my breaking point. TL;DR: Old parents can’t or refuse to care for themselves, put all of the responsibility on me, and I’m cracking under the pressure. Do I continue to help them or walk away?
This isn’t something I expected to be going to internet strangers for advice on, but I really don’t know who else to ask for some completely unbiased thoughts and opinions.
I don’t even really know where to begin, so I’ll try my best to get the important points across. Sorry in advance if this is all over the place or I ramble, but I’m going borderline stream of consciousness here because I’m in a highly emotional and stressed out state right now. Another disclaimer, I know that there are lots of people, millions in fact, who are in a far worse situation than I’m currently in, so I’m fully aware that this might come across as whiny.
I am a 28 year old only son of two Chinese parents who are 72 and 69. Due to some health complications, my dad cannot look after himself due to health issues, primary of which is mobility at the moment, but there are some other things as well. My mom on the other hand can’t drive, is incredibly tech illiterate (more so than my dad), and continues to work 12 hours a day because she refuses to quit/retire. I’ve been paying for a large bulk of their bills (close to $1k a month) for a few years now. Thankfully, I’ve got a well paying, white collar job that’s allowed me to cover for their financial needs while saving for my own future (401K + IRA and savings for a downpayment for a home). However, the job I’m in is honestly quite stressful, and I’ve thought about shifting in some way to a lower paying but less stressful career and/or moving to a lower cost of living area. Unfortunately due to my parents’ situation, I can’t really do that, and our current situation is only making my work even more stressful as I have to take time off and fall behind to look after them.
In addition to my dad’s health issues, the other big problem are my parents’ finances and their housing situation. In the past, my dad had a gambling problem as well as a hoarding problem, so he hemorrhaged money while often being late on payments of various kinds. My mom on the other hand keeps squirreling money away for who knows what and doesn’t pay for their bills (short of food). The home they currently live in is incredibly rundown and unmaintained (broken/leaky toilets, broken garage door, no washer dryer, etc), is a hoarder nest (mostly due to my dad but actually in small part due to my mom as well), and is owned 4 ways between them and 3 other relatives of my mom, one of whom is now pressuring her for their cut of the house so that they can buy a different home where they actually live.
On top of that, they have one house which has a half million dollar reverse mortgage (due to my dad first losing his job back in 2008, but then also due to the gambling and not making payments on it) which we are now trying to sell. They can’t really live in this home either because it too is rundown and now well maintained, but also because my mom is unable to drive and would not be able to get around in this particular location. There are probably a number of other things that I’m missing, but top of mind, these are the crucial factors in my situation right now.
There’s a lot of conflicted emotions here. On the one hand, I love my parents and hate to see them suffer. I just want them to be stable, self sufficient (self sufficient meaning with assisted care/living if needed), healthy, and happy. My ideal situation is just not to have to worry about their financial and housing situation, and just enjoy time with them without the other worries. At the same time, I’m incredibly resentful of the fact that they’ve basically ignored so many of their financial, parental, and household responsibilities for all these decades only to dump the bag of shit onto my shoulders which I’m not responsible for. I’ve told them for years now to please clean the house and get their finances in order so that I don’t have to worry about it, but they constantly said “Just give us more time” or otherwise deflected or ignored me.
When my dad’s healthy and mobility issues started to get worse this year, I again urged them to please focus more on taking care of their situation, because at the moment, I’m shouldering all of these burdens, financial and otherwise. Besides just paying for so many of their bills, I’m constantly commuting to and from my parents’ home to help look after my dad (get him food, help him up and down the stairs if he can’t make it, organize his medicine, take him to appointments, buying my parents additional household items like toilet paper, etc). We can’t exactly get a home nurse or other assisted living professional to the house given the hoarding situation. I’m also coordinating the sale of the home which is an hour away from where we live. And of course, as with most people their age, they’re incredibly bad with technology and constantly need me to help them with things like filing government forms online, ordering inspections, etc.
With everything going on, I proposed a plan to my parents:

Sell the reverse mortgage house (which we’re thankfully at least in the process of doing) and pay off that relative who’s hounding my parents for their share of the money to the other home
Move my parents into an apartment to live, either short term or long term, OR same as above, but move my dad into an assisted living facility instead
Hire a hoarding cleanup service to clear out the house
Sell the hoarding house
Let my parents live off the remaining money (after relatives and banks get their cut) + their social security income for the rest of their lives, with me stepping in if they are truly unable to care for themselves

Besides step 1 to my plan above, they’re resisted or at least dragged their feet on everything else. I feel like I’m at the end of my rope and don’t know what to do anymore. I sometimes feel like my only escapes are to either just abandon them and move away somewhere, or just kill myself. I think deep down, part of me is looking for validation that walking away is morally and socially acceptable, but at the same time, even if it is, I know I wouldn’t be able to stop worrying about them and their well being if I did just walk away. Ultimately, the choice boils down to this: take care of my parents’ needs where they refuse to and delay my hopes for my future indefinitely if not forever, or just let my parents do whatever they want and basically leave them to their own devices because I can’t continue like this forever.
Sorry for the huge wall of text, but I had a lot of things running through my mind as I wrote this. I’m sure I’ve probably left out some details or some things aren’t clear, so to anybody who’s actually made it this far, thank you for reading, and if there’s anything I can clarify or elaborate, please let me know.","comment 1: Sounds like you've got a solid plan. You're much better prepared for this than you're giving yourself credit. Keep soldiering on!
The only bit of advice I can give is to not let this consume your future. Be sure to keep your health and happiness a priority.
comment 2: Thanks, I appreciate the kind words and the support. I guess the problem is that, even if I have my plan to move forward, at the end of the day, I can't do anything if my parents don't buy into it and help me along with what is literally their own well being and livelihood.
comment 3: If they won't help themselves, or at least allow you to help them, there is nothing you can do. Help where you can, when you can, but keep in mind, they're adults. They have the right to live their lives and make mistakes. This is one of those situations where you can't expect yourself to be the perfect son. You can't solve all their problems and trying will only bring you misery. Sorry for the glum tone.
comment 4: Thanks for the input at least, and it's a glum situation, so I can't blame you for the glum tone. I guess at the end of the day, I just have let go in a sense? Either they make the changes and I help them along, or they don't make the changes and I just have to live knowing that their lives are spiraling...
comment 5: pretty much...
comment 6: I can relate a lot to this! My father didn’t want to leave his hoarder house, and now I’m taking care of his alcoholic mess. And super resentful about it!
What happened to him: he had a seizure and the hospital forced him to go live somewhere he doesn’t want to live.
If you want them to leave, you can try calling adult protective services to get them to see that your parents situation is unsafe and they can’t live there. That’s why the hospital wouldn’t let dad go back. 
I’d suggest you make sure you are sustained throughout all of this. Nothing I’ve done has been good enough for my family. The only peace I’ve found is knowing I couldn’t have done a better job. Someone else probably could have, but I’m doing the best I can. 
Take care of you because no one else will.
comment 7: Thanks for the encouragement and support. Sorry to hear about your situation as well, and I hope you're able to make it through.
I guess I need to some more thinking and research, because if I do call adult protective services on them, I'm not sure what happens after that in terms of their housing and care needs, costs, etc. But I'll look into it, so thanks for the tip.
What did you mean by ""make sure you are sustained throughout all of this"" though?
comment 8: I think being sustained means you are getting support for yourself somehow, perhaps from spouse, friends, other family members. At least do things to take care of yourself, such as exercise, sufficient rest, healthy food. A massage once a month is transformative.
comment 9: Sorry if if was vague. KrishnaChick has some great suggestions. Make sure you do things that replace all personal energy that you put out. For example, if you like movies, make sure you watch some, and not as a “reward” for doing the “right” things/for taking care of this situation. Watch them because you like movies and you like yourself (or can treat yourself like you do).
comment 10: I don't think they're going to get their asses in gear anytime soon. I know a bunch of older people who are similar, they've just sort of given up planning for their futures. You're right to be resentful. 
I think your plan is a good one - you might need to force it. 
Also, considering buying them a condo and having them pay you rent (if you think they wouldn't play stupid games). You'll tend to get a higher QOL than an apt, and more stability. That's what we're in the process of doing, and it will hopefully end us up recouping some of the money we put in.
You could also look into an ""elder care manager"". They sort of bill themselves as a ""professional relative"". I haven't tried one out yet, but I've been curious. If youve got the money, it might be a really good trade off re: stress.

comment 11: Sorry man. I'm having a tough time too. Parents are aging in a run-down house and one week they're going to sell, next they're not. It's like a running joke that isn't funny bc they're in deep debt.
I feel bad for my sister, who lives there and has worked hard on cleaning out their little hoarding spots of stuff they don't need, in the same hopes I have that they'll sell.
I worry the bad plumbing will cause a major issue. I worry about them falling down the stairs. I worry about dirty ducts, and foreclosure for them bc finances are an issue. I don't even like visiting bc of the disrepair and an odor in the air I think is due to the ducts.
I am annoyed that my mom either doesn't know or care that her indecisiveness is driving me nuts. I worry about dealing with a sale of an ""as-is"" house in a neighborhood where buyers will be entitled and picky, should it fall on me to deal with the mess at some point.
Past my plan to move all remaining things out of my childhood bedroom (I've been chipping away at this as I don't live nearby), I don't have much mapped out. So I admire your plan.
I really have no advice as I'm in a similar boat. You're way farther ahead than me. I offer empathy and sympathy.
Take care of you, though, no matter what. FWIW, as a preteen I watched my mother run ragged caring for her dementia mother for the last years of her life and I wish she'd given it a rest once in a while. Maybe taken an hour or two to take us to a movie, or a pedicure or something. Point being, with aging parents, it can't constantly be about them.
comment 12: You can’t go down with the ship. I know you love them and there will be guilt, but you can’t fix what has taken them seven decades to break. 
You need to have one more firm talk with them. “This is the plan. This is what I am able to do to help you. If you do not commit to this plan, you are forcing me to walk away. I will always love you, but I cannot be a part of this any longer.”
comment 13: I think you have a good plan. It does not work unless your parents buy into it but you have done your best. I can’t imagine the stress you are having. Good luck.
comment 14: If you've even jokingly considered suicide to get out of this situation, it 1000000000% needs to change. You can get power of attorney over their finances as well as medical power of attorney if they consent. You could also get conservatorship (I might look into this one first). Basically they're incapable of taking care of themselves so you get control of their finances and make decisions for them that are in their best interest. 
You could move your parents into an independent living facility if they can afford it. There's also Continuing Care Retirement Community. They often require a few hundred thousand dollars down, but once you're in it, you're set to transition in place from independent living to assisted living to nursing home without an increase in fees. I'm not sure what the value of their homes would net you, but if it's enough, that could be a permanent solution that would give you peace of mind. This does require monthly fees of several thousand dollars, but if you have conservatorship, you can control their finances to make sure these are properly paid by autopay each month. It really depends on what their financial situation looks like and if they have the money to afford this (aka, if you were in charge of how their money was spent, would they have enough?)
comment 15: Hey man, I just want to say, that whatever happens, this isn’t on you. I know that there’s a ton of societal pressure for sons to take care of their parents, but really, you are not the parent in this situation and you don’t have to take control. They’re adults. All you can do is offer to help and propose your solutions; if they say no, you have to just accept it and enjoy what you can with them. I’m sorry to hear you say that you think about ending your life over this, and I hope you won’t. You need to find pride and joy via your own life, not from your parents. Take care of yourself, friend. I’m sure your parents love you just as you are.
comment 16: I want to say firstly that i'm proud of you for caring for your folks. From the esperiences ive been havinh with my dad for the last couple years its like he's fighting against me and taking care of himself. i try to guide him and give him good choices. But all he wants to do is sit all day and complain. Its killing him and putting him at risk everytime he tries to stand up and move anywhere.
It isnt fair to you to have you pay for their bills etc just because they dont take care of things. At this point im going to suggest that you do whats best for them and not what they may want. Its not going to get any better for them. Living in a rundown cluttered home is a recipe for disaster. best solution would probably be the house get sold, cleaned out and they live in a nice assisted living. that way  they retain some freedom and choice. You're then happy theyre in a good safe place. 
yes you need to find a solution where you can advance your life and career. there is a compromise where they can have a nice place to stay and you can stop worrying and spending all your time. You will need to have a very honest conversation with them and explain how you feel and that for your own sanity and future you cant go on this way.
Do whats right and find some peace. take care.
comment 17: Random comment, but try to get a power of attorney for them and then take over responsibility (signing authority) for everything. If they don’t cooperate by going to a lawyer to do this with you, then ask the courts for it. 
It’s heavy handed but your parents aren’t making this easy for you.
comment 18: Hey, I’m sorry to hear about your situation. I recently had to “rescue” my mother out of her hoarding situation and we’re in the process of cleaning it and selling it. I’m lucky in that she is eager and willing to do so: but honestly the resentment and bitterness is still with me, and I can’t wait to get her out of my house.
If they don’t go on with your plan, there’s a danger this will drag on forever. It might be an idea to come up with a deadline - real, fake or exaggerated - after which you say you’ll have to walk away if they won’t let you help them now.
You could tie this in with looking for another job. Say you’ve found one or there are more opportunities in X area and you need to help them now before you move. Or maybe they could move with you as long as the city can be navigated easily by your mom.
I’ve also struggled with the social and moral ethics of just walking away. That’s a last resort, but if you ever decide to, anyone worth their salt would understand and want the best for you. You deserve your own life.
comment 19: Where do you live? If you're in the United States you can call your county's department of aging (it has different names in different states and counties, but googling Department of Aging should get you started) for support and advice. They can also probably point you toward whatever county services there might be that could help you with the hoarding situation, if it's actually hazardous to their health. 
You might also find some information from the Department of Health and Human Services:  https://www.hhs.gov/aging/index.html 
The AARP also has online advice for caregivers as well as an advice line:  https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/basics/info-2018/support-line.html 
You're obviously a good, dependable, loving, and frustrated (rightly so) son, but you don't owe them your life--especially because they're in the situation they're in because of their own choices, for goodness' sake. Not your circus, not your monkeys. Don't let their money problems become your money problems; get legal advice before doing this, but you can help them negotiate the process of going bankrupt (if you're in the United States; don't know whether this is an option anywhere else) so you are no longer pouring your money into their hole of debt. This situation is utterly unfair to you and I really wish you the best.
comment 20: I like your #5 plan, you can't make people change unless you have legal control over their affairs. Live your life and find a less stressful job.
comment 21: I'm sorry you're in a such a bad, emotional situation. I feel for you. Because of my dad's dementia and bad business deals they lost the house after he died. Mom moved to small apartment, she doesn't clean, she hoards, she fails inspections. I got a call from Council on Aging Cleaners that I have to clean her apartment before they'll go back and clean. She can't make decisions on getting rid of stuff. So much is hard and like someone said, it's hard to fix 70-80 years of broken. I wish you the best, and you take care of yourself first.

comment 22: Why should they change?  They’ve got a good thing going, you pay the bills and buy the groceries - mom ticks all of her money away - and dad does ?? nothing maybe?   See the problem here?  Your Mom is working 12 hours a day, but doesn’t pay any bills or buy any groceries?  I want that, seriously.
You’ve set them up with the best of all worlds.  They get to do what they want, how they want, and it doesn’t cost them a thing.  You need to change the formula.
They need to take responsibility for their debt.  Sell the houses.  File bankruptcy.  Whatever it takes.
You.  Stop giving them your hard earned cash.  You want to switch jobs, switch.  Valid reason why they have to start paying their own bills.  
YOU CANNOT SET YOURSELF ON FIRE TO KEEP THEM WARM.  Take care of yourself.  Period.
comment 23: On the hoarding: just start throwing shit away. It can take a long time to look at stuff, evaluate it , worry if your parents will miss it and if they will get mad. I’ve been through this. But seriously it’s all crap. Think about what will fit into a one bedroom apartment and get rid of everything else. Reduce it to what you could easily throw away when they die and what you would want to keep to remember them. Most of The things probably never used, too old to be useful or they have too many copies of. Take someone else along who isn’t related to help say to you: that’s junk, toss it. If there is some question, put it in a box in the garage, labeled, and if it hasn’t been opened in 6 months, toss it. They will have forgotten about it by then. Get a dumpster or put it in the curb after requesting an extra pickup from the local garbage company. Throw everything in your childhood bedroom away. If you don’t want it in your house, there is no reason to store it in your parents house. You don’t need all of that old stuff. Buy one if those cheap ikea expedit huge shelves and get the rest of the stuff off the floor.  The smell may not be in the vents at all. It might be a dead rat or a milk carton behind some price if furniture. If they object to all the tossing, then tell them you are putting it in the garage or in storage (but don’t actually get storage) then actually toss it or put it in the garage to toss later. I used to spend two weeks every thanks giving sorting my dads shit and filling 12 extra garbage cans his wife would arrange for. I used to be a little too respectful of my dads stuff—I’d try to reduce it and arrange it and get it off the floor. My boyfriend was a lot more brutal. He would just fly through all this software and computer he my dad had collected and throw away 75% of it because it only worked on old operating systems. But that was only the tip of the iceberg.

"Full time caregiving for my grandma (83) with dementia after the suicide of her husband. Feel like I'm struggling as a caregiver, it's such a hard situation to walk into. Grandma having memory issues is difficult on its own, but now she also is suffering grief over the loss of her husband. She's having a hard time coping, and says things like she wishes she was dead too. So hard seeing my grandma, who used to be my emotional rock, declining mentally while feeling so much emotional pain.
Im trying my best to understand what care she needs. My grandpa was sick this whole year, that plus visiting restrictions caused by COVID19 made us unaware of how bad her condition really was. She was diagnosed with mild stage Alzheimers 2 years ago. After spending time with her I can see that it's gone into moderate stage. She still has most of her long term memory and is able to take care of her personal hygiene, but is too forgetful and confused to do anything else aside from walk the dog. Wish she could forget seeing my grandpa after his suicide, it haunts her. The brain is so complicated.
Not sure if I can keep helping her. Its exhausting, I have to follow her around and watch everything she does in order to keep her on track or prevent her from messing something up. She has been thriving since I've been here, and says that she appreciates my help. But I'm drained. And I am not giving enough time to myself and my college work. Looking ahead, I don't know how long it will be until she needs even more care. Feeling stressed and overwhelmed. Any advice? Am I just not cut out for this? Or does everyone go through this?","comment 1: Yes, everyone goes through this.  We have to learn to balance our own needs with the needs of our loved ones.  And we have to learn what help is available and how to access it.  Hopefully others will chime in and give you details on how to do that in your specific situation, but you might start with a call to her doctor.  Be honest and tell them you're overwhelmed and you don't know what to do.  Ask who could best help you, perhaps a social worker?  You may be able to get in home assistance if you're interested.  You might also ask about grief counseling for her (and possibly yourself) or how to help her cope with that.  I found my dearest friend's body and 6 months later my husband's, and it was horrific.  I've no idea how you would cope with that along with Alzheimer's.
While I'm thinking of it I want to point out that in the course of their illness Alzheimer's patients can begin to wander and escape the house.  At some point you may need locks and/or alarms on the doors and possibly windows.  My autistic son went out a window when he was 8, we had locks on the doors but I had never considered the windows. 
Going forward, if you continue to provide her care (and, really, even if you don't) it's going to be vital that you find ways to take good care of yourself.  You need down time.  You need time to relax.  You need sleep and healthy food and exercise.  You can't pour from an empty glass. 
Thank you for taking care of her.  I'm so sorry for your losses and your struggles.  I hope you find what you need.
comment 2: Thank you so much for reaching out with advice. We're taking her to a neurologist tomorrow and will get in touch with a social worker after that. It helped so much to have a community to turn to while I was feeling overwhelmed by taking on caregiving. Much love your way 💟
comment 3: I'm so glad 💜 I hope things go as well as they can.  Take care of yourself! The group is always here if you need it.  It's a good place.
comment 4: Understand that you are not always dealing with ""Grandma"" as you knew her but a disease that is slowly robbing her of that role.  There may come a point where it may become too much for you, especially if you are the only caregiver.
Often, the death of one spouse can accelerate cognitive  decline in the other.  I have seen this several times as a caregiver.  That her husband committed suicide is probably wrecking havoc even more so.  I am so sorry for this.
There is no shame in understanding your limitations or the effect it may be having on your life.  At some point, do not feel any remorse to have her evaluated either by Social Services or the Department of Aging.  There is no shame in  saying ""I can't do this anymore"".
comment 5: Thank you for reaching out with a reply, it helped so much hearing from a supportive community. I like the advice of reframing her illness as seperate from her, she's a victim to it really. She doesn't want to have dementia, and it must be hard for her. Happy to say that she's been doing better recently, she's not as torn up about her husband's death. Also her memory has gotten a smidgen better, probably because she's not going through grief and she's getting used to the routine of having me around. We're taking her to a neurologist tomorrow and then we'll get in touch with a social worker after that. Thanks again for replying 💟
comment 6: Get connected with a social worker asap. This will absolutely wreck you if you do it alone. If she can financially qualify for Medicaid that will help pay for care expenses either in home or a facility. Ive had a lot of legal council over the last 5 years and although it varies by state, I could give you some guidance. I have been a caregiver for my 76 year old grandmother for a little over 5 years and she is now going to in home hospice today. If you aren't able to care for her long-term and she needs to go to a facility do your best to keep up visits. You never realize until it gets to the end how much you will miss them.
Looking back these were the absolute hardest years of my life and my grandmother has a huge list of medical conditions that have been endlessly managed during that time, including memory issues like your grandma (I started at 30 and had almost no help while also working full time). I do not regret for a second not putting her in a home. However, that is not at all the same situation for everyone and in home care long-term sometimes isn't right for you or your loved one. Know all your options right away before you get too deep. Also, any way you can get respite, take it. Burnout is hard to bounce back from and i know it is easier said than done, but find ways to get a break. You are still in school, so you also have to consider your future. Im dealing with end of life so I don't have a lot of time or emotional capacity at the moment, but i wanted to let you know I've been there and you can message me....it just might take me a bit to reply.
comment 7: Thank you for sharing your wisdom. Sounds like you've had a rough experience with caregiving too. So happy that we have a subreddit where we can connect and support each other through these difficulties. We're taking my grandma to her first neurology appointment tomorrow and plan on getting in contact with a social worker after that. Im still trying to balance ""work"" as a live in caregiver, online college classes and my personal life/time off. How did you manage all you had on your plate?

"Any1 have a parent that is constantly wandering, if so what medicine worked? Also happy bday to my sister who is also on this subreddit So on the 1st I took my dad to the doctor, he was prescribed Risperidone. First 3 days he seemed more cheery but it did nothing else for him, it made him slur his words too. But it made his ""go, go, go!"" energy kick in even more.
I have a mother with brain cancer who doesn't need all this stress and it sucks because he responds best to her.
Anyways this Risperdal by the 4th day when he took 2, one in AM one in early PM, he was falling all over the floor and I had to pick him up several times. He was unhurt but kept getting right back up, he wouldn't stay still and he didn't need anything. He had on a fresh diaper, was just fed and drank a lot of water, and was given his insulin. 
He even started saying stuff like he has to catch the bus, or he wants to go home. He wasn't this bad before, we even stopped giving him the Risperidone but he just hasn't gotten back to the way he was prior to this medicine. 
He has been coming out of his room naked with his soiled diaper around his ankles, I guide him back to his bathroom every morning to find that he has pissed or pooped all over the floor as well. He at least could use the toilet prior to this medicine. I clean his entire bottom half of his outfit and his bathroom 4 times a day now.
Two nights ago he got a flashlight while we thought he was in bed sleeping and started doing all sorts of weird things, he pulled the closet doors off the track and the doors fell into the wall creating a big hole. He was unharmed, he never seems to get himself hurt thankfully except for an occasional bruise. When we ask him what he's doing he doesn't even know. He also started pulling out all my mother's jewelry because they share a room, he pulled out all of his clothes from his closet. He came out of his room with an electric blanket cord wrapped around his neck.
He constantly needs to fidget with something even if it's bed time, it's this manic type of energy.
His doctor isn't very helpful, I don't understand why people look at you like you're doing something wrong if you aren't putting your parent in a nursing home. Like dude I'm here to do this, with Covid19 going on we wouldn't even be able to visit him if he was on his death bed. He deserves to be in his home. But I desperately need his doctor to get on board with giving him a medication that will slow him down or make him easier to care for.
He has already been in a nursing home before and was kicked out, he continuously tried to escape. He was too much of a problem to the other residents, having this old lady try to break off his ankle monitor so he could go walk outside. Ugh.
When he went to the mental hospital for a psych hold like 6 months ago they gave him Haldol, that's the only medicine so far that I've seen that's taken away his go go go energy and wanting to tinker with things he shouldn't. 
Last night we thought he went to bed but we heard the shower running all of a sudden. He was trying to flush his poopy diaper down the drain of the tub. He also put everything and I mean everything into the water filled tub. Garbage can, towels, diapers, denture cleaner, plunger, and he must've taken them all back out everything was soaking wet again.
I hate that the lack of help from his doctor is causing everyone in my house ten times more stress than needed.","comment 1: 1) Find a geriatrician
2) Ask about Seroquel with loading dose at night. Does he have vascular dementia? Sometimes pts react opposite to medications
3)Find someone to help you so you don't get overwhelmed. Some agencies provide relief. This is NOT some thing to be ashamed of; taking care of someone with dementia can be exhausting, especially when it's a family member,and it's easy to become burn out.
4) Give him activities to do during the day and keep him busy. What job did he have? Was he a carpenter? Give him something to do that he won't potentially hurt himself, or give him tasks around the house.
5) De-clutter the room he is in, but keep it familiar enough without a bunch of hazards such as throw rugs, etc.
6) Are his windows secure, your front door locked, etc? Are there any weapons in your home? Maybe a night light to help, or illuminate the bathroom at night. Maybe this will help his toileting issue?
7) Have a baby monitor in his room, one without a light that would disturb him.
8) You don't want to restrain him but maybe an alarm or something to alert you he's getting up if you're losing sleep.
9) Have a scheduled bedtime routine. They respond well to routines- as a nurse working with Alzheimer's and Dementia patients for over 7 years, I can say this with confidence.
10) Does he wear diapers or pull ups? Sometimes pull ups are more like underwear and they won't be as apt to remove them when they are soiled. Toilet him every 2 hours,encourage him to try even if he doesn't have to go. Have a urinal handy for him to use if he keep standing up and peeing.
11) Put notes such as ""Put your Underwear in the green bin"" .Visual cues are wonderful !
&#x200B;
Hope this helps.
comment 2: I think he does. His dementia diagnosis was on a paper in his discharge instructions that listed ""dementia"" and ""suicidal/homicidal ideation"". However one doctor left a voicemail saying he may have something and I can't remember the name exactly. Vascular sounds right or ""small"" something.
So the beginning of this story goes back about 4 years while I was in AZ & my parents here in PA. My dad started having very bad balance issues, couldn't really talk or do much, no bowel control, and it was just my mom caring for him. My mom kept calling the doctor begging her for help, same doctor, and the doctor would just dismiss it as mismanaged diabetes. This went on until one night my dad slipped in his own feces and fell, they took him to the hospital where they found out he had brain swelling. For at least a year my mom called that doctor begging for help, so for at least a year he had brain swelling. He had a drain put in and get got a lot better.
Fast forward 2 years I moved back in to help care for him, my mom got lung, liver, and brain cancer so that was hard and doubled my caregiving load. I have made 22 calls for the doctor's office and called back twice  in last couple months. 
He started getting worse during Covid19 because he couldn't go freely anymore anywhere he wanted, I was the designated shopping person since I'm the youngest. And he would instantly forget why he can't leave. The doctor revoked his license, we wouldn't let him drive he'd continuously call the cops. The doctor dismissed it as mismanaged diabetes so a month ago I decided to take over his insulin. First off the dosage was so incorrect, the pens say 30 units 3 times a day before meals and his vial says max 10 u it's 3 times a day when it's the same concentration of insulin. The doctor has yet to fix that issue she knows I'm paying out of pocket too for the vial insulin since the dosage is wrong I'm picking it up too soon so insurance won't cover it. 
Finally dad had an appointment, a follow up with her on 9/1 and he was able to shower with minimal help after the pill she gave him by 9/10/20 he was freaking out screaming he didn't understand in the shower and was hitting mom and I.  I called about it she just said she won't do anything else and passed me onto psych services for him. I complied and called every single one of them, none can help him.
We need his Seroquel back, he doesn't have the appetite he used to, he's so confused now too it's sad. 
Bed alarms wouldn't work due to our dogs would be freaking out and all four of us try to sleep whenever we can. Yes there's lights and clearly marked paths to things, I write notes but he just throws them away without doing what it says to do on there.
I've just gotta get him into a new doctor, but there's a 3 month wait to get into a new one here. 
I'm hoping if he goes to the ER they'll give him another script for Seroquel, that's who gave him the first one to begin with.
comment 3: Why doesn't his doctor give him Haldol then? Another popular alternative that works well for my grandmother is Quetiapine.
comment 4: They did have him on Seroquel before but it was only 25mg twice a day, not at once though. It made him eat too much but at this point I'd even prefer to have him back on Seroquel. 
So his family doctor just didn't want to deal with it, but once she saw him September 1st is when she finally told me she'd prescribe something for his agitation. The Seroquel came from a doctor he saw in the ER so was a limited supply. We are going to try and bring up the Haldol suggestion today mom called and left a message. Waiting to hear back, I sincerely hope and pray.
comment 5: Find a Geriatrician if his family doctor doesn't cooperate. 
50mg of seroquel is still a mid/low dosage, if he his healthy you can go up.
comment 6: His family Dr refuses to do anything else and for any doctor in my area is a 3 month wait, but I do have a sliver of hope. If I take him to the hospital I think they'll help him, they're the ones who prescribed him Seroquel. 
I hate being in a small Amish town, the cares limited. The answer in a normal scenario would be to go to a different town, but can't drive with him. He gets violent.

Medication Devices Does anyone use automated pill reminders? I’ve see a bunch out there but I wasn’t sure how well they work. I’m considering something that’s a bit more secure because my dad has been taking more than his normal amount and I’m worried it’s going to continue.,"comment 1: I used this one for my husband.  It has a clear lid so you can see when they have missed a pill time.  It rotates so you can set up a week or two depending on how often it’s set for.  It doesn’t ensure they take the pills but it will beep until it’s turned over letting the pills fall out.   I gave him a special bowl to dump the pills in and put bottled water on the counter next to it to make sure he had no reason to leave of get distracted.  I even used it when his dementia progressed beyond the point of being able to medicate himself to make sure I remembered to give him meds at the proper times.  
LiveFine Automatic Pill Dispenser, 28-Day Electronic Medication Organizer with Alarm Reminders, Flashing Light and Safety Lock - Dispenses Prescriptions Up to 6 Times Per Day - Clear Lid https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FL620B0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_EFLvFb33AGEJR
comment 2: We used a similar model (might even be the same one but I can't remember) for mom up until she needed to go to Assisted Living. The beeper wasn't very loud so if she was in another room she wouldn't hear it until someone passed through the room it was in and made sure she grabbed her pills. It was well worth the money. I'm not sure how tricky it was setting it up because the home health care nurse did the set up for us and continued to refill the pills. I think the one I bought had a second tray so you could fill it ahead of time and swap them out but we never used it. Don't get the version with the opaque lid - it's harder to tell when it's time to refill.
comment 3: Yeah it beeps for like half an hour.  A beep that was grating to me but my husband needed to be in an adjoining room at least.  It also flashes.  I had a spare tray as well to make refilling it easy.
comment 4: I just got a Hero for my mom who I think has MCI and has a staggering amount of medication to take daily. https://herohealth.com
It comes with an app so you can see when they dispense the pills. They have to push a button to get them to go into the cup. It holds up to ten meds and can also do a reminder for meds not in the Hero - like an aspirin. So far it’s working pretty well. She lives alone so the Med dispense notification is like another check in for me. It doesn’t lock, however.
comment 5: I had seen one of these. I’m curious: do you buy the machine and also pay the monthly subscription? Or does the machine come as a lease as part of it?
comment 6: The machine is a lease. It’s 99 dollars down and then 30 dollars a month for the service and app.
comment 7: I got the Tab Time one for my Mum. It was really helpful for a couple of years to enable her to maintain her independence. Stopped using it when she didn’t seem to notice the flashing light and loud alarm anymore. 
Think they also did a SIM card one that would let you know if it had been tipped up to remove the pills, but it was quite pricey.
comment 8: We got one for my mom. Pills released AM PM.  She smashed it one day to get the pills out of it. She was was sure she needed them.  So now the aide does it.

"How do I talk to my dad about getting more involved treatment for my mom? This just sucks. I love my mom (50s), who is no longer the person who raised me (30s). I'm grateful for this community and I hope you might be able to give me some advice on how to go about this.  
For a while now, it's been clear to me that my dad, who is my mother's primary caregiver, needs to get more help. They are actually quite young-- in their 50s so my father still works full-time and will do so for a while. Over a year ago he's already been working primarily from home so that he can take care of my mom, who has gradually required more and more assistance. He literally cannot leave her home alone because she'll do things like turn on the stove, put random objects (not clothes) in the washer/dryer, attempt to get the mail but end up ""running away"" so that he loses track of her. 
The pandemic obviously didn't help. In January, he had signed her up for meet-ups for people with Alzheimer's (she's the youngest, by far), but which are now cancelled. He was looking into housecleaners, but that was scrapped too. I was finally able to visit them after several months and I was shocked at how far things have gone downhill, for both of them. My father no longer exercises, he resorts to quick frozen meals because he's short on time. They're both in bad shape (after being physically quite healthy for many years into middle age). The house is mess (understatement). In part because my mother keeps ""cleaning up"" and rearranging things and my father can't keep up with tidying after her. Their roomba is the only thing that cleans anymore.
I should also mention this-- I have a fraught relationship with my father that required a lot of therapy and made me have to set boundaries. Me moving in to help out is just not an option. I feel incredibly guilty about this, but I have to admit to myself that I don't think I would be a good caregiver because I already have a lot of pre-existing stress/anxiety when it comes to my relationship with him. That being said, I'm not callous to the situation. I love them both and I know that in his own way, my father loves me too. But we would butt heads too much day-to-day for us to successfully help my mom. My sister also lives too far away to help and has small children of her own who keep her busy.
My mother literally an't function without him. Though she still knows who we are, she gets confused. She suffers from delusions. Sometimes she'll call me several times a day about how my sister or her best friend are stealing from her or that my dad is physically torturing her or that her mother has died (these things are all unequivocally not true). He helps her shower, lays out her clothes for her, makes her meals, and does all the housework. Before the pandemic, he tried to take her out on weekends to meet up with friends, but that's not happening anymore. 
I know it's time to sit down with my dad and have a serious conversation about getting help. I actually think it might be time for a memory care facility. I've spoken with other family members/her friends who have seen her more frequently this past year than I have about this and they agree. My uncle was actually the one to bring this up.
So here's my question: how do I bring this up to my dad? How should I approach this? I'm worried about my dad's reaction. He's stubborn and the type who refuses help from others. He's been in denial about how bad this is. Should I research facilities beforehand? Any advice on wording or angle of approach, fellow redditors? Thank you in advance.","comment 1: >\> I know it's time to sit down with my dad and have a serious conversation about getting help
This will almost certainly be heard as ""You're not doing enough"".  This community is rife with stories of ""my fucking family has no idea what I do for my loved one, but they're telling me all the time to do more, and of course they're not going to help!""
If you do the sit-down-heart-to-heart, you will be the Bad Guy Who Sticks His Useless Demanding Nose Where It's Not Wanted.  I have never heard of a good way anyone has brought up ""you need to be doing more"" without it going completely down the shitter.
On the other hand, you could do it right: let them know that you'll be dropping by at x time, and leave early.  Get some nice fresh fruit and some lunch/dinner you know they'll like and haven't had for a while.  Then when you get there be relentlessly positive.  Have a nice meal, and say that you're ready to step up.  You're going to be coming by X times a week with a meal to watch Mom.  This would give Dad, finally, for once, a break.  Go to the movies, go shopping, go for a walk, take a nap.  Some kind of a freaking break after months of being on duty.
When caregivers work 24/7, they burn out and can't focus on anything but making it through the next crisis.  So if you want him to be able to think beyond the next crisis, you have to help him enough so he can recover from burnout.
When you're seen as a help, when you're on the care team, then you can make concrete, actionable suggestions like ""now that you're getting Saturday afternoons off, can I get a meal delivery service to help with dinners?  I think you'd deserve to eat something nice at night!"" or ""I have a great housecleaner, shall I ask him to come by to vacuum twice a month?""  These kinds of suggestions won't be seen as imposing, they might actually be considered.
comment 2: Thank you very much for your insight here. I think this is all solid advice. I should have clarified, though (I'll add it to the post) that I live 600 miles away. I could, however, try to make a commitment to come down at set dates during the year. 
Thank you for the advice!
comment 3: Plotthick has made some really good suggestions so I'm not going to contradict anything. I don't know if its a thing were you are but look into any companion services, the one my mum uses is a guy with extensive adult care experience who takes his clients out for lunch, the weekly shop, doctor appointments etc. He spends most weeks with my dad in the garage sorting it out and this week they power washed the drive. Someone like this could give your mum the social interaction she needs, not you or your dad, and give your dad time to do whatever he wanted.
comment 4: Yes, that would sound like something positive for her. My father and I have looked into this-- our struggle has been that she lapses into her native language (English is not her first language). I speak it, but my father does not so I also worry that he might not always be able to understand when she expresses her needs, and I'd really like to find someone who can communicate with her. 
Thanks for your input.
comment 5: Even is she lapses into her native language she most likely still understands English, for now.  Perhaps go online and set up a repeat grocery delivery order or pizza every other Friday night.  Try that for a month.  If you dad likes you can just switch it to his credit card.  Sometimes adult services can talk to people better than their own families.  You can call them.  If your mom had a best friend see if she is willing to take your mom for a meal or to bring a meal.  Good luck.
comment 6: I was in a similar situation with my father who was the sole caregiver for my mother. He refused help from my sister, my older brother and myself for many years. We would see that my mom was getting worse year after year. He would not budge to help himself or my mom. He saw only expense instead of quality of live although he had the money. I approached my sister to contact Adult protective services three years ago. She did not approve of this avenue in favor of an intervention. The intervention never happened. Fast forward two years...the situation was dire. My mom could not walk well and had pain in her knees. She was near end stage and still no help of any sort. I contacted my sister again to push for Adult protective services with anonymity. We called and got the ball rolling. Adult protective services visited my parents house to my fathers surprise. Adult Protective Services determined that she was neglected. My father had three weeks to place my Mom in an appropriate care facility. Two weeks later my mom was sent via ambulance to the hospital kicking and yelling ""Help...help...help...help"" as loud as she could, tied to a medical cart to the back of the ambulances. She was sedated for the trip to the hospital and later diagnosed with pneumonia and a nasty foot infection. She was treated for pneumonia and the foot infection over a period of three weeks. The social worker at the hospital told my dad that his wife was in the process of dying and the pastor visited him and my mom.  My father did not take this well. He didn't grasp that she was dying or that she was not coming back home.  After three weeks at the hospital, my mom went to a really nice rehabilitation center. She stayed there rehabbing with incredibly compassionate nurses and staff. The nurses were shocked she was living alone with my father. She was doing well at the rehab center but medicare would only pay for eight weeks of rehab. My father didn't want to keep my mother there because it was expensive and found only one assisted living facility that would possibly accept her, where she had to walk everywhere. My mom failed the assisted living placement interview and could not walk 50 ft. My father pressed again to have her retested. She barely passed her placement test which in hindsight I believe was detrimental to her survival. She was later moved to the assisted living home and she was there for a week. She fell once out of bed, got into a fight with another patient and a few days later she fell again and broke her left femur below her ball joint. Due to her end stage condition, she was not a candidate for surgery nor would any medical doctor perform surgery on her. She had been recommended to hospice for comfort care but my father was considering surgery against our wishes. She survived intense pain for three weeks. Soon after she passed.
My point is, do not wait to intervene if you feel someone is not acting in the best interest of your loved ones. Act as soon as you can to give your them the care they deserve. Call adult protective services if you have any doubt that your relative is being neglected or not being cared for properly.

"PSA: Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety My 80 year old dad wanted a way to listen his CDs.  And I was thinking of ways to set up something like Life Alert.  Alexa to the rescue.  I’ve been showing him how to play all kinds of music and he seems to enjoy it. And I set it up so if he says “Alexa Call For Help” it texts and Calls me and I can talk to him through the device.  One device covers 90% of his house but I will probably get him one for the bathroom as well.  And best of all, no monthly monitoring fee.","comment 1: Our house is blanketed with them for a similar reason, but for my wife. The little Flex aren't great but we have one in each bathroom, and a dot or show in every room where she ever spends time. At this point our problem is the wrong Echo answers sometimes, not that we can't be heard.
If you get the night-light add on for the Flex, you can put it in place of a night light and not lose any plugs, or if you don't, there's a USB port on the bottom you can use for charging a device.
They're on sale for $17.49 right now, $32.48 with the night light.
comment 2: I didn’t know about Flex.  Looks perfect for the bathroom for an emergency!  Thanks!
comment 3: Omg this is amazing to know!!! Thank you so much for posting this. I am going to set up my moms to do this.
comment 4: I got my 85 year old mom an Alexa for these reasons as well a few years ago. She's bed bound and can easily listen to her music, the weather, the news, have Alexa tell her jokes, call me, play Jeopardy, etc. I can also drop in on her, meaning if she's not answering her phone or she mistakenly left it off the hook,  I can talk to her through Alexa using the Alexa app. I can't count how many times I've had to do that and it gives me  so much peace of mind. I truly don't know what we would do without it.
comment 5: Oh yeah, the drop in feature could be really useful!
comment 6: I’m late to the thread, but my mom is a fall risk so she has an Apple Watch that detects if she falls and sends a message to pre-selected contacts. Of course this necessarily depends on her wearing the watch constantly, but it’s definitely helpful. Also, I just bought Ring products for my own home to replace ADT, and after setting up the doorbell, indoor camera, and app, it occurred to me this would be useful with aging parents because the app platform allows you to share access to your Ring feed with others. Ring also works with Alexa.

"How do you tell someone about the severity of their memory issues? My wife's father has essentially no memory. The doctors aren't quite ready to diagnose dementia (he scored 1 point off of what they consider ""dementia"" on a cognitive test) but I'm not totally sure what other disease/condition would be closer, so hoping I can get some advice from those in this community.
To summarize the situation, his partner/girlfriend left him a handful of months back and since that time my wife and I have been helping out. He somehow got it in his head that the best option for him is to move to his vacation house in a different country. The border is still not open to American tourists and we held him off of selling his house as long as we could but suddenly it was on the market and sold almost immediately (closing is next week..). My wife and I do not think he is in good enough health to live on his own without support/help. How do we explain the severity of his memory problems to him? He doesn't think it is a big deal at all.
Examples of his memory problems:

He loses his cell phone daily
He has missed countless appointments due to forgetting he had them (even when reminded an hour before)
He spends hours a day setting and resetting passwords he has forgotten
He is convinced the buyers of his house offered a ridiculous amount of money over asking price (they didn't - not even close)
My wife had to correct every answer he gave to the doctor when explaining his day to day life.
He forgets the house closing date multiple times a day.
He has given away many of his personal items
When questioned about some event, he will not remember and will completely make something up, even if it is a ludicrous answer.
He is convinced his memory issues are minor and that they were caused by a sickness he had years ago - again, not accurate.

I could go on and on, but I'm sure you get the picture.
Some things we are trying:

He was diagnosed with sleep apnea and we have been trying to get him to wear a device to help
We got him a calendar notebook to write passwords/notes/etc. in. He won't use it.
Until the border opens he will be moving in to our spare room.

We are really concerned and convinced he is in bad enough health that he will not be successful if he is on his own in a foreign country. He is convinced otherwise though and gets very frustrated when we try to approach the subject. 
So my main question: how do we help him understand how bad his health is?
Secondarily, any advice you can offer to help us help him and to help us deal with all of this stress. Quite honestly, it is exhausting, so we are trying to just make life easier...
Thanks!","comment 1: I know of an instance where a man was exhibiting the same symptoms, and it turned out to be sleep apnea. He had a remarkable turn-around after getting a C-PAP-if there is any way you can convince him to try one, that’s where I would start. (I am not discounting your concerns about dementia-my mother has it, and we went through what you are describing.)
Denial is a common response in the beginning, but checklists and whiteboards can be helpful for reminders; appointments can be entered into his phone and yours; frozen meals or meal services could be helpful. But to be honest, what I have found is that whatever I try with my Mom, she finds a way to stymie it. Dementia patients truly don’t remember what they have done or said, and the best thing we can do is to try and live in the moment with them while keeping them as safe as possible. Their delusions are real to them, and you can’t convince them otherwise. You need to really look after yourself and your own family, because the burnout is real. Best wishes.
comment 2: Thanks, is really helpful. Unfortunately he had a C-PAP and a BI-PAP(?)  but refused to wear it, so it got taken back by Medicare. He has an oral appliance but it is like pulling teeth (no pun intended) to get him to wear it consistently. We definitely have some hope that he get get closer to normal if he treats the SA.
We've been working to communicate in ""his reality"" and attempt to shift conversations towards what is actually going on. Right now the big concern is him trying to leave the country. Honestly, that is our biggest struggle because if he goes, we can't help him...
comment 3: It’s very hard, but ultimately he is an adult and free to make his own decisions until he does something that gets him on “the authorities’” radar. It’s really difficult to stand back and watch, but someone who is determined not to be helped will find out the hard way he was wrong. I’m guessing he is not amenable to any Power of Attorney agreements or anything with his banking/finances either, so all you can do is love him and try not to let it be a huge source of stress in your life (easier said than done, of course).
comment 4: Urrggh, Take his passport?  Ok it's extreme measure and might be seen as a nefarious act, but... Take it and hide it like REALLY hide it, off property even.  It would be attributed to ""got misplaced in the move"" ... At least that would get you a few months time. I don't know for sure, but a reliable American friend of mine said few weeks ago that her passport had expired, she tried to renew but as the passport offices there had closed down for a while during Covid, now they are backed up a few months in processing applications.  Idk, I feel for you... We had similar problem with my father, 88yrs old, who lived overseas for 35 years now retired in home country - he kept booking flights to go back to 2nd country for a visit - did it 3 yrs in a row us tearing our hair out - we are grateful for this Covid this year.  :(   best of luck!
comment 5: He is setting up himself to die if he continues like this. To preserve his life at that age you would actually want him to live somewhere else. Everyone desires freedom, not poking until death. He may not be able to go to his vacation house now but you can take him out for a vacation somewhere outside the house, for a walk or whatever. I can tell you firsthand that at any age it's horrible to be scrutinized after a devastating loss.
comment 6: Yeah, we are of the same opinion as to why he can't go. The challenge we are finding ourselves in is getting him to stay here without throwing a fit everytime we attempt to suggest a different plan. Quite frustrating.
comment 7: Tbh I would just get everyone in the car, be like, ok, were doing this, we are going somewhere to get fresh air. Then just sip water and relax somewhere to get some space from house problems
"
"Incompetent Nurse Let me start by saying I have huge respect for the nursing profession. I’m a little frustrated with a particular nurse I work with and I hope it’s okay I vent for a moment.
This nurse is a sweet person, an older professional who’s been with my company for years. She interacts well with the woman she supports in our group home and manages our delegation for this person’s diabetes management. 
At one point I was having a problem with my clients catheter and called her. She had no idea what to say and told me to call the urologist which I did. This resulted in a flurry of communication and documentation between the urologist and my coworkers. Our director of nursing replied to a note I made and let us know the issue I was dealing with was pretty common and not something to worry about if it only happened once. I felt like if I’d called the nursing director in the first place I would have for the information I needed and that would have been the end. Why is my on call nurse not knowledgeable enough to handle this issue?
Then there is her track record of answering and responding to phone calls. Pretty often I’ve called her with urgent issues and not gotten an answer or call back. She called me the day after this happened once and didn’t even acknowledge my voicemail and asked me for different information. I said to her, I never got a call back yesterday. That’s the second or third time in the last few months this has happened, what’s up? She said she was doing yard work and that’s why she didn’t have her phone on her. Okay, but aren’t you my on call nurse?
Generally I really enjoy working with this nurse but her shortcomings cause me a lot of stress and problems sometimes.","comment 1: I would let your DON know the problems you’re having, but come from a point of concern about the patients rather than frustrations in your dealings with her. An on-call nurse not answering her phone could be deadly in the wrong situation, and there is no point to a calling chain if one link does not answer reliably.
comment 2: You really should look at getting this addressed. I haven’t filed many complaints but one of the few I did was because I took my grandmother to a doctor appointment where the nurse taking her vitals and verifying the med list told my grandmother that honestly she probably didn’t need so many pills. I was furious because my grandmother had Alzheimer’s and that is the last thing I need put in her head.
comment 3: My husband was in a long term care facility and we loved the nurses, then it came to a holiday weekend and they had a traveling substitute nurse.  She told us that he was getting too much pain medicine and ""they'd never do that at MY hospital!""  This after an amputation and other severe trauma.  He had already been worried about ""getting hooked"" and was trying to tough it out, it took the head of the hospital to explain he was ok and needed the meds for him to settle down!  She's the only nurse I complained about in 3 months!!
comment 4: One other issue that really triggered this post: she was delegating someone to give insulin and came to saying she couldn’t remember if she was supposed to give the insulin on the opposite side of the body from the finger she pricked. I told her I didn’t know because no one had ever told me that (I worry more about alternating which finger I prick) but that it was really her call consider she was the nurse. Like, I literally have a high school diploma and have been in the field a decade. I know what I’m doing but I’m not qualified to tell the nurse how to do something she trains us on.

"Created an app to control a TV remotely My uncle has alzheimers and can't use his TV remote anymore.
My grandma therefore used to drive to his place every evening to setup the TV so that my uncle can watch his favorite TV shows.
I built a small setup (app, server software, ir-sender) so that my grandma can setup the TV remotely from her place. It works pretty well and it was interesting to see how my grandma, who never used smartphones or computers before, had no big issues with using the app.
However I also just built an Alexa skill to make it even easier for her. Let's see how that works out.
Here is a video of the app in action: https://photos.app.goo.gl/QETKDqob1R31ZP5u6
If anyone is looking for a solution like that or something similar, I would be very interested in hearing from you.","comment 1: This is so great
comment 2: This is AMAZING! I would definitely download something like this.
comment 3: Unfortunately it's not only downloading an app. There has to be some hardware involved that takes the input from the app and sends it to the TV via infrared.
If you are still interested send me your email as a PM.
comment 4: I setup my dad with a raspberry pi media center.  Cost like 40 bucks.  I control it from my phone.  Super easy.
comment 5: I haven't evaluated a raspberry pi media center solution closely yet but sounds cool. Glad it works for you.
comment 6: Clever! The Alexa skill is a great idea, too.
comment 7: How can we do this for my mother in law?
comment 8: Currently I'm collecting emails. Feel free to send me yours as a PM.
Once I collected enough, I start building this out into a proper product.
If you want to you can also let me know about what your situation looks like. I would be very interested about the following:
- TV model
- Interested more in an app solution or alexa skill or both? Is the person who will control the TV remotely tech savvy or not?
- Is Wifi available at the place where the TV is?

"Grandfather sleeps most of the day, is awake a lot of the night. Doctor said the solution is to simply stimulate him during the daytime to correct his reverse cycling. Anyone have advice? Pretty much the title.  All we do now is just sit with him and watch tv, sometimes we'll walk him around the park when no one else is out there (we live within eyesight of it).  I used to plan activities for us to do on certain days, things like crafts or baking, but it's just exhausting since my grandfather loses interest in things so quickly and has limited mobility to do most tasks.  I'm trying to keep my own mental health in check and so is my father.  We can't always be doing something with my grandfather.  We can't leave a puzzle or something out for him to work on by himself because he gets distracted and will just start wandering around the kitchen in his wheelchair or will simply fall asleep.  He doesn't understand technology too well so laptops and game devices are out the window, too.  Does anyone have advice beyond ""play checkers or Connect Four""?","comment 1: What about things with texture or color or scent?  Play-doh, puzzles, scented markers, playing the radio, wheeling him to where you are so he is ""kept company"", put him in sunny windows to keep him awake, folding clothes, brushing the dog/cat.
comment 2: Puzzles and other crafts don’t keep him interested. He’s very nervous if I try to join him, as well. Seeing me able to do things easily depresses him and he gives up on craft time. He falls asleep in sunny windows, as well. And bless his heart, the cats don’t like the way he pets them. He’s very heavy-handed and can’t help it. 
Folding clothes and other chores could work. I’ll have to brainstorm simple things he can still do, like wiping down the counters.
comment 3: Vacuuming might be useful and pleasantly challenging.  There are cordless vacuums.
comment 4: He’d never be able to handle a vacuum. Even those small, portable ones. He’s just not what he used to be and I try to give him tasks that will build him up and give him confidence, but it’s getting harder and harder to find things he’s still capable of.
comment 5: My Nanny loves to go on car rides. She waits all morning to get in the car and go somewhere, we dont even get out, we just drive a lot. She also loves puzzles, but isn't able to do the harder ones anymore. I have her doing the 500 pieces right now and it takes her a little while. I have to do them with her bc she will get distracted too. She loves walking in the yard, we call it ""checking on things""... we'll go check on the tomatoes and check on the peppers etc... I read to her in the afternoons but she is having a hard time keeping track of the story. We have had to go into complex children's books instead of adult books now. Right now I'm finishing the One and Only Ivan with her so we can watch the new movie, I'm excited and I think she'll know she's just read the book. It's so hard, but there are lots of things you can try. The important thing is just keep loving him and saying it often, that always makes her smile and say I love you back. Hang in there 💞
comment 6: I'm sorry.. on reading more of the comments I'm realizing you were wanting more things he can do on his own. I hear ya... maybe- kinetic sand, watercolors, Magnetics, or maybe set him down with a little job he can do that's easy. My great-grandma can't do a while lot bc she has arthritis so I am not sure what to suggest. I will read the comments and replies more before I write anything again lol
comment 7: Here are some ideas we use with my mother. She has a stack of multi colored index cards she sorts, a basket of wash cloths to fold, 15-36 piece jigsaw puzzles to put together, large print word searches, simple color by number pictures, buttons to sort by color, socks to sort, she helps make tea or lemonade, we play dominoes and Hi- Ho cheerio, take walks, blow bubbles, look at pictures and books, clip coupons... We go back and forth between independent and one on one or family activities. We put in bathroom time as we switch activities. It’s not always easy, but it keeps her from being anxious. That’s our aim. That and for her to be happy. You can just mix up the cards and unfold the cloths and they are ready for next time. Edit- We do have to continually adapt the activities so they aren’t too hard.
comment 8: This is all brilliant! Thank you for sharing!
comment 9: I’m not sure where you’re located but I would reach out to your local Alzheimer’s Association and ask about day programs? It’s very common in the disease process for the sleep/wake cycle to become reversed and it’s very hard to right it again. Is hiring a private duty PSW an option? I know it’s expensive but being a caregiver is tough on your mental and physical health as well!
comment 10: I won’t be sending my grandfather to a day program in the US right now. That’ll be a death sentence. We’ve already got a sitter for two days a week and it’s all we can afford. Very expensive.

"Medical Alert Devices My mother is 90 and still living on her own. I live next door to her, so I'm able to get to her within a minute if there's an emergency. She had a minor fall last night, just a couple of bruises, but it made me think that she needs some kind of medical alert device.
Is there anything we could buy that would allow her to have a pendant around her neck that would dial my number if she needed help? I don't know that she needs a service, just a device that would plug into her landline and dial me with some kind of message. Is anything like that available?","comment 1: The lift alert pendants that are available do not automatically dial 911, they can call you if she presses it unless she asks otherwise.
VTech does have a phone system for seniors that has a pendant that will dial a series of preprogrammed numbers, if you don’t want a service. The issue is the “pendant” is very large and heavy and really not designed to be worn around the neck. It can be attached to a walker, or if she can remember to always keep it in her pocket so she has it. The model of phone is SN5147 I believe, and you need to buy the pendant separate. Unfortunately the total cost with tax was over $130 for us.
Another option: you could possibly buy one or more Echo or Google Home devices for throughout the home, which she could tell to call you as long as you’ve programmed your number in as a contact. The issue is you have to rely on the voice processing for it to understand her correctly, and if she were significant distress, she may not be loud enough or speak clearly enough for it to execute what she wants them to do.
Another edit: I should clarify that at least the life alert pendant that we have does not automatically dial 911. Some services may.
comment 2: Some of the medical alert systems will call a dispatcher for that particular system. From that point, the dispatcher can either summon emergency help or call a family member. I'm not familiar with product brands. You might look some up online that are available in your area. My grandmother had a necklace, but she she refused wear it.
comment 3: How ""next door"" are we talking here?
comment 4: Next door means next house, maybe 50 feet from her house to mine.
comment 5: Get a tile attached to your phone small enough to be a necklace
comment 6: I am a retired paramedic, have dealt with Life Alert ALOT!    With them, they would call 911 and the number of families also.  You get the call, go to your mom's and then have life alert cancel the ambulance.   We got those often too :)
comment 7: I've been thinking of one of the newer smart watches with fall detection for my mom.
Right now she has a simple cell phone ( https://www.wish.com/product/5cc8074dc36c9137ef09ece4?hide_login_modal=true&from_ad=goog_shopping&_display_country_code=CA&_force_currency_code=CAD&pid=googleadwords_int&c=6493229759&ad_cid=5cc8074dc36c9137ef09ece4&ad_cc=CA&ad_lang=EN&ad_curr=CAD&ad_price=34.00&campaign_id=6493229759&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhIP6BRCMARIsALu9Lfk2lB6HNZwyex96-FiCBk2-KyoWYdixQAW7WCz8uvNZoqtYbihOl7AaAoTxEALw_wcB&share=web )
and I've put a lanyard on it.   But she still has to remember to 1) put it on  2) put it on the charger by her bed at night.   Plus she completely forgot there was an emergency button on the back.   I've got it programmed to phone family, who can then decide what to do next.
comment 8: If you're close enough, another option is a baby monitor (sound). Also, and this is a real pro-tip IMO, get her a cane (if she uses one) that makes a noise when it taps the ground. This way you know when she's walking around. I recently gave my 94 year old mother a new cane that turned up in the trash somewhere, but when I realized it didn't do that tapping, I went right back to her old one.
comment 9: Whoa! Can you share a link to one of these?
comment 10: One of what? Her cane just so happens to rattle.
comment 11: I bought a visonic alarm system years ago.
One option was a pendant alarm you could give seniors. Also had an option for motion detectors to set up if no motion was detected in an often used room like a bathroom or kitchen in a set number of hours. Could program to call a number and leave a message.
Didn’t require a subscription.
No idea if they’re still around but I’m sure it’s not a hard option to find.
comment 12: I recently got the Bay Alarm Medical system for my mother in law. Very similar to life alert. Initial fees were about $100 for the necklace, bracelet, alarm speaker that connects to her landline, and even a lockbox for the back door that holds a key so first responders can enter easily. Bay Alarm gives the code to first responders so there’s no guessing. It’s a $20 a month service. She’s 87 & 45 minutes from me and it gives me peace of mind. That and a WiFi camera looking at her front walk ($20 and I can listen to the audio at her place if I felt like i needed to) and most recently an echo dot. She’s losing eyesight so I’m really hoping to keep her independent as long as possible. Two other things I happened upon were the Flipper remote for TVs- it only has 5 buttons. And a phone with giant numbers. It has two preset buttons (my husband & I are programmed) and a big orange 911 button on it. My next purchase will be a smart watch so I can track her. 
The last thing I want to do is eavesdrop on her life but the first thing I want is to keep her as safe as possible considering the distance.
You are so lucky she’s right next door! My mother in law has a good community and the little old ladies still snap peas together on their front porches.
comment 13: You can get an Echo Show in both houses and set it to ""drop in"" if she's ok being on video you can see from your house.
If you had multiple cameras you could literally look in on her from home.
There's an article Senior Home Central. Let me know if you can't find it.
comment 14: Take a look at the amazon alexa dot. It sits on the table. My mom can call me by telling alexa to call me.  you could try it out to see if it works.
comment 15: There are also bed pads and fall pad alarms (for the floor) which can either alarm or call. They can be adjusted for either sound or alarm so you're notified any movement.

"How can I convince my dad that he’s not fit to be moms caregiver? My mom; who has diabetes, late stage kidney disease, and whose dementia is progressing; has had some real struggles managing her treatments. Just this year alone she’s been hospitalized twice - staying in the hospital over five days both times. She had a string of incidents where blood sugar has dropped dangerously low causing us to have to call 911 every day consecutively for three days straight. She has difficulty organizing her medications and since she started dialysis in February has been reluctant to attend regularly. She lives with my dad (her husband) who isn’t particularly competent in her care, but does get her to doctors appointments and tries to urge her to go to dialysis. Because of the dementia I don’t think she really understands how important dialysis is and she bites my dad’s head off if he tries to push her to go. As a matter of fact, she gets incredibly mean, snippy and unreasonable with my dad for just about anything these days. I’m guessing it’s because of the nature of their relationship and the dementia. 
She’s currently in the hospital and has been there since Sunday because she missed dialysis every day that week. My dad tried to convince her but she wouldn’t go. This week has been tough for her health as she’s suffering from fluid build up but the doctors are ready to release her as long as she has adequate rehabilitation care. Doctors gave us 2 options:  24 hr care at home or short term stay at a nursing home. Because of my parents finances, they can’t afford additional nursing help at home and it’s not covered under her current insurance. However her insurance would cover up to 100 days in a nursing home facility. 
My sister and I think the nursing home is the best option because the 24 hr care would fall solely on my father. However my dad disagrees and wants her to come home and insists that he will manage her medication, convince her to go to dialysis, and be her 24 hr care person. 
Here’s why that’s a problem:  my dad is not suited to be a caregiver at all and even if he were my mom doesn’t listen to him. He’s had years to step up and be an adequate caregiver to her but he hasn’t quite done it. I would describe my dad as a person with so/so standards where “well enough” is all he’ll give as long as it doesn’t inconvenience him too much. She’s been struggling with medication for years and he hasn’t stepped in. With dialysis he hasn’t been able to get her to go, not really his fault but the facts still stand. I don’t think he fully grasps what a large undertaking 24 hr care is and when my sister and I tried to reason with him, he still insisted he could provide her care. He doesn’t even know who her doctors are as he’s been peripherally involved. Doctors have told him face to face for years that he needs to help but because he’s stuck in his ways and only wants to do things his way that won’t inconvenience him. He does bare minimum at best. That’s why I have gotten involved but I can only do so much because I don’t live in the same city. I think he will do 24 hr care and leave her alone when it’s clearly stated that she can’t be alone during this rehabilitation time. 
Additionally my mom doesn’t listen to him and is literally losing her mind. He thinks she sees the light now. I think dementia will continue to cloud her good judgment.
Is there anything I can do? I was thinking I’d talk to the hospital social worker and the doctor and ask if they can reason with my dad. I can think of two medical professionals that have documented requests of asking him to help but he just hasn’t. I don’t have legal rights to do anything but I want the best for my mom and I want to convince my dad that he’s in over his head. I don’t want to create strife in the family either. What can I do?
TLDR:  my dad is insisting that he can offer rehabilitative care to my mom when he has a track record of doing the opposite. How can I do something about this?","comment 1: You have to speak to the hospital's social worker.   You also need to speak to your local Medicaid office not Medicare but Medicaid as well.  Your mother's health is very much at risk due to those circumstances.
comment 2: I’m going to speak with the social worker again tomorrow and spell it out for her. I love my dad but his lackadaisical attitude towards her care thus far is something we just can’t have at this moment. I want her to rehab professionally and then we can have some time to arrange things at home. I’m worried sick about this. 
The social worker is going to help us apply for Medicaid but I think my parents combined income might be too high for them to qualify. We’re going to try it anyways because I know they have a waiver we could use for care.
comment 3: You can also speak to an Elder Care attorney.  Late night applications for Medicaid are difficult to pull off but he/she may have some ideas.  A 30 minute consultation shouldn't be that much.
comment 4: You definitely need to seek help from local Medicaid. I hope that way you could get some assistance.

The problem is he doesn’t think to bring his wallet or phone with him...ever...so he fell last week on his walk and thankfully a neighbor (who didn’t know who he or my family was) called an ambulance for him and got him to the ER. He has a couple bumps and bruises and it was a tough day for all of us. That day made us realize the absolute necessity of him having ID on him and a way for us to keep an eye on him.
We got the Angel sense device two days ago and it’s been a god send. The device was free but there’s a monthly charge if you want the walkie talkie portion of it. It attaches to any clothing (the only downside here is if your loved one lives alone this might be more difficult if they don’t know how to put it on or take it odd) and only a special key can remove it. It’s small (like a security tag youd find on your clothes when buying them) and is super light weight. It needs to charge and also needs to be put near a window for a couple hours so the GPS can get its bearings. The app allows you to see where the person is on a google maps type screen, it will also text you when your loved one leaves their home, tells you where they go if they go to a store, etc and gives a time stamp. It gives us so much more peace of mind and I hope it’ll help anyone of you too.","comment 1: Website https://www.angelsense.com/
It is about $40 per month depending on the plan you pick.
Where do you attach it to him? Is it light/small enough to not bother him?
comment 2: We figure it’s the same as having a phone line for him, since he doesn’t know how to use his phone we cancelled that and have this in place, it comes out to $40/month if you pay a year up front, if you do it actual monthly it’s like $56/month. We paid the year up front but you still get to try it out for 30 days so that’s what we’re doing.
We attach it to the lower part of his shirt and it’s really light, my brother tried it on and he said you can’t even notice it’s there. It has an SOS button on the front so if they need to call you they can, but it’s sensitive so sometimes it accidentally calls my mom but it’s no 
big deal, she can just hang up. You can attach it anywhere on clothing, but obviously the higher up it is the closer it is when they need to talk or you need to talk to them.

Missing persons with dementia-ways to avoid? I have seen SO many post lately locally and globally about silver alerts with dementia. What are home safety devices/prevention to help with this? My father has very mild early dementia and i want to do everything i can to keep him at home and safe early on.,"comment 1: If your dad has very mild early dementia, most probably, it will be a good while until you need to worry about that. I understand what you're thinking but, Trying to ""keep him at home safe"" this early on, will just be traumatising, and detrimental to his quality of life.  Usually, if the person has lived in that place for a few decades, even if other places confuse them, they will still remember where's home for a long time yet - usually.  If they have not lived in that place very long, its different story.   Get him a ""safe return"" bracelet, write his name & a contact phone number in permanent pen in his jackets, stuff like that.  Hopefully it won't be an issue for your dad for a long time.
comment 2: Would he be willing to wear a bracelet that could have his name and your phone number engraved on it?
comment 3: My current arsenal is several wifi cameras setup watching the internal  doors and exterior with motion detection alerts.  These warn me when mum approaches the door and let me see which way she went.  
I aim to intercept by this point
Then she's got a GPS tracker on a lanyard if the main plan fails.
Cameras were my idea, the tracker is provided through local social services.  If you're worried, look into what help you have available where you are

New incontinence I will be bringing home my grandmother from the hospital with new urinary incontinence. Does anyone have experience with the purewick system at home or any of the other devices for urinary diversion?,"comment 1: Hi! I've been caring for my mother, who has lost some mobility due to a brain tumor. We purchased the Purewick system about a month ago, and I can confidently say it was worth every penny. 
My mom isn't incontinent, but she does need help getting to a toilet or bedside commode. She's also on a water pill. 😥 Before the Purewick, we were getting up nearly every hour to help her go. She wasn't getting any sleep and neither were we. 
The Purewick is a bit awkward to put in, but it's very easy to use and keeps the wearer dry all night (if put in correctly. We had a few mishaps, but that comes with the learning curve). I still make sure she has a pad or brief on at night, just in case, but most mornings she's dry.
If you're looking to try it, I definitely recommend. I was being driven crazy by sleep deprivation before we got it, and now I can (mostly) get a full night's sleep.

"Advice for handling dementia patient who won’t stop trying to cook So my grandmother 70+ who’s dementia is slowly getting worse, she won’t stop cooking no matter how many time my mother cooks for her and my great aunt cooks she still try’s to go and make “something” because now she juts grabs turkey in the small Walmart packs or anything and throws it on the skillet or she will grab microwave popcorn bags and try to cook it in a pan on the stove, so is there any device for gas stoves or something I can do to minimize the risk for potential fire hazards I’m a 16M kid and it’s juts so tiring waking up every 2 secs to prevent her from leaving the stove fire on or even worse I’m juts looking to do the best I can thank you for your time","comment 1: We took the knobs off the stove to prevent my grandma from cooking. They just slid off the spindles and could be replaced when we needed to cook.
comment 2: Look for oven knob covers for baby proofing. They should keep her from being able to turn the stove on.
comment 3: Turn off the fuse that controls the oven/stove. If she realizes nothings working, say something like “hmm, must be broken, let’s order in tonight instead”
comment 4: This
Turn it off, pretend it's broken. We did this for my grandmother and she will complain but it took care of the problem.
comment 5: If it's a gas stove that's not going to prevent her from turning the knob on and releasing gas. Because the fuse is off, it won't light, and instead it'll just fill the house with gas. Then you'll have a way bigger problem.
comment 6: I’m planning on changing my Mum’s gas hob to an electric one and having a switch put in the cupboard where she won’t see it so she won’t be able to turn it on. I don’t think there’s anything you can do with gas though you could maybe ask a plumber.
comment 7: Thank you for this I’ll look into to this and see if I can manage to do this
comment 8: It’s possible to turn the gas off to most gas appliances. Depending on your gas company, you may be able to call them, explain the situation and get a tech to come out and turn it off for you, or get a plumber. (In the United States)
comment 9: Get an induction stove and put the pots/pans that work on it in a locked cabinet.

"I'm afraid my mom might have early onset dementia but she refuses to get checked I'm in bed crying, shaking. I'm sorry if this is not coherent. My mom is turning 62 this year, I'm 26, I have no other siblings and my dad passed away last year. It's just the two of us.
It's just been getting worse in the past years. Six years ago she forgot the water boiler running over night and the thing almost exploded. Then she forgot where she parked the car and claimed it was stolen five years ago.
Two and a half years ago, before he died, my dad started worrying about her mental health and saying that she is constantly forgetting things. He was extremely worried about her and always told me about it. My dad died last year unexpectedly. It's just gone downhill since with her health, even though they had been divorced. I live in a different town. His death was extremely hard on me. Mom still works full time.
Lately she's been low on energy and having difficulty concentrating. She's being forgetful and it's only made worse by her OCD like tendency to arrange every single thing, she literally drops an action in the air and forgets it to arrange something that is off to her. She always runs late everywhere and loses track of time. She always forgets where she puts things and has started to lose some of them. She's also had changes in demeanor and is acting very negativistic all the time, and screams at the cats for nonsense all the time. Two of the cats got in a fight earlier and she screamed so hard at them her voice shattered and she had a coughing fit. 
Even when dad was still alive she always refused to get checked. No matter what we told her. Today I just about had it with her bizarre attitudes and I looked up signs. the guide said that people with mild dementia have issues drawing, so I did the reccomend test and asked her to draw a clock. She refused vehemently until she drew some circles with legs, the actual clock at the very end and forgetting about the pointers. I rushed to my room crying.
She walked in on my room while I was writing this and brushed everything off and was asking me why I was crying and didn't try to console me or nothing, just walked out after ridiculing me for worrying.
I'm terrified. She's all I have left of my family. I'm so scared. What can I do?","comment 1: Get her to see a doctor asap.  And as for you, I think you should join a local support group, preferably one you can attend virtually right now or maybe in a park or something csuse of covid.  Or post here ofyen if it helps.
comment 2: Sounds incredibly difficult. Sorry to hear you're in such a challenging situation. She would need a physical to make sure there is something out of sorts with her bloods etc before concluding. There are lots of other things that can effect memory. Early onset often runs genetically? Is this the case in your family? Keep encouraging her to see someone.
""Memory loss can just be a natural part of getting older.
Sometimes it may be caused by something common and treatable like:
stress
anxiety or depression
sleeping problems (insomnia)
Occasionally, memory loss can be a sign of something more serious, such as dementia.
Do not try to self-diagnose the cause of your memory loss – always see a GP.""
comment 3: THIS what bsl1989 says. Do not try to self-diagnose. 
As a psychologist in dementia care, I cannot stress enough that there are more possible causes for memory loss  then only dementia. 
Be aware of the confirmation bias - the tendency to search for or recall information that supports your idea that the memory loss is caused bu dementia. 
Not to say that you shouldnt be worried. Seeing a loved one forgetting more an more and there behavior changing for the worse is devastating. So keep trying to get her to the GP.
comment 4: Just to reinforce this. I'm a mental health nurse on a dementia assessment unit. Before any cognitive assessment are done a full physical is complete to rule out any other causes. There have been many occasions where the route cause was an underlying physical issue and/ or depression/ delirium. When resolved the individual cognition improved.
comment 5: How can psychologists help dementia patients when thry csnt retain the sessions?  
Asking csuse I feel like my dad needs mental help but afraid it wouldn't help at all.
comment 6: First, it can be helpful to have mental problems and their cause diagnosed. It can offer some perspective of treatment possibilities. For example, depression can be primarily caused by brain damage in dementia, or secondary, due to loss experiences or increased feeling of lonliness. 
A lot of therapies are based on talking about cognitions and involve home work excercises, etc. Like you said, this is not suitable for most dementia patients, because they wont remember last weeks session. That doenst mean that dementia patients are not treatable, because there are a lot of different treatment options. 
Most important aspect of treating mental problems in dementia patients,  is the use of the social system around the patients. Which basically means that the family/care taker/nurse/etc. needs to be involved in the treatment, receive psycho-education and carry out the advice.
comment 7: Thanks
comment 8: I am sorry to hear about the struggles with your mom. As a daughter of a mother with early onset Alzheimer’s (she’s 55 and in her 3rd year of hell) I can only encourage you to get help. 
Is there some way to get someone from social services or another doctor to come to your house to just chat? I know that seems a little out of bounds during Covid, but it’s worth a shot.
I would also encourage support groups, as well as reaching out here. I am available if you would like to DM me, going at it alone just isn’t an option. 
Do you have grandparents or aunts/uncles you could reach out to for support?
You don’t have to go it alone but you do have to take some action if you’re concerned.
All the best - and please reach out if you need anything. I’m no pro but I have begun the journey and I’d happily share with you what I’ve learned.
Xoxo
comment 9: I live with my grandmother, she has very obvious dementia and it is difficult. I have no great advice for getting a diagnosis but for your own sanity try to remember that ultimately it is her own decision to get checked out and you might find contacting social services useful for achieving that tactfully. You're completely entitled to feeling upset despite your mothers judgement, I hope you manage to get some clarity and feel better soon! X
comment 10: You've already taken the first step, reaching out for help.  Keep reaching until you feel whole again.
comment 11: If you know who her doctor is, contact them and tell them what you think is happening. They can request an appointment to test her.  They will have her take a CT Scan then go somewhere for a memory test. After those two examinations, they will diagnose what she has. 
From my experience with several relatives with dementia. It definitely sounds like she has it.
comment 12: Don't ask her to draw anything if that bothers you. Let her be in a situation that's comfortable to her and you'll probably be more comfortable together. As we age we may be less reactive to the environment if we are disconnected from fresh air, sunlight, water and regular walks. If her house is all she knows, she's showing you what she understands.
comment 13: Use her being tired constantly to see if you can use that to get her into the doctor. Make sure she signs over HIPAA to you so that the doctor can talk to you about her, otherwise he or she is not allowed to do so.
comment 14: For what it’s worth, my dad is 78, he has a head injury and what may be early onset dementia. Here’s the thing. He was just diagnosed with mild heart failure which may have been going on for a long time undiagnosed , also had a very mild and undiagnosed UTI. It was getting to the point where he was confused, home but didn’t know where or when he was. Thought his house was a copy of his house. Bad, like looking for assisted living bad. Then... treated for congestive heart failure& UTI and wow what a difference.  He’s still got major issues, but is much better oriented.  I’m sorry about your mom. Try and not freak out,  undiagnosed physical issues can be big contributors. But she has to go in.

"Discreet GPS trackers? My dad has Alzheimer's and is getting lost but refuses to have a life-alert type device. I would love to have something like a Tile sticker, that I could just stick on the hat he wears daily, or his shoe or keys, but they only range 400 feet. Has anyone dealt with this or have a more discreet solution?","comment 1: If he has an iPhone you can turn on “find my iPhone” and sync to yours. You can see where the phone at all times.
Edit: omg actually I remember I saw on Keeping Up With The Kardashians there was an episode where Kris got MJ some shoes or an insole or something that was a GPS tracker. I’ll try to find it.
Edit 2: here it is!!
comment 2: There are trackers that are developed for people with disabilities (think autism and likely to wander) that are designed to be sewn into clothing, or in insoles you insert in the shoes, so it’s not even noticeable (and therefore great for people with sensory sensitivities.) You’d just have to figure out what your dad would absolutely never wander without- if he has one set of sneakers he wears every day, etc. because if he decides to wander out in his slippers it doesn’t help at all.
comment 3: Cellular connected watch, if you could somehow get him to wear it?
comment 4: Look into cat / dog gps trackers they are small and lightweight as they are designed to attach to the collar.
comment 5: We use iTraq Nano for my dad with alzheimer's. It's a pretty unobtrusive/obvious looking device and is very affordable.
comment 6: It's terrifying. I remember the first time I lost my Mom. She called me, and said she was lost. Problem is, she wouldn't just stay still, so I was running all over, apparently just missing her.
I had to get the pros in on it. I couldn't have found her on my own.
Be aware, too, of the wandering associated with sundowning. Thankfully, by the time my mom started that, she was in a memory care unit with alarms on the doors. The nurses would call me at midnight, and she would be totally freaking out.
When this happens, here are my words of wisdom: agree with him, no matter what he says, and then distract him with anything silly, like making faces or telling dirty jokes. He'll settle down.
Good luck on your journey. I wish I'd had alarms for my mom.
comment 7: What about having a front doorbell cam that connects to your iPhone and alerts you to motion at his home. You could know when he leaves the house and starts wandering. Sometimes he might not take/ wear whatever you stick the device on so maybe both methods would be a good backup to the other.
comment 8: I just installed two Blink cameras at my dad's house. One on the front door and one on the back. They're motion cams and also provide a great view of the bedroom hall and the office. I sold the story about how they're great intruder cams. In reality, they're a fantastic way for me to make sure he gets up every day, hasn't fallen, and has fed the dog. If there's wifi at his house, I highly recommend.

"Elderly Tracker Good afternoon! I am writing to see if anyone has advice on a tracker or something that I can make sure my grandfather has on him at all times so he can feel safe. He can’t remember anyone’s phone numbers or our home address and he’s worried that he will be forgotten somewhere. The likelihood of this happening is extremely rare since he is not mobile and basically wheelchair ridden. He says that he’s worried his caretaker will forget him on a walk (this would never happen either) I printed multiple business cards with emergency phone numbers and our home address for him to carry. He also has an iPhone and he can tell Siri to call people but he doesn’t think he’ll have his phone on him for whatever reason since it’s basically just to yell at Siri and ask her questions😋 
Thanks in advance!","comment 1: The problem isn't preparing for him getting ""lost"" (which will never happen), the problem is his anxiety.  Is he on anxiety meds?  Do they need to be adjusted?
comment 2: Does he want you to be able to track him down, or just someone able to call his contacts? If it's about just having phone numbers, an emergency bracelet would work well and be very visible/reassuring to him. If it's more about being found by you--this is going to sound weird, but they make dog tags with GPS. You could put it on his keychain?
comment 3: What are the chances he'll ever wander off without the wheelchair? You could get a GPS tracker/logger like trucking companies use to make sure their drivers aren't at the strip club during their shift. 
I don't have time to find the best option right now, but ideally you'd be able to find one that doesn't require the use of a manufacturer's tracking website subscription and you can just pop a 3G simcard in and call it, or configure it to check in to your own website, or something. It'd probably be worth seeing if there's a subreddit that knows more about these kinds of devices (r/spygear or r/stalker etc. ;).
Anyway, strap one onto the bottom of the wheelchair and you'll always(?) know where he is. :) Furthermore to his anxiety about being left somewhere, you could tell him that the tracker is on the wheelchair and that you'll always know where he is as long as he's in the wheelchair could do double-duty in motivating him not to wander off without the chair (memory issues aside).
comment 4: Hi OP
Have you contacted your local Office on Aging and Disability Services? Look up the phone # for the office in your county—- ours offers a free tracking bracelet. You have to inquire and qualify and get approved for this. (it’s connected to the sheriff’s office— if and when they go wander off, and it’s serious, you can call 911 and police who are trained in the program know how to locate the person)
I doubt every county has this, but it’s worth asking!
comment 5: I haven’t used this but it looks great to me, I believe another redditor posted this recently - it’s an in-home monitor for folks who don’t want to wear one.  Link
comment 6: I know this sounds odd but if he's more worried he will be forgotten maybe a GPS tracker of some kind would do the trick, if there is more concern about him falling or getting hurt and having no way to reach the phone something like life alert.
comment 7: I bought my grandma a Relay Go.
comment 8: Red Cross have a teleassistance service in my country. I had to pay 12€ a month. It is basically a red button he can press at home and contacts directly with their call center for any emergency. I think they got a mobile version.
But as it has been said, probably his issues are more anxiety related. I think he might keep pressing the button again and again if not able to understand the system.
Well, on the other side the service works well. Nobody like you know the situation better, so you get to decide if that would reduce the anxiety problem or would be a button he will keep pressing.
comment 9: We all lean over and inspect David’s card and Price quietly says, “That’s really nice.”
A brief spasm of jealousy courses through me when I notice the elegance of the color and the classy type. I clench my fist as Van Patten says, smugly, “Eggshell with Romalian type...” He turns to me. “What do you think?”
“Nice,” I croak, but manage to nod, as the busboy brings four fresh Bellinis.

"How to get grandmother with alzheimer's up to eat She wants to do nothing but lay in bed and sleep. Even if we manage to get her out of bed, she wants to go right back to bed. One track mind on it. Even if I just try to have her sit up in bed to eat, she refuses and lays back down.
How do I get her up to eat?","comment 1: My dad's appetite is almost non existent as well, and he fights us when we push him to eat. Thankfully, he does seem to love to drink Ensure which helps. We keep his meals small and simple; half a sandwich, piece of toast with peanut butter and/or jam. Nothing that might upset his stomach. Food he can eat with his hands seems to work best. Meals needing utensils are a problem for him.   Good luck on this journey.
comment 2: Excellent advice from u/plushygood, but additionally you may want to look at her bed.  If she's in bed a majority of the time she'll need a sleeping surface that isn't likely to make bedsores.
comment 3: I just try to find their favorite foods and offer them to them alllll day. They tend to graze or snack. She may even need a purée or “mechanical” diet.
comment 4: My grandmother is the same way. I second the advice that u/plushygood recommended. We will give my grandmother Ensure which she doesn’t mind drinking since she wants nothing to do with food. She’s in the late stages of Alzheimer’s and is 85, so we do what we can to make sure she gets some form of nutrition.
Another thing that helps (in my case) is feeding my grandmother and bribing her with something so she finishes her food. She loves coffee so if I give her a bagel for breakfast, I’ll tell her that if she finishes it, she can have coffee. (She’ll get it regardless, I always make it for her breakfast, but she doesn’t remember that anyways so it works out)
Finally I make sure she drinks lots of water. It keeps her metabolism up so that she’ll get hungry quicker so she’ll eat more often. Rejecting a big meal is common, so stick with smaller meals throughout the day. If your grandmother is like mine and doesn’t remember when she last ate/what she ate, you can just lie if she rejects a snack and say that she hasn’t eaten all day and should eat regardless. 
I’m on mobile so formatting is weird, but I hope these help.
comment 5: My mom is late stage. We feed her sitting up in bed, mostly homemade cream soups, smoothies, and food put through a chopper.  She will not eat and is combative unless she is taking a low dose of Olanzapine twice a day. There are potential side effects, but she won't eat without being on that med.
comment 6: I know this sounds harsh, but when my mother gets to that point, I’m not going to try and force her to eat. What’s the point? Her Alzheimer’s is only going in one direction and it’s not a good one. This is nature taking its course.
comment 7: I second this. It's a tough decision to make, but prolonging their life rarely brings any good.
comment 8: I hope she has a medical bed so you can easily elevate her when feeding her in bed.
comment 9: Unfortunately not. Wish she did, but she still sleeps in her original bed next to her husband. She can get in and out of it fine, she just refuses to sit up and eat in it
comment 10: Ater getting my father on a Meyers cocktail, he ate everything in site. Lasted about 1 month. I don’t have proof that did the trick but we plan on getting a nurse to give this to him once a month. There are companies that will send a nurse to the house for Ivdrip. Likely to require a doctors prescription. Might be worth a try if the doc is OK with it.
comment 11: Is there anything that your grandma still enjoys doing, or watching, that you could combine with feeding her? Or a special dessert she loves that she would get out of bed to eat?
If she is depressed (common with Alzheimer's patients,) maybe a trip to the doctor for medication would help.?
I didn't have any problems with my husband. He eats like a horse... even through his PEG tube! I will pray for you and your family 🧡.
comment 12: In addition to Ensure, it's worth talking about depression to her doctor if you haven't already. My mom was in the early to mid stage and started refusing to get out of bed. She was suffering from depression. Once they figured out a mild antidepressant that worked effectively, she returned to as normal as she can be with this disease.
comment 13: Same. A low dose of antidepressant really turned things around for my Mum. Previously she was refusing to eat and going to bed at 2pm.
comment 14: From experience, pudding, ice cream or meal replacement drinks or ensure. 
They seem to be more willing to eat sweeter foods.

"Guys, my mom is in such a horrible situation and I’m at a total loss... Has anyone had any experience talking to the Alzheimer’s Association? Hey y’all. 
My mom is in the moderate level of Alzheimer’s, creeping closer into the severe. It’s been a year since her diagnosis, but several years of losing cognitive function after suffering the trauma of breaking her femur and the process of going under anesthesia for surgery. 
Quick context of her life: my dad left when I was 7, I’m now 35. I have 4 older siblings, with the oldest 11 years my senior. Mom didn’t get remarried until about 9 years ago, after we were all married & moved out/away. She married the widower of a woman she was very close friends with for 30+ years... she had NEVER shown any interest in being with anyone my whole life after my dad. She was more interested in being involved with me and my siblings lives. Classic selfless single mother. 
But when her friend died suddenly a decade or so ago, the widower started coming around and wanting to spend time with my mom. She resisted it SO HARD. But he was persistent and eventually “won her over”. I think she thought it would be wrong to get with her late friend’s husband. My mom is also the classic good Catholic girl; had only ever been with my dad, etc. And that Catholic guilt & worrying what other people would think made her very hesitant to start dating him. 
So, in my opinion, her choice to finally marry him was a combination of fear and security. My mom always struggled with money. Worked 3 jobs, a total hustler, but always in debt because she wanted to give all us kids everything. She’s never been fully mentally strong and healthy. Depression & anxiety, that I used to think was just caused by my dad cheating & leaving her, but I’ve come to realize is just ever-present in her family history and upbringing. Nevertheless, she thought “wow, this is a nice man that wants to be with me, who showers me with gifts and takes me on fancy trips, and who seems really happy and funny and fun — surely this can’t be a bad thing to have financial stability and to be with someone who will take care of me, to have companionship, etc.” And honestly, for the first 4ish years it was great. The first time in my life I wasn’t just worried about my mom and the fact that she was alone and didn’t have anyone to count on (besides her kids).
Fast forward to now. Her husband has lost more and more of his hearing - which has been a big frustration for both of them in communicating. But sometimes I think he exaggerates and uses it as an excuse. Because oftentimes he will hear things from other people but have to shout “What?!” when it’s my mom who is talking....
But long story short, he is a terrible, HORRIBLE caregiver. He’ll admit it too. But he does NOTHING to fix it. For over a year now, my sisters and I have been giving him books, sending him resources, suggesting things to make his life easier... guys, I can’t stress enough to you how dense this man is. He’s 74 and a boomer to his core. His emotional intelligence is non-existent. Once at the doctors office he & I were talking to a nurse and a social worker in a room away from my mom and he went into this thing about how he worked for Lockheed his whole life and how he is a “problem-solver” — and he just can’t get my mom to realize what is happening; how much he has to repeat things and how frustrating all her “crazy” behaviors are; and wanted them to tell him “how to make her understand what’s going on with her”.... the nurses and I looked at each other curiously and we all essentially told him “you can’t do anything. YOU have to adjust, YOU have to change YOUR behavior.” He just stared blankly like “no, I don’t accept this answer. You women are idiots, so I guess I’ll have to figure it out myself.” 
He doesn’t read the books, he doesn’t talk to anyone about his feelings. He just blows up at my mom. Recently, a friend of my moms was on the phone (mom must’ve called or picked up & not realize someone was there, put the phone down without hanging it up) and this woman heard my mom’s husband YELLING at her. Something like “You’re driving me crazy today! CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY!” I’ve heard him do it too, when I’m in town and stay at their house. He is mean. Very cold and impatient. Don’t get me wrong, my mom can be mean too. But it’s not her fault anymore. She’s only mean when she feels out of control in a situation. She’s lovely when I’m there and she feels taken care of and loved. He’s not kind to her, not affectionate. He used to leave her alone at home constantly, even though my sisters and I repeatedly asked him not to. He’d drive 2 hours to go to the casino and just not tell anyone. And before you ask, no he’s not in serious cognitive decline. He still works and does complicated financial stuff and all that. He’s not an idiot in that sense, just when it comes to thinking about anyone but himself. The other day he lost her AT THE DOCTOR’S OFFICE. Not the brain doc, but apparently they didn’t know she had dementia and let her leave to go find him, since he couldn’t come in and was waiting in the lobby. After an hour he finally went to look for her and found her talking to the valet trying to find her car. She hasn’t driven in 2 years probably. 
We had a conference call with her brain doc a few days ago, to go over her new test results. At one point he (the husband) was talking directly to my mom, trying to explain why it was important to have home Heath care come in (she HATES it) and why they were saying she needs 24/7 care. It was great because he spoke to her exactly as he always does - not yelling, but very curt and uncompassionate. It was amazing because after he was done talking, the doc/nurse/social worker all started talking to him about learning how to communicate with her better, suggested all the same resources we’ve been telling him about for a year. I don’t think it mattered though. He’s not gonna change. 
It was like pulling teeth to get him to start having home health care come in. He only started having someone come like a month ago, after my sisters found out about him yelling at her while the family friend heard. It’s only a few hours a week and it’s basically just so he can leave the house. When he’s home he’s rarely even in the same room with her, and when he is it’s not for her benefit or anything. He can’t remember to give her medication everyday. I got him a $100 auto pill box thing, did everything I could to get him started with it. I found it in its original box, in the garage with other crap they don’t use.
Here’s a quick list of all the things I’ve tried to implement to make my mom as healthy as possible AND to make his life easier, all of which he has either stopped after I leave or never started in the first place:
-auto pill box
-cod liver oil capsules 
-eating mushrooms, drinking green tea, taking tumeric w/black pepper in a capsule (all just good for general brain health)
-daily walks with her dog, they live super close to a few parks too.
-getting a sleep apnea machine so she sleeps better, which is REALLY important for brain health... sleep is like the brains way to flush out all the garbage that builds up everyday. 
-having a white board by her bed where she looks everyday to remind her of things.
-an Apple Watch to keep track of her, alert if she falls, etc. or any life alert type device.
-simplifying their home which is WAY too cluttered, simplifying the phones and TV setup so she can easily use. It fucking never works when I’m there. 
-letting her go to therapy so she can at least talk to someone. We have a therapist that many of us have seen at different points and who is just an overall comforting presence. But he thinks it’s a waste since she won’t remember. 
-having a good pharmacologist managing her medications, since no one seems to be doing it regularly enough — she needs to be getting meds on time yes, but she also needs to be on the right combination of meds and have them monitored more regularly so at least THAT part isn’t hurting more than helping... There is an amazing doc that could do this about 4 minutes from their house. 
-oh, and she has this little dog that she absolutely adores. Her husband is constantly giving it people food. I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve explained to him that he can’t do that. The dog weighs probably 9lbs. It’s a teeny tiny little lap dog. He feeds it cheese, leftover steak or chicken from whatever restaurant they went to the night before, and most recently I observed him feeding the dog a Twinkie. .....
This is what we’re dealing with. A Fox News consuming, truth-denying, stubborn, arrogant (and honestly, pretty damn racist) MORON who simply refuses to take any of us seriously. And just to connect the racism to how it effects my mom, he said some incredibly racist things to my mom’s first home health care nurse. Sisters were there to hear and were mortified. I know HHC people are not gonna let stuff like that interfere with the care they give but jfc.... I want the people who are taking care of my mom to be treated with respect too. 
Bottom line: I don’t think he loves her nor cares about what happens to her. He doesn’t give her any more time and thought than he absolutely has to, and even then it’s not enough. She calls me or my sisters or my brothers 10 times a day, just begging us to help her. She thinks she can fix it herself by being different. She doesn’t understand that she can’t. And he won’t listen or adapt. I know she doesn’t wanna be married to him anymore if it continues as it is. He would basically have to be a totally different person for her to be happy with him. She can’t remember something you said 5 minutes ago, but she is not forgetting how shitty her husband makes her feel. Emotional memory goes last, and it’s just seems clear to me that whatever is broken in their relationship is unfixable, unless there’s a miracle. Or that their relationship was superficial from both sides, and now the husband is just done with her bc all he wanted was someone to take care of him after he lost his wife of 40 years. 
Whatever it is, I just don’t think their 9 years together is enough to carry them through to the end. I think he’s done. I just wish he’d admit it and let us take care of her. I really don’t think a real divorce is necessary or even a good idea at all — I’d be happy to help take care of her as much as I can, but I can’t afford all that I’d need to do it all. My best ideas right now are just to go home and get her, bring her to my house to stay for a bit and see what happens. Or for her to go stay with either of my two sisters who live close to her. But they say as soon as she leaves the house, even for a quick errand, she just wants to go home. :/ I live 4.5 hours from her, but my living situation is ideal I think. 35 acres, beautiful outdoors and lots of animals, healthy fresh food, and no children of my own. I’m here basically all the time, we’re far away from the busy road. My husband is a wonderful cook. My sisters & brothers all have kids. 3 are nearby her but the 2nd brother is across the country. 
Ugh.... it’s just awful y’all. I don’t know what the right thing to do is. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Who do I call and talk to? Who knows what to do when the person with dementia has a spouse who doesn’t seem to give a shit about them? I’ve thought about adult protective services, but what does that even do? I don’t want them to take my mom or anything. If she is forced to move into a facility, she will absolutely give up the will to live. One of her sisters died a few years back — same thing. But her daughter (my cousin) put her in a home that was hours away from their family. Mom was the only one visiting her, and even then she had to travel to another state. I don’t want my mom to feel so sad and hopeless. But I’m the youngest of 5 kids — I’ve never been the one leading the pack. I’m the one who always goes another way and goes against the grain. Right now though I just feel frozen. Like we’re all just waiting for something bad or serious enough to happen to force someone to make a stand and take control. 
If you got this far, thank you for reading. I’m not even sure if I made sense or asked a clear question. I guess I just need to know what my options are; what are the resources I can use that I’m not aware of; has anyone else heard of a situation like this? Thanks so much for any advice y’all can offer. I can’t imagine a worse time (in my life) for this Covid stuff: it was so bad at first when everyone had to stay away. But her emotional health became too fragile and we finally had to realize she’ll die from loneliness if she doesn’t die of Covid, so now my sisters come more regularly and wear masks, try to stay in the backyard, etc. To all of you caregivers out there who’ve been forced to stay away because of this pandemic, I feel your pain. This was so hard already — we really didn’t need or deserve to have this virus totally screw this situation up any more than it already is. 
Love to all y’all. And thanks again.","comment 1: > has anyone else heard of a situation like this?  
This is pretty bad.  Let me be the bearer of bad news.  
Dementia patients DO NOT do well with change.  Moving her to your house would be a massive disruption, and she'd likely do a lot worse for a good long while.  In an ideal world carers would move into the patient's house so their routine isn't affected nearly as much.  Additionally, your life and relationships would suffer.  It is not uncommon for breakups/divorces to occur to caregivers as they are torn between love and duty by guilt and resentment.  You probably don't want to pay her husband to move out and move you and your husband in to live with your mom, and no wonder.  
What you may be able to do is (maybe after a vaccine is available) help to pay for a companion.  Someone who will do laundry, dishes, feed her lunch.  Nothing exciting, just take care of the everyday and make sure she's safe.  You could sell this to him as ""someone to take care of the house while you're at work"" and to him as ""A housekeeper"".   This would also take stress off your local siblings, so they can talk to the companion and not feel like they need to ""spy"" on the household.
comment 2: He has finally gotten her a “companion”/home health care lady. It’s three days a week - 2 half days and 1 full day. But she’s so pissed about it she just locks herself in her room whenever the girl is there. I think that since it’s something her husband wants her to do & probably the way he presented it to her just makes it that much worse — she’s even more stubborn to accept it bc it was HIS idea so surely it’s some kind of punishment or something. She’s very childlike about it. It’s nuts. 
Yeah, the disruption is the thing that worries me.  She would need constant babysitting and spirit-lifting/mind-occupying to get her comfortable enough that she “forgets” about life with her husband... but it’s still a scary thought to uproot someone with dementia, even if they’re in an emotionally abusive relationship. But when I look at all the options, I know I could do the best job I am capable of if I was getting to take care of her on my farm. When I spend long periods at her house, I get very stressed and angry that I am not in control of anything real. I’m just distracting her; giving her a moment of respite from her otherwise lonely life. It all seems like a temporary fix and any progress at getting her into an actual healthy day-to-day lifestyle is impossible. There is no scenario where someone doesn’t lose. Fuck this disease.
comment 3: If you have the ability, go get her. He’s probably never going to change. But, living there with him is less than ideal. 
My 78 year old FIL has advanced Alzheimer’s and my husband stays home full time to care for him. We have been here since the diagnosis five years ago. He had a bad fall and broke his femur which propelled him further very quickly into the disease. He’s had a few other issues which have also helped expedite his journey. These last five years have been the most challenging of my life and I chose to move in and care for someone with this disease. I agree your stepdad is horrible, however, he didn’t sign up for his wife to get dementia. He doesn’t want to care for her. That wasn’t part of his life plan. Go to court, get guardianship rights and figure out a care plan. He will probably be grateful that you made the choice that makes him not look like a super douche for leaving her. My husband and I made this choice even so, we get frustrated and lose our tempers too. You do get tired of repeating yourself and arguing about why they can’t drive. Again, totally not defending the stepdad. He sucks, no doubt. He’s a fixer and he can’t fix it. However, he can’t understand that this isn’t curable. 
Being the primary care provider is hands down the most difficult job on the planet. And even more so when it’s your parent. My husband and I have had to work super hard to maintain our ten year relationship. We don’t get vacations, we don’t get date nights and we sure as hell don’t get to leave the house together (pre-covid looks no different for us than current covid). We have zero help. Our lives are on hold to ensure he has the most dignified journey to the end that we can give him. Before you pick her up you need to think about what being a caregiver will be like. 
Are you ready to change her clothes? Are you ready to change her diapers? Are you ready to feed her? Are you ready to change everything about your life to care for her?
I wish someone would have more honest with us when we started this journey. We knew it would be hard but we thought we’d have family support. We don’t. They were going to come over and give us a break. They were always going to see what their schedule looked like and call us back. It’s been five years, we’re still waiting to her back from my husband’s brother. 
I hope your journey is brighter and filled with all the love and support the world has to offer. Good luck and I’m sorry you are heading down this path.
comment 4: I agree with this response. Yes, transition is tough on people with dementia but I’d estimate it to be no tougher then living with a caregiver who doesn’t want to be your caregiver. This poster is correct to advise you of how all-consuming caregiving will be if you do go this route, and how you will likely hear many empty promises of “help” from siblings that may never materialize. I’d suggest getting immersed in the caregiver alliance world and attending virtual caregiver support groups and learning about the many ways in which caregiving can impact your life, your health, marriage, etc. Luckily with this becoming a common situation throughout our country there are now tons of great resources, websites, authors and groups that have done great work on this topic.
comment 5: Thank you for that piece of advice. I will take it to heart.
comment 6: Wow, there’s a lot of similarities in our situations. Mainly the femur break causing the big plunge into dementia. And how your pre-Covid life is no different from current Covid life. I joke that I’ve been practicing social distancing since we got this farm 7 years ago. 
I’ve been telling my siblings for a year and a half that I want her to live with me. My husband is amazing and completely on board with whatever I want to do. Though, I am not saying it won’t still be beyond difficult - even if I can get some financial support from her husband. But I am positive I can do a much better job taking care of her if she came into MY world, rather than me abandoning my husband to run the farm while I spend a few days or a week there. I was going back and forth so much last year and bringing one of my dogs along for comfort, that I permanently altered the dynamic between my travel dog and the dog that stayed on the farm. To the point I had to give the travel dog to my brother because the two dogs couldn’t be in the same room together anymore without viciously fighting. 
I love that you and your husband are so determined to care for him. It’s how I feel. My mom doesn’t deserve to be lonely for the rest of her life. I know it won’t be easy in the slightest but I’m willing to see if it can work. As long as I can demonstrate to her how much more she could enjoy life here, I think it could be enough to break her out of the mindset she stuck in. She thinks there’s no hope, no options. She just wants to die. I can’t imagine having to feel that way at the end of my life. I don’t want it for myself and I don’t want it for her.
The only reason I haven’t already gone and picked her up is because my house is in NO shape for an elderly person with dementia. It needs a lot of work. Like most, we don’t have the money to do everything we need to do in a short time. So I gotta figure out how to make my home comfortable and safe enough for me wanna bring her here and get her outta that situation.
Thanks for the kind words and advice. Honestly sometimes it just helps to connect with another person, a stranger, a know that we’re all basically going through the same thing. Makes it feel more manageable somehow. So thank you.
comment 7: I’m sorry for your position. I would like to echo the above response about people not showing up. I’ve been through cancer and now being a dementia caregiver and what I’ve learned is that people may have good intentions but they don’t show up. 
I was told the other day that I had so much support and my response was where? When is the last time someone came by to get Mom out of her bed, took her anywhere, listened to her, brightened her, or my, day, helped me cook, do the never ending cleaning, anything. I hate being this cynical but I’ve experienced it twice. People just don’t follow through for the long term. Seeing it through is exhausting and most people can’t cope.
comment 8: Maybe the aide can pretend to be her friend? My mom hates her morning aide and loves her afternoon one. Why? Because the morning one cleans and does
stuff for her. The afternoon one just plays games. She thinks the afternoon one is her friend that visits and the other is basically showing she can’t do things. 
I would not move her. I’d get more side hours or when Covid slows do a daycare program. Some are awesome
comment 9: So the husband is 74 and I'm going to assume your mom is about the same age? If so, my friend please consider that you could be caring for your mom for ten or fifteen years. You would not have much time to help your husband with your farm.  My advice is to help the HHC folks blend in a little better. Maybe you could coordinate with the agency so you could bring them in as a friend to meet your mom? Maybe sit and visit and have snacks and chat and look at some photo albums?  If she could get to know one (or more) of the HHC workers she might decide to be glad she has friends visiting. Just a thought.
comment 10: I would call DHHS elder services.  You're describing elder abuse.  They are great for networking all the services available.  You mom needs help, and probably to be put in a home (and away from her husband.)  In the meantime, he probably needs help too.  If DHHS can determine abuse is happening, then they can find a better person than your mom's husband to make decisions for her.  Usually the default person is the spouse otherwise.
comment 11: I didn't read all the comments, so I apologise if I'm repeating someone else. Soooo holy shit where do I start?! Wow...this is an incredibly heart breaking story & I'm so sorry youre going through this, just awful!
1st - just wanted to quick acknowledge you're a wonderful writer! Very descriptive & thorough... & you and your siblings all willing to step in is so amazing and kind, then hearing you describe your childhood with the classic single mom working 3 jobs and life devoted to her babies/not dating, no wonder she has such sweet children, sounds like such a loving, amazing mom! 
My opinion towards this comes from my mother having to do this with her own mother (who was in the between mild - moderate, but fastly heading moderate stage of the disease)  who also found herself in an awful living situation (more on that later)  but they (my parents/aunts) basically had to abduct her to get her out of it!
& I'm also an RN & I've worked at a nursing home (skilled nursing, rehab, and long term care) as a nursing supervisor & case manager for the past 5 years or so as well as critical care nurse in a hospital in the past & also (my bf and I both) worked as psych nurses at an acute, locked units, psychiatric hospital - i covered all floors there but he did geriatric psych for almost a decade...
 but I'm certainly no expert & honestly with dementia/alzheimers, not many are - theres still so much we don't know & def won't in our lifetime.. mainly bc with every organ in our body, all so wildly complex & can have so many disorders, they ultimately each have a main function or job & when it stops doing that job, theres typically a solution to fix & you can objectively tell if its worked (ex. Lab values, mri/CT scan imaging), but not only does the brain do millions of jobs - not 1 case is the same, not one person shares the personality traits identical to another & results are subjective. Sorry, got off track ...
The house theyre in - did she move in with him or did they buy it together? Is there anyway to get him the F out? Because, even tho this disease doesn't ever regress -  it is very likely the care shes receiving from him (or lack thereof ) will cause progression of the disease.  A huge concern from reading this was about the pill dispenser - not only does it show pure ignorance & blatant disrespt on his part - but youre not even sure she's taking the meds? With most of these meds (aricept & namenda are what I see most) they take weeks to start working & showing any affect. He's possibly never even seen what they're capable of BUT, missing doses, going several days without, not only cancels all the progress the drug has made, but its severely fucking with her brain chemistry, potentially making her worse... just stopping one sends the brain into like panic mode, could cause serious delirium. 
Way before you described him as this fox News binge watcher - that's already exactly what I was picturing lol. Trying to change a stubborn, stuck in their ways, insensitive, 74 y/o man is basically not going to happen. If there was going to be a change, it would've happened already. He can't accept change, he can't accept the new her, and he doesn't want to either. The very little hes done so far, has caused extreme burn out. And the fact he's able to leave her alone, take her out to eat, etc shows that she's still in an early stage and if he can't handle it now, then its absolutely crucial you separate them before she progresses.  Leaving the house and wandering away (even in fridged cold weather depending where u live) & starting a house fire are things that can easily happen if left alone. 
But contrary to the one comment I did read - going off my experience- it's not nearly as hard or critical (I forget the words used) to uproot a person with dementia from their environment. Will she be angry at 1st? More than likely. Will she adapt and get over the anger? Absolutely 1 million % 
With my grandmother- she lived in a little community for seniors in a modular home development after my grandfather died & met this neighbor, Fran, who also binge watched same news as your story, always angry yelling at the TV , also you had to scream to talk to him lol, but to save $ she sold her place & lived with him. They got along well & were great companions, both in their 80s & not romantically , but really loved each other. Slowly they both started showing signs of demntia & maybe cause it really started together, it seemed to progress quicker. We were scared & also living 30 mins away, Frans daughter was 5 mins away & felt she needed to have her dad @ home for safety & for fear of breaking both their hearts - she offered to take my grandmother in too (till she got too much to handle). 
She was still slightly independent,  just need like supervision or verbal cueing  with bathing, bathroom, dressing, etc. Repeated herself a lot  & zero short term memory, slightly mentally draining. We thought Fran's daughter was an angel. We were so wrong. Long story short- she was hardly bathing or changing her clothes, wouldn't answer the phone if we called, was forging her ssn checks, & took out credit cards in her name. 
Because she couldn't comprehend she was being abused, plus we couldn't really speak to her - when police showed up - she could answer all orientation questions (name, date, where she was) & she said she felt safe, she wanted to be there, etc. 
We had to basically plan a sting & see when the daughter left the house, send cousin up to door for surprise visit, get her to agree for lunch, & took her to my parents, then to a Dr for a legal diagnosis, then to a lawyer to get my mom POA, then slammed the stupid cunt with every charge possible 😉 
We obviously felt terrible for putting her through this, she was confused, angry, upset, asking every 2 minutes where Fran was..and that lasted about 1 week. Then she adapted. And most importantly, she was SAFE!         I won't go any further on my own story cause this post is long af already. 
But I can tell you with 100% honesty, for all these years doing admissions...i havent seen many difficult transition from home to long term care, waay more happier, & the ones that were difficult - were much further progressed than your mother now. 
Youre without a doubt going to need in home care, even for you (or siblings) for your own mental well being. & yes - every health care worker has been called awful names or faced racism,  but when someone's work environment is hostile - they either won't come back & spread the word around the agency, or think of how anyone's work ethic would be in an unpleasant, unappreciated environment.... less than satisfactory. 
So not only is he harming her with the meds, hes harming her emotionally by yelling creating tension, hes harming himself by not listening on how to also make this easier on him, hes harming her relationship with her kids, & hes harming her potential of getting great, structured care.
People with dementia THRIVE in a calm, structured environment. They crave a solid daily routine. 
You asked who you can contact for advice - the office of againg! No, they will not take your mother, theyre full of resources & are specifically trained for issues identical to yours. 
Sorry i drug this out so long! Your story really hit home for me. I wish you all the strength in the world cause these situations are HARD!!!! 
oh - & if not already, while she's still maybe legally in sound & mind - get an advanced directive & make one of you guys (her kids) power of attorney!
Good luck to you!
comment 12: Hey, sorry for the delay in responding to this. But I just read your comment again and wanted to say thank you for taking the time to share your experience and offer advice. It’s always nice when someone seems to “get” my family’s specific situation. Because you’re absolutely right — if you’ve met one person with Alzheimer’s, you’ve met ONE person with Alzheimer’s. No two are alike. However there are other things, as you stated, that are absolutely necessary for every person suffering from dementia, like routine & a calm environment. 
I was just with her last week for a few days, and learned from her husband that he’s started the process of selling their house and has signed them up for a new facility being built nearby. It should be done in 2021, but I supposed it could end up stretching to 2022. As Charter Members though he is getting an incredible deal for both their independent living quarters AND for her eventual private memory care space. It’s good, but it’s still a long way off and I’m hoping they’ll be able to stick it out till it’s built. I spoke to one of my sisters this morning — she had a bad phone call with mom earlier. The home-care girl was there and mom was PISSED. She took it out on my sister, ended up shouting Fuck You at her... it’s really sad bc that sis has 3 young sweet girls, and spends ALL of her spare time over there at the house, helping out with mom. She’s been decluttering the house — taking out all the clothes and other hoarded crap that makes living there so chaotic. Poor girl. She does so much to help and ends up getting shit on the most by mom. But she’s strong at least. 
Anyway, we’re hoping that today’s & last night’s dramas will push the husband to finally do what we’ve been asking: get the home-care for every morning and every night, so her meds can be on time and she can have help brushing her teeth, bathing, dressing. Right now her skin is always itchy (because she’s not bathing properly) and her teeth are discolored. She’ll put on full makeup and jewelry and clothing (w/shoes!) to go to bed at night. Apparently her eyelashes fell out bc she wasn’t taking off her mascara. :/ It’s just bad. It’s so bad. And it boggles the mind as to WHY he won’t just LISTEN to us and do what we say. He finally got the home-care people in, but it’s not really so much about taking care of her than it is about him having long chunks of time where he can not be around her. He has the money to pay for the extra expense of having them come in the AM and PM, but it’s a 3 hour minimum. And 3 hours isn’t enough for him to be alone. Even though my sweet sister even offered to come over after the morning girl, just to give him an extra few hours on top. It makes no sense. HIS life would be so much easier if he gave her any kind of structure and consistency. 
Ugh. Thanks for letting me rant more. It’s just so frustrating when the caregivers aren’t on the same page. It could be sooooo much better for everyone if the paid help was taking care of all the “official” stuff so her kids could just BE with her and try to create moments of joy while we still can. And I totally believe what you say about how much better they can be when their basic needs are being met. At first the transition is hard, but once it kicks in, they’re better for it and won’t fight the change so much. 
I’m gonna pass along some of your advice to the husband — I liked the words you used in a few spots. Made me think about it differently. Sometimes the right phrasing is key. :) Oh, and thanks for the compliment to my writing! My mom was a writer/journalist. She had a column in the Catholic paper, syndicated in like 25 states at one point in her life. She was always so witty and sharp. Which makes it all the more hard to hear her struggle to find words and stammer through sentences. She was so bright. And I think part of her still remembers or thinks that she is the same as she was, so the defiance she has whenever she feels belittled or not in control of anything, it’s intense man... But anyway, thank you. I was the one of her daughters who got the creative, journalistic side of her personality, so thanks for the huge compliment. Means a lot. :)
comment 13: 32 here, dealing with an uncooperative parent when you need help from them for dealing with the one with dementia is the absolute worst. The sad irony is Mom always went on and on about how bad some of her distant cousins were for never visiting their father with it after he went into LTC, and now that mine is temporarily in a facility we've not once gone to see him. When he still had...well...some of his faculties we could have gotten the ball rolling on this, but she resisted at every turn.
Due to finances we'll be getting him back soon, and she's promised to ""be better"" and help now, but I really doubt it. We're supposed to be getting Home Care in a few times weekly but she complained about her ""space"" being ""invaded"" so am sure that will end lol
Good luck with her husband, the guy needs to own up and admit he wants nothing to do with her. I hate widowed predatory older guys only seeking a servant later in life, that really needs to end but it seems to be a non-generational thing.
comment 14: Omg! This is my life right now with my parents!
comment 15: For realsies?? How are you coping?
comment 16: The whole situation with your step-father is awful, but as someone else pointed out, dementia patients don't do well with change.  If you decide that's the best situation for her, be prepared to make an excuse, tell her you need her with you for a while to help with something, give her a reason to be there to keep her calmer for a while until she settles in.   
Someone else touched on the idea of having a ""friend"" show up. That worked well with my mom. In her case, the lady who spent every morning with her was her granddaughter's mother-in-law, so she peripherally knew her and she just decided she needed to stop in and see Mom every day, or that was what Mom was told. She never knew she'd been hired by my sister and made it really difficult on us when she would say things like ""I love that Mary's coming to see me but I wish she wouldn't come every day!"" It never occurred to her that ""Mary"" was coming every day at the same time and leaving at the same time.
comment 17: Wonder if he believed marrying her would provide someone to look after him. Perhaps he is really annoyed that she needs care from him that isn’t what he wanted to happen in his first kid age.
comment 18: Wow. I hadn’t considered how bad the dynamic of a resentful husband can be.  My dad has early stage dementia, but lives alone. this sounds awful for everyone. Denying her access to a therapist sounds abusive. He needs to be told that he doesn’t need to see the point to give her a ride. A social worker may need to do that. 
1) call your state’s equivalent of Agency on Ageing
2) Alzheimers association is a good info clearinghouse, but they also frustrate me because they recommend recourses unavailable in my area. Which I find irksome. Adult daycare? Nice IDEA. They recommend resources but don’t actually provide anything.
3) adult protective services.
4) find about Medicaid waver in your state. 
Advice:  you really need to simplify.  Forget the dog, it’s fat. The husband will feed it. forget the optional (tea, c pap, mushroom stuff,  changing their home, white board) Fight the ONE most important battle. If its meds, load the med box yourself, put it in the place and call her at med time every day until its a routine.  If its meds management, take her yourself. If it’s a walk or something the care giver can do,  tell her you are taking her on a walk on (time and date) and go on the walk with them both. Do it again until it’s routine.  Give the caregiver jobs. Don’t  give hubs jobs or expect hubs to do it. He won’t.  Sorry he’s a dick. Your mom chose him too, on some level anyway.  
You seem to have the fantasy that w/o hubs in the picture you would be able to take care of her better.  Maybe, maybe not. Think carefully before going for guardianship. He’s frustrated, ignorant and overwhelmed.  At the end of the day, what does he want? What will change the situation so he doesn’t have to be an abusive ass?  Is it a divorce, or is it he just needs a break? Maybe there are interventions that can help change awful to acceptable, if not good.  If you take her, she’s yours, for years. Looking at that time horizon may make it easier to see if any social services can help. Because it’s going to be frustrating.  : /. sorry 😐

"Tech to help with dementia Hey guys just found this sub, my grandfather has had dementia for a while and is deteriorating.
In a recent bus ride into the city with my gran he missed his stop as my gran got off and has now been lost for about 36 hours in the city, the police are on it and there have been some sightings on cctv and such, while we await his hopefully safe return we have all been thinking about things that can help prevent this in the future.
So to my question: 


We we’re looking to get gps trackers potentially for both my gran and grandpa to prevent this kind of thing happening again, does anyone have any recommendations for reliable easy to use and convenient ones? 


We want to get my gran a phone that she can use in emergency’s, she’s 80+ and not very tech savvy but knows how to use a tablet, any recommendations on something with a long battery life and easy to use, I don’t know if there’s anything aimed at the elderly here.


Not exactly a tech question but if anyone else has any advice on how to help prevent any situations like this without moving him to a home I’d be really appreciative, just trying to stay productive and not worry.


Thanks for any help! This is in the uk btw if that matters","comment 1: Hey there - that's super scary about your grandad. I hope he's found soon!
I'm a bit of a tech skeptic when it comes to folks with dementia. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to find a solution, but I guess I'm here to urge a little caution unless you have very deep pockets... Here's why:
GPS trackers are amazing. Truly. The trick is getting your loved one with dementia to consistently wear/carry the tracker. My mum started disappearing before I moved in to be her caregiver, so I moved to GPS trackers to try and keep tabs on her. Thing was: she never wore watches or jewelry, so even when presented with beautiful trinkets she would take them off in less than a day, never to put them on again. I tried adding a tracker to her fancy cigarette case, but she recognized the square fob-like device as foreign to the case
 (without remembering that it was important or its purpose) and so would diligently pick at it until her case was restored to her memory of what it was meant to look like. I found some neat shoe-lace trackers, but she entered a phase in which she would hide her own shoes around the house and so wouldn't wear the same pair day to day. I got her a new wallet (she was in the habit of carrying a wallet) with a tracker, but she never recognized the new wallet as hers and wouldn't carry it. A long list of examples to say: if you're going to find a GPS tracker for your grandfather, think carefully about what he's likely to actually carry/wear with him every day. You're going to have more luck, at least based on my experience, if you can find a way to add a tracker to something he already knows and carries in a way that he won't know it is there. (Does he use a cane? Unless he has many, that might be a good thing to explore?)
Regarding a cell phone for your grandmother, and also to perhaps open you up to other assistive devices, I'd encourage you to check out the Alzheimer's store. Here's an example of a simple phone that they sell:
https://www.alzstore.com/RAZ-Memory-Cell-Phone-for-Seniors-p/0039.htm
I know that your grandmother doesn't have dementia, but if you're looking for easy to use devices... They have some really great options. You'll find some other good simple cell phones on Amazon. I'm in Canada so the options you have available to you may be different, but I've heard good things about the jitterbug flip phone. On the Alzheimer's store, you might also find some other things there that your grandfather might have some use for. Again, though, I'd urge caution about new tech for your grandfather... Learning how to use something new can be really difficult...
Hope this helps. Best wishes.
comment 2: I really appreciate the comment, I’ll definitely have a think about where we could possibly put one thank you for the ideas! I’ll also definetley check out that store and phone thank you so much for your help and support!
comment 3: In US I think the elderly phone is called the Jitterbug. My dad had it. It has big buttons and very simple directions.
If you get one get a Tile for it. Tiles are little squares you stick to thinks that you can track from a computer if lost.
"
My dad set a reminder on the Alexa to remind him his birthday is tomorrow. It’s both cute and sad. 🤷‍♀️ ,"comment 1: The upside is that he knows what Alexa is and how to operate it.  My MIL finds her Google Home terrifying.
comment 2: This is true. The reminder showed up on my phone as “Alexa, my birthday is on August 7th.” It’s cute. 
Every time I let him know he can play any music he wants on Alexa, he gets super excited and says, “Alexa! Play ‘The Piano Man’! I love this song!” And then listens as if it’s the first time. For him, it is!

"Car GPS for tracking person with Dementia I'll try to keep this short: My grandmother has dementia, but she also enjoys her independence. The family tries what it can to allow her to do what she loves while keeping track of her whereabouts. My grandmother still drives to places, but she mainly goes to church and grocery shopping, but can get lost if her normal route is blocked (road closures). All other destinations she will have someone else with her. We would like to have someway to track her car in case she gets lost. She has a phone with GPS, but she forgets it sometimes.

"Seniors Guide on how to get up from a Fall Seniors Guide on how to get up from a Fall.  
More than 1 in 4 people age 65 and older fall each year, according to the CDC, and falling once doubles the chances of falling again.  
After an older adult falls, lying on the floor for a long time or getting up incorrectly could cause additional injury – even if they weren’t seriously injured from the fall itself.  
Many people who fall, even if they’re not injured, become afraid of falling.
This fear could cause them to avoid everyday activities. And if they’re less active, they’ll become weaker, which then increases their chances of falling.  
To combat this, seniors can proactively learn safe techniques for how to get up from a fall.  
Knowing what to do if a fall does occur and practicing ahead of time will give them confidence that they’ll be able to help themselves and minimize injuries.  
Here is a 5-minute video demonstration of safe techniques for getting up after a fall and outline the key steps to take to get up or to call for help.
Step-by-step guide for how to get up from a fall safely: 

Stay calm and still. Don’t move for a few minutes because moving too quickly can cause more harm.
Figure out if you’re injured. Slowly move hands and feet, arms and legs to check for pain.
If there are no injuries, slowly roll onto your side, starting the movement with your head and moving down your body toward your feet. Take a moment to rest.
Slowly push up into a crawling position and crawl slowly on hands and knees toward a sturdy chair or piece of furniture. Don’t rush and rest as needed. Place your hands on the seat of the chair, one at a time.
Supporting yourself with the chair, bring your strongest leg up to a 90-degree angle by putting that foot flat on the ground. The other leg stays in kneeling position. Slowly push up to standing using both arms and legs.
Slowly turn around and lower yourself onto the chair. Sit and catch your breath for a few minutes before doing anything else.

How to call for help when there are injuries 

Stay calm and rest for a few moments. Figure out what parts of your body are injured.
If you have one, use an emergency medical alert device or mobile phone to call 911 or a family member for help. Tell them about your injuries.
If there’s a pillow nearby, put it under your head. If there’s a blanket or some clothing nearby, use it to keep yourself warm while you wait for help.
If you don’t have a medical alert device or a phone nearby, start yelling for help. If you can’t yell, grab something nearby and use it to bang on the floor or on nearby furniture to make noise and attract attention.

Safety warning: always assess injuries before moving
Seniors should only consider getting up if they’re not injured or dizzy from the fall. 

If you find that your older adult has been injured in a fall, don’t move them – that could make their injuries worse. Instead, call 911, keep them as warm and comfortable as possible, and wait for emergency responders to arrive.

Important: Seniors with serious health conditions or limited mobility should always consult their doctor or physical therapist for advice on what to do in case of a fall in order to prevent further injury.","comment 1: As a previous retirement home worker and the child of elderly parents, I can't thank you enough for this post. Keeping calm and having a plan for situations like this helps to save lives ❤
comment 2: Mother in law is almost 96.  I and My wife, mother in laws youngest child, and another sibling have been personally caring for her for several years now.  
In a nursing home is out of the question for the family's 4 siblings.  But this last 18+ months things have declined drastically.  
Argumentive with many menial tasks as eating and bedtime, etc...
Her brain not really processing these tasks.  ""Change your blouse"" turns into a 15 minute lecture of what she needs to do and how to do it.  My wife would go they the steps with her.  
Sometimes I would be there and almost do the work for her.  Reaching into the sleeve to gently guide her arm thru the sleeve to put on her PJ's, night gown.  
It just stresses my wife out to see her mom ""so much out of it"".   I try to help my wife and encourage her, but it's a personal thing with her and her mom.  I can, and say so much.  
She demands bedtime only hours after getting up, or hours before dinner time.  Then during the night she is up almost every hour.  Last night she did well, stayed in bed and we all kinda slept in till almost 9 this Saturday.  
Thx,  just wanted to share...🥴👍

"Desperation, Loneliness &amp; Depression Title says it all. I didn't know there was a group like this but kept searching around because I made the mistake of posting on a relationship advice board and got roasted by some. Some of the personal DMs had me in a mess.  There were a few that were incredibly  helpful and had suggestions. I am reading through these posts on this board and BAWLING. 😭 This post is just going to be sheer venting and I am so thankful I found a place like this. I am going to try find a group or create one after COVID passes. 
My husband and I met many years ago. The first 10 years married was a dream (5 years together before) and I cherished every bit. I grew up really poor and mother was an addict with a houseful of little kids. I was thankful to be out and getting a good marriage and career. My husband was never than romantic or even attentive. I could accept that and I have 5 wonderful children and pets. We were a good team together and incredible chemistry in bed. 
About 15 years ago my husband fell ill. We finally learned he has Myalgic Encephalomyelitis or simpler term: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Then about 5 years ago he developed serious neuropathy. He is in chronic pain, struggles to walk and now having trouble with his hands. The last couple years I have just started to feel SO alone, drain and depressed. I don't exercise, eat horrible and am so depressed. I am trying to work on all of this. With our kids almost all grown I think it is worse. Taking care of him all the time is zapping me if energy. I desperately crave dates, going on walks, all the things we dreamed about. We were happy to be young parents and worked really hard. We planned to spend our 50's on enjoying each other. Instead I find myself just wanting to scream at him. I feel so much guilt and selfishness. Like I am a horrible person. I have even considered an affair but I love him so much. 
The other awful thing is how much people do NOT understand and you lose friendships, especially couple friends. We used to be super social. Not anymore. It is sad going out alone or to parties by yourself - the rare invite you do get. I am trying to think of ways to get back on track. I exercised yesterday, way too hot outside 109°!! I made a doctor appt to see about depression and anxiety. I want to get this 50 pounds off too. I have never been so miserable, overweight and depressed. 
Apologies for long post I just needed to talk. I felt so much less alone after coming here. Like I might survive. I have had moments just wanting to die.This resentment I feel is suffocating. Also, since many don't understand neuropathy or CFS they say the most insensitive stupid things. I actually had a good friend suggest that maybe a vacation would help. WHAT?!!? He can hardly get out of bed without serious exhaustion and isn't going for long walks along the beach with neuropathy. So tired of the medication/doctor/therapy suggestions. Have you tried yoga, meditation? 🤦‍♀️ I have one friend inviting us to do things and then upset when we don't come. She'll always do this last mintue. She'll say 'Well, you can come!"" I have tried to explain it makes me feel more alone and sad. I don't want to watch her kissing and hugging (new relationship) on her new man. I know she's happy but I can't handle seeing it. 💔
Thanks everyone. I am thinking of you all. 💛❤💛 Hold on. Keep trying. One day/moment at a time.","comment 1: I sent that heart because I was in my car..but I've been doing this for 17 years and I am convinced nobody knows what caregivers do but other caregivers. I've likened it to a secret society. I've run into other caregivers and we can damned near spot each other before we even talk. 
And our wives don't understand, our husbands don't understand,our friends don't understand ,only WE understand each other. The isolation, the loneliness, the sense of duty that we ALL possess. I only half jokingly put forth the idea of a dating/friend service JUST for we caregivers. Because nobody else will understand. Hang in there OP REACH OUT if need be it doesn't have to be me just don't weather it ALONE. ❤️
comment 2: Stay strong ❤️ don’t let anyone bring you down, reach out if you ever need someone
comment 3: Hi. Know that you are not alone in this, we are here to support you. We are going through the same emotions, and we understand how how it is to be a caregiver, to feel alone, and sad. I feel this way too sometimes. I found this subreddit a few weeks ago and I'm glad I did. I found that a lot of caregivers feel this way, and they always listen (read) with an open mind.
About your well-being, I think it is a good idea to keep in touch with you physician about your mental health as well as you weight. I have the exact same problems, so I relate to what you said. Sport helps a lot with mental health. Before covid, I started to go to the gym for the first time and it felt really good. I think it might help you. Plus, you'll have the occasion to have time for yourself, and not always being a caregiver.
Try to reach out to a local caregiver support group. You might find some support, and maybe some friend to have a walk? :) they would understand your situation and not be mean like your friends...
Try also to see if you could have help at home taking care of him. Having someone helping you on a daily basis might relieve some of the stress of you shoulders.
I'm curious about what people in relationship advice have said. How could they be mean to you? You are obviously in a dire situation and need help.
Forget what they said, they are not in your shoes, or the shoes of a caregivers, so it is difficult for them to understand.
Stay strong. You are not alone. ❤️
comment 4: People unfortunately have strong opinions on situations they don't have experience with.  I was the caregiver for my mother during the last few yesterday if her life, and it was grueling.  One thing I wish that I'd known about is the availability of respite care.  When I was checking my mom into the rehab place there was another family checking their mom in for the weekend because they had a trip to go on.  You could check into the availability of that in your area.
Soon after my mom died, I started getting sick.  Now I'm the patient and my husband is my caretaker.  Nobody signed up for that role especially when you have energy and vitality.  I'd venture to say he feels like crap about it.  
You took the best first step.  There are resources available for caretakers.  Take advantage of them all.  You deserve every ounce of help there is to be had.
comment 5: You are going through caregiver burnout(Please google it). I went through it too. After a while, everything they do just gets on your nerves and you turn into a ruthless monster. And you wish for it to end, but when it does finally end, there's no relief. Yeah, you have more time and you get your life back, but your loved one is a major part of your life. And when they go, a part of you dies with them. Trust me, no matter how bad the situation is, when they die, you will wish hard for just one last day of it.
Try to remember that your loved one isn't themselves anymore. The illness is what's driving you crazy, not them. They would not act out of character and put you through so much if they were feeling alright, would they? Try to treat them the best that you can and don't take the frustration out on them.
I know you are tired of therapy suggestions, but it really does help. Letting it out will help you in the long run and will help you understand the situation better. It doesn't make you weak or bad or something.
comment 6: Thank you for this information. I am going through this now. I care for my mom and I love her but I am feel like I am going crazy and losing control of my emotions. I live in a somewhat remote area with a lack of support especially now with the COVID but I did look up caregiver burnout and at least I know where to start.
comment 7: It's even worse when you are the only person who is helping out. Without those breaks, you never get a chance to cool down and all that stress has nowhere to go.
comment 8: Sending you love, I understand❤

"Online shopping and mystery order fun. My elderly family members, with various degree of cognitive issues, have discovered online shopping, and in the past few weeks I have disputed hundreds of dollars in charges and spent hours returning they insisted they did not order but only ""looked at"". Most of these orders were through the Amazon app so things were pretty straight forward, but some of the other items only show up as debits from their bank accounts with cryptic identifiers from distant lands, and they can never remember where they actually ordered the items from.
Today I spent the morning trying to track down a charge on my mom's boyfriend's bank statement for which he has an e-mail receipt that only indicates being from some non company in China. He does not recall placing the order, only looking at the item, but does not recall from which website and has mild paranoia. This leads him to the conclusion that he has been hacked and that the hackers have taken elaborate steps to collect his bank information, shipping address (different from home address), cell phone number and new e-mail address. 
I know this is actually not the case because I recall him talking about having ordered this thing a month ago.
Unfortunately the item hasn't arrived yet and I have no way of determining if the website was legit because it is not showing up on or around the order date in his browsing history and it has proved difficult to file a claim on the charge because the banks and paypal are short staffed due to the virus.
Fun times.","comment 1: Do they have one click ordering turned on for amazon? That would probably be the easiest way to stop the ordering since it would require them to input the info to continue to check out. 
I would look for Wish orders for the unmarked Chinese debits. Wish is the new go to for chinese knock off drop shippers.
comment 2: They don't have one click ordering turned on. What they were doing was placing things they wanted to save to look at later in their cart, forgetting about them and neglecting to remove the things they did not want and review their order before placing it.
We thought maybe the mystery order of the day was through Wish but have not been able to confirm yet.
comment 3: That sucks. I hope you can get things figured out with the bank.
comment 4: MIL looked at a laptop once and only once. She managed to lock out the keyboard somehow while only having to flick through a few pictures. It took me 30min to finally unlock it. Thank god she was old enough to be completely computer illiterate. Good luck.
comment 5: Did you know that Apple permanently locks you out of your iPhone if you guess the passcode wrong 10 times and to gain access again you have to do a factory reset from an iCloud compatible device? My mother discovered this the hard way and before I could even do the reset I had to update Windows. It took 8 hours to regain access to the phone. Thankfully, I serendipitously had the thought to save backup copies of some important things she had on it that we could not save to the cloud a few days previous to this.
In her defense, she was on morphine at the time and hallucinating slightly, but Apple should really find a better alternative to the perma lock out.

"Any good experiences with fitness/sleep trackers with aging relatives? My grandpa (93) is hoping to continue living in his house as long as possible, and I'm helping my family brainstorm things that could help keep him as safe as possible there. To help with the broader job of making sure he's safe at night, I was thinking about getting him a fitness tracker that would give him alerts for early signs of sickness, like a higher than normal resting heart rate. Has anyone tried anything like this? When I googled it, it seems like most fitness trackers are geared towards people who are very comfortable using touchscreens, but I was thinking he could maybe use Siri to sync the data and then a family member (either in person or remotely) could keep an eye on the numbers to know if he might need an extra check-in. Any advice would be great!","comment 1: We’ve had great results using the Apple Watch. The series 4 & 5 version has fall detection & will alert the house and call us if my dad is down for more than a few minutes.
comment 2: Thanks so much! My mom was saying if there's any tracker he'd prefer, it would likely be one that looks and feels a lot like a watch. Is there a specific app you like to use? Or it's just part of the in-built watch?
comment 3: Depends on his mental health whether he can manage anything tech, so I can’t comment on that. And it depends what safety issues you are worried about. For tripping and falling: night lights everywhere—some are LED and motion activated, grab bars in bathrooms and handrails for steps. Sturdy dining chairs with arm rests. Various grab bars for couches and beds. No throw rugs and a cleared floor. For monitoring: cameras to send images to your cell phone. Seems invasive but if you see him on the floor you can get to him. ‘I fell down and I can’t get up’ buttons, state may pay for the service. Meals on wheels so someone checks up on him once a day.
comment 4: Got it! Thank you! He already has grab bars/handrails/a pretty well-optimized living space, and this would just be supplemental! The most immediate reason for some extra safeguards is that awhile back he fell out of bed while he had a fever, and (we think) because of the fever wasn't lucid enough to press his emergency button--his fall detector can't be worn while sleeping because normal movement while sleeping will set it off. (If it happened again, I'm sure the family would look into something to add to his bed, but I think that hasn't come up yet!)
Re: tech: he could probably manage, but after talking to family who interact with him on a daily basis, it would likely be a pain for him to have to sync a tracker.
The camera idea seems like a great alternative--do you know/prefer of a specific app? Unfortunately meals on wheels in his area is on a break during the pandemic, but I'll definitely keep that in mind for later!
comment 5: We got something called d-link a few years ago to monitor our cat while on vacation. Maybe new products out there now. We could see the camera views on an app on our smart phone. Some of these monitors have motion sensors that will alert you when there is movement or noise. Now we’re not traveling and my mom moved in with us so I have non-web baby monitors in my moms bedroom and office and I have volume turned up so I can see if she’s shifting in bed or restless. The video monitor has a battery and I carry it around with me or plug it in next to my desk and bed. I can keep an eye on her without getting up or disturbing her. I am also most concerned about falling out of bed. She’s done it twice—once breaking her cheek and once landing upside down and having. A heart event from being stuck. Old people also fall on the floor and get hypothermia and can die. This happened to my grandma. She fell on the weekend, laid on the kitchen tiles which were cold and wasn’t discovered until Monday morning when her helper arrived, then died shortly after in the hospital. So it won’t prevent falls but can help recover the person to safety more quickly.
comment 6: Thank you for the tips! That's exactly what we're afraid of, and I'm glad you have a good solution for your mom!

"GPS tracking for my grandfather with dementia? Hello! I'm not sure if this topic has been discussed in this subreddit, I definitely haven't found anything searching. My grandfather has Lewy Body Dementia and sometimes leaves home abruptly, leaving my grandmother worried (specially when it happens in the night). At the moment I'm home and can follow him right after he leaves, but most of the time they're on their own.
This had made me wonder if anyone is going through the same and how they manage the situation. The ideal solution would be to get a GPS tracker to slip in his clothes or something he takes with him at all times, but he's not even taking his phone or face mask with him anyway.
How would you manage this situation? Do you know any good quality GPS tracker we can use? Do you have any other tips that could help? Thanks to everyone in advance!","comment 1: We’ve found the best option for my mum is the GPS insoles that slip into shoes, which is fairly foolproof. The only problem is that they are V expensive in terms of trackers- around gbp 250-300, so it does depend on your budget. 
We’ve also made sure to be VERY nice to local pubs, shops etc as when mum turns into an escape artist, they’re often amazing at calling us if she appears. Good luck!
comment 2: Do you also have the lo tech option in place: A not-easily-removable bracelet with contact info on it.

comment 3: My dad was obsessed with his wallet and always had it on him, so we bought a Tile and put it inside wallet. You can buy them at Target, etc. 
https://www.thetileapp.com
comment 4: We use Tracki. There’s a monthly subscription fee for the internet (required to ping to a satellite). It’s pretty good. The app is good, bit fiddly but once you learn it it’s ok. Maps the history too. 
The issue with trackers is the battery capacity. Which is related to 1) size (bigger = longer charge but harder to hide on someone’s person,clothes, etc) and 2) the refresh rate (how often it pings the satellite) - more frequent pings = faster battery drain, less frequent pings = less good idea of where people get up to. That said, if your person doesn’t walk around all day (like my dad) you could set it to refresh every 30 minutes and then refresh within the app to see where he is just at that moment. 
We have it set for a refresh every 10 minutes, usually get 10-13 hours that way. 
The tracki is about 2x2”. It’s ok on a keychain... idk about sewing it into clothes...  
Accuracy isn’t 100%, depends on the location (signal strength) and its good within a few blocks. Tracki supposedly “learns” location with use but it might be off by a building or too. Being in a rural vs urban area might make a difference one way or another too.
You can set a geofence too to let you know when they leave.
I think ours works on a 3G network btw. Have seen some products that operate on 2G, I believe that’s going to be phased out where it isn’t already. 
Overall This is better than the last tracker we had
comment 5: Thank you! I will have a look at it. Really appreciated :)
comment 6: My small care home installed an alarm at each doorway that would announce loudly if it was opened, example: ""front door opened"" that way care staff knew if residents were trying to escape out of immediate supervision. They recommended we installed a bed alarm under moms care home bed if mom got up at nighttime. That may be helpful as an alternative for your grandma that doesn’t require technical upkeep.

"Life Alert or ?? Hello, 
Is there some type of device like life alert that will alert when an elderly person falls and they’re alone? 
My father is in his mid 80s and he is alone for some time at home, but we are worried about him falling while he’s alone. 
Any device works and price is not an issue at the moment. Thank you!","comment 1: We have a Life Alert it's fine but definitely has some flaws. For example, if you accidentally press the button your loved one will need to verbally communicate with the speaker to yell them they are ok and provide a security code. 
My grandmother often times can't hear te alarm go off and has alot of trouble communicating the code to the operator leading to more false alarms than appropriate use.  On top of that a landline is required , so if you have one great, if you don't I dont think it's worth another bill (on top of the LA service).
comment 2: Accidentally pressing the button is a common issue with such devices, regardless of company or manufacturer. The idea is that it's better for the button to be super easy to press rather than too hard to press - they don't want someone not being able to press the button when they need to.
comment 3: A landline is not required. There are ways around the issue you're experiencing.
comment 4: Pretty sure some smart watches can have apps that detect falls. Might be worth looking into, as they can also be used to call for help
comment 5: Seconding this. They have watches specifically for elderly people. They have a lot of different options depending on what your priorities are.
There's heart rate, fall detection, auto call answering, geo fence (for wandering) and other options.

hope you'll find a good one
comment 7: My mom is limited to her room and bathroom 90% of the time so Amazon Alexa works well.  I also have devices placed around the house when she does move around. So far so good.  She can intercom, call and play her favorite songs by using her voice.
Helps both of us by tracking her meds and diet too. She likes to hear her calendar for nurse visits and exercise times.  Shopping list is a big plus too she tells Alexa and I will see it on my phone while at the store.
We have been using the Alexa system for about a year now.
comment 8: I actually just joined to ask for advice on this matter, but maybe I can help you with what I've found so far.
One thing to note, for those not aware, I purchased a life alert for my mother a few years ago,  without discussing this with her (life alert specifically asked/recommended if I had discussed this with her), and when it came in the mail, my mother was upset, and felt I was spending too much money, also felt as though she didn't need it.  She demanded I ship it back. Life alert will ship the unit, then schedule an appointment to get it set up. Because it wasn't set up, (3 year contract fulfilled), they allowed me to ship it back and only pay the nominal fee you agree to when it gets set up, as any company typically does.
Discuss this with your loved one before proceeding.
I went down the rabbit hole of trying to find a solution, and they all seem to offer 8 out of 10 options, with it staggered between some offering some solutions, and others offering other solutions, but no-one offering and all-in-one solution.
Some offer bulky watches that are not water proof, some offer lanyards that don't have a microphone, some offer all of the above, be require a specific carrier.
The big deal is the middle man. You may pay 40 dollars a month for a lanyard connected to your home wi-fi. This contacts an individual who will respond to the alert. They will initiate a call back, and further contact emergency medical if there is no response. 
For 80 dollars a month, they will set up a stand alone modem/router using their own router and include an extra gadget, such as a button to put in the shower.
For the full 120 they will include many gadgets, such as watches, lanyards, stand-alone network  routers, etc.
We always just call 911 for emergencies.  The apple watch has the capability of initiating a 911 call during a fall detection. When a fall is detected, it sounds off a bell/buzzer for a minute or so to cancel the call. If the user doesn't cancel, it will alert medics. It will then also alert contacts that you have set up.  I wish it would contact the contacts prior to the 911. I'm still trying to get it set up. Maybe others could help?
She happened to get a bit wavy with the hands the other day, and I heard it go off, on her wrist, and she ignored it until I grabbed her wrist and said ""It's asking if there is an emergency,"" so take that with some salt and tequila.
User needs to be within range of the iPhone, through local wi-fi connection, unless you get a stand-alone network on the watch, which is extra phone service (30 dollars a month roughly).
Because my mother lives with me, I have also bought a bunch of local CallToYou bell chimes that are placed around the home, that she can use to alert me if there are any issues. They are just some remote buttons that sound a chime. Easy to set up, probably many others on the market that do the same thing, not trying to push them specifically.
The apple watch allows medical information to also be included with the 911 alert, I've got some of that set up, such as medications, but I can't link to her medical group.
I've also heard of options/apps that you can put on the iPhone, that will contact third party before calling 911. This might be an option, but I haven't investigated too much yet.
A combination of the above, and a consistent check in time might be best.
Thanks for listening.
If anyone would like to add to this, please do! I could use the assistance.
comment 9: I guess my point was, if your father won't wear a lanyard in the shower, get him a decent waterproof watch. If he's not wearing it, it does little good.
comment 10: I have cameras in the house, set up in places that my mom is most likely to fall. I can check on the live feed via an app whenever I want. You can buy cameras individually online for about $40 each, and the livestream via app is free. I have one under my Mom's bed so she can't see it (she hates the cameras) but it's great because I just need the floor view to see if she fell, so I can rush over. She has a life alert but refuses to wear it.
comment 11: I work for Life Alert, a lot of elderly refuse to wear it unfortunately ._.

"Advice on getting my mom help? I am writing this because I’m taking on trying to help my mom’s mental health/cognitive situation sorted out and, frankly could use some insight and support.
About five years ago, my family started noticing that my mom was repeating the same stories, seemingly forgetting conversations she’d had with us and having some issues recalling names etc. She’s 69 now so my sister, aunt and I didn’t think much of it at first, that maybe she was just experiencing some age-related decline but  that it was likely nothing to get too worried about. We also noticed, independently of one another, that her already volatile moods (her side of the family has a history of bipolar disorder and we’ve long suspected she’s got some of those traits) started getting worse. She has stormed out of family gatherings for no known reason, had screaming fits where she has rolled on the front lawn because my sister didn’t appreciate her babysitting my nephew enough and had multiple episodes of that nature. 
The trouble is, because we’ve all had difficult run-ins with her and we have all had very busy lives far away, we have had only occasional contact with her. Mom, who has essentially lived alone on a mountain for the better part of a decade, hasn’t worked, had hobbies or done much of anything for almost all of that time because she got a good deal when my parents divorced and hasn’t had to worry about money. She really has not been good about keeping herself occupied, and because of her sometimes cruel and manipulative demeanor, she has been pretty isolated. She is a histrionic person in terms of personality, but fails at close relationships because she lashes out those closest to her all the time (and always has).
About a year ago, after speaking with her on the phone a few times, I started to feel like things had taken a turn. When I asked her, she didn’t have recollection of basic things (when she’d last been out, what she’d eaten that day, when she’d last taken the dog for a walk). I was concerned enough that I found time to visit her and, when I got to her house, I was shocked at just how bad things had become. It was clear she was starting to not take care of basic things like hygiene, feeding herself etc. Her dog was both severely overweight and seemingly ravenously hungry I later found out that it was because she would forget to feed him for days at a time and then, alternatively, forget she had fed him and over feed him some days. When I had conversations with her, she would repeat the same story/anecdote, often within a few minutes and then completely forget everything we’d talked about moments later. Whenever I mentioned that we were going over something we had just discussed, she lashed out and accused my of gaslighting her. It was shocking and I felt terribly guilty that I’d distanced myself enough from her to not notice how bad it was getting. 
On the drive home from that trip, I called my sister and aunt together to get their input on the situation and find out what they’d noticed. Like me, they had each been distancing themselves from her due to episodes of cruelty and hostility. I should also say that my mom has, until recently, been very cunning and sharp in her interpersonal relationships, which I think did a lot to cover her decline effectively from everyone around her. She is sharp in many ways but her memory is rendering that cunning part of her less and less effective. On that call with my sister and aunt, I found out that she’d gotten lost multiple times on familiar drives, gotten in major fights with each of them multiple times after seemingly small memory lapses were acknowledged, had major mood swings and even made half-hearted suicide threats with them.
Cut to a few months ago. I had a contract job come to an end and managed to arrange some things so I could come live here in NC with my mom in her house for the time being and hopefully get some treatment figured out. It hasn’t been easy and I’m met with constant resistance, but I’ve managed to get her to see her primary care doc, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, have a neuropsychological exam (as referred by her primary doc), got her a CT scan and, as of late week, finally got her to a neurologist. The primary doc had apparently expressed concerns about her memory to her in September of last year but my mom never followed up or told anyone. The neuropsych testing showed severe short-term memory loss of an unknown cause and also revealed a lot of the ways she guesses/fabricates to cover those memory losses. According to the testing, she retains virtually no information (of different types) minutes after learning it which tracks very much with my experience of conversations with her etc. The CT scan was clean but the neurologist ordered an MRI which will happen Monday. The psychiatric nurse practitioner, her primary doc and neuropsych tester all also brought up mood lability and histrionics, so much so that the tester put “suspected bipolar disorder” in his written test report.
So far, everyone thinks we are probably dealing with a mood disorder and some form of dementia, both of which are feeding each other. She was prescribed 2 mg of abilify but hated taking a drug for a mood disorder and demanded to go off it, and then was prescribed Aricept yesterday to hopefully curb some of the memory loss and associated mood issues.
I realize this is a wall of text, but I needed to let it out and hopefully hear some encouragement. Right now it feels like I’m fighting against my mom to try to get her help and, really, without getting her declared incompetent (which I really don’t want to do unless I absolutely have to) I am powerless to actually mandate anything. I should also state, she doesn’t really have a valid powers of attorney for either medical or general duties. My mom thinks she’s fine and continues to think it’s everyone else making it up. I know that there is a part of her that’s terrified but she covers it with meanness at almost every step. I’m frustrated/fried and feel stuck with what to do next.","comment 1: Hey. Just want to say that you're doing amazing work so far. It can be so difficult to get medical attention for a person who has cognitive problems, and that you've had your mom see several doctors is already an accomplishment. I know it doesn't mean much, but e-high-fives from an internet stranger. 
I don't know if I can offer specific advice as you will know your mom better than anyone. I can share my experience, though...
I'd encourage you to think about having your mom declared incompetent. It 100% was a difficult day for me when I did as much for my mum, but it barely phased my mum. I got caught up in what it meant, but my mum just thought a rude lady came to visit and forgot all about it by the time we finished supper. In spite of my misgivings, what the declaration allowed me to do was to get my mum the care that she needed. At the end of the day, that was worth it. I don't know your mom, but I feel reasonably confident in saying that if she is resisting diagnosis and treatment now, she's not going to have a Eureka moment later on. Taking care of the legal stuff asap means that the distance between you and your mom's care gets much shorter. At the end of the day, if her care is your biggest priority, well ... It might be worth considering. (Depending on where you are in the world, there are likely other steps to getting authority to make decisions for your mom. You may wish to contact the local Alzheimer's Society for guidance on this.)
Best wishes.
comment 2: Thank you very much for this response. With my mom, because she’s good at faking, I’m not sure she would be declared incompetent, 
at least not at this point. But it’s very helpful to have your take on it.
comment 3: My mum was very good at faking too. I think that it's pretty common in early dementia. 
I'm sure that it's different everywhere, but for us the process included several in person visits and written reports from people who knew my mum. The woman who visited was a nurse who spent her career specializing in dementia. The nurse could see right through my mum's dodges, usually just by staying relentlessly on subject. 
Anyway. I really do wish you all the best. It's a tough road.
comment 4: Out of curiosity, are you in the UK? Just noticing your use of “mum”. I’m wondering how different the legal protocol would be here in the states. If you are here, NVM. And thanks again!
comment 5: I'm in Canada. I think we split up here on the mum/mom thing.
comment 6: Gotcha. Well, I like “mum” myself but, being from Wisconsin, feel too pretentious saying it.
comment 7: I had a teacher in grade 2 teach us that if we pronounced it ""mum"" we should spell it that way. For whatever it's worth, I don't think most of the world would bat an eye at using the u if you feel bold one day.
comment 8: This sounds a lot like my mom. She has tried many things including Zyprexa for the mood disorder which helped but had too many side effects. 
She’s now on Gabapentin to help with the mood and Aricept for memory and Ativan as needed (which is bad for dementia but she has major panic attacks).  She’s still not okay. We’ve tried so many meds. When we get her calm her memory worsens. It stinks.
comment 9: It does stink, that’s for sure. I wish you the best with your journey in this. And thank you for your insight.

"My mom needs a medical alert “something” Looking for insight or experience with any device for essentially summoning  911 or, if we’re getting fancy, a family member. My mom recently spent 10 hours in the bathtub because she couldn’t get out by herself. Is willing to get something but everything about it needs to be as easy as possible otherwise she won’t do it, understand it, charge it, etc. 
She doesn’t have a cell phone...
I wondered if an Alexa or google home might work? I know zero about these systems ... 
or is “life alert” the answer? 
Many thanks, and good luck out there!","comment 1: My dad has a watch, which dependent on how much battery you're willing to use daily, can tell you lots of different things.
It has fall detection - you set the sensitivity. 
Emergency calls are made by holding a button, and you can opt for it to cycle through a few set personal contacts or straight to emergency if you pay more, but we don't use that as I get the calls.
You can also set it up to auto answer certain phone numbers in case you're worried about them.
There's lots of different watches I'm sure but they're pretty simple. The chargers are just magnetic and you place the watch on top (this is good as long as they don't move the charger or turn it off!)
comment 2: We used to use a life alert like system supplied by a local ambulance company. There was a necklace and a box connected to the land line phone. The necklace uses a battery that's good for 10 ish years.
We stopped using it because my mom would never wear the necklace.
comment 3: That's an excellent point. My Mother in Law passed away this past January and was not wearing her alert necklace so no help came. It was early morning and she had just gotten up to put the tea water on. But, when she was wearing it and needed help, from a fall or whatever, help was there in minutes.  I like the watch idea better.
comment 4: We set up an Alexa system at my parent’s house last year to run off of their land line with the Echo Connect. It was pretty easy, the hardest part was setting up the contact list on their iPad. 
My father is in a wheelchair primarily. He can transfer himself by walker to the bed, chair, toilet, etc, but has fallen a bunch of times. He’s too big and weak for my mom to help him up without hurting herself.The device has really been helpful as they can just shout “Alexa, call 911”.
We just added one to the garage as he’s been hanging out there this summer reorganizing decades of construction supplies. He listens to music out there, checks the time, calls my mom to tell her to pick up something at the store. It’s very convenient!
comment 5: I have this in my house for my mother.  There's an alexa in every room she goes into (including the bathroom).   I also have a couple WYZE cameras in primary areas so I can check in on her while I'm at work (and they allow me to speak to her as well).
comment 6: Thanks for this. After researching for a time this seemed to be a great option. Sadly, it seems the ‘connect’ is no longer available. I’m feeling it less and less likely to use these smart home assistants without a working cell phone. I’ll keep looking!
comment 7: I looked into one for my elderly uncle who had just underwent brain surgery and lives alone. The two big things are ""fall detection"" and the ability to press a button on a desk or a button on a necklace. The calls are placed via a cellular/mobile phone network the user doesn't need a cellphone.
There are a few scammy companies that do not have medically trained staff answering the phone. You'll know they are poor quality because they are the ones who advertise the cheapest price.
Health insurance may cover the cost of an alert system.
In the end we didn't get one but of the ones I saw I think any with fall detection are the best option.
comment 8: I'm using the Lively medical device through Great Call.  I don't think any system has everything I want, but this hit most of my check boxes and we have been happy with the service so far.  It's not terribly expensive and they are very responsive when it detects falls.  We had a couple of false alarms and a couple of misfires when we first got it and their response time was fantastic.  One of the big complaints is that for some reason the device flashes, you don't see it in the light, but when it's dark it is something you notice even when your eyes are closed.
comment 9: I've been looking at getting a fall detection watch for my dad. But he doesn't know how to use a smartphone, even though we've tried teaching him.
Do you feel that this is necessary for their products?
comment 10: I got my dad an ""elder phone"", the brand is Doro. It's a basic flip phone, and he carries it in a little pouch that he wears on a lanyard around his neck. He has got almost everyone to call him on his cell now, so it's always easy to reach, but the best part is the emergency button on the back of the phone. If he falls (he has, a week after I got it for him) he can just long press a physical button on the back of the phone and it is set to call me. Might be an option for you/your dad.
comment 11: This what I want to get for my mother.
comment 12: I cannot verify how objective this site is, but it seems like a good place to start. Consumer Reports also has a guide, but it's a little overwhelming. 
https://www.medicalalertbuyersguide.org/best-medical-alert-systems/
comment 13: please look at this article and we can discuss.
This is by far one of the most difficult problems, and is easy now that we have voice command devices.
My mother used to keep her alert on the toilet, because if she fell, in her logic, that'd be where she fell.
It was infuriating.
Definitely use a voice controlled smart device , I know some people who could help you more than I can if that interests you, i'll email them.

comment 14: I have Ask My Buddy set up on Alexa for my mom. Alexa will call anyone on a list you set up, she would just have to say ""Alex ask my buddy to call "" "". It works really well! Here's the info:  https://www.askmybuddy.net/
comment 15: Hi. Thanks for this. I’ve been researching all of these answers and I believe smart tech is the way to go. I am having trouble getting a straight answer about whether a cell phone is needed for this to be operational and make phone calls with a voice command. I can certainly use MY cell phone to set this whole thing up but does it work after that without one? I thought I had a handle on this with the help of “echo connect” which makes landline a viable option but apparently they no longer make them. If you have a minute ... what’s your situation/set up?
comment 16: We have an Echo Dot and added the Ask My Buddy skill and then added the contact names and phone #'s of people my mom would need to call. The program will call cell phones and/or landlines. I can't remember all the steps I took to set it up but I do know it was pretty easy. This should tell you all you need to know about that and they do have Support also:  https://www.askmybuddy.net/quick_start.php 
Once its all set up all she had to do was say ""Alexa ask My Buddy to alert (name of person) "" It can also send text messages and emails. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
comment 17: I am a retired paramedic.  I suggested life alert often to people in the same situation as you are.  We would respond at least 1 time a day to life alert calls.  Life alert stays on the line with the person until someone shows up and then they verify we are there and ask us to reset the system.  No I don't work for them, but I sure have worked with them a lot.  When it is time for me to get a system, I will be getting them.
comment 18: >Looking for insight or experience with any device for essentially summoning  911 or, if we’re getting fancy, a family member.

I'm not sure if this will work for her, but I have an Alcatel GO FLIP.
comment 19: I have Alexa set up, but parents tend to forget it's there or how to use it to contact me. I can check in on them with the Echo Show devices in a couple places though.
comment 20: There's a company called Senior Safety Alert, that's what we used for my grandmother. It has a base with a big red button, that needs to sit in a central location in the house. It plugs into an outlet, and also into the phone line. Then you get either a watch or a necklace with a button that they wear. Pressing the button connects a person who will ask if everything is okay. If they can hear you, you say what's wrong, they send help. If they can't hear you (you're in the bathroom, it's too far away, etc.) they send help anyway. It's all very easy, there's nothing to charge. The only thing to remember is not to wear the watch/necklace in the shower or bath...lay it nearby so you can reach it, but don't get it wet.
comment 21: I am in a similar boat I have narrowed my search down to 1) Medical Guardian or 2) Bay Alarm Medical. I have combed hundreds of sites and reviews and these are consistently at the top but I am astounded at the lack of in depth fair comparisons out there... The trailing third place would likely be Phillips HomeSafe with AutoAlert and very last of the top 4 would be LifeAlert because I have seen many post from EMT related people saying they get calls from it all the time.
comment 22: I worked for Philips Lifeline for 13 years. It’s a great service. I’m happy to answer any questions about the service that you have!

"Need Advice: Super Obese Sister can't live in the home anymore! Hi,
First, I know obesity is a hot issue and people can be cruel about it.  My stepsister is a human being and I can't go back in time to before my parents married to ""fix"" her situation or how she was enabled into her situation.
So goes like this her parents have been caring for her whole life. She was always obese, but after she got cancer, the pounds came on and she's now immobile and bed-bound.  They are nearly 80s and a few weeks ago Peepaw was told he can't take care of her anymore and both parents are being moved to an assistive living facility.  
Meemaw and I had a talk last time I was there to help and she was nearly in tears because she said she just couldn't do it anymore.  Sister is on SSI, but for some reason, they never sent a caregiver or home care nurse to her regularly.  And of course, those two tiny old people cannot get her up or move her. 
So they are packing up the hoarder house to sell, but they need a place for the sister.  No one in our area who has a care home wants to take a super obese person because of the risks to staff.  I was a caregiver for people with CP and I know.  Lifts are still dangerous and I had a staff member go on to Workman's comp after a lifting incident with a super obese person.   And cleaning up is no party, but she is still a human being. 
Does anyone know of any facilities that might take her for TREATMENT?  We can plug her into a senior care home, but she's 50, has a healthy mind, and she can get better if someone gives her an eating disorder treatment and the medical care she needs to lose enough weight to be mobile.  Once that happens she can come live with me. 
<3 to everyone out there dealing with this.  I'm personally recovering from ED and while I have been super obese, I've never been bed-bound and trapped like my step-sister is.  I know she's in pain and her legs alone (massive cellulitis) give her infections due to not moving.","comment 1: Can you contact social services in you area and see if they have any advice or options?
comment 2: I'm so sorry you're going through this. We have an incredibly similar situation in my family and I know how challenging it can be for everyone involved.
I wish I had more to offer, we're also at a loss most of the time, but I think it's important to talk to her medical team about getting some professional help to come in regularly for her. The situation has changed.
I also think it's important to include her in everything possible about this planning. Her whole life is being taken from her involuntarily, in a manner of speaking. She's being involuntarily forced from her comfort zone and into the unknown. It sounds like she already has a lot of unaddressed emotional challenges. If this is going to be successful, she's going to need to take the lead as often as possible in the decision-making. She needs to have some control so she can begin to rebuild her sense of self-efficacy. 
I would also reach out to as many bariatric specialists as you can find and ask about resources in your area.
I hope this transition goes as smoothly as possible for everyone
comment 3: > Does anyone know of any facilities that might take her for TREATMENT? 
What kind of treatment is appropriate?  If it's a medical procedure, get her scheduled; if it's psychological, get her scheduled.  If it's in-facility treatment, find out what treatment is appropriate and research facilities that do that.  This all depends on what treatment is appropriate, and probably only a doctor can tell you what that is. 
It honestly sounds like she's been enabled to slowly kill herself, and now that her help is gone she'll either fail medically, or lose enough weight to support herself (no pun intended).
comment 4: If you've seeing the TV shows based on super obese people you probably have seen the ""set the scene"" backstory portions of the show where it is pretty obvious there are adults in these folks lives who are enabling the behavior consciously or not. 
The seperation from her enablers is going to be dramatic so I have this high hope there is an ED facility out there that will take an immobile, obese person to start.  That means psychological care and medical.  
Two years ago I went to one of these places after I had weight loss surgery because I wasn't coping well and hurting myself due to ED and the surgery.  They had a residential program and I opted to be home since I lived two miles away.  I never have been immobile or waited on, but I have been enabled by a previous partner in the sickest way.  I contacted the staff (whom are wonderful, smart people) to see if taking on a case like this is going to be a major time investment.
So I figured a research-based facility would be more interested than dropping her into a care home alone (with no family) and just letting her die. 
This is going to be terrifying for her to be removed of her enablers and she will be put on a limited diet no doubt in a home.  She'll need therapy most of all during this. 
My step-dad and mom are super cruel to fat people and they have no compassion for this girl.  I'm not sure about the rest of the family, but I don't want her to kill herself because they treat her like she's a lesser human and not deserving of care that has to be SPECIFICALLY for people with eating disorders and the medical commodities of obesity. 
Everyone dies.  Its the only guarantee in life.  However, making her suffer and rot until she does pass away is something we can prevent and hopefully delay so she can have a semblance of a real life.
comment 5: You're very compassionate, she's lucky.  So you want to take her to an inpatient care center.  Contact the bariatric unit of the hospital in the area, they might have a list of such centers, or at the very least, tell you the search terms to find them online.

"Both my job and home life are centered around caregiving but i feel like I have no right to be so stressed I’m a 22F college student who lives at home during the summers with both my parents and my 82 y.o grandmother. I am almost certain she is in the beginning stages of dementia as she is exhibiting both rapid cognitive decline and obsessive tendencies/behaviors. I also work at a res. school for kids with severe trauma and behavioral needs. It’s a really stressful job with an extremely high turnover rate but I still love it. However there are somedays that it is all too much. 
For BG, my grandma moved in with us around seven years ago after my grandfather died. Unfortunately, the day he died she completely stopped living. For about five years her life was limited to only going to the grocery store, the drug store, watching TV, and visiting our relatives at least twice a month. About two years ago in June, she stopped being able to drive due to spinal stenosis and the pain medications she took for it. For months she could hardly move, until they realized she needed a hip replacement before they could do anything for her spine. She got the hip replacement and was in a rehab for about a month. Ok, done. We get her out of the rehab and finally home but are told she has cancer in her breast and lymphnodes. They tell her (rightfully so) she is too old for chemo and needs to have a mastectomy. Ok, done. She gets the mastectomy and my parents and I switch off caring for her and taking her to daily doctors apts. We are told she has some cancer cells remaining in her lymph nodes but that medication will stop it from growing for at least a few years. Ok, done. At this point, it is February and she has hardly left the house for anything other than a hospital in months. The difference in her brain from June to February was both scary and depressing. Still nothing is done for her spine either.
So now it’s a year and a half later. My grandmother is still capable of doing a good amount of things: she can walk short distance with a wheeler, she can bathe/dress herself, she can empty some things from the dishwasher, and she is (slightly) capable of using her ipad. What she can’t do anymore is: cook, clean, use the microwave, change channels on the remote, keep track of medications, drive, or use any kind of critical thinking. 
As much as I love her, she is unbelievably ungrateful for all we do for her. When she wants something, it HAS to be right away or else she gets upset. She doesn’t even like the fact I go to school because she would rather I stay home to care for her.
Due to COVID, she has spent the last four months inside the house. My parents have been working from home which she got very used too. My dad recently went back to the office and my mom is away from home right now taking care of my grandfather who just had a stroke (another thing i’m stressed about). This means for the last two weeks I have been the sole one caring for her on top of my very chaotic job. 
Yesterday we got in a tiff when I couldn’t help but get visibly annoyed at her for something small (she had just been following me around, asking about every little thing i did all morning). She wouldn’t stop asking why I was annoyed and I told her I just needed some space. She told me she clearly “thinks too much of me” and will “never ask a single thing of me again” and that she would go sit in her chair and “shut up like the useless old lady she is”. I started crying on the spot because I already know her life is miserable and I feel awful every time I even get annoyed with her. She is extremely passive aggressive and jealous of younger people (which she admits to). 
Last week I was late to work twice because I completely forgot what day it was. I’ve been unbelievably agitated the last two weeks. My brain feels like it is in a complete fog. It didn’t occur to me till yesterday that this could be CG burnout, but I feel like I have no right to complain. There are people who spend decades of their lives caring for people who can’t dress or bathe themselves. I don’t know if it is because of the job I work that I am burning out so easy. Maybe I need advice or maybe I just needed to vent. And maybe i’m not so mad at her as I am mad about what’s happened to her. I’m not sure yet. Either way if you’ve read this entire thing... thank you and I apologize for the earful!
Also, for a quick reference of what I mean by a chaotic job: I came about a quarter of an inch from losing my eye a few weeks ago when a student tried to stab it with a pencil. Now I have a nasty scar right next to my eye. I’ve also been spit on, bitten, punched, kicked, peed on, you name it lol.","comment 1: You have all the right in the world to be stressed. Do not feel guilty. What you are experiencing is stress that every caregiver feels. My mother was the same way. You feel like an absolute shitheel but you cannot process it differently.  I constantly try and rationalize what my patients are thinking and I can NEVER figure it out. Because we can't. My Uncle is going down the same path, I see it coming. He has different health challenges than my mother did, but it will end the same.  Chin up. You aren't alone. Message me if you need to.  I had a caregiving mentor and still do. We talk regularly. It helps. I haven't the courage to go to a caregiver group meeting, but they do exist.  I spend a lot of time alone in my head. For you at 22 to be experiencing what I did and do from the age of 32 when I started down this road, to where I am at 50, I can't imagine I could have done what I do now at age 22. You truly are a very very special individual. ❤️🤗
comment 2: Thank you so much! Your comment actually put a big smile on my face! I can’t imagine being a caregiver for 18 years, your mom and uncle are/were very lucky to have someone like you❤️
comment 3: Please remind yourself that when she criticizes you, it is not really her saying those things to you, it's the dementia talking. It's how her brain is classifying and dealing with her fear.  *hugs*
comment 4: Hey, me too. Seriously, I feel almost the exact same way as you do. I’ve only been caring for my dad for a month or so but I’m already experiencing burnout. Unfortunately I don’t have any advice but I want you to know that you aren’t alone and I’m sure the other folks on here can give you some. I think being young sometimes makes it harder, of course we want to be unselfish and care for our loved ones but there’s so much to do and you see people the same age as you not being responsible for anyone.
comment 5: you suck it up until you can't. the important part is figuring out when/where ""you can't"" starts.

"App for remote health monitoring of seniors I lost my grandmother to Alzheimer's a few years ago. I remember it was very eye opening at the time to see the incredible burden on the caregiver- physically, mentally, and emotionally. 
Since I am a mobile developer my trade, I spent the last year and a half working on an app to help remotely care for an elderly individual- especially one with cognitive impairment. Not sure if this is of use or interest to anyone here, but I sure hope so! I realize this is a Dementia subreddit, not Alzheimer's, and I did share my app in the Alzheimer's subreddit as well- but I was hoping this would be of some use or interest to the community here. Would love to get some feedback!
Basically: you pair your app with your patient's (grandparent, parent, uncle, etc), and get real-time updates and visualizations about their safety, health, and wellness.
This is not your ordinary location tracker: it is chock full of advanced activity and behavior recognition like stress detection, sleep detection, extended inactivity, extreme weather, fall detection, etc. I hope its something a bit different that makes the caregiver experience simpler and easier.

I think there is probably limited utility for a smartphone app with many dementia patients because of this.
If something like that could be incorporated into a smartwatch app and a caregiver put the watch on the person with a non-removable band, then I could see a lot of utility.  It would even be useful in institutional environments.
comment 2: That is great feedback. Thank you! 
I should clarify that this is not an app for Alzheimer's patients- it is broadly an app for tracking elderly, that I hope could be applied to some segment of the elderly population with early stage Alzheimer's or Dementia. It may not do much good for an individual who requires round the clock in-person care and supervision already.
To your point about smartphone usage in the affected population, I believe there are a couple form factors that might work. For example, there are some lanyard-style ways to carry phones I have seen- or a little leather pouch around the waist, for example, if the pocket is not convenient. But I completely understand that it will not work for most individuals. 
If you have any other questions or thoughts, please don't hesitate to reach out.
comment 3: In my case, we tried various ways to keep the phone on my sister (I had a tracking app installed), but they all failed.  Unless they can understand that they need to have the phone with them, then it's not going to work. That's one reason why memory care facilities (where my sister now lives) utilize non-removable wristbands that trigger alarms near exits.
For non-dementia people, I think it could be a great tool.
comment 4: Thanks for the feedback, I totally understand! I am considering a smartwatch port for android os.
comment 5: Obviously you would have a tracker of some type on the patient, what exactly is it? Demetia patients lose everything, phones watches, glasses.
comment 6: Thanks for the comment. Right now its just a mobile phone app. The mobile phone could be worn in a variety of nonstandard ways, such as around the neck or on the waist, that I hope could help. However, I fully realize this will not work for everybody. The app was not necessarily designed solely for alzheimer's or dementia- but my hope is that it can serve some purpose.
comment 7: Where does that data get stored during app usage, when it's closed and after it's deleted???
comment 8: It is stored in a fully encrypted database, with no personally identifiable information: totally anonymized.
comment 9: Great idea! My mother would def be prying off the cell phone. She’s taken apart and destroyed  many “unbreakables” keep working on it. It will work for some people and is a great idea.

Any plans to port this to iOS? If you need help on the (iOS) design side, let me know.
comment 2: Thanks for the encouragement! I am looking into an iOS port. The first thing I need to figure out is if the iOS operating system allows background processes in the same way Android does. Otherwise, tracking would be quite challenging.
comment 3: You can request background location services; if the user allows, the system will give you location in the background. Otherwise, most processes are permitted in the background, assuming you follow guidelines and get user permission for the private items that require permission.
comment 4: Can you elaborate more on how this works? Is the Alz patient supposed to have a smartphone and enter in all that info constantly? I don't get it.
My dad is 81 and his tech skills stopped at about the year 2001, he can barely turn on his  flip phone, let alone carry a smartphone around at all times. I'm not sure how this app would help me?
comment 5: Thanks for your comment! First of all, I should clarify that this is not an app for Alzheimer's patients- it is broadly an app for tracking elderly, that I hope could be applied to some segment of the elderly population with early stage Alzheimer's or Dementia. It may not do much good for an individual who requires round the clock in-person care and supervision already.
There were several themes in the design of Peace of Mind:
- First, no manual data entry. As you correctly point out, many elderly individuals would not do well with self report. Those who could, would rather not. Therefore, the entire app is automatic AI-based activity and behavior recognition algorithms: no manual data entry required. Its quite possible with today's wearable sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS. 
- Secondly, this app is not just for making you aware of emergencies: its also tailored to allowing you to check in periodically and confirm that everything is OK. Hence the name ""Peace of Mind"". 
To your point about carrying a smartphone at all times, I believe there are a couple form factors that might work. For example, there are some lanyard-style ways to carry phones I have seen- or a little leather pouch around the waist, for example, if the pocket is not convenient.
The app would regularly report location, location change, fitness history (daily steps, extended inactivity), stress, fall detection, and a host of other things. I'm happy to provide elaborations of how these things work in further detail if anyone is interested.
If you do decide to check out Peace of Mind, DM me and I am happy to give you gold membership for free, so you can try out the premium features (goal is not really to make money, but I had to add some monetization features because my server costs are sky high).
comment 6: Thanks for clarifying! You've got some good ideas.
I am trying to think of how an app like that would work for me and my situation. My dad has mild-moderate dementia, but is still fairly independent (he drives, is ok with all personal self-care such as dressing, etc.) but lives with me and I help him with a particular health issue and track all his meds, etc. He has a flip phone, though mostly it's just for habit because he rarely uses it, I think it is mostly a symbol of his ""independence"" by this point to have it clipped to his belt. I have tried many times to teach him what a smartphone is, with limited success. 
I have a gps tracker that I put in his car, and even though the battery is not great, at least it helps me be assured he is not lost. It requires a pricey yearly subscription, so if it was already built into another app that would definitely be a plus.
I would definitely be interested in giving it a try. I could get him one of those very basic smartphones for seniors and talk to him about carrying it around for safety. He's gotten lost a few times and I know it kind of scared him so this would give us some peace of mind. 
Does the app have a way to set medication reminders? ""Did you take your morning medicines?"" With a big yes/no button. That would be super useful.
Another would be to have a way for me to set a calendar with automatic reminders of upcoming medical appointments. He likes to know about what's happening in advance, so something like ""Reminder! You have an appointment with Dr. Smith tomorrow at 11:00am! Sally will be by to pick you up at 10:30am."" With additional reminders closer to the time, say 30 minutes prior, or something.
How does the app measure stress levels? Can you expand on that?'
Anyway, sure, I'll DM you. I'll give it a try.
comment 7: >I have tried many times to teach him what a smartphone is, with limited success.
I totally understand the struggle! If you could get him in the habit of carrying a smartphone around with him and charging it nightly, he would not need to interact with it in any other meaningful way for Peace of Mind to work. The app is very simple in its interface and really just runs in the background.
> I would definitely be interested in giving it a try. I could get him one of those very basic smartphones for seniors and talk to him about carrying it around for safety. He's gotten lost a few times and I know it kind of scared him so this would give us some peace of mind.
That's great to hear! Hearing about someone interested in this (after all the world involved) is a huge morale boost for me. I'd love to keep in touch with you through the process to learn more about how your experience is going. When selecting an Android phone, please make sure it runs at least Android 7.0 or higher (almost all new phones do, but just double check). Also, Huawei on some occasions does not play well with background processes to save battery, which can be annoying. I believe Motorola phones are a good choice for this app, though it should work on almost everything.
> Does the app have a way to set medication reminders? ""Did you take your morning medicines?"" With a big yes/no button. That would be super useful.
As far as medication reminders and appointments, unfortunately, no such functionality yet. I decided for this app to go with all automatic behavior monitoring, to distinguish myself from the other apps on the market (lots of them do alarms, reminders, medication, but very few are holistic behavior monitoring solutions). However, I am definitely open to expanding the app functionality in the future. I assume your yes/no button would be on the patient side of the app, encouraging them to manage their own medication, correct? Rather than reminding the caregiver to administer the medication on the caregiver app? 
> How does the app measure stress levels? Can you expand on that?'
Current methods of stress assessment with wearables use heart rate variability, or galvanic skin response (usually the former, since the latter is overly noisy and requires special sensors). Since Peace of Mind is an app for phones rather than watches, in this case I do neither. Instead, I am estimating stress with several different metrics including (but not limited to) the following: - The number of times the phone screen is turned on and off recently - The number of times the device is picked up and put down recently - Any pacing behavior observed recently (transitioning from walking to idle rapidly, multiple times in the last few hours).
In addition to fusing this data into a single stress score that is graphed over time, I also provide a breakdown so you can observe individual metrics: fidgeting, restlessness, inactivity, etc. Of course this is by no means perfect, but my hope is that it adds another layer of actionable information into the app dashboard.
Thank you for your interest! Really appreciate your support. I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have.

"Seeking advice - how to tell if my mother's mind is slipping or if she is having memory problems due to medication. I moved my 67yo mother in with us recently because her physical health is failing. She loves to garden, but because her arms are fragile and it hurts her to carry heavy items, she and I selected 2 new lighweight hoses to make it easiest on her (among other purchases/household improvements to help her). But this morning, she is carrying heaving dishpans FULL of water from kitchen sink thru the house to outside across the yard to water all her plants. ??? I begged her to use the new hose, and she said ""It is too much work."" (She has never even used it once yet).  She is now on her 12th trip out to the flowerbeds because she refuses to use the hose even after I unspooled it for her and she won't accept help carrying the heavy dishpans full of water. 
I have been noticing other strange choices and behavior since I started to work from home these last months (like saying she hasn't taken any meds after we watched her take them an hour ago and the evidence is there but she will not believe). I'm not sure how to handle what I am witnessing and when/if to get a doctor involved. When will I know to take more serious action to protect her from herself with her short term memory slipping? (There are other work from home adults in the household to keep an eye on her, but she's my mom not theirs, you know?) I have tried to talk to her about her medication being better organized to help her see what has been taken vs not taken, but she will not believe any of us that she is starting to have problems and undoes/ignores anything we do to help her. Her friends all tell her she is just flighty, not having problems. But she came in 4 times this morning (in 10 minutes) to ask me to add sugar to her water when it boils. On the fourth time I pointed out I had already said I would and she was confused because she thought it was the first time she was asking. I checked the trash and saw she put on 3 new pain patches today (I track this everyday) but she told me she didn't put on any, even though I can see one peeking out from under her shirt when she bends down. She now believes the pain patch is from yesterday and she forgot to take it off. I tried to explain how I knew it was a new patch and she dismissed the whole thing and went out to play in the garden. 
If you made it this far in my overly-long jumbled rant, do you have any advice for convincing her there is a problem?","comment 1: It's possible she is noticing herself and, out of worry, is trying to ignore it as much as she can. I'm not sure if trying to prove her how she is repeating stuff or that she has other problems is going to be helpful, since it may turn you into an antagonist in her mind. The fear of losing our faculties and not being able to decide over our own life anymore is very pronounced (and with good reason) in the elderly. 
I'd maybe try to go the route of her close friends, and ask one or two of them to sit down with you and describe what is happening when they are not around. Right now, your mom is getting reinforcement from them that isn't actually doing her any good, and it would be better if you could get them as your allies. It also can be difficult for people to accept input from their children, due to an often unwelcome reversal of the parent-child roles, but they are more ready to accept it from friends or other people similar in age and perceived authority. 
One thing that definitely needs to be checked out is if your mom has a UTI. Especially in older people, those can lead to exactly the kind of odd behaviour you have described. That could be something you could ask one of the friends to present to your mom as their suggestion, so it doesn't hit the wall your mom has put up against input from you and others she wants to put up a strong and capable front for. The important thing is to get her to see a doctor, and if that needs to happen with conviction by proxy, so be it.
comment 2: Thank you. I have gotten one of her trusted church friends on board with me recently at least. I will ask her to approach her on the UTI issue. My mother has always been the one taking care of her siblings and friends. It is hard for her to not be in control as often now. When I moved her in with us, we both knew she was deteriorating, but it was more physical issues with a little bad money decision issues. It breaks my heart to see that look on her face when she asks me to take care of something she just did an hour ago and she makes me prove it by walking her over to show her I can't do it because she already did it. I am trying to be gentle and patient. I know the value of positive emotional reinforcement.
comment 3: hydration is an issue too with older women.
The talk older women don't like to share: incontinence. All those 'depends' commercials aren't there for nothing!
Women will pee more - uncontrolled - as we get older. So that kinda sucks. When we cough, laugh... have running water on our hands... even at night, we either get up more often to pee or possibly even pee our beds. 
I know. I'm 59 and seeing this happen to me, but more to the point, my 61 year old sister is having it worse. 
Here's the problem: Women will STOP DRINKING WATER to prevent the pee issue. 
BIGGER problem: not hydrating is bad for the brain and symptoms mirror dementia. 
I share all this to say: is your mom hydrating? 
This is a shot in the dark. Might not be the issue. But could be! 
Best of luck!
comment 4: Great advice.
comment 5: Just a public service announcement: UTIs are commonly diagnosed in older patients as a cause of altered mental status but this is not really an evidenced based practice. Providers frequently jump on a UTI as a cause of non specific symptoms based on results of a urinalysis or a positive urine culture, neither of which are tools that can really identify a UTi, rather they should be used to support a diagnosis of a UTI based on symptoms. The problem with this is the provider then stops looking into other causes of the altered mental status if they exist like medications or the patient gets put on unnecessary antibiotics which can cause side effects or Colonization with resistant bacteria that make real infections more difficult to treat. In a patient who is able to detail the presence of UTI symptoms (pain when urinating or urinary frequency, flank pain, among others), the absence of these almost always means it’s not a UTI. I would not suggest pursuing treatment for UTIs for older patients when they aren’t complaining of symptoms consistent with a UTI. -Infectious Disease pharmacist

comment 9: If after ruling out (or discovering and treating) UTI (or any other physical cause), you still see things that give you concern, one thing that others have suggested as a way to get their elder who is in denial about memory loss to the doctor is not to try to convince them that they are having problems, but rather to frame it as a normal check-up; that the doctor is going to give them some baseline tests now while the elder is “well”, so that they can tell later if there are any changes.
comment 10: We share the same doctor. I think this would be easy to get done. Thank you.
comment 11: The hose is new, maybe she is set in her ways. Work in the yard with her a bit and use the new hose so she can see and offer her to try it and see how nice it is. Sometimes they just want what they think works and shy from new things.
Talk to her doc about the medication. If she is forgettingthen you may need to manage them for awhile.
My dad always insisted he do his own and was having issues. he took 5 days worth of morning pills one day and thats when I took over med mgt. His health is improved
Also may talk to her doc or neuro about her issues and see what they say
Best of luck
comment 12: You have to watch your Mom with her pain meds & patches.  She absolutely can’t be wearing several patches at once - it’s too much in her system, no matter what kind of medicine it is.
You should buy a weekly pill divider.  It is a case that holds 7 pods, one for each day.  Each day has 4 sections: morning, afternoon, evening, bedtime.  If you fill it once a week, she can take her medicine from there.  (You’ll also be able to tell when she’s missed a dose, so you can give it to her.) Then you can LOCK UP the rest of her medicine.  Same with patches, give her the one she needs, lock the rest up.  Anyone with memory issues cannot be responsible for their own medication needs. She’ll be mad for awhile, but that’s better than being hospitalized or worse because she overdosed.  I’m an EMT and see it a lot, it’s not just illegal stuff on the streets, it’s also unintentional overdoses from people with memory problems.
comment 13: Due to her medical conditions, she is allowed 2-3 pain patches a day (I hunted down the prescription because that scared me at first, too) plus other heavy meds. Dealing with the pill situation is going to be tough, but we are determined. I fear it may require an intervention. I fear what happens when our area starts opening up and I am not around so much.
comment 14: Our pharmacies here can dose your meds into blister packs, easily labelled as which pill to take on which day and at which time. I'm not sure of this costs extra, but it would make your - and her - life easier if you just put a quick call into the pharmacy and asked them to do this, then you could probably slip it by her quite easily under the guise of ""this is how they do everyone's meds over x age now"" or some other silly explanation. The only downside is that I believe they can only do this for meds for 1 week at a time, or so I remember hearing from a friend.
comment 15: There is r/dementia.
comment 16: You need to talk with her doctor and let them know your concerns and let them rule out several things.  She could be developing dementia, or it could be too many medications combined.  Also just because she is prescribed 2 - 3 pain patches does not mean that combined with other medications it is still the correct dosage.  It could be a basic med adjustment.  Although UTI's are not uncommon and do cause altered mentation, there are other things that must be ruled out first.  In other words she needs a doctor's opinion and you need to go to the doctor's appointment and let them know your concerns.

Abstract
Objective: Effect of a probiotic on the gut microbiome and peripheral immune function in healthy controls and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
Methods: MS patients (N = 9) and controls (N = 13) were orally administered a probiotic containing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus twice-daily for two months. Blood and stool specimens were collected at baseline, after completion of the 2-month treatment, and 3 months after discontinuation of therapy. Frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used for immune cell profiling. Stool samples were used for 16S rRNA profiling and metabolomics.
Results: Probiotic administration increased the abundance of several taxa known to be depleted in MS such as Lactobacillus. We found that probiotic use decreased the abundance of taxa previously associated with dysbiosis in MS, including Akkermansia and Blautia. Predictive metagenomic analysis revealed a decrease in the abundance of several KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways associated with altered gut microbiota function in MS patients, such as methane metabolism, following probiotic supplementation. At the immune level, probiotic administration induced an anti-inflammatory peripheral immune response characterized by decreased frequency of inflammatory monocytes, decreased mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD80 on classical monocytes, as well as decreased human leukocyte antigen (HLA) D related MFI on dendritic cells. Probiotic administration was also associated with decreased expression of MS risk allele HLA-DQA1 in controls. Probiotic-induced increase in abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium was associated with decreased expression of MS risk allele HLA.DPB1 in controls.
Interpretation: Our results suggest that probiotics could have a synergistic effect with current MS therapies. Ann Neurol 2018.

comment 18: So where and how on earth do you get k2mk7, and does it have a name? I found out my vitamin d was incredibly low so I’m going to be taking 50,000 IU a day, but if I can safely double it that would get me back to normal levels more quickly.
Edit: wow! Thanks for the awards!!! They’re my first!
comment 19: For every 10000iu (10mg d3), 100mcg k2 mk7, (walmart has mk5), 500mg magnesium also makes sure the d is getting where it needs to go, and the beetroot/dark leafy green nitrates .. er 
Anyway the k2 compared to everything is the most precious. It may be some lost primordial version of vitamin E which is used by the barrel as an industrial preservative. Compared to a kilo of vitamin C, curcumin, black pepper extract, grapeseed from say a website like bulksupplements dot com, the vitaminshoppe is my go to for the k2. Around $20 for 100 capsules. 
40000iu d3, 400k2 is an experimental daily dose for controlling asthma.
Vitamik C was shown to reduce the drop in fev1 after exercise, so vitamin c preserves the strength of the force of exhalation for the first second,  this fev1 is related to lifespan and lung cancer risk
comment 20: Wow. Thank you. I'll check that out.

"Attractive medical alerts Hi guys— my father recently passed away and now my mom lives alone. I’m looking for a medical alert bracelet/necklace/watch that looks like jewelry, not a medical device. I’m not sure if she wants monitored or unmonitored. Google hasn’t shown anything. Anyone know of anything? I’m thinking of the Apple Watch, but my mom is pretty scared of tech, so I’m reluctant. She does have an iPhone tho. TIA!","comment 1: What do you want it to do? Call 911 if she falls? Measure her heart rate? Just have her medical info on it?
comment 2: I want it to call 911 or a family member at the press of a button or using a voice command. Thanks!
comment 3: Oh dear, so sorry to hear of the loss of your dad. For full disclosure, I am a founder of a comprehensive global medical alert and emergency ID system called iCE Angel - ID. We use two ""trigger"" points for an emergency alert: (i) app panic buttons on Apple and Android phones and watches that are good to use if your mum is conscious and able at the time; and more significantly (ii) QR codes that can be scanned with any phone by any rescuer or passer-by if your mum is unconscious or unable to self-help. 
From an aesthetic point of view, our panic button is an app on the phone or watch; while the QR code is given to you in two downloadable template formats (a) as an emergency ID card on a wallet-sized template that you can self-print and laminate as many as you want (I leave them in my wallet, on the back of my phone cover, on my bike, and in each of my backpacks) and (b) as emergency ID photo image to place on your phone’s lockscreen. In addition, you could also (c) create your own wearable IDs by printing the QR code on anything else, for example, I’ve engraved mine on an army-type dog tag. FYI, all medics worldwide are trained to look for medical alerts in wallets, wristband, necklace, and phones. 
The two aforementioned trigger options – panic button and QR code - are independent of each other, meaning you can use either or both, but in all cases, phone numbers will automatically be exchanged between the person initiating the trigger (in this case - your mum, or her rescuer) and the emergency contact persons (in this case - you) so that a call can be initiated by either party. In all cases, you will also receive emergency text notification via various channels like email / app push message / FB messenger to ensure you SEE the emergency alert because incoming voice calls alone can too easily be missed or unanswered during our regular busy lives – whereas emergency text messages are very “in your face”. Once you open the alert you can also see the pinned location point of where the alert was triggered. All the above is free forever for a single user (one account, one user). 
We have a premium upgrade option that enables the account holder (for example you) to add an administer up to four additional “dependent” members via your account (for example mum, grandpa, and two young kids) who are not tech-savvy enough or too young to administer their own accounts. And you are able to upload and securely store a very comprehensive “Rescue wallet” for every member that includes insurance details, medical history, living wills, organ donor status, and other emergency records. For security and privacy, the Rescue Wallet is only ever shared with the member’s nominated emergency contact person(s), and only when an alert has been triggered. It is up to the emergency contact person to then use their discretion and to when to on-share the Rescue wallet and with whom. The premium upgrade is only USD 15 per YEAR – and right now we’re in the midst of a 3-month #TWOL campaign where we’re giving away 100% of our revenue to several amazing organisations around the world that leverage the funds to sustain starving daily wage workers. Wishing your mum well... feel free to pm me if you have any questions.
comment 4: Thanks— this sounds like a great product but not what I’m looking for. I need something independent of a phone or watch as she doesn’t always walk around with her phone and an Apple Watch is too complex for her. Just looking for a simple, good looking device with a button or speech recognition for calling 911/ a series of emergency contacts.

"Feel like I'm losing it. Alright this is a bit of a doozy, I'm going to preface this by saying I have crippling social anxiety, I can't handle confrontation- At all-, and I'm a shrinking violet when things get bad i just fold into myself and take it. 
So this a first for me but I'm desperate to get this off my chest or at least vent a bit. When I turned 18, my mothers sisters daughter (think my cousin?) moved into our home after a bad breakup (it involved her having a husband and a fiancee at the same time, wonderful drama that) she took my room and. I ended up moving in with my grandparents to take care of them as they were no longer able to drive/do things themselves. (my grandfather had just gotten his license revoked for driving 15 on a 45 street) It was originally mutually beneficial I took care of what needed to be done around the house and for them and I had a rent free home. Year 1 was great, I was going to college and feeling good about where I was in life.  
After the first year or so however things changed. My grandfather was a very demanding and old fashioned man, he was the Man of the house and anything he said was law, that was fine. However he decided that both me and my grandmother (his wife of 60+ yrs) didn't need to know he was dying of cancer. All the sudden doctors appointments went from two or so a week to almost every day most with long drives and waiting hours in waiting rooms, I've waited all my life however so it didn't bother me too much, I pulled back from being a full time student to a class at night. (honestly I didn't need to pull back so far but I was using all the extra work at home as a pleasant excuse to avoid school, more on this later).  
Year three to five were rough. I dropped out of college completely to be at home in case I was urgently needed (it happened frequently) My grandfather slowly lost the ability to eat or speak all the while he would tell us he was fine and forcefully move the conversation on, I honestly don't know how I didn't fully pick up on it (I had suspicions but would never have guessed it was as bad as it was.) He lost most of his balance, and became unable to properly care for himself, so I started bathing him, cleaning up when he soiled himself and such. His skin was also paper thin and he would fall attempting things he knew he shouldn't leaving me to try to bandage what looked like someone took a cheese grater to his arm or w/e he fell onto and sloughed off a massive chunk. (this happened monthly with me eventually learning how to treat it myself without the ever fun trips to the ER). Anyway It was wild for a while until the cancer eventually took away his ability to eat and he had to go into hospice. (""The Family""tm decided my mom would stop by to help out when possible which I'm eternally grateful for) I just wasn't in me to watch my grandfather pass so, I hid myself up in my room and only came out rarely however I did speak to him before he passed and got everything off my chest in the end making a silent vow to take care of my grandmother fully until the end. And so 3-4 days after he initially couldn't swallow he passed on.   
Now is where things start to get bad. my grandmother I guess the best way to put it is ""knows her place"". (when referencing the old timely women take care of the house and kids and NOTHING else.) so once my grandfather died I had to deal with a woman lost in the world who now got to make her own choices it's sad but she only really started living once he passed and she was in her late 80s. So dealing with the grief and trying to take care of her was a bundle of joy (for the first two to three months she would just sit watching the recording of the funeral and cry, all day. Probably not the healthiest thing ever but I wasn't sure what to really do so I just let it be.) Anyway, I'm now taking care of a grief laden widow of 65\~years who would have panic attacks if I left the house for too long.   
As more time passes she becomes more and more controlling. She gave all financial responsibility to my uncle and wouldn't let me really help with paying bills or anything like that for her.  I'm not allowed to leave the house, If i visit family or go anywhere I have to call and check in with her, I have a 9pm curfew(established after I spent too much time talking to my brother and lost track of time coming home to a sobbing and hysterical grandmother), she follows a step or so behind me in the kitchen when I try to make her food, she constantly CONSTANTLY tells me shes alone she has no one while I'm standing next to her, (because of where I live i use baby monitors around the house so if anything goes wrong I'll hear if she calls for me) she tried calling me once, but due to my mothers earlier visit (she accidently changed the com channel) I couldn't hear so she called the police. (That was a fun one, open up the door and EMT+firemen standing there asking if I needed help) Came downstairs to hysterics again. anyway it goes and goes and goes.   
So here I am now almost a decade later (9ys) I go to bed, have a nice horrifying night terror that transitions into what I can only vaguely express as waking from a fugue state, all the sudden everything that didn't bother me came rocketing back to me. It was like something grabbing hold of my chest and just wouldn't let go, each time I tried to calm myself a new horrifying revelation would strike. Something snapped and I sat in bed crying for the next 15 hours until I forced myself to get up and at least cry in the tub so I did that for a while. All the while non stop back to back all I can think of is that I have nothing at all. I have no real education (I had to get an adult school diploma and then only got through about two years worth of college credits) I have no money, I'm not being paid to take care of my grandparents. I have absolutely insane social anxiety to the point where it's crippling and just the idea of trying to go out and apply to jobs / meet new people physically makes me ill. I lived an extremely sedentary lifestyle and gained almost 30 pounds due to doing nothing and stress eating while staying here.  I tell all this to my grandmother and she tells me that she also worried what I would do when she passes, however she ""wants me to understand I need to make my own money so she won't be paying me for taking care of her"" I brought up some of the programs to get state aid and possibly be paid through them however she flat out refused. (I'm also not going to be inheriting anything it all goes to my father and his brother for them to split 50/50)  
So I just agreed with her and then went to my moms house and just spent the entire day crying, now three days later and I just don't know what to do. I feel broken, I feel like what I do isn't enough, I'm not nearly good enough to do anything, I feel like my memory is failing me, that it's getting harder to remember things that should come easily. My anxiety would selfdestruct any chance of employment(interviewers dislike panic attacks), I have no idea how to be an adult, I can't leave the house to work, I can't leave the house without her going into a meltdown(before covid and especially after), I'm not intelligent enough to go for any of the STEM jobs that would let me work from home, I've turned into a fat wet noodle, I used to be fairly active and loved swimming now I can't even walk up two flights of stairs without going out of breath and sweating. I don't have any real work nor world experience, and it's unending.  
So after a day with my mother(Quarantine be damned I needed her so I went) I've now signed up for school again and am trying to get a degree (in what I have no idea because unfortunately I have no real interests but I'll probably sort it out through trial of elimination of what would I rather do less.) but it's adding to the crushing feeling of anxiety knowing I'm going to have to go back to school and be around more people and all the damned interaction that's required. compounding that is this new fun undercurrent SCREAMING into the back of my head to DO MORE NOW MORE NOW and it just hurts. I'm just so damned tired personally I don't see myself having lived a hard life. I've never been materialistic, I've always enjoyed just being alone somewhere so the isolation was pleasant for me, I've had everything I needed to survive I've never wanted for food and I don't believe I've ever truly struggled but I just feel so old and tired and worn down that it's hard to see a reason to keep going. 
So here I am just kind of putting some of it into writing. honestly any advice would be truly appreciated I'm just in such a bad place right now that my entire mind feels like an exposed nerve, errant thoughts twinge like biting foil and I can't seem to sleep well or calm down. 
There's honestly so much that it's daunting to write it all out and I'm giving the barest of overviews there's just so much that trying to write it down would be an exercise in futility. but i Need to do something to calm down and this was one of the only things that I thought of after reading a ton of how to be an adult stuff.  
I apologize if this reads like a shotgun blast of just stuff but I'm emotionally compromised exhausted and just so tired and burnt out that It's the best I'm currently capable of.","comment 1: Here’s my piece(s) of advice for what it’s worth. I was a School Counselor for 25 years, now take care of my disabled husband. 
Don’t look back. That’s not how time or life works. What happens to a lot of us is that we follow the path of least resistance and it’s not until we are in unbelievable emotional pain that we look around and say, “How did I get to this point?”
So, you have the characteristics of depression and Anxiety (Fear). So do I. One of those characteristics is thinking that you are trapped and have no control over anything in your life. Well, you do!
Find a therapist online. You need to talk to someone who will listen. Your GM is wrapped up in herself and honestly doesn’t “see” you. 
Like every other human with anxiety issues, you have used faulty logic. You do not need a college degree for a job anymore. One of my children has a Masters and no job- actually hates what he got degree in. Go to a community college and get a vocational certification. Dental hygiene, LPN, whatever. Contrary to popular belief, your job does not have to be your passion. It can just pay the bills so you can afford to do what you want outside of work. Bake, garden, hike, whatever!
Decide what you actually want to do- set goals. Pick one or two and WRITE DOWN the steps you will have to take to get there-Action Plan. Divide your goals into short term and long term. 
You do not have to be your GM’s live in caretaker! Slavery has been abolished! Please, please, please find a way to live your own life- whatever it may be. Your GM has had hers so far, obviously got married, had children, had her own house, etc. You are worthy! You are worthy of your own life! You are worth so much more than being an unpaid caregiver. 
Make the leap!
comment 2: Thank you for the advice, I do appreciate it. I'll give looking up online therapy a shot however I'm not too confident I'll find something workable. (I messed up last year and ended up losing my insurance + I have no income so can't really pay). Now onto the unpleasant part.   
I do need to be my grandmothers live in caretaker, there's so much I left out of the main post but she is fully blind in one eye and losing her sight and I'm expecting her to be fully blind in the next year or so, she was injured when she was younger and has two herniated discs + horrible arthur so she can't move her head and is in constant debilitating pain but refuses to take any kind of pain medication. (it took me over five years to convince her to swap from asprin to norco and even now she takes the lowest dose possible and cuts it in half) and of course she also has horrible anxiety. Anyway If I leave she'll worry herself to death and I don't think I would be able to handle that. Not to mention the guilt of going back on my word to my grandfather on his deathbed. It just isn't an option for me.
comment 3: If you won't move out or insist on being paid then insist on them hiring a caregiver for daytime so you can go to work and school and you can be the night shift for your grandma.
Also, instead of super big steps (like demanding pay for services or insistingthey hire a caregiver), start small like I did to take your life back... I started walking. Just a little at first, then more. When I reached 5 miles a few times a week, I got a cheap bike. I found I love riding. I started that 5 years ago after a long challenging spell with my husband. I am making huge strides in my personal journey to not keeping myself a caregiver-doormat. You can too. Start small. Just get up, right now and walk around the block. Then do it again tomorrow and the next day. When you feel ready, go for two blocks, then three. Taking that time will help you sort out your thoughts and the exercise will kick out those fabulous endorphins. You will start to see more clearly and more completely what you need and how to make it happen.
You've got this. (((hugs)))
comment 4: Well, you've got me crying again but I took your advice and went out for a 15 min or so walk there was the stress of having my grandmother home alone and all the horrible things she could be getting up to but it did help and it's something I'll strive to continue. As for the daytime caregiver, We initially had one come in but that ended after my grandfather died and my family decided that because I was only taking care of my grandmother now we no longer needed the help, they were also reluctant to have her spending so much money on help when free labor was here. it's not something that's pleasant to bring up and because of my fears and insecurities not something I would willingly bring up myself :/. It's fairly disturbing how much I'm praised as self sacrificing, how it's such a great thing I'm doing, how few people could actually do what I do when in truth I'm just resigned.   
anyway enough maudlin I really do appreciate all the help from you and everyone else here. The pure feeling of relief that I've gotten today from all of you, of learning that I'm not alone that there are and will be more in the same place as me even if we're different our core responsibility is the same it's made me feel like I might be able to get through this. It hasn't gotten better, it isn't going to get better and it's going to get a whole lot worse but at least I'm not alone, and I never really knew how much that meant until I was directed here. So really thank you all from the center of my being and I'm getting emotional again so I need to stop rambling but yea.
comment 5: Why are you the only one who can take care of your grandmother?  She has other family members.  She is also eligible for paid aides to come in, through her insurance or Medicare or Medicaid.  It may not be what she wants, but she doesn’t get full control of this situation, or of you.  So don’t cave and let things be, you need to fight to get some freedom and some air - so you can breathe and start the kind of life you want to live.  Stand up and insist changes be made.  Start by talking to your Mom about it all. Best of luck.
comment 6: There are a slew of reasons why I got the job and why we don't have paid aides mostly family pressure and expectations that I can't really argue against. Generally if I do bring it up I'm told I don't have to pay rent so it's not in her benefit it's in mine. (my grandmother is good at turning things around on me like this to make my problems actually her problems) she also gas lights me to relatives where she tells them all I do nothing at all when I'm not around to defend myself so they turn against me. My mom knows though and has been my support through it all but I'm fairly sure my uncle hates me even though my mom tells him so I've taken to avoiding him when he visits which exasperates the problem.   
I don't fight, I'm all fought out, I just take it, and wilt, and crumble, and break down. It's happened before but never to this extent. I just woke up and everything was different and it will never be the same and it will never be ok again and it's terrifying. but I have a little light in the dark now so I can at least pretend to be alright even if I feel like I'm dying on the inside and maybe I might make it to the light and find out it isn't a cliff.   
I do appreciate the advice and am truly thankful for it.
comment 7: Also, you have job-related skills but don't realize it.  You're a faithful caregiver and demonstrate excellent writing skills.  I go to these reality recap websites where someone blogs/recaps a reality show and people subsequently comment on it.  Sometimes they look for new writers.  Maybe you could find a little side-hustle like that?...not a full time job but something that will boost your confidence.  Also, volunteering somewhere can help boost your confidence and isn't too stressful.  It's something that could build-up your resume also.
comment 8: Seems like both you and your gramma need to be treated for anxiety/depression.  It's crippling and has paralyzed you into thinking you can't get out of a hopeless situation.  Can you scrape up enough money for a doctor's appt?  I know it's expensive but the doctor could prescribe you an effective, generic anti-depressant.  There's so many helpful anti-Ds now that have lost their patents and so are cheap now.  You'll need to explain to the doctor your insurance/financial situation so they prescribe something generic and affordable.  A good anti-depressant and appropriate dose can help both your depression and anxiety.  I've taken Effexor for 20 yrs and it has really helped me manage my generalized anxiety, more so than depression even.  Once you get in a good place with your mental health, you can be in a better place to manage your gramma and her mental health and unreasonable demands. Make that doctor appointment!
comment 9: It's something to think about for sure, I'll try to see what I can do about getting to a doctor. Out of curiosity is it something a therapist would be able to prescribe? At the moment I might have to decide between going to a therapist or a doc at least until Jan.
comment 10: most therapist can't prescribe meds unless they're a therapist/medical doctor.  you'd probably really benefit from therapy and they can assess whether you need to see a doctor for meds.  good luck!
comment 11: Hey, i’m really moved by your predicament and i commend your efforts in doing the best you can. Caring for someone is inarticulably exhausting, yet its not always visible and easily acknowledged  (like your relatives).
Unfortunately other stuff is out of my depths but if i had one advice, it would be to leave yourself a nugget of time everyday or even every week. Im also very conflict averse, and thus have trouble setting personal space, but in your case it seems to have made you a sponge soaking up other people’s problems  without having time to take care of yourself. This ‘self-time’ can be as simple as taking a walk everyday. Communicate with your grandma and slowly allocate some time of the day for yourself. I think walks can help build up some social confodence over time (e.g can progressively build towards greet stramgers with a nod or simple hello )
i hope my outsiders take isnt too arrogant but You need to help set some borders and boundaries for your grandma. Its what she needs in life - shes swimming with no direction after the passing of your grandpa. This is is in a way also what you need to do for yourself, so its both you and your grandma working together rather than just you tolling away. Your life is VALUABLE. Dont give up on pursueijg your own worthwhileness
Sorry its late and ive been rambling a bit. If you have any questions pls do reply. I think your quite articulate : )

"Controlling TV Remotely? Hello All,
Has anyone had experience with getting a TV set up so that it can be controlled entirely remotely? I'm interested in getting this done for my Grandma who can no longer figure out how to operate hers by herself (we have a remote with large buttons, she's constantly dropping it where she can't reach, trying to operate it backwards, pointing it at the ceiling, etc...).
She doesn't have WiFi currently as she's never needed it, but I'd have it set up if it could solve this problem. I would get a WiFi hotspot as a temporary solution, but I'm assuming the streaming services would eat up the data allowance on those pretty quickly. That said, I've never used one so maybe it's an option.
I feel like there has to be a way if I got her internet access and a Roku or Amazon Fire to turn her TV into a ""smart"" one, but I don't know if that would allow me to actually see the TV to know what I'm doing? 
Also, only vaguely related, does anyone have a Portal type device set up so that they can easily video chat with their parent/loved one without them having to do anything to answer? Basically I can just connect on my end and we can see each other? I'm looking into ViewClix, which seems to be the only option. Seems incredibly overpriced but other than that, exactly what I need.
Any advice would be welcomed!!","comment 1: I saw a comment a while ago about how to use the Alexa Drop In feature for parents in nursing homes that I thought was super helpful: https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fv3one/mom_locked_down_in_nursing_home_gift_ideas/fmgpg7n/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
comment 2: If you have Comcast, you can download a remote app on your phone to change channels
comment 3: I bought the Flipper remote for my moms TVs.  $40 each
One in her family room operates the TV w/ cable. Her bedroom TV is on an antenna. They are both older TVs so I had to try remote codes till I found ones that worked. 
https://flipperremote.com
It’s a 5 button remote (power, channel up, channel down, volume up, volume down). There is a panel you can open (not easily, so mom doesn’t try - in fact she doesn’t realize it’s there) and you can set it up, program which channels to cycle thru, program what devices to turn on/off, etc.
I also put in Internet at $60 a month, 50 Mbps download, 3Mbps upload and installed 2 Amazon Shows so we can drop in. She loves them. I turned off all the options I could on the Show and in standby mode it runs thru photo albums.  Also put in a Nest Hello video doorbell I can answer on my phone and 4 Nest indoor cameras so I can check she is OK.  
She knows about all the cameras & I’ve showed them to her and the video I can see on my phone. None point into bathrooms but do point down hallways, etc. All the cameras have helped my anxiety over her being OK. It’s also nice to see if she is awake before I drive over. In fact, I find I’m spending more time there now.
Anyway, we have all this technology available so why not use it. I know the situation is fluid and will be changing but I’m more comfortable with her aging in place right now & willing to put off moving her in with me.
Good luck finding a solution to your current TV issue!

"Medication reminder for the elderly? My grandmother is 93 but still lives on her own at home. She is in very good shape, but she has been forgetting her medications lately. Were trying to think of solutions to keep her independence as long as possible as she is not ready to move in with a family member quite yet. She is still physically and mentally capable of caring for herself, with frequent checking in, but skipping medication is a huge concern. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for alarms or other devices that alert when it is time to take medications? I have been looking on Amazon and there seems to be mixed reviews for alot of the devices. Thanks!","comment 1: > She is in very good shape, but she has been forgetting her medications lately. 
Not  uncommon.  If she is Smart Phone literate, there are apps called ""pill reminders"".  I use one call My Therapy.  You basically set it and forget it.
comment 2: We use an Echo device to set medication reminders.  (My sister and I live with my Mom and are her caregivers, but there's always so much to do that if we didn't set medication reminders we'd be lost.)
If you set the volume loud enough I think your grandmother would hear it.
We swear by them. I have multiple reminders set; when to give her various medications, when to give her various drinks (we need to monitor fluid intake), when to do her chair exercises, etc. etc. etc.
comment 3: That's a great idea! I have several extra echos so this is perfect. Im surprised I didn't think of that. Thanks!
comment 4: You're very welcome!
We've been through so much trial and error with my Mom (not just with this) that it feels like we could write a manual sometimes on what works and what doesn't.  Believe me, we go through scores of things that don't work until we're lucky enough to find something that does.  😊

"Advice re parent getting lost. Thank you for taking the time to read this. My mother has Alzheimer’s and lives alone in an apartment. She’s been managing okay (with me doing everything for her). Her life is pretty limited. She walks to a nearby supermarket, restaurant and GP all of which are within 50m north place. Last night I took her to the local gelato place — 50m south of her place. She was completely at a loss to where we were or the direction home. This is a big shift and concerning. 
Does anyone have any advice on managing getting lost? She’s not ‘wandering as such—ie randomly walking off—but seems inevitable she’ll get lost soon. All the tracking devices I’ve come across seem to have terrible reviews and also short battery lives. I can’t see her everyday to recharge a tracker and she won’t remember to do so.
Would love any advice. Thanks in advance. 🙏🏻","comment 1: I bought something called iTrack on Amazon. It's a little tracker that can be clipped to a belt or attached to a lanyard around the neck. The device itself is inexpensive but you pay for a subscription, it can track worldwide (which I'll need in a couple months so it's worth it to me). The battery is pretty good, depends on how often you have it ""ping"" to report where it is. 
It's got a way to set a perimeter around your home and it'll send an alarm when it goes through it. 
Aside from that, I guess what you can do is make sure your mom carries with her some sort of ID with her address in case she gets lost and asks for help. They make bracelets you can order that you can customize with her name, address, medical info, etc.
comment 2: Will check it out. Thanks!
comment 3: Check with your local law enforcement. There’s something called Project Lifesaver in my area that provides a tracking bracelet or anklet. If your loved one elopes, you contact them and they use their device’s radio frequency to track them down.
comment 4: Yes good idea. Will do.
comment 5: In conjunction with the devices the others have suggested would some kind of daily/ every other day in home support be an option for you? With that, part of their regular duties could be ensuring that the device is charged and on her person when they leave. 
I would also suggest some sort of door alarm so that, at the very least, you could be notified when she leaves. There are also locks that can be operated remotely so that way she has to notify you of her intentions when leaving. I can understand if that would feel uncomfortable, but her safety is paramount. 
Lastly, even in the absence of a special program, you can contact her local police station, make them aware of the situation and provide them with her information, possibly including taking her for a livescan for ID purposes, so that if they find her without ID lost, they can identify her easily, return her home and notify you. 
Best of luck to you and your mother. I understand what you are going through and for what it’s worth you have my sympathies.
comment 6: The charging is the problem with all of these. Battery capacity is linked to size. Anything that would last a week would be the size of a brick. Unobtrusive ones that could fit on a keychain do need to be charged every 1-2 days. 
(It does depend on the refresh/ping rate, but we’ve had two trackers, and even at the slowest setting, on a 2G network, we couldn’t make them last longer than that.) 
If you can see her every other day it could work. 
We’re using Tracki right now and it’s decent. Costs 20 or so a month (you need to subscribe to get wifi access to do the tracking).
comment 7: The other issue for me with these was getting my mom to wear it, and charge it.  My dad couldn’t keep up with it either even though he was just aging and didn’t have dementia
He basically went everywhere with her.  One time i remember she got lost and called, we found her , but it scared dad and I.  Hope you find an answer.
comment 8: Thanks everyone for the great ideas. Lots to think about. Much appreciated!
comment 9: If people around the neighborhood know her you could talk to them explaining the situation and asking then to keep an eye on where she goes.
With my mother-in-law we attached address tags to her outdoor clothes while she was still living alone. That helped a couple of times and total strangers helped her get home.
comment 10: Thanks :) I’ve done this—although she keeps removing them lol But I put them back and she’s starting to not notice them.
comment 11: Same here. We've put up notices around the home with directions to things like the toilet, and she kept ripping them off. We kept putting them up and eventually she stopped ripping them off, and now only rarely asks about the whereabouts of things. Persistence and patience seem to do the trick.

"Is there any smart wristband out there in the market? I am looking for a smart wrist band with good battery life that comes with vital tracking, fall detection and SOS alert for my grandparents. Any recommendations?","comment 1: I actually just got my mom an Apple Watch series 5 with GPS & cellular for this reason, after researching a lot of less pricey options.  She’s been falling more and doesn’t carry her phone around with her.  Once I strap the watch to her wrist she can make calls from anywhere, and if the watch detects a fall and you don’t press a button within a certain amount of time it notifies EMS and your emergency contacts.  I work 12 hour days an hour from home, so this is essential.  You can even shower with it.  Plus I got her a red band and case, her absolute favorite color, so she is happy to wear it.
The only vital it monitors is heart rate I think, but you can manually enter others on your phone to track.  If you are an Android user you can probably find a similar product from Samsung or something.
Also, LPT:  I am an ER nurse, and talked to some paramedic friends about how they gain access to a home if the occupant is unable to get the door,like if they fall and can’t get up and no one else is home.  Apparently, they normally call law enforcement to gain access.  However, and this is US/state of FL, but I would guess would work elsewhere, you can call non-emergency dispatch and leave instructions on where to find a key, so they can get inside faster and with less property damage.  (We ordered a cast iron hedgehog hide a key for the flower bed from Amazon.)
comment 2: Thank you alot, this is rly useful🙏🏻
comment 3: Good!  I’m so glad!  Also if you are an Apple user they are more than happy to chat online with you about the safety features, I talked to them for about 20 min to make sure if had everything I needed.  Good luck!
comment 4: This is the exact problem... my grandparents don’t own iPhone and there isn’t exactly a wearable out there yet that has the Apple Watch Safety Features
comment 5: I know that with LifeAlert devices, they can direct law enforcement/EMTs to lock boxes that are discreetly hidden on the property.   The house key is inside. You can give these services the combination to the lock box.
I had one patient who fell, broke her femur, couldn't get up or get to the door, called me and long story short, the fire department used a ladder to enter an upstairs balcony.

"Mom keeps losing her key My mom is in assisted living and her memory is deteriorating. Lately she keeps losing her room key. I attached the key to the strap on her purse, but she removed the key and wore it on her wrist (wrist coil with key ring). Staff has replaced the key twice already, and she lost it again today. The facility is secure so there is no problem with leaving her room unlocked, but I don't know how I can help her keep track of it. Any suggestions?","comment 1: Can you attach a Tile to it so it can be located with a phone?
Also, a lanyard that goes around her neck might be less likely to get mislaid.
comment 2: Hopefully the tile that sticks. The one on the keychain didn’t work for my dad because he kept removing it.
comment 3: Thank you for the suggestions!
My kids suggested a lanyard too. It's bigger than a wrist coil, and a really loud color like hot pink would be very conspicuous if she leaves it lying around.
I wasn't familiar with the Tile so I googled it. Unfortunately Mom does not have a smartphone so I don't think a Tile would work for her, but it looks like a really cool device!
comment 4: Is she friends with a neighbor, that she can keep the key there instead of carrying it with her?  Or in her bra if she is able to um ... still carry things that way?
comment 5: Thank you! She has very nice neighbors, but the residents are elderly and many have memory issues themselves. I hadn't thought of carrying it in her bra...
comment 6: Maybe she can pin it there or a little clip.
comment 7: I had the key on a ring attached to the strap of her purse, but she took it off and started wearing it on her wrist. She takes it off her wrist to sleep, and then it ""disappears"". So, I could see the same thing happening if she pins it to her bra or anywhere else. She also tends to put things away for ""safekeeping"" and then forgets where she put them.
comment 8: Have you asked the employees?  I bet they’ve had this happen a lot.  They may have a solution.
comment 9: Will do. Thanks.
comment 10: Would it work to leave her room unlocked? It might remove a frustration for her.
comment 11: Thank you! That would be the simplest solution, but I think Mom just wants to have a key because she thinks she lives in a hotel and ""I'm paying for my hotel room so the hotel should give me a room key."" Sometimes she says ""the hotel never gave me a key when I moved in."" 
All the rooms open to interior hallways and the facility is secure, so it's very safe.  She seems to be without a key most of the time now, so the room is unlocked anyway.
comment 12: Is the place safe enough to keep it under a welcome mat, or on the back of her front door decoration? Are the staff okay with that?
comment 13: Thank you! Yes, the place is very safe. All the rooms open to interior hallways and the facility is secure - there are always staff members 24/7. If I don't get her a big lanyard to wear around her neck, another possibility might be to hang it on the back of her door. The doors have dead bolts only, so she can't lock herself out. I will check with staff - they have probably dealt with this before.
comment 14: My apartment has deadbolts, that helps me, too.
comment 15: Just wanted to say this is normal.  Mom always worries she'll lose stuff, so she'll put it somewhere she can't forget, then forgets.  So instead of wearing her room key on her wristband, she puts it her pocket, then puts it in a drawer.  Then forgets which drawer.  Being on lockdown means she doesn't go out often, but it's still an issue.  
I like the idea others have had about a lanyard, but Mom would rebel at that because it looks ""tacky.""  She hasn't outgrown  vanity.
comment 16: Thank you for sharing! Sigh...yes, this is exactly Mom's situation too. Last week her purse went missing. It's a huge bag - think Mary Poppins! A caregiver eventually found it in Mom's closet, zipped inside a suitcase. Mom does not remember putting the purse inside the suitcase in her closet. She is convinced that ""a burglar broke in"" and hid her purse, but I'm not surprised it was there. She probably hid it for ""safekeeping"" and forgot. 
I had to laugh when you said your Mom hasn't outgrown vanity. Do you get her a replacement key every time, or does she just leave the door unlocked?
comment 17: LOL to the hidden purse!  Mom does this too with anything she deems important - from throat lozenges to her wallet.  And of course she doesn't do it, nameless other people break in and hide her stuff.  In the bottom of her closet, in an old handbag, zipped and wrapped in a blanket.
We've always found the keys before they had to be replaced, thank goodness.   I also made up a key ring with her name, phone number, and room number on it in case it gets left in the dining room or something.  Not the best security, but I thought it would help her find her room if she forgot the number or help somebody find her way home if she wandered off.

"I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment. TL;DR - I'm putting it here at the top because it's silly to make you scroll through screens of text for it.
I need help preparing. I've finally got dad to agree to see a neurologist. I've got one shot to keep this ball rolling to get a diagnosis and get some help. What do I tell the doctor? What will be super important for him to know? What will be kind of helpful? What's not helpful at all?
Dad can come off as a normal, sweet but quirky old guy. But there's a lot going on at home.
I'm trying my hardest to keep him independent and healthy but I've got to get at least a home healthy aid in there to keep him on track. 
Now The Long Part
About 16 years ago, I noticed the first change in my father. He started telling folks he was raised in a rural town on the outskirts of our metro area where his grandparents lived. He was actually raised in the worst neighborhood in the inner-city area of our metro. He started speaking with a southern drawl for a while. He would pronounce dinosaur as di-nuh-SOUR and try to teach that to my toddler son. From that point until now I've noticed a marked decline in language skills. He forgets nouns and objects are described by their function.
About ten years ago, when my mom/his wife was sick she had a commode at the house. He referred to it as her ""potty chair"". Several of us attempted to correct him by over-pronouncing commode to him hoping he'd get the hint. She passed after being ill for four months. During the funeral planning, he told the funeral directory he wanted a second autopsy done because my mom was in perfect health when she went into the hospital and he didn't agree with the first autopsy's findings. In the next few minutes, the funeral home is calling medical examiners from across the state. He's puzzled. I asked everyone to step out for a few moments. He doesn't realize that his words indicated he believed by mother was killed by the hospital and he's threatening legal action. For the record, my mother was obese, probably morbidly; had what she thought was the flu for nearly a week and hadn't drunk any fluids for 3 days. At that point she was transported to the ER, her heart beat irregular, dehydrated and found to have a bowel obstruction and required emergency surgery. She's lucky she made it to the ER let alone survive the surgery.
The hoarding started shortly after mom passed away. Three bedroom house with narrow walk ways cutting through all the stuff. 
It was about this time the humming started. He would hum while watching TV, sitting at the dinner table, wherever. He once hummed very loudly at my daughter's dance recital. I told him to stop and he denied he was doing it. People three, four, five rows ahead of us were turning around and glaring at him.
He fell in with a window washer who is a Sovereign Citizen. This character is a part of the Republic for the united States. The believe the current US government is a corporation and they are the true and faithful government. For several years, dad would have a Tuesday night conference call with all the other self-appointed representatives and senators and discuss how they would take control of the federal government's assets once society collapsed. This window washer acted as an agent to purchase US$300 worth of Iraqi dinar. This dinar would be worth US$300 million when the dinar were turned in during a special redemption time frame. Of course, the dinar were turned in but no US currency was returned.
One fall I mentioned I had prepped my portable kerosene heater for winter in the event of a power outage. During a call a few days later, he mentioned he brought his heater inside to prepare it for winter. He started it in the family room and had flames shooting up to the ceiling. At that point, I realized I had to watch everything I said and start thinking ahead of him.
Five or six years ago, he started dealing with incontinence. He fashioned cloth diapers for himself using material my mom used in crafts and sewing projects. He'd fold these in 42 layers of cloth. He was very proud of this number for some reason. It looked like a football stuffed in the front of his pants. It took me three years to get him to switch to Depends. Then he switched to cloth baby diapers when he found those in the back of a closet at home. He used those until a year ago when his personal physician came to his apartment and forced him to toss those out. He'd been drying them in the bathroom without washing them. The smell was overwhelming and management at his retirement center approached me. He started using Depends again and drying out partially used Depends on the bathroom floor. The overwhelming smell was back immediately and again generated a phone call from management.
Three years ago, he placed a corn bag in the microwave to warm it. They are common in my area and are used to warm a bed during cold winter nights or as a heating pad for pain relief. One night he got it hot enough to start a fire. He burnt a hole through the fleece sweater he was wearing and a hole through the blanket he'd covered himself with. He suffered a second degree burn on his left pectoral region.
About two years ago, he suffered a TIA in the early morning hours. My younger brother who lived with him at the time found dad's glasses in a dinner plate sized spot of blood on the floor, found my dad bleeding from his lip, tried to had dad his glasses 3 times, set them on the bathroom counter and left to get breakfast. At 2PM that day my family and I arrived to find him with dried blood on his face and took him to the ER because his behavior was very odd. MRI and other tests performed. Doctors said he'd had a TIA. Because he wasn't safe at home anymore I put my foot down and moved him to the town I now live in.
Since arriving here, he's started hoarding clothes from the senior center clothing giveaway. He started collecting stuffed animals there as well and giving them to his special friend June. June's family requested this end because they were concerned about mites, lice and other bugs on the donations. Management at his retirement center asked me to speak with him. He stopped giving her stuffed animals and instead gave her dresses and sweaters. June's family collected two 30 gallon garbage bags full of sweaters and dresses and gave them to management. This time the manager and I sat down with dad and he agreed to stop. Immediately following that meeting he told me, ""Now I'm not saying you and your wife HAVE TO do this but the clothing giveaway has a lot of bras and panties and mens' underwear you could get for free."" I cannot think of anything more repulsive than wearing someone else's used underwear.
He frequently asks me what I know about a letter he received in the mail. I ask what the letter was about, who it was from, etc. I get unspecific details such as from that one place or that group or I think it was those people I talked to the other day. When he receives an explanation of benefits from the insurance company, he'll ask why he's getting a bill. When I explain it's not a bill, he argues with me.
If you've read this far, thank you. Thank you...","comment 1: This post has 3 tests. Fill them out, and take them with you. It will give the doctor a ballpark of where your dad is at.

comment 2: Thanks for posting this !
comment 3: Neuropsych intern here. He likely will be referred to a neuropsychologist for an assessment. It’s hard to say if he will be cooperative in the testing based on what you’ve said, but I hope he is. Neuropsych assessments are able to provide nuance that brain scans can’t always and help determine exactly what might be going on. Hope all goes well!
comment 4: Oh my word. My heart goes out to you because the lack of insight into their situation is so difficult to manage & it really can feel like, in terms of mitigation, you ""solve"" one problem, only to uncover 50 more. First off, I'm so glad that your Dad has family that clearly love him, care for him & want him to have a safe, happy quality of life. The tests that will be done, neurologically, SHOULD reveal enough to the physician, but I would also make a list with approximate dates with the type of things you've mentioned here, & give that to the Dr. (out of view if this will upset Dad) to give them a much more well rounded history of what's been going on & for how long. You could also call in advance & ask to speak to the Neurologist yourself, to give them a heads up. Not sure what the POA situation is with your Dad, but in my personal experience, it doesn't get better than it is currently, so if he's struggling with knowing if a bill is indeed a bill, it's time to look at ways protect him, & his finances, so that you know that his needs will be met, safely & it removes the responsibility & worry from him. I know this is scary & overwhelming but you're not alone. Be as calm as you can, as descriptive as you can & as persistent as you need to be to get the requisite people to pay attention & to help your Dad get the assistance with care that he 100% needs. A diagnosis opens doors. Thinking about you both. Please let us know how it goes. Xo
comment 5: Maybe show the neurologist what you have summarized here as well. It paints a pretty succinct picture of where he is at cognitively. Good luck-dealing with our aging parents can be a real struggle.
comment 6: Mail this description ahead of time. You could even suggest a separate phone consult where you can explain all the things he got wrong during the tests, regarding personal history.
The rest will come out in the tests. They are impossible to cheat, as you can't fake cognitive abilities. If they aren't there anymore, they aren't there to skew results.
comment 7: Too lazy to read it all, but it will come out in the testing. He will be assessed by a separate neuropsychologist, then you’ll go back to the neurologist. At least that’s what happened with my mom. I worried they wouldn’t see it or she would cheat the tests, but thru came back with clear results. Good luck!

"Potential early dementia - please share experience. My husband is nearing retirement age, so younger than the average person with a diagnosis of dementia. I have some experience in this area, which is why I'm concerned.
First signs were years ago, related to a statin. Cognitive decline was very rapid. He stopped taking it, but never fully regained function. Fast forward several years to a heart attack. Now on a very aggressive cholesterol lowering medicine. I cannot tie his current status specifically to that. At this point, it's a long and fairly slow decline. Recently I ran across a photo from about 20 years ago and emotionally was slammed with the realization that the guy in it bears no resemblance to who he is now. I guess the daily slog sort of masked the magnitude.
He has difficulty word-finding. He will stand in another room and yell ""what is this?"" and if I don't know (because I'm off in another room) he'll get furious and demand to know why I don't come look. Or he'll say, ""you know, when you're that person who is doing that thing, but like, famous"" and if I can't mind-read, he'll slam his fists and accuse me of ""gaslighting"" because ""obviously"" I know. In particular, he seems to be losing nouns. 
He is also falling victim to inertia - has trouble initiating activity. For example, he'll say that he ""always"" does the dishes. He's at home during the quarantine, and occasionally does them, but the spatial understanding of the device seems lost to him. I'll find dishes & glasses shoved together so tightly that it's a miracle nothing shattered. Or, he'll empty it half way, then start adding dirty dishes in with clean. Or run it half full. I never know what I'll find.
Also, and this one really troubles me, he ""remembers"" things that I did, but thinks he did them. It's making me constantly check & question myself. Or he'll meld different memories as if they were simultaneous, even though the actual events were years apart. 
He has some paranoia. Any conversation I have with our adult children, he assumes we are talking about him in a gossipy way. If there's any word play (puns, references to memes, movie quotes) he thinks they are directed at him. He gets mad and accusatory - so that is the end of any fun conversation. 
He has had a medical doctor witness a major episode - one so wild we took him to the ER. He's had SO MANY scans & exams & blood tests. And everything comes back ""normal"" so I'm at a loss. Like, basically I have to just watch & cope because nobody is taking it seriously. 
Where can I turn for recognition & intervention? (In the US, by the way.) And if you've been through this, what timeline & prognosis & outcome have you experienced?","comment 1: I'm replying to myself - just so I have the details recorded. He has just recently started 2 new behaviors. First is assigning long-term meaning to a single incident. For example, I arrive home exhausted and he asks if we can grill out for dinner. I say that I'd rather not tonight. Then, day after day after day, he says ""I know you hate cooking on the grill"" or ""you're the only person I know who doesn't like steak on the grill"" - or to our adult child, ""your mom hates the grill, so maybe the next time you're here, you'd cook for me?"" WTF?
And - being unwashed. He's always been meticulous about hygiene. Now he can be obviously filthy and not care. But beyond that, he's often outright defiant - like refusing to bathe.
comment 2: Oh, I feel for you. I am in a similar situation, except I'm his adult daughter (25). For the diagnosis, I felt something was wrong about six years ago. Everyone I talked to about it would shrug it off, saying that he's always been forgetful. It took losing his job and NUMEROUS talks to get him to the doctor. Even then, I had numerous doctors brush me off without a proper diagnosis. First his primary physician and then, a strongly recommended neurologist. The second neurologist brought him in for a PET scan (insurance agencies want every single test done before this, because it's pricey) and we finally received the diagnosis the week that our state went into shut down. If there's anything this journey has taught me, it's to trust your gut. You know him more than any doctor who spends 1 hour doing a simple memory test does. Find a doctor who listens and respects you. It will make all of the difference. 
&#x200B;
If you're curious about my journey:

Call and ask primary care physician to do memory test during physical, don't receive feedback, says he's fine
Six months later, receive concerned call from employment saying they cannot have him on a job site any longer
Call primary physician again, do exact test but demand referral
Get blood test immediately
Get MRI test
After waiting three months, finally get in to see a psychiatrist and wait for a 6 hour intense memory training
After waiting two more months, receive feedback and spend 40 minutes talking to psychiatrist
Get referred to Neurologist, wait at least two months for appointment
Meanwhile, get recommended another Neurologist, get in within 1 month
Spend 40 minutes doing very similar memory test primary physician did, get told it's nothing but a fluke and get recommended sleep study
Go to sleep study, do take home sleep study, find out there's some minor sleeping problems
Wait a month, do an overnight sleep test. He can't sleep with the equipment on. That entire ordeal is a wash and I choose not to go forward, knowing he won't wear a sleep mask.
Finally get an appointment with the original neurologist, get assigned another MRI, another blood test and never-done-before PET scan
Do all three, takes about two months to fit in
Return for proper diagnosis, turns out the PET scan wasn't sent to neurologist, entire appointment unnecessary since neurologist can't make a diagnosis.
Drive home, find out on drive home what the diagnosis was and cry in the car for 20 minutes.

I didn't even mention issues regarding accounting, law, employment and general every day life things. It's a very challenging job, although with you being his wife, you don't have to jump through as many hoops as I have had to in order to even begin aiding with his medical journey. I chose to share this info with you because I desperately needed an outline of what to expect. I strongly recommend you find a support group near you. If not, groups on Facebook and Reddit have been extremely helpful answering questions, sharing information and giving me a place to connect and not feel alone. The neurologist sent me this book that was helpful understanding the best way to communicate with some with alzheimers: Learning to Speak Alzheimer's: A Groundbreaking Approach for Everyone Dealing with the Disease
&#x200B;
Good luck with you journey, and again, don't let anyone doubt yourself! Once you have a diagnosis and learn to communicate with someone with alzheimers, things will ease up. They're difficult, but you will treat him with the same leniency you would give a child. You'll feel more forgiving.
comment 3: And to clarify timing, I noticed things in 2014. The journey for the diagnosis took from July 2019 to March 2020.
comment 4: Thank you so very much. Honestly, based on real-world experience, it would actually be easier if he were in the ""pleasantly confused"" stage of AD. What I suspect is vascular dementia. 
In working with people with dementia, the AD patients were often odd but very manageable as long as everyone was gentle & soothing. The vascular dementia patients were totally unpredictable.
comment 5: There are also language components of FTD (frontotemporal dementia) as well as some of the other situations you’ve described. You may want to do a bit of reading about that to see if fits the behaviors you are seeing.
comment 6: Thanks. I do indeed see some similarities. Helpful clues.
comment 7: This should be a magazine or newspaper article. People read about some promising new treatment for dementia and it probably seems like some progress is being made. The reality is quite different as far as effective diagnosis and treatment. Other people I've spoken with have had the experience of being told that it's ""probably normal changes associated with aging"" until they reach the point they cant draw a clock face on the mini mental exam or name 3 animals that start with the letter F. Then its apparently too late. I've never understood  when exactly is the window of opportunity where treatment is beneficial?
Can you imagine if this was the current state of cardiac medicine?
comment 8: Have you seen a neurologist?
comment 9: He refuses. Because: Nobody does anything for me. They just want my money. You're gaslighting me. I'm not crazy. You people are just trying to make me think I am.
Edited to add: Sorry. Moment of frustration on my part. He was hospitalized for several days in a neurology unit. Discharged. No diagnosis. Which is even worse than anyone can imagine. 
At this point, I'm nearly depleted emotionally. The things he does are so bizarre, so being told ""everything is normal"" when clearly it is NOT is just devastating.

You have the option of connecting it to your smartphone so you can track how many times he forgets to turn off the stove. I don't think having wifi is mandatory.

You could crack an egg on the surface while its on and it wouldn't cook but if you put a pan on it and crack it inside it would cook fine. Very hard to catch things on fire with it. Definitely worth a google. Also has the benefit of things like timers and being able to dial in the exact temperature.

"Hi. I work maintenance in a nursing home and I love and cherish all of your friends and family with dementia. Been in the healthcare industry for about two years. And in the last year, I have really come to treasure residents with dementia. They may not be who they were. They’re just who they are now. That’s all I personally know really. 
And flat out, some are downright consistently hilarious. Their delusions they carry on with while I repair a wheel chair or tv or whatever, are entertaining. I go along with it and am actually genuinely interested in their stories.

Using a Bluetooth auxiliary input device, and Spotify premium, I ask each and every resident what musical artist is their favorite. They all have an answer. All of them.  
Elvis. Stevie Ray Vaughn. Styx. The one which really stands out in my head is a German man in his 90’s. He said Mozart. When he heard the first few notes he bellowed out in laughter and clapped his hands.  During the 30 minute drive back, he moaned with pleasure and continued to laugh. 
We listened at max volume as well. He had asked me if it too loud for ME at one point as he was hard of hearing. Haha. No sir!!!
Just know, if you have family or friends with dementia in a nursing home, they may not be who YOU remember. There are those of out there right now who love and care for who they are RIGHT NOW!","comment 1: What a great person you are, to take time to pay attention to the residents!  So many are starving for attention.  And to know that music is the secret key!  Bravo man!!
comment 2: [deleted]
comment 3: you’re such a great guy. thank you, really.
comment 4: I loved your post. It is unusual, and it brings a whole new positive approach. 
I was so in need of sth like this. Thank you for making my day. 😄
comment 5: Good for you. Good hooman. Seriously.
comment 6: You are loved and appreciated, my friend!! Thank you!!
comment 7: Thank you for posting this! I work in LTC and I have seen strong bonds built between residents and various employees. I always appreciate our maintenance crew when they allow a resident to “help” them out. It’s beautiful. Thank you for what you do!
comment 8: I know I’m three days late but thank you for taking such pride in your work. I know it isn’t always easy, but I’m glad you can focus on the positive and make such a difference in the resident’s lives. A lot of us have had bad experiences with nursing home staff, I’m so glad there are people like you in the mix.

"Recommendations, new diagnosis. So one of my future in laws parents was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's  his wife is fine and in decent health but she us caring for him. They live in the middle of no where with no phone service, I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a tracking app for him that he might not notice? He is in denial and repeats himself every few minutes, so something really noticable, he might RIP off. 
I feel really bad about it because the closest relatives (us and we are 3 + hours away) is there anything that would work for them, they do have a land line but no internet service. 
Also what would be the best way to get needed information to his wife without upsetting her? I thought maybe sending her a reliable book? I am a CNA and have had lots of experince with dementia and alzhiemers patients but I am no doctor and the only doctors close to them said yep, its alzhiemers gave them a medicine to slow the progression and promptly brushed them off.... so I was able to correctly respond to most of her questions, but once again... I'm not a doctor and I know she is scared and wants to be informed. Suggestions please? Thanks in advance !","comment 1: Rural services can be few and far between, but still, the first stop would be an agency for aging.  There might be resources they can hook the wife up with.   How tight is money?  Can you tell us an approximate location?  (at least country)
comment 2: United states, money is tight older couple in thier late 80's I will have to look up an agency like that for sure. Not sure the exact money situation but I know they don't have a lot of it.
comment 3: Satellite internet would be useful and is available everywhere.  But that old a couple, I kind of doubt how quickly the wife could pick up Internet skills.  
They ideally should move into town for the sake of emergency services, but it can be very hard to convince old homesteaders to do that.  If the husband does wander, that is very much scarier in the country than in a city, especially in winter.
But I still recommend looking for an elder services agency for their area.  Start with Human Services or Alzheimer's associations for the state, and then drill down to the county and physical address.
comment 4: Thank you you've been very helpful! I've taken care of my grandmother that had cancer, and I've taken care of alzheimers patients at care facilities but taking care of a family member who has alzheimers is a little different I appreciate it :)
comment 5: Each county in each state has their own office, which is good. They will be familiar with the rural life.
comment 6: > They live in the middle of no where with no phone service,  
>
>they do have a land  line but no internet service.  
Which one is it?  It might be possible to get the house a router and him a fitbit-like watch to get health recordings and track him if he wanders.
comment 7: Sorry I should've been more clear, theres no cell phone service but theres a land line. And that's a wonderful Idea i never even thought of that.
comment 8: A router, a tablet pre-loaded with zoom or other conferencing sw, and then ""weekly/monthly dinner night"" where everyone gets food delivered and eats together would probably help everyone feel more connected?
comment 9: I like that too :) I dont mind to stay and help when I can, I was going to do weekly visits just to see how hes progressing too?  That would help a lot I think the wife is feeling pretty sad, scared and lonely right about now. Thanks!
comment 10: Usually caregivers feel pretty overwhelmed too.  Weekly ""afternoons off"" may be just the ticket.
comment 11: Regarding a book, The 36 Hour Day is like a Bible for dementia/Alzheimer's. It's about $5 on Amazon. I can't recommend it enough!
comment 12: Awesome! I was waiting for a good book recommendation ❤
comment 13: If they can swing it i strongly recommend a lockable perimeter fence. You can have alarms and tracking stuff, but in my experience if all you have are alarms but no meaningful barriers its possible primary caretaker will become jumpy and paranoid about every little thing that vaguely sounds like a maybe alert. This is how it was for my folks anyway.
comment 14: Thanks!
comment 15: I forgot to mention, if the gentleman ever served in the US armed forces in any capacity, and received any discharge other than dishonorable, he is entitled to a slew of services including lower-cost (or free) drugs and clinic visits.  In addition, the VA has a program to support the caregiver to take care of the veteran at home.  Their social worker contacts me by phone monthly just to check in with me, and that's very nice (and free).  They also provide free or low-cost respite care, which can be either at home (someone comes in) or at a facility (overnight or day treatment).  If he's a veteran, his wife should definitely look into this!
comment 16: He is veteran that's awesome, that's not even something I thought of! That would help out a lot! Thank you!

"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia. I feel like I'm in way over my head. So, as the title text says, my dad has suddenly had to move in with us, and I'm absolutely overwhelmed. 
The story is as such: A couple of weeks ago I got a call from the police. Apparently my dad, who lives alone 3 hours away since my step mom died, had called the police to complain about people having a sit in on the front lawn, and having broken into his house. The cops arrived, and my dad is talking to bushes and there's no one there. He's been bothering the neighbors about it too, who saw nothing. The police said they couldn't admit him to the ER, as his vitals were good, but he refused to go back into the house, and then drove to the local gas station and started having a fight with an invisible person in his car, and the police were called again, and so I drove up the 3 hours, and took him all the way back home with me, where after a good deal of sleep and some discussion about the possibility of hallucinations (he was an ER nurse and understands the concept very well), he calmed down and seemed to go back to himself, though I could notice a considerable disruption in his normal cognitive abilities. 
We took him to a psych facility the following day, and they told us they weren't going to admit him because he wasn't a danger to himself and he was getting belligerent about not being allowed to smoke, and with the virus they thought he'd be better off at home, and the symptoms were mostly gone by then anyway. So they set us up with an outpatient appointment the following week, and we set dad up in the guest bedroom. We've since had the outpatient appointment, and the psychiatrist basically said that he thought dad had a mini stroke, and it caused an onset of dementia, and he didn't think dad should live by himself anymore based on how he answered the questions. So now dad is moving in with me.
First off, dad seems able to take care of himself in many ways, like hygiene and self feeding, but has issues with more complicated aspects of living. He can't really work the TV (he could if it was just turn it on and change channels, but the whole smart TV thing and multiple remotes has him stumped constantly, even with a regular cable box and two remotes). He also has a hard time working the Keurig, with its 3 buttons, and can't manage his dumbed down little flip phone, accidentally deleting phone numbers, etc. This is a man who used to work regularly in Excel for a clinical trial management service, and the man who introduced me to the internet, set up a computer in our house when DOS was the OS, and had an Atari 2600 from release, so he wasn't a luddite, but now he can't use a computer to save his life. It's heartbreaking to see him futz with his seatbelt for 3 minutes, or with the AC knobs, or the TV remote we got him which only has about 6 buttons, BUT I used to work in mental health, and patient care isn't something I have a problem with.
My problem is this: How do I begin dealing with all of his stuff? He has a whole three bedroom two bath house filled with 40 years of stuff. He has two cars and a truck, a rental house, and two empty parcels of land, all 3 hours away from us. AND, I found out after going up there and going through all of his stuff, that he got depressed after my step mother died and hadn't dealt with any bills in almost a year, and his taxes and god knows what else were all kinds of screwed. The first thing I did was get all of his bills paid up, and I'm trying to deal with his finances, but I've found so much stuff I'm out of my depth on, like that he never made any claims on my stepmother's life insurance or anything, and he gets money through investments but he can't really tell me how that works tax wise or anything.
Here's where I am right now:

I've got his bills paid for April, and I'm working on May's. I have YEARS worth of paperwork to go through and I'm trying to sort through it a little at a time.
We went up this past weekend and I had him label everything he wanted to bring down, and everything he wanted to keep or put in storage.
I put one car in the shop because he just left it in the garage for a year, and we got a new battery in the truck, and drove it back down to our house. The other car is so old I don't think it'll make the trip.
I got his neighbor to cut his grass for the time being, after getting dad's permission to tell him what's going on.
The current tenant of his rental house wants to buy, so I guess I need to figure out how to sell a house without a realtor, which I've never done before.
I've gotten the name of an Estate Sales Agency, to maybe go through and sell all dad's other stuff, which is the only thing I can think to do to deal with all the stuff we can't keep, and I've gotten the name of a junk remover for whatever is left.
Dad's house will bare minimum need a major landscaping overhaul (he's let his land grow up significantly, and there are trees down in the yard), and possibly a new roof and definitely new flooring if we're going to sell the house. He owes $100k on it, but maybe we could sell it as a fixer upper regardless. I don't know.
I've gotten a family friend who is a lawyer to send me information on wills and power of attorney, but dad doesn't want to sign anything and doesn't have any active paperwork, and I'd really rather have him sign willingly than have him declared incompetent, if I'm going to survive living with him for the next however long.
I let Dad manage his own meds (and double checked him) for about two weeks, and he just couldn't do it himself, so now I'm managing them for him.

The whole time this is going on, all I can think is am I doing the right thing? How is this going to affect my life? How is this going to affect HIS life? Am I missing something? And I'm constantly second guessing myself and my actions and whether I'm doing the right thing at the right time.
I have no resources. My wife is still employed, thank the gods, but I've been laid off due to the virus, which is the silver lining to all of this because I'm getting unemployment with the extra money for the time being while I use my time to help my father, but eventually that's going to run out or I'm going to have to get a job to maintain our home AND pay for him until we can get his finances figured out.
So, I apologize for the long rant, but I guess what this post is about, is that I need help and though I know more than some I've never dealt with this and I feel like I'm drowning in stress, I don't know if I've missed anything important, and I don't know what resources might be at hand for this.
And hell, in the midst of all of this, how do I actually CARE for my Dad!? I'm managing his meds for him, and making sure he gets food, of course, but I'm at a complete loss for how to occupy his time, and help his life be worth living, especially in the midst of this virus stuff.
And, selfishly, I need to figure out how I make sure that my dad's life doesn't consume my own? I know my life is derailed currently, and there is now a new normal, but what's on track for me going to look like going forward, etc.
ANY advice, or resources, or ANYTHING at all is helpful at this point.","comment 1: First, take a deep breath. This is actually very typical in a lot of cultures and even our own years ago, in the past families usually cared for their aging parents in home. It's worked for centuries and so it will work for you if you are willing to put in the effort and it seems you are. 
Now you MUST involve a lawyer. I'm not at this point with my parents yet so others could point you in a better direction as to which type but with all the legal odds and ends you'll have to bite the bullet and get one involved. Maybe your father already has a lawyer, if so it would be really good to touch base and if nothing else discuss the situation at least. It will definitely take some of the burden and ease your mind to an extent to get with a lawyer.
As for the rest, it's good to play second fiddle to your father's lead. The very worst for older adults is losing freedom and autonomy. It seems like you're doing well here, you're stepping back to see what he can and can't do. You're letting him do as much for himself as possible. Even if it seems like he doesn't, he does very much appreciate this. 
If you ever find yourself extremely frustrated and overwhelmed, just think for a moment about how it must be for him. Neither of you wanted this situation and sometimes older adults can make it worse by bucking up and being contrary. It's so very hard for them to accept that this is their new reality. He doesn't want to impose on you and your life. The frustration from that alone is enough to cause some major issues all around.
The best course is to just keep at it like you are now. Give him as much space as possible. You all need to settle in and become comfortable in each other's constant presence for now. After an adjustment period, if things go smoothly, you'll find it gets easier and he may be ready to find hobbies and things to take up his spare time himself. 
In college I had a few focused classes on the aged and how the Boomer generation is going to change how we approach older adults. They're nothing like generations past, they helped create the world as we know it today. Sitting on the porch and watching the world go by isn't going to be enough. 
I also suggest getting maybe a laptop specifically for him and programming it in a such a way he can re-learn or familiarize himself again with technology. He may get a few viruses and get frustrated but this may also help alleviate some of his stress. Going from being connected to totally unplugged doesn't feel good for anyone, older folks included.
comment 2: Thank you for the kind advice. Sorry I haven't been able to respond. It's been a whirlwind lately, to say the least.
comment 3: I hope things are going better for you. I really hope you found a lawyer or talked to your father's lawyer if he has one. Having all that squared away will alleviate a lot of stress then you'll have a better outlook going forward in all things.
comment 4: First of all you have done GREAT so far! Your father is very lucky to have you. 
My mom has dementia and I've had her next to me in my condo building for a couple years now. A few things I've learned:
Get a durable power of attorney in place NOW. I can not stress this enough. If your dad continues to push back on this then you need to be VERY assertive and tell him (in whatever words feel right to you) that he can't have it both ways, depending on you, LIVING with you, and having you take care of 100 things but won't give you the authority you need to actually do those things. 
Dementia is a horrible disease and it will test your patience like nothing else. My mom is also wary of ""giving up her independence"" meanwhile she depends on me for so much, after a year or so in I had to have a couple long talks with her about needing her cooperation or I was going to back out and she could do what she wanted ON HER OWN. 
If that sounds harsh, I don't mean for it to sound that way, but if you don't get some control of the situation now and getting that DPOA it will be MUCH harder down the road. In fact at a certain point your dad will not be competent enough to sign legal documents and then you would be looking at guardianship which is a long and expensive process.
After getting the legal papers, then you have to think of long term planning. This WILL disrupt your life. That is a GIVEN. My advice is to talk to your father now about what he both wants and expects for HIS elder care needs. The sad reality is that caring for a dementia patient in a private home is rarely doable without massive burnout on the part of the caretaker. At some point if your dad lives long enough (and many do) he will likely need a memory care facility. 
With my mom I told her I would do what I could to keep her in her own place as long as possible, and we would hire help as her needs increased. I told her that if it got to a point that she was not safe to be alone even with some hired help then we would have to find her a nice facility close by so I could visit frequently. She seems okay with this plan. 
Good luck.
comment 5: I meant to thank you for the advice, but we've gotten tied up in so much it's been on the backburner. I just wanted to let you know that we really appreciate the advice.
comment 6: You are off to a great start! You are in an overwhelming and difficult position, but you can and will get through this. My FIL who had dementia lived with us as well, so I understand how overwhelmed you feel. A few things to consider:

You are wise to see an attorney. It is best to see a certified Elder Law attorney if possible because they are the most knowledgeable in this area. They can likely connect you to a good real estate attorney for the sale of properties as well. If you are in a different state you should see probably consult with one where you will be living as states have different policies. 
Consider looking for a certified move manager. They also specialize in working with older adults in these situations. They will organize, pack, sell selected items, dispose of what is left, etc. If you google certified move manager you can find one in your area. 
Explore selling the home as-is. It will be much less stressful. Hopefully the proceeds from the sale of assets will give you a little bit to work with for his care.
Contact your local area agency on aging. They can connect you to any assistance and programs that may be available and are usually a wealth of information. Find your agency here:  https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/About/Aging_Network/AAA.aspx 
Contact the Alzheimer's Association for caregiver support. Programs vary by location, but they have SO MUCH available. Find your local chapter here:  https://www.alz.org/local_resources/find_your_local_chapter 
Check with your local pharmacy about the packaging of Dad's meds. Most can put them in pill packs labeled with date and time to be taken. It will make meds management much easier for you and will be good if you are able to have help once at some point.
Connect with a certified home care agency to see what might be available. Even if you can't afford much, a couple hours a week will allow for you to get a bit of time away. (This is so important.) Here is a questions to ask worksheet you can use:  https://polkeldercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Form-Home-Care-Questions.pdf 
Check with your local police department to see if they have any programs related to dementia response. Some communities have registries that you can participate in and do well checks or can more easily locate family when someone wanders.
Most communities have so many hidden resources. The Chamber of Commerce & City Hall are good places to gather resources and programs like Meals on Wheels will also be able to clue you in about what else might be available in your community. Some communities even have adult day care programs that would be helpful when you return to work.

I hope some of this information is helpful. If you have any other questions I can help with please ask. I'm happy to help if I can.
comment 7: This is a great and helpful list and deserves more upvotes.
comment 8: Thank you, I'm glad to help!
comment 9: It IS a great and helpful list and I have been using it to take our next steps. I'm just sorry it took me so long to reply. Thank you again!
comment 10: No worries! Glad the info has been helpful.
comment 11: - Get power of attorney so you can deal with his finances, his property and other matters. His wife's insurance money will come in handy once that gets settled. 
- Put his name in for an Assisted Living residence close by - you do not have to take the placement if his name comes up quickly, but some places have long waiting lists. My mother's place has Assisted Living and Memory Care in the same residence, just different floors. It seemed to be a humane set up, so they don't have to move to a whole new place if they need more services. 
- If he is still driving, it might be time to check out alternatives. Before my stepdad even started hallucinating, he would get lost and sometimes even ended up in the ditch. Finally his kids started ""borrowing"" his car for weeks at a time until he was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia and was told not to drive. 
- Check to see if he is getting all the financial aid and services he is allowed. Many places have Senior's Social Workers that can help with that - your town/city likely has a Seniors' Center that can point you in the right direction for many things - including caregiver supports and day programs. 
- It sounds like you are doing all you can so far. It will be challenging but the hardest part  is now when things are in such a mess. He is lucky to have you.
comment 12: Thank you very much for the advice. It's been a wild ride so far, but I think we're finally starting to manage.

"I am fucking dying inside. My parent has early-onset dementia that came on noticeably at 65. We had to move to a nursing home 2.5 years later. 2yrs in the nursing home during this pandemic they refused food or water. The decision was made to issue a nothing by mouth order and place them on hospice. 
THAT WAS TWELVE DAYS AGO. 
How can anyone survive this long who was already severely underweight, with renal failure, late stage dementia, and Parkinson’s? 
What’s worse is we can’t even be with them as they die. The facility has a 50+% infection rate of covid, and my other parent has significant risk factors that an exposure would likely kill. 
This is the fucking worst. I flew out and left my family when the hospice team told us they had days to live (the 24th). Sunday they told us 24 hours, Monday the nurse told us they wouldn’t make it through the night. Then today the nurse tells us eye tracking and arm movement has returned along with being responsive. 
The stress and anxiety of this is killing me.","comment 1: I am so sorry that this is happening to your parent and that you have to experience this. I don’t know if it means anything to you but your not alone in having gone through this. My grandma was very similar to what you described at her end. She spent about two weeks basically unable to get out of bed and unconscious 90% of the time. The last week she never woke again. 
She was so physically healthy before the dementia hit her, it basically worked against her and prolonged the decline. She never made any improvement at the end and I can only imagine the kind of whirlwind of emotion that is creating for you and your family. I wish there was some magical panacea of words I could offer to ease your pain. All I can do is offer my empathy and my sympathy and tell you that with time and grief the pain will start to heal.
comment 2: i'm so sorry you are going through this.  It can take a month or more or it could be tomorrow. It's ghastly but it will pass, just as everything does.  Look after yourself as best as you can during this bit - that's part of doing right by your family.
comment 3: I am so sorry you are going through this. My thoughts are with you at this time.
It is very common to get a improvement before the end, this is often called terminal lucidity or the end of life rally. It can be deceptive but usually passes fairly quickly within a day or two.
comment 4: What an awful situation you have to live through. 
&#x200B;
> Monday the nurse told us they wouldn’t make it through the night. Then  today the nurse tells us eye tracking and arm movement has returned  along with being responsive. 
A sudden return to better functioning is common for those who are near death: it's theorized to be caused by dehydration reducing brain swelling, or a few other reasons.  Maybe this torture will end soon.  As some of us say with good reason: sometimes death is a blessing.
comment 5: Jeeeeeez. This sucks so bad. My heart hurts for you. All I know for sure is that you will get through it. One day this won’t suck so bad. Hang in there. Sending love.

"Resources for long-term care Hello friends, my dad has Alzheimer's and seems to be advancing pretty rapidly. My mom has been my dad's caretaker but I know it's burning her out. A couple things I'm looking for help on; we need some kind of tracking device for my dad for when/if he wanders away. I've seen plenty of watches but my biggest concern with any kind of wearable is getting him to wear it. It doesn't help much if he walks away without the watch or other wearable on. I've seen the tracking soles for shoes but it needs charging almost everyday. Thoughts on what works well and how to get them to wear it?
The other thing I'm looking for guidance on is how to find out what kind of assistance my parents qualify for. My dad was a 9/11 first responder and is part of the long-term study so I've asked my mom to mention it at his next check-up. But I'm curious about who I should contact to get more info on financial assistance for long-term care. Thank you in advance!","comment 1: You may have seen this advice before,, but it's good advice. Elder Care attorney.  A good one can help you draw up a map, so to speak, on how to effectively get your dad, the care and help he needs.
comment 2: I just read about elder care managers and now I know what to ask for! This is exactly what I need; someone who can help us navigate all this. There's a lot of great info online but it's tough to sift through it all to find what's relevant. Thank you!
comment 3: In my county we have this thing called project lifesaver. It’s a wristband that’s somehow linked to a radio frequency. Someone from the sheriff’s department would come by every month or so and change the battery. It’s waterproof and the band is made of something similar to seat belt material, but a little smaller/thinner. Maybe you’re dad would think it’s cool, or you can figure out some other novel way to spin it? My mom enjoyed the sheriff’s deputies coming by to change the batteries. 😳
Also, the local senior center or area agency on aging should be able to assist with resources. There may also be local geriatric care managers/management companies that can help as well.
comment 4: >project lifesaver
I'm going to look in to this, thank you!
comment 5: You’re welcome, and good luck with all! Check out some Teepa Snow stuff if you haven’t already, that may also be helpful to you and your family!
comment 6: There are aging and disability resource centers or departments of aging in the states. Look online for these, they have a lot of information about benefits. Also health and human service centers will have information available about area specific resources you can use. A lot of churches have information about community options available. 
There is more than you think out there that have information available to help your mom out with burn out. If you have family to reach out to that can come “spend time” with your dad so your mom can have a break once in a while could also be an option.
comment 7: Thank you! I'm going to reach out to my employee assistance program. I'm just not sure what to ask for from them but I'm hoping they can guide me.
Unfortunately I'm the only family nearby so I help my mom as often as a I can but with coronavirus, I haven't been able to help. I'm encouraging her to just hang in there until we can get my dad in to some adult day-care programs that I think would help her out.
comment 8: I think being able to communicate with you over the phone helps her tons right now as I’m sure she’s feeling very isolated. Just letting her vent to you Might help relieve some of her stress. 
Adult day care is a great idea! The interaction and care at some places are wonderful. When there are some open and available please take tours of a couple and talk to as many of the care workers as you can. The one we took my grandma to also had a childcare that had activities planned with both the kids and the elderly together. My grandma had extra smiles when we picked her up on those days. 
There is also a program where I am located that has volunteers drive people in need to appointments, I believe called caring angels? There is also a Medicare-based transport for people. 
Going through this takes so much patience with the person affected. My parents and I took shifts with her just trying to get her to eat or take her meds or shower. It gets difficult and frustrating. I really commend you for your concern for both of them!
I think with your employee assistance program just being frank with the situation and asking for any available resources and information to get you started.
comment 9: I have been talking to my mom every day. I think you are right about her feeling isolated.
That is such a cool idea to have adult and child day care in one place! I'll have to see if I can find anything like that. My dad loves little kids
I'm definitely going to reach out to ask about resources from my employee assistance program. Thanks!

"Remotely controlled electronics Hi everyone!! Cross my fingers this gets seen 🤞🏽🤞🏽 Just a little bit of info about me: my mom was diagnosed with early-onset dementia -  she’s 58. I recently moved out but still visit her every weekend. She lives at home with her mother and my godmother goes to her house a few  times a week so she’s never alone. She still likes to do things for herself like cooking, cleaning, and laundry but still needs occasional help. Where she really struggles is using electronic devices.  I’ve started to teach her how to use her Samsung tablet so she can  listen to music even when I’m not there to help her navigate the tablet.  I’ve been searching but haven’t really found much, but I was wondering if there are any electronic devices out there that can be remotely controlled on my end even when I’m in my own place. Like her tv, tablet,  a radio? Any suggestions and alternate solutions are appreciated! ☺️","comment 1: Hi hi!
So, I don't know about devices that are intrinsically built for remote access, but there are certainly loads of programs out there that allow you to control one computing device with another. (This is to say: you can work with computers, phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) Which program to use depends a bit on your level of proficiency and on the kinds of devices your mum and you have (Android, Windows, Mac, etc.). A bit of googling should get you pretty far in finding a solution. 
Non-computer devices (like radios) are trickier. I'm not aware of any way to operate these remotely. This isn't to say that options don't exist, but just that I've not seen them. Something you may want to look into are devices custom-built for folks with dementia. I've seen one-button radios and simplified tv remotes, for instance. There are great phones which you can program with the names or photos of loved ones so that using the phone is a one-button project. You'll have to do a bit of digging around because they have so much on offer, but check out the Alzheimer's society store: https://www.alzstore.com/
And ... If you're able, loop your grandma and godmother into how to use these tech. The grim truth is that everything you teach your mom now is likely to fade away. Having several people who can use the tablet, for instance, saves you being on call all the time, which I'm sure you're willing to be, but it can become relentless.
Good luck!
comment 2: Thanks so much!! I’ll look into that store
comment 3: The previous poster nailed it. I just wanted to reiterate that you’ll have to teach others in her life because she won’t retain most of any of what you try and teach her. Also, you might want to consider a device along the lines of an echo or Alexa.
comment 4: Thanks!
comment 5: Awesome!
comment 6: What kind of TV does she have? There are apps that you can use to control the tv remotely.
comment 7: I’m actually on the market to purchase her a new tv. Any recommendations are welcome
comment 8: I’m not buying my dad a new tv so I’m just attaching a windows pc to it (a cheap raspberry pi or android tablet could work too).  I could also get one of those smart plugs to turn off and on the tv but he seems to be able to handle that p.  I’m also going to buy him an android tablet to play with and control it using the same apps which may be helpful for you since you are already getting a new tv.  Could you post which tv you choose if you find one that can do remote stuff?
I’m using the programs parsec and teamviewer.  Both free.  You can control android tablets, raspberry pis, Mac and Windows PCs with these apps.  The only thing you can’t control is an iPad though you can still see the screen with teamviewer.  You can use teamviewer on your own iPad though to control her windows pc.
I like teamviewer in that it’s easier to transfer files from my pc to hers with it.  And if for some reason your pc is logged out, you can log back in.  But with parsec, it’s like your computer is her computer. 
So the things I do with the tv now that I have a pc connected to it are that I can start up Netflix and watch something with him.  I’ve got a chrome browser that is set up to three pages.  The first is YouTube saved with my playlist of exercise videos I can exercise with him on.  I might karaoke with him through YouTube as well.  I’ve got another page saved to my comcast xfinity stream.  And then another I’m thinking about setting with some online games like wheel of fortune or something.  The last page is to my Flickr album so I can share photos and videos with him to talk about what I’ve been doing.  I guess I could give him a Bluetooth gamepad and play games with him too but that might be too complicated for him.  Maybe I’ll do a playlist of music videos for him too for YouTube.
I’ve got Skype setup on the pc so that it automatically answers when someone calls him so I can Skype with him so he sees me on the big screen tv.  I gave my sisters the Skype number as well.  I gave him an old junky desktop though so am going to buy a webcam for the tv or take an old cell phone and use that as a webcam.
The android tablet will let me play touch screen games with him.  I might use the Facebook instagames as there are so many easy games lumped there.  Not sure yet as I haven’t tested this out.  In general, I find bowling games to be easy as all you have to do is flick your finger.  Soccer goalie games too.
She will need decent upload speeds and you will need decent download internet speeds for this if you want things to look good on your end.  Without it, since it’s all playing on her devices, she can still get great visuals but I’m not sure if you will have problems seeing a movie or something streaming off her pc.  Also, streaming uses a lot of data FYI though unless you are already using tons, I don’t think it’ll be too bad if you have a decent amount of data.
Another option if this is too tech for you is Amazon echo show or google nest hub.  Those can allow automatic video call pickups.  I prefer Facebook portal for its big screen or tv setup but it doesn’t have automatic call answer so that’s a fatal flaw for me.  These devices can’t do nearly as much as my pc with teamviewer and parsec setup can do but it’s simpler (I find teamviewer and parsec to be easy too but it does require some work).
As far as her chores..  there are a ton of smart household devices out there.  It’s just a matter of how much control you want to take and how much money you want to spend.
Edit:  here’s a smart remote too that sound like it can control anything that uses ir input.  Not sure how well it works though as I haven’t tried it.  Reviews seem mixed so I personally hesitate in using it.

comment 9: Wow thanks so much! You really provided a wealth of information for me. 
I ended up getting her just a regular Insignia tv with a roku device. 
As far as the smart plug goes, can you control turning the tv on and off from your phone even if you’re not at your father’s home?
I actually tried playing around with teamviewer last week on her Samsung tablet and my iPhone but I noticed I could only screen record. Would I be able to control it via my iPad or would I have to purchase an android tablet for myself?
I also downloaded Skype for both of us last week as well and set it up to automatically answer my calls. So far so good!

"Remotely controlled devices Hi everyone!! Cross my fingers this gets seen 🤞🏽🤞🏽 Just a little bit of info about me: my mom was diagnosed with early onset dementia - she’s 58. I recently moved out but still visit her every weekend. She lives at home with her mother and my godmother goes to her house a few times a week so she’s never alone. She still likes to do things for herself like cooking, cleaning, and laundry but still needs the occasional help. Where she really struggles is using electronic devices. I’ve started to teach her how to use her Samsung tablet so she can listen to music even when I’m not there to help her navigate the tablet. I’ve been searching but haven’t really found much, but I was wondering if there are any electronic devices out there that can be remotely controlled on my end even when I’m in my own place. Like her tv, tablet, a radio? Any suggestions and alternate solutions are appreciated! ☺️","comment 1: This hits different!
comment 2: Yes it really does but I’m trying my best!
comment 3: I would try an amazon dot, she will need to get use to speaking with the queue phrase "" Alexa, please do... or play..."" but after she gets the hang of it.
comment 4: Thank you!

"Could my grandfather have dementia? We can't take him to a doctor as of now due to lockdown. But we are worried as he is behaving strangely for the past few months. 
He would forget things which he had done just a few minutes ago, forget where he had kept his things. 
He loses track of time, he would think it's morning even when it's evening and this usually happens after he has just woken up. 
He talks to his own reflection in the mirror or doors, has become very paranoid, he keeps hiding his things and thinks that someone will steal them. 
He would think that the things he saw in the TV are happening for real sometimes. 
Occasionally, he would say that he want go back to his home (while referring to our old house;  we shifted many years ago).","comment 1: First, get him checked for a UTI.  That causes a lot of mental changes in people over 60.  Your GP should be able to get you a test so you can do a home collection of urine.  Call his doctor and ask.
comment 2: Okay, didn't know that. Will surely get that checked. Thank you.
comment 3: I second the check for UTI. However, you can also look for things that have changed over time. Handwriting that has gotten worse. Something that he has done for years that requires some attention to detail that shows noticeable negative change. 
My mother enjoyed adult coloring books, and started out very neat, detailed, and good color choices. It slowly degraded to the point where she uses a single color per page and has trouble staying in the lines.  
When you ask him questions about his past, does he come up with fewer and fewer memories? Do you have the same conversation over and over again? Does he forget who people are and how they are related to him? 
Is he Type2 diabetic?
comment 4: He does talk about a particular thing everyday, we have to explain the same thing to him almost everyday. Yes, he sometimes forgets people. 
One more thing, he took his glasses and looked at them in awe, he didn't know what that thing is and he has been wearing glasses for years. This happened only once though but I think it's getting worse with time. 
No, he is not diabetic.
comment 5: UTI’s can absolutely cause dementia like symptoms, but of the problem persists over weeks without a commensurate physical decline, it’s less likely.
My grandma often had both and in her case a UTI would simply exacerbate the symptoms of her dementia. 
Start recording, both in writing and especially in video, examples of this behavior. Sometimes when confronted with video evidence, patients can break down. And if not, it’s something to show their doctor.
comment 6: Physically, he is fine. He had problems with urination but that was related to prostate and it is sorted out now. And his mental condition seems to be getting worse with time. 
Will do the recording, thank you.

"Update on sweet by overspending MIL Hey reddit, thanks for letting me post updates about my dear but overspending MIL. I’m not sure it does anyone else a service for me to post these updates but it sure helps me. I apologize for the length, it’s therapeutic. 
Quick summary: My beloved MIL is 85, lives in an apartment in the same complex as me and my husband so we can help care for her. She does not drive so we run errands for her. She used to be rich but lost multiple properties over time including her home to foreclosure. She is in debt to family members to the tune of over $30,000. We are cosigners of her lease, and so recently got entangled in her finances when she could not make rent. She has more than enough to live on, but purchases unnecessary items on QVC and Amazon etc, then can’t remember making the purchase, and has accrued around $1700 in overdraft fees alone in 2020. She mentioned being extremely stressed and sleepless about this to me in late March. She agreed to a detailed budget and series of small loans and repayments from me and my husband that should get her back on track by midsummer. She does have enough to live on plus a modest amount of spending money if she watches it. This proved a problem as she kept forgetting about our agreement and spending money anyway.
Kind commenters suggested in a previous post ways to gain control of her finances, such as taking over her bank account and giving her a monthly allowance on a gift card. This proved difficult as my BIL is her POA, not us. Everything I have done with her finances I did with her in the room to give consent and passwords (when she remembered them). BIL lives a few hours away, while we are the ones to care for her daily. He and my husband do not always get along well, especially when it comes to who knows best about their mom. Last week was pretty rocky. MIL asked for help from both BIL and us about her finances. We each made separate plans, which she forgot herself so she couldn’t keep the other party informed. BIL gained access to MIL’s bank account. Well, that locked us out of MIL’s bank account. MIL herself couldn’t access it because she kept forgetting the password. MIL kept giving each household a different set of information about her finances because she couldn’t remember. Example: 
Me: MIL, did you make a purchase for $200 from So-and-so on March 14?
MIL: Yes, that was for such and such.
(Later) BIL: Mom, did you make a purchase for $200 from same So-and -so on March 14?
Me: No.
BIL: It must be fraudulent. I’m disputing the charge and having the bank send you a new debit card.
(Later) Me: MIL, why can’t I buy deposit a check to cover your rent at the ATM for you with your debit card?
MIL: It’s being replaced.
Me: Why?
MIL: I don’t remember.
This obviously was unsustainable, so after great reluctance from the brothers, I GOT ALL 3 OF US ON THE PHONE AT THE SAME TIME to discuss MIL’s finances. Pardon the caps, it was a real victory. They have not done this in years. It involved some swallowing of pride on both sides, but I was very proud of how it went overall. We got access to her bank account again, which is essential if we are to help her stay on budget and make sure she doesn’t fall below 0 again. We are taking real steps to all be on the same page. Some of these steps are the ones commenters suggested in my previous posts – thanks! Both households are monitoring her account regularly. BIL is willing to take control of the account and put her on an allowance if needed. He doesn’t want to take the step yet as he already had to block QVC and some other spending outlets she has, and feels it would be too much at once. As long as she is compliant with spending, we’re ok just monitoring her.
The victory came with a price. My husband was helping MIL sort her magazines. She gets around 20 magazines a month, which adds up to $100 a month. We asked her if she was willing to whittle these down to maybe 2 or 3 a month, at least until her debt is paid off. OR even just let us temporarily suspend delivery. When libraries open back up, I can check many of these out for her for free. She was resistant and started sticking her tongue out at us playfully and saying we wouldn’t let her have any fun. I recognize this is her coping mechanism, and didn’t mind. Husband however reminded her should take this seriously, because she was in debt. She remembered the debt only vaguely, so we gave her a brief summary. She insisted she was doing all right financially and didn’t need help. I reminded her that although her bank account is above 0 now, she has bills due of over $2600 in the next couple weeks, so we have to still be very careful. When we mentioned we had discussed her finances with BIL (we’d told her multiple times the conversation would happen), she felt we were ganging up on her and being tyrants. “Why does everyone had access to my accounts?” she asked. She forgot she herself had asked BIL and us to be involved and had given us access to her various accounts.
Things got worse when we took her to the bank to get her new debit card. We stopped at the grocery to pick up a few items she needed, since it was right next to the bank. MIL wanted to go inside. Due to the current health situation, we knew that would be unsafe. It was a busy time of day. Then MIL was mad we wouldn’t let her go inside Dollar Tree. We asked what she needed from there. “I just want to look around.” I am very empathetic to how stir crazy she must be. It was the first time she’d been near a store herself in a month and half. I explained she was in an at-risk population. She remembered part of the news about the virus. I think she half understands how serious it is.
“I am tired of people telling me how to run my life. I don’t think you understand I do just fine living independently and taking care of myself and my finances on my own!” she said, as upset as I had ever heard her. I felt for her. It must be extremely hard for her kids to tell her she can’t do certain things. But the truth is, she is at the point she can’t take care of herself on her own. Without our “interference,” she would have been evicted. And it’s in large part because of her memory issues with finances. Two days ago, she had to ask my name so she could write me a check for her medications. 
I feel like this week we made the relationship between my husband and BIL a lot better regarding this issue, but took a step backward with my MIL’s feelings. The truth is, she will probably forget she was ever upset, just as she forgot she ever asked us to get involved, just as she forgot she was ever in debt. I know she will get upset at us again sometime in the near future, when we remind her about the budget again, and tell her she can’t spend something. I am not angry at all with her, as she can’t help it, and this must be extremely difficult. We tell her we love her multiple times a day, and are there to help her. I do feel like we are controlling her to some extent, but I KNOW we are acting for her safety. I wish it were easier. 
That was long but it’s helpful to write about it, so thanks.
TLDR: MIL spends too much and forgets, we took big steps getting on the same page with BIL to work together to help her, but now she feels we’re ganging up on her.","comment 1: That’s great that you all got on the same page!  QVC & HSN are like morphine to the elderly, I swear.  We used to call my Mom “The Queen of QVC”.  They would have her on the air all the time.  She had a bedroom just for her purchases from those two places.  No way you could sleep there.
Your MIL will eventually hit the point where you can take all of her finances away from her; debit card, check book, all of it.  Then you can get it all straightened out.  Until then, I bet you’re going to continue to have these battles again and again.  I wish you perseverance and courage.  Take lots of deep breaths and drink lots of wine if you have to 🙃
comment 2: Thanks for the empathy! Wine for us both.
comment 3: Congrats on getting the bros on the same page, no small victory.
comment 4: Thanks for the encouragement.

"Dad has gotten worse these past few days; keeps running off and crying My family is trying to do their best with keeping my dad with us; especially during these covid times because we would not be able to see him. 
It was just over a week ago he would sit inside and watch wrestling without any trouble. Now he keeps bolting for the door, and running off. If we were to lock him inside, we’re worried he may grow angrier possibly towards us. 
The good thing is he always takes his phone that we use to track him. Never leaves without it, so we drive to where he is, and he’s usually calm by them, and complies with us. 
He’s been more prone to running off on us, and crying. It’s so heartbreaking seeing my dad go through this illness. 
We are trying a different set of pills now, and hopefully it’ll calm him down. Otherwise, we have no choice but to take him to the hospital until a home is found, and I desperately don’t want to give him away yet. When he runs, he doesn’t watch for traffic too. It’s like a light switches and it’s no longer him. Then he calms down and it’s him. 
I just want my dad to stop running away from us so we don’t have to put him into a home.","comment 1: My father cried every day for nearly a year.  When I put him in a memory care center he stopped.  He was under so much stress and it went away.  He's so much happier not trying so hard to pass as normal.
comment 2: You really really do need to lock him in.  Install locks that need to a key inside as well as out. You said he is not checking for traffic.  You’d never forgive yourself if he was hit by a car, and it’s not fair to the driver of the car either.  If he does continue to roam, you should give the police a heads up, so they know his situation though.
comment 3: My grandma experienced similar problems. She continued to escape, even after we changed the locks. I remember one night, me (29m) being out of breath trying to run down a 79 year old woman. I had to physically haul her back a half mile to the house; and then she called the police on me. 
I fully understand that the restrictions presented by this covid outbreak have to be taken into account; however, the safety of your LO and yourself have to also be taken into consideration.

"The Hugs are Worth It I pick her up and her knees collapse. I feel a sharp pain somewhere low  in my back as muscles and bone adjust to the unexpected strain. She  laughs. It’s not a real laugh; I know that. She has no more control over  it than the sudden contractions that curled her legs under her as I  lifted. But I can control the flash of frustration I feel when I drop  her into her wheelchair. It’s another morning living with PLS, Primary  Lateral Sclerosis. It’s another day I get to be with the woman I love  more than occasional back pain, that I love more than life.
Maybe I should have taken better care of myself to prepare for this.  Less time tapping on a keyboard. More time at the gym. More time working  out. Arnold would be able to lift her with one arm. So would The Rock.
Or maybe a technical solution. I could get a Hoyer Lift, but I don’t  want one. The bathroom would have to be remodeled to accommodate it. The  bed frame with the under dresser full of old photos and memorabilia  from a life together would need to be replaced.  No. A mechanical device seems too clinical, and I’m OK lifting her.  Really. I get to hug her close to me several times a day. That’s worth  risking a little back pain, isn’t it?","comment 1: At least get a good back brace.  Anytime you are standing up, especially lifting a patient, you should have a back brace on.
comment 2: Thanks! I ordered one two days ago. The thought that I finally needed one is what prompted me to write this.
comment 3: A back brace and sensible shoes is what you learn right away.  Even if I am washing dishes, doing laundry or helping someone to the bathroom, I have my back brace on.  I still have backaches.  ; (
comment 4: This made me tear up. You have a huge heart and a way with words.
comment 5: Thats beautiful, you made me smile. That is love.
comment 6: It’s so worth it, isn’t it?
comment 7: Always and always.
comment 8: You love your mom, and you love her more than the pain, and that's really sweet.
But unfortunately the love won't make the potential injury of your back go away. 
Definitely get a brace, but be open to doing the things you're not wanting to, like redoing the bathroom and getting a Hoyer. My brother has ALS and he didn't (well we didn't) want a lift, but once his condition changed and our backs were literally hurting, we knew it would be safe for everyone if we had mechanical help... and btw we did have to redo our bathroom! We got a reliable contractor who simply widened the door entrance and got a small ramp leading up into it. 
It's good to love mom. But do so responsibly! Otherwise if you get hurt, who's gonna take care of her... and you? Be safe
comment 9: Wife, actually. 38 years together.
comment 10: Ah sorry, but same thing still applies, gotta take care of you!
comment 11: A back brace and starting to work on your core muscles to support your back. It doesn’t have to be crazy amounts of sit ups or anything. Just simple ones to help your back and your balance as you lift her.
comment 12: Thanks for posting, it made me smile.  You're handling things with such grace and love.

"Support Services won't pay for things you actually need. Why? I am the caregiver, I do this 24/7 for the last ten YEARS! But apparently what I say my mom needs is irrelevant .
Hey I really could use an alarmed Pulse Ox so I don't have to get up every 20 minutes all night long to check and make sure she didn't take her oxygen tube off in her sleep again... 
Nope, sorry we can't pay for something like that. Oh but here, have a bedside commode! 
Ah, no thanks, there's no room for it and both me and my mom prefer just getting her into the bathroom. 
Not here Take it! We insist. (and will imply you are a horrible caregiver if you don't)
Hey, my mom needs diabetic shoes because her feet swell and I'm having a hard time finding regular shoes to fit her. 
Okay, jump through all these hoops, get your mobility issue mother to the podiatrist, then take her to have her feet measured by the therapy department, go to the health mall to have them fit and then we'll find some bullshit reason not to cover them anyway. But take this hoyer lift you have no room to store or maneuver around your tiny apartment. 
Again, no thanks, I'm pretty sturdy and have no trouble whatsoever getting my mom up and its good for her to take those few steps around the apartment anyway. 
No! we insist that you take this thing and stick it in a corner were it will become an $800 clothes rack!
So... since you wouldn't cover the diabetic shoes, because technically they're not a 'medical device' how about a pair of 'medical' compression stockings to try and reduce the swelling in her legs?
No.
But we can save you time by having your moms medications prepackaged in these little daily blister packs.
No thank you, I've been setting up her pill box for 10 years, it only takes a few minutes and that way I know its done right.
But we'll pay to have them prepackaged.
*eye twitching and frustrated screaming*","comment 1: That sucks. And ten years is a long time. I'm approaching ten so I know.  Which city/country?
comment 2: So true. My mom sat in the hospital for 5 days, while they refused to pay for a $300 suction device. But they paid the $1500 a night stay. Also refused to pay for my mom's wheelchair but would pay for splints.
comment 3: I will say she has a wheelchair and they did eventually pay for it but took several appeals.
comment 4: We have an nice motorized wheelchair, that we told them my Dad wouldn’t be able to use.  It’s sitting in the middle of the floor in their tiny second bedroom.  He has Parkinson’s and his hands shake too much for the fine control of the joystick.  When they delivered it, they had him try and he put it into the wall every time. So there it sits, brand new.  I’ve tried to give it away, but it needs a new battery and no one wants to pay the $100 for it to get the free chair.  So aggravating.
comment 5: So sorry. That kind of thing is so frustrating.
comment 6: Yeah, been there, done that. The visiting nurses wouldn't help me help my husband at all. They wanted me to buy a transfer chair from Amazon, but the wheelchair wouldn't fit through the bathroom door. At least his lady doctor helped us get the wheelchair for free. My state medicaid won't pay for diapers or bed pads either. All stressful times.
comment 7: Keep fighting. I became very shameless having nearly lost my mom at 16, my dad at 22 and my sister becoming permanemtly disabled when I was 24.
Some friendly tips that actually work:
1. I ask for whatever from whoever. The worst they can say is no.
2. Sometimes you have to make anonymous calls to your own health insurance company and throw out a ""hypothetical"" like you're ""asking for a friend"" just to get a straight answer from an actual person.
3. Unleash your inner Karen. Threaten to sue, cry at them, whatever gets the job done.
4. Call and hang up until you either get someone in the phone who actually cares or who gives zero f*cks and will do whatever you want no questions asked. Its kind of terrifying to know that people like the latter exist in any work place but sometimes it's what you need to get the job done.
5. Research the corporate/head office of whatever company is giving you trouble. Usually ltmc insurances and the like are umbrellaed under a larger group. Get to that corporate headquarters and leverage that contact to get what you want. I recently did this with a NYC agency. I went to the state department who superceeds them and after 2 months of getting nowhere with the city I sent 1 email to the state department, my phone was ringing off the hook the next morning with people suddenly BEGGING to help me!! And all this while in quarantine!! People are sooooo lazy until you figure out who they're boss is....Oh, super important, email and letters or faxes are best. People get terrified when their negligence is documented in writing.
6. PATIENT ADVOCATE!!! If you're in a hospital find this person immediately. In the US most states have this and the patient advocate is required by law to report any wrong doing by the hospital. Sometimes rehabs have them too. The hospital will bend over backwards to make you happy. Guaranteed!!
7. Worst case scenario there is the tride and truest tactic of all: unleash the media on those mofos. Granted, it has to be life or death, basically very severe situation with potentially catastrophic consequences- but yeah, get that local newspaper, tweet, post photos and docs (obviously block out sensitive info), local news stations, whoever picks it up. My mom had to do this at my elementary school when it started to go downhill. The media attention forced the school board to investigate and one of the teachers got charged for drug possession with intent to sell. My mom and the pta just thought she was showing up drunk to work, so you never know if a story is bigger than you think it is.
Hope this helps! Caregivers for life!!! 🤘

"How to control grandparent's TV for them My grandmother is in an assisted living facility. She has parkinsons, so her hands and voice shake and she often says the wrong words. We know what she means, but something like Alexa certainly would not. With coronavirus, she's essentially stuck in her room with nothing to do. Is it possible for me to turn on the tv and change the channel for her? She has an echo show and we just ordered a fire TV cube. It doesn't have to be an Alexa product - willing to buy whatever. Would really appreciate any tips, suggestions or advice that anyone has.","comment 1: I don't know of any products like you're looking for, I'm sorry. For my mom, I access her Netflix and make sure that what she wants to use is the first suggestion on the main page, but I'm guessing that would not work for you. Totally different direction, but have you looked into low vision remotes? They usually have extra big buttons and fewer options (usually 4 or 6 max on the remote)
comment 2: It turns out we might be able to control her tv if we buy a fire TV cube. It isnt foolproof, but my mom can sync her phone to it before delivering it, and then she can talk into the app on her phone to change the channel. Will post an update if it works cause I'm sure there are other ppl struggling with something similar!
comment 3: One option is to get her a basic desktop pc. get her some movie services like netflix and hulu. You can set up a pc where you can remote in and control hers. just like when a remote tech takes over and fixes your puter. Its the RDP function I believe.  
You also might ask over in the IT reddit and se if theres any devices or services that would allow this. There is alot of home devices that you can remotely command so maybe that can be used for a tv.
comment 4: Ah cool.  Yeah, I used to have remote access set up on her computer at home.  You can do it via Chrome.  Good suggestion!
comment 5: setup skype too or something similar and ya all can do a video call. best of Luck.

"Paging button that calls phone Hey everyone, I’m looking for a way for my grandma to call me if she needs help. Ideally this would be a button she could press that would just ring my cell phone. Ideally this would notify me even if I’m away from the house. 
Does anything know about any device that does this? The simpler the better. Doesn’t need to have a microphone or anything, just a way for her to make my phone ring at the press of a button.
Thanks!","comment 1: So this is a fairly common question. You're looking for a medical alert system. Here's a writeup I did a while ago on these
There are also ways to setup a cell phone to do this, you can directly place a contact on the home screen and it will dial that person. My wife and I have this set up for when she has a seizure and I'm not in the immediate area (She can press it when she first feels it come on). 
There are also medical alert apps, although I haven't looked at these.
comment 2: Thank you so much! I was struggling to figure out exactly how to search for what I’m looking for so this helps a bunch. Sorry for the redundant post! Haven’t been on reddit long so I wasn’t sure how to search similar questions.
comment 3: No worries. I should really get a FAQ going once I have some time.
comment 4: I got this for my mom when she still lived at home. It wasn't as expensive, I got it for about $80 on sale. It plugs into a landline and can call out when a button is pressed. It worked fine, but was one of the only ones that didn't have a monthly fee.

"Mom woke me up today to call her an Uber for... She wanted me to send an Uber to her house in a small town 1.5 hours away from me so she can get here to drop off some candy she doesn't want to mail and some other stuff for my kids.
I have a family tracking app on our phones and she and her husband have joined in, so I see them out at the shops every 2-4 days.
Well, apparently her husband finally said no to SOMETHING and refused to drive down here with her to drop off Easter candy so she wanted me to call an Uber for her.
I gently reminded her that we are staying home except for essentials. I subtley commented that just my husband MIGHT need to go to the store to get stuff FOR A FULL WEEK, get in, get out, and get home. I told her he will wear a mask and that I was up until 11 last night making more masks to donate.
Amazingly she didn't go off on me, she didn't hang up on me, she didn't cry, and our conversation stayed somewhat productive and definitely friendly despite my having to tell her to not come here for candy - only go out for ESSENTIALS.
My poor step dad and what it must be like in their house in these times!","comment 1: These are the hardest of time

"technology Hi there! I am very new to this sub. We are about a 3 years into my father in law's diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer's. While we absolutely love the time we spend with him, things are extremely difficult. He is at the stage where he is still lucid enough to understand that he is confused... if that makes sense. So really it comes down to frequent arguing and paranoia. It is difficult to determine if he is confused, or if he just wants to hid things from us. Currently, we are struggling with electronics. He lives in an independent living facility- so basically the only thing they assist with is housekeeping and meals. He very much enjoys having his phone and apple watch, and is able to understand facebook, etc. The problem is he is continually changing his passwords. He changes his apple account, facebook, phone login, email login... EVERYTHING... almost daily.  He then calls us to see if we can help him because ""facebook is broken"" or ""something is wrong with Apple"", when really he just keeps changing things. I don't know if this is Dementia, paranoia, or what? We very much cherish our time with him and we 100% want to maintain his independence as long as possible. I am just curious how others have handled similar struggles? Do your loved ones have phones and internet? Are there ways to ""lock"" the phone so he cannot change settings? Do we just let him keep changing things because it is ""his"" phone? We spend hours on the phone with him trying to walk him through steps of how to change things back. Apple is also frustrating because once he changes his apple account, it logs him out of all of his other devices- so he has to repeat the process with everything. He is under my brother in law's plan right now so we could have access if we needed. We are just unsure of the right move! How do you handle their paranoia? We are frustrated and could really use any words of wisdom and guidance. 
Thank you so much!","comment 1: I'd set all of his accounts to two-factor auth and set the phone to mine.  Then the password can't be changed without talking to me.  He wants to change the PW, I get an alert, I wrap up whatever I'm doing and call him.  Then you can be the ""hero"" and also find out what the new password is.
comment 2: Man that sounds frustrating. I remember having issues with gaining access to my Dad's email early on, but technology isn't really in his wheelhouse anymore. 
I just asked my mom and she said we just kept having to reset his password. You could try contacting apple or facebook but I'm not sure they're able to lock in a password or something. Good luck! Wish I could help more.
comment 3: We got my mom a very bright password book and have been able to reinforce that she always write down any password in it. I had to make a specific page for each account like apple or her bank because she kept just writing down random passwords. It doesn’t always work but it sometimes it does.
comment 4: We went through similar with my husband. He is almost at the end of his journey now, but we downgraded him from an android phone to an iPhone because it was easy-to-use. But then he lost the ability to use even that.
Your father in law will also get to the point where he can no longer use technology. Keep that in mind.
Setting up two-factor is a great idea for now. Change the settings so that you receive the email for password confirmations and such. Just remind yourselves that he isn't going to remember what he did, or why.
Feel free to PM me if you want!

"What tech are you using to keep track of your aging loved ones during COVID-19? Hey team,
I hope everyone is safe and well in this challenging time. I want to know what kinds of technology you are using to be there for your loved ones while keeping them safe by staying physically away from them. I've been building https://sailor.app as a side project and want more to gauge what is broken and what people need badly so I can build it in this time of crisis.
Stay safe everybody.","comment 1: The same kind of tracking collars they use on wolves, paired to a canine shock collar. They leave the GPS coordinates of their homes during lockdown, they get a ""freedom shock"".
comment 2: Take my award and upvote!
comment 3: My mother is legally blind but her hearing is pretty good if she is with just one or two people. She has a basic flip phone where she can receive calls and she can call out to my brother and I. All the fancy tech is lost on her, because of the blindness. She does have an audiobook reader for the blind, and even though the city libraries are closed this service is still in operation - she gets 3 books every week by mail and she can independently send them off via mail. She also has her radio set to CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corp) which offers news, current affairs, and entertainment. Her TV is also of comfort to her, and she can change channels. 
The biggest connection is her phone. I call her every evening, my brother calls a few times every week and I have reminded her adult grandkids to call once in a while.  She is very worried about later this week when everyone in her residence will be kept to their rooms, even having meals brought up. 
I am assembling a care package for her that my son is taking over. He can leave it at the front desk and they will sanitize it and take it up to her. 
Her residence is using ipads and Facetime for a lot of the residents, but you have to make an appointment and we figure it would be better used by people who can see and may not have as good hearing or who have slight cognitive delay. 
Thanks for trying to help others through this.
comment 4: High tech - mostly connecting by phone and email. I did guide my mom through how to activate Google Duo so we can video chat. We've done that a couple times, but she prefers just talking on the phone a couple times a day. 
Low tech - driving to her house and dropping things off on her porch. Ringing the doorbell, running back to my car and shouting at her and stepdad from 40 feet away in the driveway.
comment 5: My mom lives alone has no interest in video chat. We talk on the phone several times a week. She and her girlfriends talk regularly. 
Once every 10 days or so I top up her groceries. I make her hide in the bedroom while I bring them in, wipe them down, put them away. When everything is done I’ve washed the table/counter/hands, I have her come back in and we have a cup of tea from across the room. 
My big decision this week is whether or not to allow the maids in. They are doing everything right (mask, gloves, bootie, cleaning cloths and vacuum cleaner bags changed between each house) but it’s still other people. 
She needs the house clean because she has asthma and allergies, and this is a commercial company that does a great job. But still a risk. 
They will clean better than me, and she can’t scrub like needs to be done.
comment 6: We gave Mum a Fire tablet and since her cataract surgery her eyesight is tons better, so the small screen isn't such an issue. She explored the free books and now I'm getting a notification a day about a book she's downloaded. At least if I know she's reading, she isn't leaving home. She's also exploring Hulu and Netflix (got her hooked up to our accts) and on the internet more since I spent a few hours with her on the phone. Patience. So much patience, lol She's using Skype on there to talk to my brothers kids, whom she was taking care of 2-3 days a week. That was the worst for her, not being able to see the kids. Its a lot better now that she can see them every day if she wants.
comment 7: My dad is 85 years old and lives alone in another state. He has a lot of trouble using technology. He can't figure out how to use Facebook. He has trouble with his basic cell phone often. He can't hear me very well if I call him. He won't use apps. He does not shop online much.  He can't or won't text on his phone. He does not have equipment to do a video call.
We exchange e-mails daily. He tells me he is going to the store for 1-2 items every other day or went out to buy an unnecessary shelving unit. I beg him to stay home. He says thanks for the tip and ignores me. 
How would tracking help?
comment 8: I gave my 89 yr old grandmother my old iPad, and set her up with an Apple ID and password using their home email address (which she can’t use so we handle for her).  Her caretaker will help her do FaceTime with me as she insists she can’t use the iPad by herself.  So mostly it’s old school phone.
comment 9: Google Hangouts! My dad was so excited to show me the bathroom he remodeled!

"Something doesn’t add up with my mom For a few years my sister and I...and then more and more family...have noticed my mom showing signs of dementia.

stopped calling. Doesn’t like to talk on the phone more than a few mins.  Very little to say.
forgets recent events and names
can’t keep track of days of the week
forgets birthdays (completely)
has stopped cooking
says off-color things
tells long, meandering stories from many years ago
watches the same repeat episodes of SVU over and over. She will literally just watch that 24/7
scored about 50% on one of those Alzheimer’s quizzes

So my sister and I asked our dad to get her checked out. 
He just emailed us:
“ Good news. The CT scan came back normal. Still has cognitive issues but not to the point of needing medication”
How can that be?","comment 1: I'm no expert, but I would think she would need a thorough neurological evaluation, not just a CT scan, to confirm or narrow down a degenerative brain disease.
Do you know what questions were asked of her during the meeting? Did she meet with a neurologist specifically? Was your dad present throughout the meeting?
On a side note, I understand people who are afraid to get themselves or a loved one evaluated for dementia-like symptoms, but I wish they would realize that forgoing a diagnosis doesn't mean they don't have the disease.
comment 2: Gerontologist here. A ct scan isn’t going to show the plaques related to Alzheimer’s. I would question the doctor doing that and not a neurological test. 
I would also check if she’s hydrated enough, check for any signs of a UTI and lastly check her medications. Are there any overlapping drugs?  The mix of certain meds can also cause delirium and dementia like symptoms. Good luck.
comment 3: Silly question: why a UTI?
comment 4: UTI’s can also
Mimic the symptoms of dementia in older adults
comment 5: I had no idea. Could that last for months and months?
comment 6: If left untreated yes. Again I don’t know all the circumstances but I would have a doctor do a full diagnosis.
comment 7: I’m not sure what other testing other than the cognitive quiz. She’s 69. They have only been speaking to her family doctor and I have a feeling my dad isn’t giving all the info and/or might be downplaying symptoms.
comment 8: There are simple screening tests but also more comprehensive evaluations, generally performed by specialists.  I don't know how it works in Canada, but my sister (who is 66 and has FTD), was initially screened by her primary care physician.  She was then referred to a neurologist for brain imaging and to a memory clinic for cognitive testing.  Her primary care doctor also ordered testing to eliminate other potential causes, such as UTI or other acute conditions.  After all that was done, the neurologist was able to make the FTD diagnosis.  And in my sister's case, the brain imaging was pretty definitive in showing a significant mass loss in the frontal lobes.  That isn't always the case.
Again, I don't know how things work in Canada, but a primary care doctor should not be diagnosing dementia, it needs to be done by a specialist.
comment 9: Is a CT scan the only testing she had?
How old is your mom? 
Older people can have age-related cognitive decline that isn't dementia.
comment 10: See other reply. 69.
comment 11: That’s so frustrating, OP; I’m sorry. Those were almost the exact same symptoms my dad first showed. He’s now late stage and in memory care.
comment 12: Alzheimer's?
comment 13: Dementia
comment 14: I think a neuropsychological evaluation (cognitive testing with a neuropsychologist) would be warranted to see what's going on and where she's having difficulties.
comment 15: (In Canada) is that something their family Doctor needs to set up as a referral?
comment 16: I'm not sure as I'm in the US, but here's a good resource to figure out your next steps in Canada for cognitive testing and screening for dementia. Good luck!
comment 17: Thanks!
comment 18: Where in Canada are you? Often there's a senior's program or assessments running out of a clinic, usually in a hospital. Often calling the health line will get you further info.
comment 19: Let's break down what he said. 
> “ Good news. 
So everyone noticed and agreed something was wrong. 
&#x200B;
>The CT scan came back normal. 
This means no masses or strokes or other obvious problems, that is good news. 
&#x200B;
>Still has cognitive issues 
So her problems were evaluated, at least using the gold-standard Dementia test and maybe other tests.  That's good, that's at least one big ol long doctor's visit and they're already starting testing. 
&#x200B;
>but not to the point of needing medication” 
So some symptoms have been ID'd and they're looking for ways to treat it.  
&#x200B;
When you look at what he said overall, he appears to be doing the Typical Manly Man thing and avoiding interacting with it, which means minimal information for you.  I'm sorry, that's got to be torture.  But it does sound like she's in treatment and things are proceeding.
comment 20: I help take care of my boyfriends grandmother, and her MRI report said “no signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s, only typical signs of aging.” For reference... I’ve taken care of her for 10 months now and she can’t recall my name (ever) and thinks it may be 2012 (she’s never sure) and can not recall her children’s names. Her cognitive exam at the neurologist’s office finally gave us the dementia diagnosis and a medication (which doesn’t help at all but she’s very far gone at this point and 83 years old). Moral of the story is to definitely follow up for an in person oral-type exam with neuro.
comment 21: My mom had all of the same symptoms, she has FTD. When she first got scans doctor said they were fine too. But her diagnosis is rock solid...
comment 22: I'm so sorry about your mum 
Could I please ask how old your mom is and what were her symptoms ? 
and how she is doing if you don't mind
comment 23: My mom is 44 years old, and her symptoms have definitely evolved a lot over the years but I’ll try to list some of the early stuff.
- wanting to go on walks constantly, at first about twice a day but then every hour or so.
- in the beginning she re watched a lot of friends episodes, eventually she stopped watching any tv at all. 
- Spending a lot of time on facebook but never posting or crafting coherent thoughts.
- telling the same handful of stories over and over again like clock work. It seems like her stories have a backward progression too, like the more time that passes the older her stories are i guess? At first it was like the same handful on repeat everyday, but now she will tell the same story 3 minutes apart without even realizing.
- definitely had issues with off color remarks, mostly as part of her stories.
- this is a weird one but she has no sense of shame? No guilt or embarrassment at all anymore. Extremely apathetic. As of lately one of her stories is about how she accidentally soiled her pants at work once a long time ago 😂
- she never could tell that she was acting different and she still cant :(
That was by no means a comprehensive list, sorry. Im sure i could think of 20 more things throughout the day but i should probably stop for my own sanity lol.
A little over a year ago now we moved my mom into a memory care facility, as it was the best choice for our whole family. Her disease shows no signs of stopping. Sometimes there is physical violence if she doesn’t get her way. Shes somewhat of a big toddler now :(
I dont mean to label your own mom with a disease that she very well might not have, and im sorry if i scared you about it! There are a ton of possibilities when it comes to memory loss and personality changes. Nonetheless, if you want to learn more about FTD for educations sake, here is an amazing resource: https://www.theaftd.org/
Good luck. Message me if you would like more info/help/anything!!!!
comment 24: thank you for sharing this!
comment 25: No problem :)
comment 26: Thank you so much for the info, your mum is so young it must be so awful for you .... I really appreciate your response
comment 27: Thank you too! Im glad that my mom’s story can help others ❤️
comment 28: I am worried about mine as well. She is constantly forgetting what I tell her....other people aren’t worried but I suspect something is wrong...she refuses to see a Dr and does spend no more than 10 minutes via phone call....

"I want terminally ill brother to die First post, and it’s very uncomfortable to write this.
My brother and I are in our late 20’s. My older brother has ALS and has been declining in the past few years. Now he’s almost a vegetable except for his speaking which is pretty affected and he can move his eyes. Other than that it’s me and my mom and a home care worker who help him literally every. single. hour.
Taking care of him has been terrible on me and my mom. Of course money is an issue with my mom cashing in some of her retirement to help pay for expenses that insurance doesn’t (which isn’t like we’ll be homeless, but she won’t have the “golden” part of her golden years anymore). Her back is in pain from physically having to do everything for him, and her face looks like it’s aged a decade in just a few years. She’s unhappy to see her baby dying slowly, but she’s a great mom and really loves my brother (and me).
I am also helping care for my brother. I moved away after college, was starting my life, finally got a great girlfriend, and I felt like I was spreading my wings. I’m so good at my job (sorry not getting too specific here because I don’t want my mom or brother to find out). But what I’m saying is - I really I love my life.
But now I gotta keep coming back every time he’s in the hospital because of a choking fit, or I see on Skype that my mom’s burnt out, or a new worsening happened that’s literally unmanageable by my mom and the caretaker. And there I go again, leaving my life, job, girlfriend I’m really so excited to marry one day (almost 2 years), fitness, income, etc - and there I go leaving it all for God knows how long... a few weeks here, up to 2 months! Last year I spent over half the year at home.
That was half a year I lost income, borrowed to pay my rent, had a strain in my relationship because WE JUST MET a few months before this shit happened. When I do return to my life - I’m tired and exhausted and feel fat and have low sex drive - but more troubling, I’m not “the same” person my girlfriend met years ago. She’s sweet and is so supportive, but it rips my heart to know I can’t be that adventurous and life-loving guy I was when we met.
I was soo good at my job, fast track to promotions. My boss and colleagues really appreciated my work, really respected it, which was leading to private consulting jobs because of how good I am in my job (and how I love it too).
My fitness was on point, eating healthy - going to the gym, taking care of me and standing on my own two feet.
Now I’m almost chubby, have little money, am constantly waking up to help reposition my brother or help him wit a coughing bit or anxiety attack. I love him a lot, but I can’t do this anymore - I’ve given up my life to care for him, and refuse to move back home and give up on my dreams and the path I was on. I work really hard to take care of myself and go to therapy, an open with my girl, attempt to eat healthy (but that’s impossible when I’m back at my mom’s home). I really try - I’m just so effin exhausted.
My brother wants to really live. He thinks he will beat this - we just had his doc’s appointment recently, and I pulled the doc aside to ask about his prognosis. The doc said if my brother wants a trach he could live for years.
I had an anxiety attack after that. I can’t do this anymore. I feel like he’s being selfish putting my mom and I through this, something we didn’t sign up for. I know he didn’t either, and we do so much for him, but he’ll never improve only get worse. I don’t want us all to go down with his sinking ship. My mom’s life is destroyed, and I don’t want to be bitter and care for him as a vegetable. I really have strong feelings of resentment I hold in check when I interact with him.
He’s hard heard and has a strong will. If he wants, he can live for years as a vegetable. No one can help him, so why do we have to suffer because of him being scared to die, or his stubbornness to hang onto a pathetic future? He’s optimistic, has no problem scolding me and my mom for not feeding him right because our limbs get exhausted from holding his head. He doesn’t see what his declining state is doing to us, and I’m not gonna tell a terminally ill brother to consider our fate too. I don’t care that he expresses his appreciation, but we sacrifice everything because he’s the sick dying one.
Everyone talks about how great we are, how lucky he is to have us, etc etc. But I hate those comments, like it’s selfish for people to say think “oh man he’s so bad, it makes me feel bad, but look - they’re taking care of him really good so that makes me feel good”. If that makes sense. 
Idk guys, I really will miss him. But I do not miss my prime years being destroyed by caring for him. I know I sound like a terrible human, and an even worse brother - but I wish he’d die already so I can care for my life and what’s left of my mother’s.
Yes I do talk about this with my therapist, who assures “this won’t last forever.” But after the ALS doc said he could live for years, I just lost it.
Just venting here. If anyone has any advice, that would be appreciated. Again, I’m sorry how bad this sounds, I’m not saying all sick people should die - but I can’t give up my life anymore","comment 1: The thing is,  you don't have to give up your life? You do have to make a choice, though. You are either there to help caregive with your mother or you aren't. Going back and forth will give her expectations you may not want to fulfill - i.e. that you will always bail the situation out. Hard talks are needed. Your mother, you, your brother, and the doctor (or an intermediary like a therapist for the family or social worker) need to discuss what happens if your brother does get the trach and is total care for everything. ALS is terminal and you are right to belabour that point. Everyone in the picture of the terminally ill patient needs to be realistic (yet also positive) about the situation going forward.  
Yes, your brother can live with a trach for an indeterminate period of time. What quality of life does he desire? Is he enjoying his life currently? How about your mother, is she getting days off and does she feel comfortable with the knowledge that when it is her time to be taken care of, she may not have that nest egg nor the family caregivers (you) around her to aid her in her own ill health? What happens if you get sick or injured while you are unemployed and helping family? All of these things are important. Your therapist is right - this won't last forever. But it can go on for several years up to two decades in some cases - the trach just takes over breathing until the muscles of the body finally give up.  
I don't think you are wishing death to your brother but I do think you are going through a grieving process of your own right now - the life that could have been had, the stress on your family, and the prospect that this could go on for years. Decide what you are willing to do for your mother and brother first, talk it over with your therapist, talk it over with them, then help your mother plan for extra assistance - stuff like another caregiver, extra tools in the home to aid her in caring for your brother, a weekly housekeeper, a respite day off.
comment 2: Get your brother into long term care. My mother has MS and she is near the end stages at this point but 10 years ago I just could not do it anymore. I love my mom so much and having her in a place with people trained to care for her and her around other people with similar issues was the hugest weight off my shoulders.
comment 3: [deleted]
comment 4: My mom’s MS is so severe that it has greatly impacted her cognitive abilities. Although she was very hesitant to go into care at the time, it is her home now and she likes the companionship of other residents. I am her legal guardian, so I do a lot of communicating with the care facility, her dr and deal with her finances as well as visit her regularly. She also knew that I could not continue to care for her forever. I was in my mid twenties and a single mother of one child and full time in university. Now my brother has MS and lives with me so I am a full time care giver again. The difference is that he is much more independent and has a better prognosis for his illness trajectory than my mom did. We both know that if it ever comes to it, he will go into a home as well but I don’t foresee that need for a long time. He can’t work, but he takes care of himself otherwise so it works for us. 
I understand the guilt and resentment you are feeling. You can’t set yourself on fire to keep your brother warm. What has happened to him is an absolute tragedy but you are allowed to have a life too. As difficult as it is to consider going into long term care, I urge you to consider it an option as a family. I am sorry you are going through this but don’t forget these feelings are normal.
comment 5: I’m not entirely sure, but can you guys talk to the hospital social worker about care options? The economic and mental toll on you and your mom is huge, see what caregiving options might be available through the state (depending where you live of course).
comment 6: I just came to say I understand and deal with something similar. You’re not a horrible person- this is very difficult to deal with. I wish nothing but the best for you, your mother and your brother. Blessings.
comment 7: Consider this: if you can get through school to a degree and move on to a career that allows you to make decent money, you could then provide for him monetarily and support your mother in a way that does not impede your ability to lead the life you want.
If he could live for years, that might mean five but it might also mean twenty-five! Or even more! He could potentially outlive your mother. 
You are in a crap situation where trying to stand your ground and work for your future (which could also benefit both brother and mom) will cause a lot of bad feelings all around.
What you can do is square away help for your mom while you are in school. There are possible resources that you can harness to make this possible, though it will take effort on your part to make it so prior to leaving. In case you have not checked out this possible resource for volunteer in-home help and apply for grants to assist your mom financially while you are in school.
I do not envy you and I'm so sorry you and your mom and brother find yourselves in this position. I wish you strength and fortitude to help you make the best choices for your own mental health and future self.
Edit: spelling
comment 8: [deleted]
comment 9: Oh sorry if those were only for CA! I didn't look hard enough.
Your brother and mother will call on you so long as you respond. You need to break out of it through force of will. If you don't, you will become what you fear. 
You can prepare your family and help get them established with alternate caregiver sources, and give yourself a timeline to leave. Choose a career that will allow you to make decent money and help them both long term.
comment 10: As hard as it will be, you & your mom have got to start trusting the nursing staff that are hired to take care of your brother.  I know that he is the one that doesn’t trust them, but it’s you or your mom (or both of you) who come flying to the rescue every time he yells. These are medical professionals who have been trained for the job at hand.  Just because he had an incident doesn’t mean they are all incompetent.  
Explain to your brother that your mom can’t keep doing the work that they are suppose to be doing.  She’s too exhausted, mentally and physically.  Tell him that he’s going to have to let them take care of him while mom rests. He’s not a child. He can do it.  And that you are returning home, because you have to return to your job (or whatever). And then do it!  He won’t like it at first and will probably kick up a fuss. But stick it out and he will see that they know what they’re doing. That will be a major milestone for both of you.
And I’m not sure why you come home every time he’s hospitalized.  I take that back.  I would come home, but once they were sure he was going to make it, I would go back home.  You may only be gone a day or two. Your mom has plenty of hired help to get him home and settled back in. That’s their job, let them do it.
Neither of you can continue at the pace you’re going. You will start losing things, like your job, your girl, etc.  Your mom will lose her health and possibly prematurely her life.  All for something that can be changed, although it will be hard.  But it will be worth it in the end.
comment 11: I don't have advice for you so much as I want to say what you're feeling is normal and expected. It's not selfish to feel this way. Wishing you peace and strength.
comment 12: Have you talked to your mom about moving him to a home, especially if he gets a trach? You have every right to live your life and not spend all your time caring for your brother. Of course you love him and your mom and want to help, but you shouldn’t be expected to sacrifice everything for it. Perhaps you can talk to your mom about scheduling time when you go to help her every other weekend or something. Why have you been there for weeks or months when there’s your mom and a caregiver? They should be enough for the majority of the time. And some may think I sound cold saying this, but you shouldn’t be expected to drop everything every time he goes to the hospital. My husband had numerous hospital stays before we moved in with his parents that they didn’t travel for. There wasn’t really a need for them to. I also didn’t expect them to drop everything to help unless they wanted to or I was desperate, and even now his care falls on me. They mostly help by keeping an eye on our son. 
It really sucks your brother has ALS and is going downhill. It really sucks that it’s terminal. But you don’t need to put your whole life on hold when he has caregivers. Help is good when you can, but live your life.
comment 13: I understand your sentiments.
comment 14: Boundaries boundaries boundaries. Taking care of a loved one is so hard but the phrase ""you cant pour from an empty cup"" should be the one phrase all caregivers should remember. You can still be apart of your brother's life to the point where it doesn't effect yours as negatively. Even if its something as simple as just saying ""no I cant today"" if your mother needs help. If your brother is adamant about pushing thru, maybe have a candid (but very forward) conversation w him on how it will effect the both of you? 1 on 1 caregiving truly is a team effort. Best of luck to you & keep at it...I know you're tired of hearing it but your family IS lucky to have you.

"A tribute to caregivers The whole concept of caregiving was completely foreign to me; the idea of someone making huge personal sacrifices to provide ongoing care for another adult was something I’d never encountered in my 29 years. 
All that changed when my friend Sal was diagnosed with Glioblastoma, a deadly form of brain cancer. I was with him throughout his battle and witnessed first-hand the stress, chaos and exhaustion experienced by his younger brother and primary caregiver. Sal’s many friends were quick to offer help, and some even took the initiative to bring food or to visit, but even these acts of kindness ultimately became another source of stress because they were so difficult to manage. 
Always a creative thinker, Sal knew there had to be a better way. He’d say “There’s got to be an app for this.” What if you could bring your friends and family together into a private app and use it to share important updates, messages, or requests for a helping hand? Friends could volunteer to help out with meal delivery, giving a ride, or just stopping by to visit, making these acts of kindness much easier to coordinate. He even came up with a name for the app: Friends Indeed.
Unfortunately, Sal lost his fight to GBM, but his passion for Friends Indeed was not forgotten. I decided to carry on Sal’s vision and build the app in his honor. I’m proud to announce that Friends Indeed is now available for free on Apple and Android devices. I truly believe Friends Indeed will make life easier for family caregivers and give them some well deserved relief. 
If you’re a caregiver, or you know someone who is, I ask that you please give Friends Indeed a try. Here’s a 60 second video that shows how it works: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjUwL6l6cVs&t=","comment 1: I think this is a lovely idea!  Having been a secondary caregiver, I would have lived to have had this app to help coordinate care.
comment 2: This is a great idea!

"Anyone have any luck with any GPS tracking apps or services? My father is in assisted living but he still goes out for walks on his own. Lately we've run into some problems (too complicated to get into, but he isn't getting lost) and the home wants me to get him a GPS tracker so we can know where he's going.
I looked it up on Google and it looks like there are lots of services that you can buy a wearable GPS tracker that uses mobile data and pay a monthly fee and you can track people no problem! Unfortunately my father will not wear any of these items (necklace, bracelet, he won't even wear his medic alert bracelet, I've literally put it on him, begging him to keep it for his own safety and he just gives me a dirty look and removes it) and even the sneaky shoe sole trackers are a no go because he wears flip flops anytime the weather allows it. However he always has his phone on him, and he even keeps it charged! Yay, I was hoping that since he already has a device that can be tracked that the phone company would offer a service for GPS tracking, but apparently they dont (why not? Other companies are using the exact same tech and charging $60/month, why wouldn't the phone company want to get in on that?).
So I suppose I'm stuck using a GPS tracking app installed on the phone, so I figured I'd see if anyone else here has anything to say (good or bad) about apps or services that they've used. I'm happy to pay as long as it's going to get the job done.","comment 1: Checkout life360. I haven't used it but it gets brought up on parenting subs a lot. It looks like you can location share recent and current location as well as receive alerts about low battery.
comment 2: Ditto on life 360. Until my relative could not go anywhere on his own we used it to track him to the library and back. Very good service.
comment 3: Thanks looks like it has a trial so I'll give that a shot.

"Vascular Dementia - Possibly? My dad has not been diagnosed with dementia, but he is in his early 70's with type 2 diabetes and has been around 300-350 lbs (at \~6' tall) for a few decades. He had a double bi-pass heart surgery about a year ago (should have been a triple but they did what they could). He's had some simple memory issues for quite a few years (like repeating himself often) which I didn't think was a good sign, but had chalked it up to aging. 
I now suspect that he may have vascular dementia as he recently (in the past 3 weeks or so) has been very confused and paranoid with intense delusions and visual/auditory hallucinations. It started one day when he left the house in his car. He got about a block away, got confused, turned around and went home. He knew something was off so he called his GP and my mom took him to see the nurse practitioner that day. They did blood work and didn't find anything unusual. They also did a CT scan and didn't see any signs of stroke, but the report noted diffuse atrophy with nonspecific white matter changes most likely indicating microvascular disease. The report advised that he see a neurologist immediately, but the NP wanted to get his psychosis under control first. About a week or so after the initial appointment they prescribed him Seroquel - 25mg/day. I don't think the 25 mg was very effective, so about a week after that they upped it to 50 mg/day. 
His mental capacity has taken a rapid decline in the last 3 weeks and he fears that most of his friends and family are plotting against him. He believes he is being recorded or being listened to through all of his smart devices. He wants to cut the cable and destroy his cell phone and bluetooth speaker. His emotions are severely heightened. Also, I've noticed a significant change in his ability to text. Three weeks ago he was texting me full sentences and now he's only capable of 1-2 word choppy texts with a ton of emojis. In the middle of the night last night he sent me about 50 texts in total in a span of 2 hours (I didn't respond to any of them as I was sleeping). None of the texts made much sense, but he seemed agitated with my sister. 
Is this typical of someone with vascular dementia (or dementia in general)? Has anyone else here experienced this with a loved one? How do you navigate texting with someone who is suddenly mentally impaired? I obviously love him and want him to know that, but I also don't want to upset him accidentally. I live about 2 hours drive away from him, so I can't visit as often as I'd like. Also, as of recently, he will not answer the cell phone when me or my mom call him even though he's aware that we're calling.
As a side note, I just learned yesterday that his father (my grandfather) was schizophrenic, but died of cancer in his 50s or 60s (before I was born). How likely is it that this is late-onset schizophrenia or a possible adverse medication interaction?
My dad is seeing a geriatric psychiatrist this Thursday, but any input is appreciated! He's also seeing his urologist on Tuesday since he had a UTI in December (in case this is relevant to anyone). Thank you for any input/responses! This sucks :(","comment 1: Gosh, that sounds rough. I'm so sorry.
I think most people here aren't in a position to say ""yep, that's dementia."" Reddit isn't a great diagnostic tool. However, I can say that I saw (and still sometimes see) lots of those behaviours in my own mum who struggles with vascular dementia. And yet, the rapid onset of your dad's symptoms strikes me as peculiar (hers developed over a much longer period). Also, there are loads of things (as simple as an infection that can clear up with some antibiotics) that can create those kinds of symptoms. So for now, it's tough to say. Make sure you ask lots of questions when he sees his doctors, and don't be afraid to reach out to them in confidence before or after your dad visits. Although doctors won't be able to give you info about your dad without his explicit consent, you can certainly give info to his doctors.
On the journey to my mum's diagnosis, and also in seeking help for care after she was diagnosed, having really detailed accounts of her symptoms was helpful. While you wait for your dad's doctors to do what they need to do, maybe you can concentrate on doing this work? You could also confirm that your dad has a POA set up so that if you and your family do need to act on his behalf, you're in a position to do so. If he doesn't have a POA set up, look into your legal options ASAP. Some things become impossible after diagnosis. I'd also suggest checking in with your mum. For every worry you have, she likely has just as many that are exacerbated by being with your dad full time. Encourage her to reach out to pals, and volunteer to hang out with your dad while she's away so she doesn't have to worry about him. If she doesn't have close friends or family she can talk to, see if you can help connect her with a support group. A lot of people feel the need to tough it through the hard stuff in life, but self care is really important, and will become exponentially so if it turns out he does have dementia. 
It's really hard not to fret when the possibility of dementia is on the table. Of course, we are all different, but focussing on what I could do (rather than simply worrying) helped me be the best I could for my mum. I'm sure there are other things you can do, beyond what I've just suggested, so if you find yourself stuck in worry then I'd encourage you to think about how you can act.
And do come back here to talk if you feel the need. Worrying and feeling alone sucks. We can all listen and offer ideas when possible. 
Good luck, and hugs.

comment 5: Well, quick update.. my dad was Baker Acted today since he was threatening suicide. He was taken to the hospital in hand cuffs after fighting with the police.

"Early onset dementia? I have MCI. My husband and teen daughter’s (and MY) concerns. Thoughts? I’m 49 years old, 50 this year. Below I’m copy pasting my husband and teen daughter’s observations about my rapid decline in memory and thinking skills (past 3 months or so). I’ve seen a neurologist, diagnosis of MCI, getting full workup. Labs are being done to rule out another cause such as something metabolic or vitamin deficiency, etc. 
In the meantime, I’m getting some real anxiety about this. I’m very self-aware of what’s happening and it’s destroying my sense of dignity and making me avoid talking to people because I ramble and stutter and can’t find the right words and it is humiliating. 
I’m having MRIs today for Brain/head/cervical spine (I’ve been having cervical radiculopathy so neurologist is checking that out too, just in case). 
Side note: my mother has dementia, she is 82 but the signs were very obvious in her 70s. Not sure if this matters. 
My Questions before the copy/paste: 


Do the observations below sound at all similar to anyone you know with dementia? Esp “early onset”? Regardless of cause…


Is it possible that decline this severe and rapid could be due to vitamin deficiency or something like that? I mean I hope so, but reading through this below it seems just, kinda more than that. But I don’t know. 


If I am dealing with any kind of early onset dementia, is there a chance the brain MRI will possibly show changes so we can aggressively proceed and have something to work with/get answers/help?


Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, I know it’s long but it would be so helpful. I’m very eager to learn all I can about this and would be so grateful to hear what those who are familiar with it all to share their ideas and experiences!
Husband and 17yo daughter's notes, I told them to be brutally honest, that it would not hurt my feeliings. I'm grateful they took the time:
-----------------------------------------------
(My name) cognitive/severe short-term memory problems (observations from my husband, with input from our teenage daughter, in their own words)
These have been noticeable for roughly 3 months but have been rapidly getting much worse over the past few weeks.
1) Severe short-term memory loss. She will do something, and 30 seconds later will ask if she did that thing. She’ll forget something someone says and ask the same question w/o realizing it. Repeatedly. Or she will make the same comment over and over in the same conversation. 
2) Inability to continue a thought if interrupted
3) Will recall conversations from previous week, but act as though they just happened.
4) Conversations that just happened, she will repeat as though they were her idea & it had never been discussed.
5) Repeat requests rapidly without giving time for ""requestee"" to respond. Her frustration grows.
6)  She often starts to speak and then stops mid-sentence. When we ask what she was going to say, she can’t remember. 
7) Lots of pauses while speaking because she forgets names of objects/people/etc. Stutters a bit while trying to think of the word, then uses a general term like “thing” (“Will you go get me the..the…the…you know the thing…that thing..” while pointing or gesturing)
8) Randomly interjects conversations with comments or questions not relevant to the topic being discussed. 
9) Loses things several times a day, even things she was just handling a few minutes before she loses it. Forgets what she is doing shortly after she begins doing it. 
10) Repeatedly reminds people of something in the same conversation with no awareness she’s doing so.
11) Easily frustrated and frustrated with herself the more she forgets. 
12) At the grocery store recently, she kept losing track of what she was doing, where she was, very confused. She also kept “losing” her grocery cart; daughter (17yo) had to remind her to get it, and it would be on a different aisle (with her purse still in it). 
13) The other night she got out of her car. Later couldn’t find her keys. A few hours later we discovered she had left the car on, engine running for several hours. 
14) Last but certainly not least – she’s very aware of what is happening and it’s heartbreaking. Brought concerns to her longtime PCP, who referred her to a neurologist. Referral note said “mild cognitive impairment.”
15) Neurology appt which I (husband) attended with her: she did not pass the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). It was not severely under the “normal” cutoff (it was 24/30), but additionally, after about an hour of talking w/ the neuro, she did say my wife has “mild cognitive impairment.” However, because she is college educated, highly intelligent, etc. I believe this score is sinister. 
16) Neurologist told us that it is not safe for my wife to drive for the time being/foreseeable future. She understands but that seems to be a huge red flag to us. 
----------------------------
Thank you to anyone who read this long post...any input would be so appreciated.","comment 1: I'm most definitely not a doctor, but have been dealing with similar problems. (F51 and on medical leave from grad school bc my brain quit working.) 
Two things your doctor may or may not have considered are checking your thyroid levels and also estrogen replacement if you're peri- or post-menopausal. Apparently about 10% of women get really hammered by menopause, especially in terms of memory and cognitive processing. Hormone replacement can help. Using only estrogen is safer in terms of cancer. 
I'll be thinking of you and hoping for a good prognosis. If you want to talk to someone in a similar situation, please do get in touch. I know I've really struggled with the idea that I may not be ""me"" anymore and worrying about my children if it goes badly. I'd be more than happy to lend an ear.
comment 2: I'm so very sorry to hear you are having the same problems, and how it's affecting your life! :(
About the thyroid problems, they are definitely checking those - took a bunch of blood tests yesterday, that's included. The TSH (?) from earlier tests was fine, but they're diving deeper into that with the new labs anyway, just to be sure. I do have persistent hypercalcemia, it's inching up bit by bit too, but no idea how or why. Re; menopause, that's a good idea to consider - I had a hysterectomy 2 years ago, but kept my ovaries. I don't know if it could be that or not, I don't have hot flashes or the other symptoms other than memory loss and the MCI, but I do know different people will show different things, and it's worth checking. Thank you for the idea.
I sadly relate to the feeling of ""not being me"" anymore, I sure don't feel like me. I feel ""stupid"" (not beating on myself, it's just such a rapid fall into it), and also my poor husband and children - this is NOT easy on them, and I am conscious of that, and fearful of things getting worse. 
I appreciate so much your sharing, and again, I'm so very sorry for your struggles. Also, thanks for the offer of getting in touch, and that offer extends to you as well. We aren't alone!
comment 3: Search up the Bredesen Protocol!
comment 4: If this method has worked for you or someone you love, I am really happy for you. 
It's not a cure though. While vigorous exercise and a healthy diet probably won't do any harm, Bredesen's claims lack scientific validation. He also promotes ideas that have been discredited (such as claiming most people are gluten intolerant).
It's incredibly tempting to believe in miracle cures and there are plenty of people out there willing to take your money. Some of them may even believe what they're selling. But the horrible truth is that there is no miracle cure for any of the multitude of causes for dementia and cognitive impairment.
comment 5: Just to let you know, I've personally talked to many folks that have been diagnosed with MCI, Early Alzheimer's and have gained back their memory. They've posted their experiences... Etc. I've messaged, and have been contacted. These people are real... This isn't a money-grab. 
&#x200B;
So would you rather see your loved one decline, or would you at least try this protocol which does have some benefit?
&#x200B;
Say what you want.
comment 6: You may find this of interest:
/r/earlyonsetdementia
I recommend you check the sidebar there for a link to the Bredersen Research, Findings and suggested Regime.
comment 7: Thank you SO MUCH. I will go check it out right now!
comment 8: You are most Welcome!
comment 9: YES YES YES, so glad you mentioned Dr. Dale Bredesen. (at least that's what I think you meant? So glad his findings are getting out more into the general public... rightfully so)
comment 10: Agreed, I try to live by them.
comment 11: [deleted]
comment 12: Wow, that IS interesting, I had no idea! Thank you so much for the information. I fear the search for causes of what's going on is going to be an uphill battle, and I can use all the info I can get. Thanks again!
comment 13: Wouldn't it be great if HRT treatment helped prevent or even halted A in its tracks. Big hugs from me xx
comment 14: YES it sure would. I'm trying to research all the ways this could be happening to me, and it's absolutely overwhelming. :(
Some of my labs are back, but they are being held until tomorrow in my patient portal. It's at the doctor's discretion I believe. My other doctors I see don't put a hold on me seeing labs but I'm not upset, just really really want to see if anything at all came back abnormal so it's something fixable. I'm terribly anxious. 
Thank you for the kind words and hugs. :)
comment 15: First off, I have great news for you and your family. Look up the doctor, ""Dr. Dale E Bredesen"" He has literally reversed cognitive decline in 100 clinical patients diagnosed, truly -- with Early Stage AD, MCI, etc. He has also published a book called, ""The End of Alzheimers"" back in 2017. (I would strongly suggest buying this book)
He has found the root cause of cognitive decline is lack of vitamins/minerals, healthy fats, hormone imbalances, heavy metals (if you have amalgam fillings, replace them ASAP with a   S.M.A.R.T dentist. Conventional dentists just drill them out. Amalgam is at least 50% mercury by weight, and is a known neurotoxin. S.M.A.R.T dentists use the right protocol to safely remove those fillings. Wait three months after removing, then chelate orally by using the Dr. Cutler Protocol)
&#x200B;
In order to see the root cause of your memory impairment, you need testing done by a Bredesen trained specialist. If you're curious to find out more, look up this group on facebook, ""The Bredesen Protocol Unaffiliated""
&#x200B;
I have genuinely talked to people on this group that were diagnosed, made lifestyle changes, and their memory was basically normal.
&#x200B;
Youtube Dr. Bredesen. Buy the book. Join the Unaffilated facebook page. The page is a great place to ask questions, see others' stories on improvement.
&#x200B;
EDIT: One last thing, the subreddit ""early onset"" the redditor placed below... Looking through it, these folks are on the right track. Supplements, sleeping at least 8 hours or more. What the Bredesen Protocol does, is compound all of this together. Dementia isn't just a one shot, fix all. You have to see what th root cause is... Whether or not you are APOE4 (which definetly contributes to early onset. If you are APOE4, going on a keto diet will be extremely beneficial) Fat is key. Especially if you're APOE4. If you wish to check your status, 23andme offers a health aspect. Even if you find you're not APOE4 on 23andme, you can grab it's raw file, and upload it to a site called Promethus - there it'll show if you're APOE3, APOE2, etc. Finding out your APOE is an important step. Different diet perhaps.
&#x200B;
Asking questions on the Bredesen Protocol Unaffiliated will clarify any questions you have.
Start small. Don't panic, you got this!
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
(And no, this isn't me trying to make a sale. I have a family member I've been concerned about, and have been really taking the time to look further.)
comment 16: Thank you so much for the detailed information, I really do appreciate it!
comment 17: I'm so sorry that you're going through something so frightening. I am thinking of you, and hoping that your prognosis is good!
I just thought I'd leave a comment because of how similar this feels to my father's situation. Doctors believed that he was suffering from a type of FTD that cropped up in his 50s. I was in my late teens when his symptoms appeared, and my mother and I were in the same position as your daughter and husband are today. I remember that as a family  we felt very lonely in our journey - there were so few people in a situation us. If you or your family would ever like someone to talk to, feel free to drop me a message.
Thinking of you all, and hoping this is nothing more than a quick bump in the road!
comment 18: I'm so sorry you had to go through this with your father, that is heartbreaking. Also one thing I know is how damn HARD it is for immediate family - spouses, children, etc.  I am self-aware of what is happening and I know how frustrating it is dealing with me. I am not at all being pitiful or looking for reassurance when I say that - it's the truth - and I don't think I could handle it - dealing with my husband being like this. I mean, of course I would handle it, I love him. But it's just so damn hard on all of us, in different ways of course.
Neurologist called an hour ago, 3rd call today - wants me in her office 1st thing in them morning, instead of our scheduled follow up two weeks from now. I don't know what that means. Hopefully something shows up and it will be a REVERSIBLE thing. 
I will keep updating here. Besides my husband and kids, I'm talking to no one about this. Not until we know exactly what's happening. 
Thank you so much for sharing, and again, so sorry about your dad. :(
"
"Help her watch tv My mother has dementia and can’t work the television.  Usually my dad is around and can help her find something to watch, but he does all of the errands so he is sometimes out.  She panics when he is out and it would help her a lot if she could watch tv and relax a bit.  She doesn’t watch tv often and she’s quite old-fashioned, so she doesn’t like much of what’s on.  My husband is incredibly patient and has created a very detailed sheet of instructions for her.  At this point she should be able to turn it off and on, check specific channels that he wrote down the number for, and sometimes channel surf.  This is a real struggle, but as long as we review it with her often, she can do it.  However, most of the time she can’t find something to watch.  She can’t use the guide.  Because the shows she likes aren’t usually on when she tries, she thinks the tv is broken and quickly gives up.  I can’t believe there is nothing to help with this.  We have them on our Netflix account and my dad uses it to watch shows with her when he’s around (she loves Hallmark Christmas movies and he watches one with her every single night), but she definitely can’t use it herself.  I would love for her to be able to use it because then there would always be something she could watch at any time of day.  Is there any way to set it up to just play a list of shows we program in for her?  Or get an Alexa or something to help her find something to watch?  I just feel like there has to be a way to do this.
TLDR: Is there any program that can be used to help a senior with pretty severe dementia watch tv?","comment 1: I'd burn a few DVDs with a series of her favorite shows, connect it to the tv, and set it to repeat play.  When Dad comes home, he could change the TV to whatever he wishes.  When he goes, he could set it to that input and it would just cycle through those episodes for her.
comment 2: That’s probably the best option.  She really wants to be able to do it herself, but it sounds like that won’t be possible.  I just wish that Alexa or something could do this for her, so she could feel like she was in control without having to navigate to the right menu, etc.
comment 3: This is her doing it for herself.  It's just a different feed.  On, off, volume, all of that is completely controllable.  A simplified tv-only remote might be called for.
comment 4: I’m just re-reading these now and noticing that I didn’t even thank you.  I’m sorry.  I really appreciate the advice, thank you.
comment 5: You're welcome, and no worries.  This is a rough road to walk.
comment 6: My dad has a universal remote called Flipper (available on Amazon). It's very easy to use and only has six buttons (on/off, mute, volume up, volume down, channel up, channel down). You can also program it to select favourites so she can skip a bunch of channels. 
I also made a guide and printed it in colour with an image of the remote and arrows and text pointing to each button to describe what each button does. I made sure to use one or two words for each button to make it easy to read.
Hopefully that will help.
comment 7: She’s good with this remote currently, although I will keep that in mind for sure.  She has a guide like you describe.  It’s just multi-step processes aren’t really an option.  She can’t track time anymore, so even though we’ve written down “Dr. Phil on channel 3 at 5pm,” she expects it to always be Dr. Phil if she goes to channel 3.  She can get to that channel (using the guide like you describe), but she can’t understand why it won’t be playing the show she wants.
comment 8: When I came back to read through the suggestions again I realized that I never thanked you.  I’m sorry, my mind has been elsewhere.  Thank you, I really appreciate your help.
comment 9: No problem. You're going through a lot and I can relate. There's also a clock that might help her with time: https://www.alzstore.com/day-clock-with-reminders-p/0045.htm. You can probably find it on Amazon for less.
comment 10: This website has lots of products that look like they could be really helpful!  Thanks for sharing.
comment 11: My husband could no longer handle a remote or navigating menus.  I took a iPad and locked it into the Netflix app.  Even though he had never used an iPad touching what you want became very easy for him in about a week.
comment 12: Oh that’s a great idea, thank you!
comment 13: I use Netflix and it automatically plays the next show after. You could also use YouTube TV or create a playlist of movies on YouTube.
comment 14: The issue is that she can’t navigate to Netflix or YouTube.  Dad can set it up for her and leave it to play, but I’m trying not to add to his tasks (he already does everything, he’s amazing).  Unfortunately I live five hours away.
comment 15: I’m just noticing now that I didn’t even thank you earlier.  I’m sorry.  Thank you so much for your suggestion.
comment 16: I have a Google Home Mini and it's connected to a Chromecast on the living room TV. I can tell Google to play something on YouTube or Netflix (though I don't usually do this option) on the living room TV. It turns the tv on and starts plays video. For YouTube, I think you can tell Google to skip to the next video.
I got it originally to help my grandmother, but she's never been big into tech and doesn't try. She knows the Google Home Mini can tell the weather, so she'll ask me to ask Google the weather etc.
Looks like for Netflix, I had to specify what show exactly for Google to start on the TV. I just tried Hallmark movie or play Netflix, but it didn't like those commands. And it may all be connected thru my phone, so if your mother doesn't have a smart phone, I'm not sure if it'd work, but it may. At Christmas time, Walmart had a $35 set of Google Home Mini and Chromecast together. I know I paid more for that for the original 2 I had.

comment 19: That’s a really good idea!  My dad just got a new tv and now is using the older big screen as a monitor for the computer, so she could definitely watch on that.  My husband has Remote Desktop set up on their computer so he can help fix any issues, so I think we are basically all set up for this.  I wish there was a way she could control the tv on her own because she so wants to, but I think I need to accept a different solution.  I love this idea.  Thank you.

"Grandfather with Alzheimer’s This is a long rant/plea for advice/comfort
My moms father, my grandpa, has been a huge part of my life since well before I can even remember. Him, and my grandma (who recently passed away due to cancer) were always there for every event. Every soccer, basketball, track and field event, band event, you name it they were there. They lived quite close to us in town, only about 10 minutes away, on a farm they built themselves. They were always incredibly independent. 
My grandpa was diagnosed in 2013 and my grandma passed away in 2018. Since her passing, things have gotten increasingly difficult. He lives full time in my families home. Comprised of me, my dad, my mom, my younger brother, and now my grandpa. He attends an Alzheimer’s day care during the week, from 8 am to around 4 pm. VTA offers rides to and from usually. But whenever he’s home, the stress in the household sky rockets. My dad isn’t very supportive of my mom, and does the bare minimum in relation to help around the house, helping my grandpa, or helping my mom with emotional support. My younger brother and I are left to pick up the slack, but we’re both in school most of the time. My mom does most of the care now, and his care is getting harder by the day. The only things he does on his own now are using the restroom and eating. He needs help with everything else, including drinking. He has to be forced to drink, it’s at least a 20-30 minute process for a small glass of water or juice. He doesn’t do anything without prompting or assistance. He has to ask where the restroom is, where he’s supposed to sit (we’ve built a “game room” of sorts where he has access to our large backyard, puzzles, couches, a TV, etc) if the food placed directly in front of him is his, even down to hygiene like changing his undergarments. 
All of this has taken such a toll on family dynamics and life. There always has to be someone with him, we have to schedule our entire lives around his care. It’s round the clock, there never seems to be a break or a moment where we’re not doing something, either working, going to school, and then caring for him at home. The only person who doesn’t help out for the most part is my dad. 
I love my grandpa and I know the reason I “blame him” isn’t because it’s his fault or that’s where the blame should lie... I’m just frustrated that this is where our lives have ended up. My mom makes comments about when he’s going to pass, and “hopefully in the next year” and about putting him in a home. I know to some extent these are just “jokes” but it’s painful. My grandparents were always there for us, but when, out of the 5 years we’ve had such a high level of burden, between my grandmothers illness and my grandfathers, does the stress go away? Does it ever? 
His behavior as of 3 years ago encroached on being completely inappropriate. At my grandmothers chemotherapy appointments, he started to make fun of those who had cancer in the room. He makes racist and derogatory comments in public. He makes sexually suggestive comments and behavior toward my mother and occasionally me, and does so to strangers as well. His offensive behavior is always called out and he’s told that it’s inappropriate, but he just laughs, because he thinks everything is a joke. 
I’m at my wits end and so is my mom. (I’ve taken up the mantle of emotional support for my mother). We’re not ready, emotionally, to put him in a home, but we also don’t want to throw his behavior onto someone else. We’re also terrified of possibilities of abuse, either done to him, or him being sexually suggestive with women of all ages, nurses or other patrons of care facilities. 
At this point I just don’t know where to turn. My boyfriend, nor my friends, fully understand where I’m coming from because they’ve never experienced anything like this. And talking it through with my mom just brings more stress and anguish on her part, something I try to avoid. 
I just don’t know what to do, or what to suggest, or how to help myself through any of this. We’re still grieving my grandmother, and it feels like we grieve for my grandpa every day, day in and day out and caring for him has been nothing but a reminder of that pain. 
Has anyone else gone through this? Does anyone have an idea on how to handle any of this? What were the emotions surrounding putting your family member in a home, if you ever did? How did you emotionally support yourselves, while also supporting others? I know therapy is an option, but it’s not something my mom will participate in, let alone my dad, and my younger sibling has turned to other means of “therapy”, and not in any appropriate ways. It’s also time and monetarily consuming, which id feel guilty for. 
I just don’t know what to do or where to turn. Any advice, personal experiences, or comfort is more than appreciated.","comment 1: I’ll start by saying your mom’s comments are a coping mechanism.  Everything else you are feeling is perfectly normal when you are under stress like this.  Don’t argue with your Grandfather, try to deflect and change the subject when he says things that are inappropriate.  Hang in there.  My kids went thru the same things when my mom lived with us for 5 years.  I think they regret not being kinder to their Grandma.  Good luck.
comment 2: We are in almost the exact situation with my grandma and it exactly is a coping mechanism. my boss told me the other day ""i feel bad for laughing at the stories of your grandma, but you just make it sound so light hearted"". Well, if we didn't laugh we would be crying. it's devasting she isn't the person she was, but we are trying our best to give her the care she needs. my mom stays home full time with her and my aunt and I provide relief. it's a constant balancing act of schedules to make sure someone is always with her.
comment 3: Is there any kind of Alzheimers support group in your area? They gave us the idea to get my father's doctor to refer my father to the local health authority and they assigned a case manager social worker who gave us information on a lot of local resources.
We have hired nurses part time to help with my father and we also have someone visit him daily to take his medication. The case worker said that my father will have to go to somewhere with memory care very soon.
The sad reality is that the brain is dying with Alzheimers and that things will keep going downhill. Please reach out to any sources you can get for help. It sounds like you are reaching the limit of your capacity to deal with this yourselves.
Take care of yourselves, too. This is an awful disease.
comment 4: My dad is currently in late stage alzheimer's and he lives in a memory care facility. Dementia, sadly, is so common now that there are facilities who cater only to residents coping with dementia. My dad was very flirtatious and often inappropriate with care staff. But they are trained to manage those behaviors, which are not uncommon with this disease. I promise you that no matter how bad or embarrassing you perceive his behavior to be, caregivers have seen worse! 
My siblings and I are all about the TEAM approach to our journey with this disease. We ask for help any time we are overwhelmed. And currently we are working with a social worker ourselves. She is helping us find resources to help our dad be the best he can be and she is also helping us manage our health/emotions. I am sure there is some sort of local 'healthy aging' agency you could look into. 
I would also say that there is no shame in asking for help and at least contemplating finding a care facility for your dad. My dad has been in one for about 3 years now. He ADORES the people who take care of him and I have seen so many residents move there quite sad and isolated at first. But they blossom with the energy and attention they receive. They join social activities and make new connections. 
Send me a pm any time if you'd like to talk more - this is really hard stuff. But sharing our experiences helps us all. You are not alone. Hugs.
comment 5: Your Grandfather’s inappropriate behaviors are part of the disease, not something your Grandfather has any control over.  So he couldn’t stop doing it even if he tried.  But, as the disease progresses, that behavior will stop.  This is an ever changing disease.
It sure sounds like your family could use some help.  Contact your local Area on Aging (every county has one).  They will send out someone to evaluate your Grandfather and then make recommendations on ways to help you guys.  They may recommend an aide come in to help, or they may recommend him going into Memory Care.  They will also help explain financial help available.
I’m glad that you’re able to help your Mother cope with all of this.  It is a big big task taking care of someone with Alzheimer’s, once their disease progresses past a certain point.  Let her read what you wrote and the responses.  I’m sure she’s proud of you!
comment 6: Educate yourself about the process.  You Tube  Teepa Snow vignettes are very helpful.   Very short .  Watch as many as you can .   Not all will be relevant to you today .  Your grandfather will go thru stages.   I had great relief when I learned to enjoy each of my Mom's personalities.    As a young woman yourself you need to have a respite regularily and just be a teen.   Not everyone is capable of dealing with this disease.  Try not to think harshly of your dad.   Not everyone can be a caregiver. It ""ain't""  easy and somecare afraid of what they don't understand. 
As to placing your grandfather in a care home,  your parents need to evaluate the cost. If your grandfather has the resources you should definitely  consider.  You can visit.   My Mom is in a care home has not been able to feed herself for 4 years   not walked in 3 years.  Left arm contracted last year. Both arms contracted the last 4 months  .  Cannot move head from left to right. Blind.   Sorry to describe this to a young girl . It is the physical side of alzheimer.
Remember your grandparents would want you to live your life well
comment 7: Two short comments:

The behaviors your grandfather is exhibiting (inappropriate comments, sexually suggestive) are caused by the disease. Alzheimer's is a disease that destroys brain cells, which often causes someone's ""filter"" to drop. I'm sure he doesn't want to be that way.
Putting a loved one in a nursing home is emotionally taxing and a decision not be taken lightly. But making the decision to put him in one doesn't make you or your family bad people, nor does it mean any of you have failed. The reality is that his needs have become greater than what can be cared for at home. A good nursing home (one with a dedicated memory-impaired wing) is equipped to handle those needs.

comment 8: These are a tool for hydration for dementia patients that hopefully will be on the market soon. Just posting a link for you to follow if you’re interested. https://blog.thealzheimerssite.greatergood.com/jelly-drops-release/
comment 9: You are doing a very tough thing and it is admirable that you are looking out for the well-being of your Grandpa while smartly recognizing that the current setup is not sustainable for your family. Talking to others who have been in your shoes is an excellent first step toward relief.
Some great advice has already been offered for how to enlist some experienced help outside of your family and get some respite from the stress - follow it. It’s so important to carve out some time to participate in the activities that restore your own well-being so that you have the strength you’ll need in the marathon ahead. 
All of the symptoms you’ve described for your Grandpa sound exactly like what we experienced with my dad in his last 4ish years. It was so very hard to see him in that state (knowing he had no control) and exhausting to always be on guard trying to protect him from hurting himself while buffering his constant inappropriate behavior toward others (especially everyone trying to care for him). My dad also had very scary paranoid delusions for a time and it was awful to think that he was living in such fear. It helped a bit to get educated on how to best communicate with a person who has dementia and finally accept that it was okay to use “therapeutic fibs” to comfort & redirect his worries.
There did come a time when we could no longer manage caring for Dad at home. By this time, he could no longer walk on his own, was on 24/7 highflow oxygen (which he would forget to wear and then pass out), and was totally incontinent. We were fortunate to find a “personal care home” near us with just 5 other patients and a rotating staff of loving professional caregivers who could help him without being devastated by the experience (as we family members now were). This allowed us to visit daily and return home afterward with peace of mind knowing he was in great hands. We also had great daily communication with the staff so we knew what was going on throughout the day even if we weren’t there physically.
Paying for this type of care is very expensive and difficult for most families. We were fortunate to have enough savings available to afford this place for the 6 months until he passed at age 86, but our plan if he had lived beyond the savings was to spend down until he qualified for Medicaid and do the best we could with those benefits (likely requiring a move to a larger memory care facility that would accept Medicaid rates). He was also a veteran with full military benefits for service-related disability, so we had another option to pursue there (our state’s nursing homes for veterans), if it came to that.
Wishing you strength & comfort.

"thanks for being there even though you didn't know :D Hey guys,
I wanted to thank you all for being here. I have posted from this account and another, and all night I remembered I’m not alone, that others have gone through this. I’m living at home with an overconfident father and a mother who defers to him in all things. She has no will, no poa, no plans, no waiting lists, no activities, no house modifications for safety, no geriatrician even. 
I had been planning to move out, to stop enabling them to ignore everything. I was going to call elder abuse/neglect before I left to make sure social workers got involved. Contrary to popular belief, they don’t care if a caregiver calls and asks for help, the patient has to call. It’s been very frustrating.
Yesterday I discussed at work and with my gaming group that I was thinking about calling them tomorrow instead of waiting because I really was afraid she’d get hurt before any changes were made. She has balance and movement issues. 
Last night she fell somehow, and couldn’t get up. She didn’t get hurt, but trying to get up hurt her. I was so furious the whole time dad was telling her to do things she didn’t understand to get off the floor. I kept seeing all the things I knew about from nursing school that would have made it easier to help her up that we didn’t have. Things that should have prevented falls in the first place. We had nobody to call, no assistive devices. She kept saying she’d discussed it with dad and would not be going to the hospital ever. Woman! Right now you have no choice in the matter if dad isn’t there! Cause she has no paperwork! 
I managed to mostly keep my mouth shut, waited 7 min past the deadline I’d set in my head and I finally called 911. Four awesome firemen showed up. They easily got her up and into a chair, not listening to her protests. I wished I’d called earlier, but I was still afraid of authorities stepping in. I AM still afraid of authorities stepping in. I want her wishes to be honored, but they refuse to take any action at all. Firemen actually didn’t do any cognitive assessment, so I needn’t have worried they’d take her away. Guess they pick old people up off the floor a lot!
Dad later stopped by my office to say goodnight and said thank you. I once again swallowed all the things I wanted to yell at him and said Make Changes. He nodded. He’s promised everything before. Even when I admitted I was suicidal living here with no security and no plans with all these towers waiting to collapse around us, NOTHING changed. We’ll see if anything happens now, but I’m not afraid to call now. 
Anyway, I wanted to write and thank you all for being the ghosts in my corner last night <3","comment 1: It's hard for families to make changes.  One thing I'd suggest - getting some help and support for yourself.  Even super temporary can make all the difference.  When I was driving in, knowing I was taking my father to the ER one way or the other, I called a crisis line to find out exactly what the steps would be.  Hearing them say I was doing the right thing regardless of the resistance from my father really bolstered me.
comment 2: wow that must have been so hard. that is a good idea, thanks.

"Question RE: Elder Care Alert Buttons We are looking into taking care of our grandmother and moving in, but I'd like a device that she can press or communicate through that would be linked to an App. Something that isn't quite a phone, but like those medical alert buttons, except something which instead of calling 911 would alert me in an App. Is there something like that?","comment 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/afd4g3/i_need_help_finding_a_good_life_alert_system/edy217h

comment 8: Dementia people lie the ability for tech early. Our doctor recommended a baby monitoring device with camera and voice. To help if she tries to get up at night. I work from home and she lives with us so hopefully they will work. Just ordered from amazon. We also have cameras in the house D-link or something you can view from a smart phone. Got them to monitor the cat when we were on vacation but better to have something Motrin activated. Used to have an alert button when she lived cross the country but the only time it rang was when she accidentally pressed it while doing dishes at the sink.
comment 9: Those medical alert buttons will contact you first, not 911. Or at least you can set them up that way. We have one for our mom and they call my sister first.

"Need advice on Power of Attorney/Alzheimers My grandma is turning 90 in July and her mental health is rapidly deteriorating. Shes a stubborn German lady who has been ridiculously independent her whole life. Still lives on her own, takes care of herself (mostly) and has a blind dog. Last year though her mind noticably started deteriorating with alzheimers and she forgets a lot of stuff. Constantly repeating, having same conversations over and over, explaining things she used to know. Some days are better than others and for now (with supervision) she still is getting by on her own. But likely not much longer...
For example, she got lost walking in the summer and was found at 10pm across town.  Sometimes smells of poo like she forgot to wash. Forgets to drink water all day long. Loses keys. Hides money in envelopes all over the house and forgets. Recently said robbers broke in and left $5000 in an envelope on her counter. Which turned out to be the money my mom was trying to help her find the week before. Was stashed under her bed and then not there next check in visit. 
My mom and her sister (my aunt) have been at war because they disagree what's best for her. My aunt is an absolute snot and hates the family. Never shows my grandma love. Always acts annoyed she is asked to do things. Wants to put her in a nursing home and said something's 'wrong with' grandma and needs a doctor. My mom laughed in her face over that. My aunt did not tell anyone in the family when my grandma got into an accident and lost her licence. 
On the other hand, my mom is a certified nurse and worked at a nursing home for years. She said that grandma has altimerz and there's nothing ""wrong"" with her. That it happens in old age. She has taken care of so many with it and wants my grandma to move in with her and my dad. She cares for my grandma, visits her all the time, takes her blind dog to the vet and actually cares for my grandma. Unlike my aunt. 
My aunt is being really vindictive and somehow illegally had my grandmas mail rerouted to her house instead.  My grandma lost her mind on my aunt bc now she doesnt get her own bills. Its important for her to maintain a routine. Checking the mail and walking to city hall to pay her bills has been a daily task for years. Now she doesnt even know what she owes. She demanded my aunt return the mail but my aunt ignores her calls, voicemails and refuses.
My grandma owns a second home (which I live in) and since she kept forgetting all three tenants were paying rent my mom has taken over the landlord duties and maintenance. Writes receipts so my grandma can see as keeps track of all her papers and constantly looking at the ones in her purse. 
After my grandma was found wandering, my mom put a Bell Smart Things tracker in my grandmas purse to keep tabs on where she is. My aunt found it, took it out and hid it in a box under papers in a cupboard. Thinking my mom would never find it. Then she put her own tracker on grandmas set of keys without saying a word.  My aunt changed the locks on my grandmas door and didnt tell or give my mom a spare key. My mom had to go make a copy for herself. 
Unfortunately, my grandma has made my awful aunt power of attorney when she dies as 'she is the oldest child' you know. That's the way they used to do it in Germany apparently.  When my grandma dies my aunt has admitted she wants nothing to do the properties,  wants to wash her hands of the family and she says she will sell it all. My grandma is very rich, likely has over a million dollars in the bank and two homes worth $700,000 each. Her Will states everuthing is to be split 50/50. To be ""fair"". 
My aunt had already admitted she won't let my grandma move in with her. Her house is too pretty and wants no part of washing, feeding and caring for an elderly person. Not to mention she's not even experienced or qualified. She at least sees that she's not the best person for it. Would rather put her in a nursing home and forget about her.
My mom wants my grandma to sign a Power of Attorney so she can have access and control to grandmas banking, bills and health care while shes alive.  POA for health care allows my mom to pay herself with some of my grandmothers funds for taking care of her as my mom will need to quit her current job to take care of her full time. 
My parents are selling their forever house to move into a ranch style home where theres a really nice plot of land with a chicken coop that grandma always wanted. No stairs. Her own in-law suite/bedroom. The blind dog (who loves my mom) will live there too. 
My mom is getting high blood pressure stressing as grandma has good days and bad days. Never know until you see her. She's worried grandma will refuse to sign the power of attorney with the lawyer. She is stubborn and might not understand. We dont want my aunt to trick grandma into signing the POA and tossing her in a nursing home. 
My mom booked a German speaking lawyer next week, which might help if he speaks to her in german, but I'm just wondering if there's any other tricks or approaches we have that my aunt cant fight. 
1) Can we take my grandma to court ordering the judge to give my mom POA if we can prove shes not fully sound of mind? 
2) Anything you might know? 
3) Anyone you know we could contact?","comment 1: This are not funny cat comic...

"Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy body/Alzheimers) Originally posted in r/AgingParents and someone suggested I post this here.
My dad (66) and I have never been close and I've always wanted to be. That's not really the point of this post, but it matters. He's uncomfortable talking about much of substance and always seems to feel ill at ease, like he isn't sure what's coming out of his mouth and not certain of where he is. He wants to make people laugh but not be laughed at. He's always been a proud man. I keep his jokes going even when they don't make sense, and our conversations are usually light. Sometimes though, his stress overwhelms him and he cries to me about what may or may not be real problems and I don't know what to say.
I live 1100 miles away, and my siblings found out last October that our dad was diagnosed 2 years ago with Lewy body dementia and Alzheimers. The only reason his wife told us was because he was hospitalized and they could no longer hide his symptoms. I just found out he was hospitalized again yesterday to have his meds readjusted. Late Sunday night, he tried to walk over to his neighbor's house because he was convinced he had been hired to manage a football team and he needed to be next door to start work. His wife tried to redirect him and he spoke angrily to her and pushed her. So now he's back in the hospital and I'm a wreck.
I'm going to call him but can somebody with more experience please help me know what to say to him? I always try to meet him where he is and act as if whatever he says is perfectly ordinary conversation. It's sad, but I can do that. It's his anguish that kills me. When he cries about not having any money and tells me he was robbed, what do I say? I have no idea what their finances are, and furthermore, I was told never to contradict someone with Alzheimers. Hell, my dad never liked being contradicted when he was healthy. I don't know how to comfort him. It seems impossible to get him off that track and it destroys me to know he's suffering and not be able to fix it.
Please help.","comment 1: I'm sorry. My Mom, 69, also has LB Dementia.
It's gut wrenching when they are scared, confused, afraid. They do not believe the truth, they can't. Their brain is misfiring every-which-way and has created stories to explain the flawed data and emotions, and nothing you can say can pull them ""out of their world.""
Deflection or therapeutic lying work best, but often don't work at all.
All you can do is make sure to acknowledge their feelings (you don't have to agree with the lie), for instance, ""I know you are scared mom, and think Dad is trying to kill you. I am here for you whenever you want to talk. I would never let anything happen to you. You can call me anytime."" Acknowledge their fear/pain is real (because it is) if not the situation causing it.
My poor Dad is the person I can't find many ways to help. He's taking care of her, everything, still works full time, refuses to let me move home to help. And she takes all her rage out him, and all her paranoid delusions revolve around him. I can see how deeply it wounds him, though he tries not to show it.
It's the worst. I wish I could help, but all I can really do is say, I understand. Hang in there.
comment 2: Thank you so much. This helps. I’m sorry your mom is struggling with this cruel disease too. Mainly I feel lost. We never had a great connection to begin with, and I hate that I don’t know what to tell him when he’s afraid. It’s hard being so far away when all I can do is listen to him cry, can’t hug him or anything.
comment 3: Hang in there OP, I'm a caregiver who specializes in Dementia and alzheimers care. Here are some tips, you're right dont disagree, dont fight just redirect and comfort. If you're father starts crying , try to comfort and listen. Many people just want to be listened to , let him know everything will be ok and that you're there for him. Ask if hes pain or if he wants to go for a walk or to the bathroom, sometimes the freakouts could be a signal of something else he might need. If he gets angry try to redirect his attention and agree while doing so. Never engage in a physical altercation, always give him some space if you can and change the subject. If you anymore questions feel free to ask
comment 4: Great suggestions! I also recommend connecting through music from the era he was a young man. Maybe talk about who his favorite musical artists were and even listen to some tunes together even during a phone call. Often music connects  us with our loved ones.

Hell, my dad never liked being contradicted when he was healthy. I don't know how to comfort him. It seems impossible to get him off that track and it destroys me to know he's suffering and not be able to fix it.
Please help.","comment 1: Re: "" please help me know what to say to him? ""
Nobody really answered your question, so here is a list of questions which might bring joy to him:
Can you tell me about your best friend when you were a kid and one of your adventures.
What is the oldest story you know about our ancestors?
Is there something about me that you have always wanted to know but have never asked?
Can you describe a favorite memory about a family member?
If this was to be our very last conversation, is there anything you would want to say to me?
Do you have a favorite snack, song, television show, recipe, comedy?
What is your first memory?
Did you ever get into trouble as a kid? What happened?
If there was a biography of you, how would you want to be described?
What choice are you thankful that you did not make?
comment 2: Finding a local dementia/Alzheimers support group might help you connect with others going through the same thing.  May help you compare notes and share ideas/stories.
comment 3: Whatever you do, please remember you're not alone in dealing with this type of situation. If you can find other people going through the same thing you'll all learn from each other.
It's kind of a natural thing to learn to interact with someone who has memory loss and confusion, it just takes practice to become familiar. You're doing a good job. Using humor as you described is a useful technique. Sometimes patients will get what I call a memory echo- they don't know why they're happy but it carries forward and sets a general emotional tone.
If he's happy in the moment then that's a victory and his life is better. What you do is much appreciated!
If you can give him a wallet to carry with a few dollars in it that might reassure him or change the story. Stashing money in a place where he'll look for it can be helpful.
Medication is perfectly appropriate if he responds well to it. I wish you all the best- hugs.
comment 4: Thank you for the kind comment. I never feel like I’m doing enough. I wish I could fix all of this.
comment 5: Clever idea stashing a few dollars. That could assuage the fears that he was robbed and is penniless.
comment 6: Oh thanks. It's called a suggestive environment. Things like security widow stickers are helpful too, if the patient would notice and find it reassuring.
We can say, yeah, we've taken steps to make sure that never happens again! By the way, wasn't it smart of Mom to keep that emergency account over the years? Yes you made that money, she just managed it. Thanks for working so hard! Or we could bring up the effectiveness of neighborhood watch and good community ties, if the patient has friends in the neighborhood. That helps to remind the person they're not alone. 
This kind of thing can backfire, so it's important to say very little and see how it goes. Too much information is confusing so if a person can create their own positive ideas we're winning. They're going to have their own stories and ideas no matter what we do; so guiding them the best we can is vital. Our body language is important too.
I never lie to patients, but if there's any truth to a statement it can be brought into the conversation.

Maybe try posting this there.
I wish you all the best.
comment 8: Thank you, I'll do that right now.
comment 9: Start working now to get him into a care facility. My mother has been in a home for 13 years now post Levy Body diagnosis. It’s a terrible disease and people can live a long time. Just do yourself a favor and don’t pretend this can be managed with a few pills.
comment 10: It’s a horrible disease. My dad’s wife has medical PoA and refuses to even get in-home care for him. I asked why she was opposed and she blocked me. We’ve since reestablished contact and I explained that questions aren’t a criticism, but I don’t know how to broach the subject of his care without the risk of losing access to him completely.
I feel lost, scared, overwhelmed. I can’t even imagine what he’s feeling.
comment 11: I have not dealt with Lewy-Body dementia, but I know Alzheimers painfully well. Here is a little bit from my education.


His reasoning is not stable. Ergo, it is futile to try to reason with him. Never waste time trying to reason with the unreasonable.


He needs to be in a memory care live - in facility.  The sooner, the better.  His hygiene is probably going sharply down, and they know how to deal with that. It should be a locked facility for the safety of the patients, who will try to escape, usually during the night. 


If he gets moody, and he definitely will, don't get pulled into it. Remain cheerfully calm at all times. Let the facility workers take care of the bad stuff that will upset him. The family must keep happy feelings around him.


As the Alzheimers progresses, his maturity digresses. He will become childish. Like a pushy toddler. Remembering that reasoning is futile, Here's a tactic which works :  distraction. And your imagination is free here. ""Hey! I can make a fish face! Look at my fish face! Can you make a fish face?""   Or a tender hand hold, back scratch, face caress.


Or simply a change of scenery, as in, let's go for a walk! Whatever it takes, distract away from bad behavior. Goofiness, tenderness, music, those all work.


If he feels trapped in any way, he will rage. (So would we!). Respect that. You may have to ask some helpers to wait out of sight until he can calm down. This will occur more and more often as the dementia progresses.


At least one person close to him needs to see him several times a week, just to cheer him up and check on general conditions. The family needs to be kept updated on his condition. 


Please get a lawyer to get all the papers set up, powers of attorney, will and executor, and someone needs to be on all his accounts to manage his bills. This needs to be done quite soon. Get all the documents you can. Find out who is their health insurance, life insurance, etc. Meet the doctor. 


It's quite traumatic. It's just hell. Prepare whoever will be doing this odyssey with him, this is a horrible journey, but we all agree, we wouldn't change our experiences.
I know this is unpopular on reddit, but rely on a lot of prayers. It's the only way to survive.
comment 12: Such great advise!
comment 13: Thank you. Great blessings on all who must take this journey.
comment 14: Thank you. This is very helpful.
comment 15: In relation to your comment about prayers. I find that many of my prayers aren't just for my mom, but for me : that I would handle this situation and challenge wisely, and that I wouldn't speak out of frustration.
comment 16: Exactly!! Oh boy, through and through. It's SO hard.
comment 17: Maybe just try to sympathize with him? If the wife has PoA and doesn't want help, you can't do much except talk to him. If he says he was robbed, just tell him you're sorry and that must have been awful, and then introduce a new subject to try and redirect him, like ""Have you had dinner? What did you have?"" or something like that.
So you acknowledge whatever it is he is feeling or thinking about, so maybe he won't feel like you're being dismissive or uncaring.
This is all I know to suggest. I'm sorry you're both in this difficult situation. :(
comment 18: Checking in to see how you and your Dad are doing.
Just a phone call to tell him you love him and thinking about him is all that is needed.
When he tells you ""I was robbed and have no money"" Just roll with it. Living on his own he will be safer in a memory care unit. Friends Dad had Alzheimer's and kept disappearing, and gotten his old 18 wheeler tractor/trailer hooked up and driving down the interstate. Cops who stopped him thought they stopped the wrong guy as he was so coherent and story checked out, thankfully to the cop politely asked for the manifest (he didn't have one) and trucking company sent out two people. One to drive the truck back, other to take him home. Just amazing. 
Did he get a clearer picture if Lewy Body or Alzheimer's? The two are different. Lewy body and Parkinson's are both due to misfolded alpha-synuclein.  Alzheimer'sis misfolded tau.   Different proteins(our bodies have thousands of different proteins) but when they misfold it causes problems.
Haldol - antipsychotic - is fine for Alzheimer's.  It should NEVER be administered in the case of Lewy Body.
For Parkinson's and Lewy Body make sure to get an ""Aware in care kit.""
https://www.parkinson.org/Living-with-Parkinsons/Resources-and-Support/Patient-Safety-Kit
A great resource is:
Lewy Body Dementia Org. lbda.org
I wish you and your Dad all my best.
comment 19: Hi, thanks so much for checking back in.
Dad is in a memory care unit and doing much better out of the “care” of his spouse, who has more or less abandoned him for her new boyfriend. She’s gross. He doesn’t ask to go home and he doesn’t about her anymore, which leads me to believe he’s forgotten about her. For the best, really. She’s toxic as hell and obviously does not love him.
Sometimes he thinks he’s in a hotel. He can only FaceTime on the unit’s one tablet because phones are too difficult to sanitize between residents. I haven’t been able to reach him as easily, which has been difficult, but I’ve been able to call and routinely check in with the nurses, who say he is doing well.
Right now, his unit is divided in half between residents who have covid and those who don’t. Fortunately he’s on the side that doesn’t. I’m hoping that will continue. He is resistant to wearing a mask when leaving his room. For the most part he likes to sit in his room and watch the birds and turtles in the courtyard from his window. He told me before all residents were quarantined to their rooms that his favorite part of the day was when they played music. Hopefully some semblance of normalcy will return soon so he can have that joy again.
I’m still grieving hard. I’m working on things as much as I can in therapy. It is my understanding he has a diagnosis of both Lewy-Body dementia and Alzheimer’s. I didn’t know it was possible to have both, but here we are.
Thank you again for asking and giving me space to talk about him.

Hey Alexa! Remind me to take my tablets. ,"comment 1: Where did i seen this comics?

"Advice Please So I have been caring for my husband for a little over 3 years. He has a seizure disorder, BPD, and other mental health issues. Honestly there are days that I just want to walk away. I never thought it would be this hard. This is not what I signed up for. I love him more than anything in the world. However, I feel like I've lost myself in caring for him. How can I care for him as well as make time for myself? I struggle with feeling guilty any time I leave him to his own devices to do anything I need to do. He's extremely dependent on me to the point that he insists on riding with me even to the gorcery store. It gets annoying and difficult to do things on my own. Any advice on how to do that without making him feel slighted or abandoned?","comment 1: Does he have family nearby? I'd ask someone or a few someones to commit to regular visits so you can get some away time. Some ins will pay for adult day care or home visits. Don't feel guilty, that's not what anyone expects in life. You deserve to live too!!
comment 2: We do, his parents live about 5 minutes away but he doesn't get along to well with his dad (bad history) and being alone with them makes him anxious. Our best friends live about 10 minutes away and I've tried to plan a girls day and let them have a guy's day but he always gets anxious as the last minute and we end up cancelling. I feel like I almost have to just say well you're going to have to deal with it while I have this time but his seizures are increased by anxiety... UGH
comment 3: depending on where you live there might be social service or non-profit programs that could help. Check with NAMI.org and the local disability office too.
comment 4: Seizures and anxiety... are you in a Medical Marijuana or Legal state/country?
comment 5: Yep. Currently saving up to get both of our cards!
comment 6: Okay.  So if your state has laws like California did, he can get a card and you can sign up as his Caregiver, which means you can purchase, transport, prepare, and administer, but not take any yourself.  That's usually cheaper.
You'll want to look up studies (Doctors like Pubmed studies, but using a pot website to find the studies themselves might be easier because some of the studies are written very med-speak-ish) to print out and bring to the doc.  This isn't to get a pot recommendation, this is to ask the doc if there's any contraindications with your husband's current meds.  To keep the doc from immediately getting all defensive, the conversation should go something like this: ""Here are husband's meds.  I've found all these studies on how Cannabinoids reduce anxiety and seizures (hand them over), so I need to know if there are any possible negative interactions between his meds and cannabis, please, before we try them.""
About Cannabis: we don't know enough about it yet.  We do know that pot has a boatload of different things in it, some of which are good, some which do harm, and some of which could go either way.  For instance, CBD is great at managing my dysmenorrhea and anxiety, but we know that THC actually accelerates HPV tumor growth.  Additionally, the first six or a dozen times you try it, you'll get bigger reactions than the twentieth and all those after that, just like alcohol.  With those things in mind, go slow with this drug.
Start with whole leaf if you can, it'll have all the stuff that might be helpful.  Derivatives from whole leaf (edibles, tinctures, vape, etc) will have less of the chemicals that might do the job.  Just a simple pipe (tobacco pipes work fine) and microdose.  Take a few leaves (not a whole bowl, that's for bigtime smokers, not small fries like me and most noobies) and smoke 'em.  Microdosing means you're taking such a little tiny amount that there's barely any noticeable smoke, and it certainly shouldn't make you cough.  You'll feel the effects in 1-10 minutes, and then it'll wear off in 1-4 hours.  There shouldn't be much, if any, feelings of being ""high"", though it should reduce anxiety.  Like pain meds, it's not that you suddenly feel happy, it's just that the bad stuff has gone away.  If you don't feel anything after 30 minutes, take another puff.
Edibles: edibles are usually dosed out in 5mg pieces.  That's a dose for a regular user!  If you want to start with edibles, nibble a corner.  1mg or less is usually plenty, and they'll last 4-24 hours, averaging 6-8 hours.  Take a little, wait 8 hours (yes really), and then try it again with a larger dose until you get a good reaction.  Honestly ""good reaction"" can be as simple as ""reduction of the pain/anxiety/yelling/number of seizures"".  Some folks never feel ""high"", just less awful.  
Good luck!
comment 7: well honestly we already use it daily for medicinal purposes, his doctors are aware we just don't have the cards yet. lol
It helps a lot with the depression and anxiety as well as the pain from the seizures. He still just really struggles with being without me. 
I work from home everyday except Monday, typically he will have seizures off and on all day while I'm gone and sometimes will have them Sunday knowing I'm going to be gone. 
He gets very lightheaded and dizzy easily so I feel like I can't leave him alone without him getting hurt. He has fallen down the stairs several times and pretty much lives with a constant concussion, which doesn't help his mental health issues. 
I just feel like I can't leave the house alone without causing him issues. He always tells me to go and do stuff, I'll make the plans and then when it comes down to it he gets anxious and I end up cancelling, causing issues with friends and making me feel slightly resentful.
comment 8: Then his anxiety is the issue.  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may really help him not be so reliant on you.  It's time to look for fixes for this because... what happens if you break your ankle?  Catch the flu?
comment 9: Yeah, his psychiatrist has recommended it several times. 
That is our other issue, I bring up therapy and it causes issues, he doesn't think he needs it. I have no clue how to make him see that he needs it. 
I just want an hour or two out of the house without feeling guilty. :(
comment 10: So you need advice on how to either get your husband to therapy for his anxiety, or advice on how to get some alone time without guilt.  So... you need guidance (AKA therapy).  Therapy can help you figure out solutions for exactly these things.
comment 11: Yep. It's been advised by my primary. But the whole feeling guilty about leaving him alone thing. But I think that this is one thing I need to do and it'll help. Just gotta suck it up and go.
comment 12: Ok if by BPD you mean borderline personality disorder, DBT therapy can definitely help! It reduces perceived abandonment depression which looks like triggers his seizures. This level of dependence is neither healthy nor sustainable.
comment 13: Schedule some therapy sessions for yourself.  When it comes time to go, if he gets anxious, rather than cancelling, tell him he’ll just have to go too!  Win-Win!
What type of seizures does he have?  Grand mail?  Have you seen the seizures yourself?  I’m wondering about his several seizures, at home alone, while you’re gone.
comment 14: That's the goal. I like the idea of having him go if he's anxious. 
He has Psychogenic Non-Epileptic seizures (pnes). They are caused by a variety of things. Head trauma and psychological trauma mainly. They started about 3.5 years ago. Triggered by a falling out with a friend and financial issues. They are sometimes absence seizures, sometimes small convulsions, sometimes grand Mal. He has them a little as a few times a week and as much as dozens in one day.
comment 15: Hi! Sorry to hear how you're feeling... I've been there myself to some extent. I've posted about this before, but my advice is to be open to talking. The fact that you can recognise there is a problem is a good start. Going on to such forums is a great starting point. I myself have used https://healthunlocked.com/. They are such a supportive group of people - extremely kind. Now all else I know is from what I've read online: https://www.guardiancarers.co.uk/care-information/feelings-being-carer. 
Carer guilt is so common and it's nothing you should be ashamed of. As much as you love your husband, you need to look after yourself too. I suggest you take some time for yourself. For me, meditation in the morning worked. (To be honest, I did not live in the same house as my grandmother, but it was still very demanding caring for her almost every day). Try to meet some friends for even one hour or speak on the phone to whoever you're close to and might understand. Also, if you feel like your husband is too dependent on you, have you given any thought to getting a carer to come in for a few hours per day? Or even per week? This would also offer you some time to focus on yourself and your health.
comment 16: I'm sorry I just saw this today. Haven't been on in about a week. 
Unfortunately I don't really have any friends really. It's hard to find people who understand the demands. I spend a decent amount of time online conversing with people to get human contact lol
I have suggested getting a carer/thought about it. I struggle with that as well. I feel like since I can adequately care for him that I'm taking away from people who don't have someone who can care for them if that makes sense. The thought of having a stranger in the house is difficult for him as well. It's kinda a mess over here lol.
I think I need to just start with little things, maybe meditation like you suggested to help myself and once I help myself maybe I can help him more.
comment 17: Oh wow. I'm so sorry to hear. And yes, I do understand the caring part. Whenever you feel like it's time, I think you should opt for that. People do need it, but you and your husband will need it too. 
Meditation really does help. It has helped me too. Try to simply start with some breathing exercises. Sit in a place which is comfortable for you (on the floor with your legs crossed, on the bed, etc) and breathe in and out counting to 8 with each breath in and out. Just clear your mind. Open the window and focus on what you hear outside (birds chirping, children laughing). I think it'd be a good start. 
If you have some time to go out by yourself I suggest museum open nights. It's full of nice people and it's a nice way to socialise without any stress. You can get involved in talks and all sorts of activities there.
comment 18: Thank you so much for all the advice!

"Tracking devices for dementia. Hi all. My grandfather is  beginning to show the first signs of dementia, and he’s always been sort of...difficult as it is.  Let’s leave it at that.  He still drives.  Is there a good app I could put on his phone that is reliable, hidden, and always on so that we could keep track of his whereabouts?","comment 1: Google maps for android and find my friends/find my for apple! They both use gps tracking on the phone. You would need to get his phone and have him share his location with you still but after that point, you can pretty much check at anytime.
comment 2: [deleted]
comment 3: He is still capable of driving.  He is just incredibly naive and there are people taking advantage of him and his vehicle. He lies about his whereabouts and we have no real way to track him down if something happens with the awful crowd of people he’s clinging to.
comment 4: If he has dementia he is not safe on the roads.
comment 5: He is showing what we think are very mild symptoms, mostly involving allowing a group of people to take advantage of him. He is otherwise fully aware and sharp. 
It could also be that he’s just increasingly lonely and needs these people to feel validated. His wife just passed of Alzheimer’s so it’s the first thing our minds are jumping to. 
For whatever reasons, he’s consistently making poor judgements in character and we need to know his whereabouts in case anything happens.
comment 6: People have a great deal of ingenuity on masking their dementia. By the time loved ones notice it has often gone quite far. He needs to see a doctor for an assessment. My stepfather had what appeared to be mild dementia but when  he was assessed, he was in the moderate range. There were so many things he couldn't do on the test but we just never noticed, since he was agreeable and easy to get along with.
comment 7: If he is involved in an accident of any kind, he will be found at fault, as will his family and caregivers, for allowing a person with dementia to continue to drive. It's always going to seem too early to get him to stop driving, but it could be so much worse if it's too late.
comment 8: try Life360
comment 9: Life360 is really good for android or ios. You would have to get into his phone to set it up. You can pay to get a driving report, too.
comment 10: Yes for around $7 a month you can get a complete driving and location report. Like speed, braking etc
comment 11: My father has Alzheimer’s and still drives occasionally, I have an AwareGPS monitor plugged into his diagnostic port. It lets me track his driving as well as speeds and hard stops. It has been a game changer for us, $20 a month for the gps, like $20 to buy the monitor. I cannot recommend this enough.
Edit: I have the app installed on my phone, I can check his location anytime.
comment 12: I'll be interested to hear what folks say as we have this issue with my dad but he doesn't use a phone anymore so we can't track via an app.
comment 13: If he’ll let you put something on his keychain you could use Tile. thetileapp.com
comment 14: Throw a Tile under his floor mats.
comment 15: Or shove the tile into that spot between the seat and the center armrest. You know - that no-mans land where your hand won’t quite fit into the crack to pick up the stray coins that always seem to fall there?
comment 16: There is now wearable technology - watches that have GPS trackers in them specifically for the issue you’re talking about. Family can see where the person is. Very accessible in America, Germany, UK, Sweden etc. 
Where are you based?
comment 17: I ‘m in the southern US. The only thing is that this man is already distrustful of technology and would have a FIT if we insisted he wear any kind of tracking device. I’m thinking something I could discreetly put on his phone would work...as long as it stays ON, you know?
comment 18: Yeah I get you, I’d agree with another poster and go for Find My Friends (if iPhone). 
The tech I meant is a watch and you could sell it on the basis of getting his steps up etc. But totally understand, I have family members who are exactly the same. Not the model I had in mind but this  is similar.
Good luck!
comment 19: Thanks so much. ❤️
comment 20: My mother is the same. I turned on location tracking one day on her Google maps app. I've never turned it off and it's provided me peace of mind
comment 21: Are you sure you’re not dealing with MY daddy?  He was sure that “they” were doing things to his computer so it didn’t work. My daughter was able to get his phone and install life360 on it and hide the app. Every now and then, we’d have to turn it back on because he enjoyed changing all the settings, but he never knew we could track him because, if he had, he’d still be screaming and he passed away in August. Good luck.
comment 22: Oh my gosh, that is exactly how he is.   He won’t even keep the account I made for him on Netflix. It’s honestly exhausting!  Good idea with hiding the app...I don’t actually think he’s tech-savvy enough to figure it out, so that might work!  Thanks for your help and I’m so sorry for your loss.
comment 23: I’m having similar concerns for my parents. Someone suggested an Apple Watch, to track location.
comment 24: I saw a news story just in the last week or so about a GPS device built into a shoe sole insert.  I thought that was smart.
comment 25: Life360 is good, if you’re sure that he keeps his phone powered on and with him. My mom, and a few other older folks I know only turn on their phone when they want to make a call or are expecting one. It’s a holdover from the days when phone batteries didn’t last at all, and cell phones were just for emergencies.
comment 26: I thought about getting one of those small pet GPS from the wish app and putting it in my 98 year old father in law’s wallet.
comment 27: Came here to recommend TILE
comment 28: Neck bell. Like for a cow.
comment 29: I laughed. I'll share the downvotes with you.
comment 30: This kinda applies -- an Apple Watch is good for tracking, but I found out today that the Series 4 and up has fall detection! 
If Apple Watch Series 4 or later detects a hard fall while you're wearing your watch, it taps you on the wrist, sounds an alarm, and displays an alert. You can choose to contact emergency services or dismiss the alert by pressing the Digital Crown, tapping Close in the upper-left corner, or tapping ""I'm OK."" 
This seems like a game-changer for older folks. I can see getting my dad one -- although he is fearful of some tech. But he's also fallen a couple of times (when no one was around) so it might be something to consider.
comment 31: If you have iphones, set up a family plan and add him on.  You’ll always be able to get his location without any apps installed and it won’t notify him.
comment 32: Does he happen to have a vehicle with onstar capability?

Video calling device recommendation? Does anyone have recommendations for a video calling device for my mom with dementia? Would like to be able to call in without her having to answer. Also if it can be tamper proof as we set up laptops with skype auto answer before but she accidentally changes the configuration of the laptop or turns off wifi. The CNAs try to help but arent as tech savvy.  Mom has difficulties speaking due to parkinsons so voice activation is not needed.  Thank you all!,"comment 1: Amazon echo and google nest hub both have drop in features where you can call in without the other person answering.
I wish facebook portal devices had drop in calls as they have the largest screen by far and the camera does a better job following a person around but unfortunately, last i checked thry didn't have that feature (maybe they added it by now but I doubt it).
comment 2: Thank you for this information, i was also looking into the facebook portal but in the end the echo show seemed a bit easier.The screen is a bit small and sometimes i can only see part of her face depending on where shes sitting but still seems to help :) also during these times where we cannot visit, its really helped making daily check ins easy.

I ended up showing up two hours early for appointments. It took an hour to get her to get ready and then an hour before I'd say it was time to go and she'd immediately rush into the bathroom and lock the door and start saying she had to go to the bathroom, brush her teeth again, take a shower (even though she already had).

comment 4: Yeah, we don’t live with her....I’m amazed at how few resources there are. I just wish we lived in Norway or Finland...
comment 5: I use Amazon Echo Dots all over the house. You can set verbal reminders to go off for them and drop in from your own phone on an intercom set up. It’s been helpful in making sure he takes meds and contacting him.
comment 6: That interesting, I’m assuming her comprehension is intact but working memory is certainly part of it so maybe it isn’t. Thanks.
comment 7: Anything you are going to introduce now is going to take some learning, and as you have stated and this isn't a time to learn. At this point for me, it wasn't about making her life better but making my life work better with hers.

"A tool that will prevent my grandma from using the stove? We're not sure whether she has alzheimer's at this moment, but there was a time when she turned on the stove and forgot to turn it off. She's also deaf, so she couldn't hear the fire alarms going on. If I was not in the house at then, things could have gotten really bad. We try to limit the times she is home alone with my grandpa (who has alzheimer's), but just in case, we think it's best to not let her use the stove at all when we are not in the house. 
Is there a device that will lock the stoves or the stove knob? Any recommendations for the products?","comment 1: Throw the fuse that controls the stove- an easy fix :)
comment 2: This is a great answer: get a lock for the fuse box and lock it too.
comment 3: We never tried this, but we looked at it when my mom kept turning on the gas to the stove. Turning off the gas supply wasn't enough as she figured out how to turn it back on.   https://www.alzstore.com/automatic-oven-control-p/0352.htm
comment 4: In stores like Babys R Us, they used to sell child proof devices for stove knobs. I think Lowes and Home Depot sells them as well.
Amazon sells a bunch of them.

Although Jenn's suggested to cut the power to the stove is probably the most surefire fix!

"Need Advice - early stages of care My mother in law was diagnosed with psuedodementia about 3 years ago. She has refused to acknowledge it and gets pissed when it is brought up. Her husband died and she has declined very fast since. So badly that we are going to move in with her. But we are at a loss for how to handle it. 
My husband has power of attorney over medical. We aren't sure how that works exactly but we were able to obtain her past medical records and look at them (she is very tightlipped about it all). We want her to take a test for dementia but have had issues getting her to agree. A nurse told me that we could call adult services and they would have someone determine if she is in need of anything ...and we could have them order a forced evaluation. Had anyone ever had to have someone forcibly evaluated? I just can't imagine that going well.......
She is hiding Twinkies and shit in her room after we got rid of them. She has diabetes and high cholesterol, etc. She doesn't cook anymore, we have started supplying her with healthy meals and she eats them with little complaint. Should we push the hidden Twinkies? Confronting her would go over badly, we could just take them out and check periodically and keep removing them but idk would that fuck with her mentally?, should we let it go if she continues eating 3 actual meals a day?
How do we get through dealing with her? We also have a 2 year old that makes things difficult because she is particularly interested in him and very judgemental towards my husband and I. Not even for any particular reason it seems, just seems like shes old and insecure about all the ways parenting seems different nowadays or like she's super jealous because she truly enjoyed her time as a mother and seems to wish she could have it again (her other son died relatively young ☹ so a lot of emotion there). I see this as being the hardest thing to deal with. 
Any tips? We figured we could track her phone using the Google find my phone thing so we would always know where she was (if she had her phone)  
Anything that could make this easier?","comment 1: Hey there, sounds like you've got a lot going on!
I'm not from your area, so not sure what your process is for diagnosis and stuff, but getting  support is important for her, and you. First step should be your doctor - call them and have a chat to see what they suggest. It may be you discuss it with her head on, or maybe a sneaky trip out and call at the doctors 'to pick something up' while you're out..  speaking with the doctor first will help figure out how to approach it.
Social services should be able to advise on what support's available in your area. Worth a chat even if it's just that for now. There may be advice and support you can use now, and it's worth knowing what help you can get if and when things get more difficult.
Great that you're doing her meals so she's eating healthy. Where's she getting the twinkies from? Can you just stop buying them? The main thing is her health, so if eating them is causing a risk for her diabetes, then they need to stop. If it's not causing a problem, it's probably not worth the argument. Hard to say what to do if they do need to stop - you could 'clean her room and find them' and bring it up gentley? Or offer healthier snacks for if she's getting hungry? It's not uncommon though for people with dementia to gain a sweet tooth!
With your child? Eek, not even a parent my self! with dementia, it's easier to try and avoid confrontation, so either let things slip if she's just being critical, or if she's telling you to do things a particular way, maybe reply 'that's a great idea, I'll try it later', or that your child's sticking to a routine for now, and hopefully it'll go forgotten?
Good luck with things!

"Aging Parents and helping their adult children My parents are in the late 60s and 70s and have never been able to manage their finances well. About 3 years ago I managed to convince them to sell their massive house, buy something smaller, pay of their debt and save the rest of the money for travelling and/ or unexpected life expenses.
My sister who is financially a mess has been trying to get my parents to pay off her car and used multiple reasons. 
Last year she quit her job and didn't work for 8 months or so. During this time she tried to get them to help and I stepped in and handed out my money so that my parents won't be affected.
Last week she decided she wants to buy a place after having worked again for about 5 months and convinced them that if they pay off her car she can get a bank loan to buy a place.
Obviously she doesn't understand how finances work and getting a place will put her into debt with no savings and with her track record I can see them to help out till they are dead.
I'm sitting here not sure what to do as I have power of attorney and all funds etc go through me. Normally I let them make decisions and give my opinion, however in this case no one is listening to me and I don't know what's the right move.
If I say no to the transfer of funds I'm sure my sister will stop talking to me and then try and go around me.
If I let this happen my parents are going to lose 4000USD and likely have to help her out again in the future when she realises she can't pay the bond, levies and rates. 
My parents have all there mental faculties however have never understood how to handle money or say no to my sister.
When should I step in?","comment 1: This same thing happened with my MIL and SIL.  At that point in time, it looked like my MIL could afford the $10,000 but my husband was worried that down the road giving it to my SIL would prevent my MIL from obtaining the correct services that she may need. So that's what he told my SIL that he didn't know what the future would bring and that at some point my MIL may need that money.  My SIL wasn't happy but my husband felt that his first priority was to his mother and making sure that she would be taken care of appropriately. 
I wouldn't let your parents pay off your sister's debt because your parents could still be around for another 10 to 20 years and that money could make a difference to them. If your sister is like my SIL the asking would have never stopped if my MIL continued to bail her out.  So she may be pissed but your priority is to your parents. It's really hard being the only adult in the family.
comment 2: Thanks for your thoughtful response, the more I think about it the more I agree. It's a lot of money that they could put to good use for themselves down the line.
Going to have a stern conversation with all involved and hopefully they listen to reason.
Thanks again!
comment 3: I'd caution you to at least be aware of the (very likely) fallout that this conversation might have on your family, although I do think it's the right thing to do. 
My brother is an alcoholic and when my parents divorced several years ago at the ages of 70 he nearly manipulated our mom into giving him her entire retirement savings (worth around $700,000). My other brother and I had to step in, and although we were able to block a lot of it he has still manipulated her out of over $100,000 in vehicles, etc. Our family, which used to be close, is completely destroyed over this.
Hopefully your parents are mentally still with it, my mom started drinking a lot around her divorce which left her even more vulnerable and she defends my alcoholic brother even though he has significantly contributed to destroying her relationships with my dad, her sister and niece and my other sober brother and I. I wish I had some advice that if I had it to do over again it would've fixed the situation and protected my mom while still keeping our family intact, but I still don't see how I could've done it differently unless I just butted out and let him take her money and left her struggling.
Just be cautious, maybe consider talking to a trusted financial advisor (maybe someone your parents trust too? is there a financial advisor they've had for a long time that you could talk to as well who could give some respected input?). Situations like these have destroyed many families which is maybe inevitable, but if there's a way to do it that keeps your family intact then make sure you're considering all angles and taking it slow beforehand so there's less regret down the road. Good luck.
comment 4: Talking to a financial adviser would be great, my family don't have one but I'll see about speaking to my friends and finding a good one.
Just spoke to my mom and she seems to be in a tizz about the whole thing and my dad apparently doesn't care and just focuses on his readings and wants everyone to be happy.
I appreciate the caution and will take it slowly with them. 
Personally I don't care if I don't have a relationship with my sister and to am extent my parents. 
At this point I'm just trying to do right by them because they raised me as best they could and I owe it to them to make sure they are comfortable or atleast know they have some future to look forward to.
comment 5: Agreed, you dont know what the future may bring and its much better that they be able to handle what Life may throw at them. My dad is 93 and seems to spend money at times needlessly because it makes him feel normal again. he thinks he should spend it all and i just cant seem to convince him to hang onto it in case something else happens. There may be another operation or he may need to enter a care facility and he wont listen to either caution.
comment 6: I agree, don’t let them help your sister, because it will never stop. We helped a family member buy a place, because she could not get finance. Also someone who has no idea of how to handle money. Within 3 years she couldn’t pay the loan any more. Within 5 years we had to pay all her levy/building management fees. Now it’s at a point where she just emails me the repair invoices. And I can’t do anything about it. It was really a huge mistake. But we did it, because she was genuinely about to become homeless. It’s been a 10 year ordeal (nightmare) so far and we no longer speak.  :(
comment 7: Ouch sorry that this happened to you and it's a big fear that the same will happen between my parents and my sister. 
It's just shit always having to be the reasonable one... 
Strength to you and hope you somehow get away from having to 'help'.
comment 8: Thanks for that. I’m going to make sure I sort out my own old age, that’s for sure!
comment 9: >It's just shit always having to be the reasonable one...
I hear you. Being the one fiscally responsible person in a family full of people who cannot manage basic financial planning is AWFUL. I don't know whats worse: continuously watching them fail and mess up their lives; or the knowledge that they'll be coming to YOU and begging for money when they're broke and facing homelessness.
comment 10: I think the latter is worse because it affects us more than just watching people make mistakes.
After a long drawn out conversation my folks decided to give the sister the money with the full understanding that I will not support them financially ever if they did it and that they can no longer ask me for financial advice as they don't take it.
I'm going to have lunch with my sister tomorrow and let her know my feelings and that I don't want her in my life.
Family is important but your own sanity is more important
comment 11: >I think the latter is worse because it affects us more than just watching people make mistakes.
Agreed. 
I watched helplessly as both my parents pissed away a large inheritance from my grandfather that could have been put away and/or invested for their retirement. Now I have to work very hard to turn off my emotions and maintain my boundaries so they don't suck my wallet dry

comment 20: Perhaps purchase the car from her but allow her to continue to use it?  
Or give the 4K as a personal loan with no interest (paperwork required), and a declaration of intent to pay back, so that she will have documentation of owing it back to the estate, when the time comes?  
Or suggest that you think this is a terrible idea, but will agree if you all go sit down with a licensed financial advisor to discuss sister's finances, and that advisor agrees that now is a good time to buy a house and that paying off the car is a good move to facilitate that. Then you can offer it as a loan.
comment 21: Ya we tried the loan thing and then she stupidly said she won't pay them back because a brother loaned money 15 years ago and never paid it back.
At this point I'm likely going to absolve myself of power of attorney and go no contact.
Thanks for your input :)
comment 22: oh, wow. You're just done. alright. If that's what you want to do because they're that dysfunctional, it's probably for the best for your quality of life.
comment 23: I'm really in 2 minds about things after talking to my mom I think I need to find a solution to protect them.
comment 24: well, there are ways to protect them, such as having yourself on the bank account and requiring your signature on any checks (the check should indicate this) and your signature for bank withdrawals.
If they are easily manipulated, you might talk to them about signing something that prevents them from managing their own finances. I know there's a term for this, and I don't know the term, but basically, they aren't legally competent to sign contracts and such - you would do it for them. If they're not willing to sign but they really can't make good decisions for their future, you can get it through a court. This would protect them from not just your sister, but from phone scammers and such. Then you manage the bills or put them on auto pay, and they get a card with like $200 limit that you pay off every month.
You could also just play hard ball and decide that you're willing to protect your parents at the cost of the relationship with your sister - and say that you will not agree to the gift of $4K. It will only be a loan, and if she doesn't pay it back, it will come out of her portion of the inheritance. If she's in real need of the money, she might finally agree. If she's not, then who cares?
And then, you might want to consult with a lawyer about how to protect your parents specifically from your sister. Because financial abuse is a thing, and since they're old they might have special legal protections and you might, maybe, be able to get a legal order to prevent her from trying to go behind your back to get money from them.
Also, this other brother who took a loan from your parents 15 years ago and never paid it back? Make sure that's listed as a debt owed to the estate and consider legal action to get a judgement on it if he won't even pay payments toward it. If they're just using your parents as a piggy bank, then be their protector. If they care about your parents, then they should be willing to pay it back.
&#x200B;
Edit: (forgot to add) you can also sign over these responsibilities to a 3rd party like a financial manager who is legally obligated to act in your parent's and their estate's best interest. Many banks offer this as a service for a fee.
comment 25: Pretty sure the word you're looking for is Conservatorship.
comment 26: thank you!
comment 27: Please try to talk some sense into your parents.  
My parents have been ""helping"" my brother his entire life.  My brother is now 58 years old and my 88 year old parents still ""help"" him all the time (like EVERY month!).  I'm not looking forward to the day when my parents are no longer around to ""help"" my brother cause there's no way I'm going to do that!
comment 28: This is what I fear my parents will die penniless and then my sister will want help from me...
Sorry that you going through this
comment 29: I'm really frightened of the same thing!  My parents are at the stage where they need additional in home care or assisted living.  Not sure if they can afford it due to giving my brother all their savings.
comment 30: I’m in the exact same situation. Parents in their 80s, older sister in her 60s who has been terrible with money her entire life. Over the course of her life, my parents have either bought or outright given her a vehicle FIVE separate times, and they’ve been sending her money every month for years if not decades. I’m talking sometimes $1,000/month.
When they die, her share of the inheritance is technically enough that she shouldn’t ever need to beg money from me, but I know it’ll run through her fingers like water. But when she comes to me begging for money once she spends all of her share, she’s in for a rude awakening, because my reply will be a firm NO.
comment 31: A lot depends on the scope of your power of attorney, I think. Every POA is different, and the exact wording is very important in determining what you are allowed to do, and when. Keep in mind that power of attorney CAN be revoked - if your parents still have their wits about them and decide they aren’t happy with how you are managing the money, they can have you removed as POA and still give your sister whatever she wants.
Others have recommended you speak to a financial planner, which isn’t a bad idea, but I would also suggest you consult with an estate planning attorney.
comment 32: How will your sister qualify for a home mortgage without a down payment?  She may be counting on your parents helping her with that.  
Many parents help their children with a down payment for a home,  I know my parents did, and if your parents ever helped you with money, your sister may be thinking it would only be fair if they helped her as well.
My suggestion would be to convince everyone that if your sister pays off her car on her own, your parents can contribute $4000 (or whatever amount they deem appropriate) to the down payment for a home.  She will have help from her parents - she is their daughter, they love her and want good things for her - but she will have a better chance of making this work.
In the end, if they are not convinced, you can choose to be the ""bad guy"" and not allow them to pay off the car, and in your place I'd have no problem doing it.
comment 33: The idea of paying off the vehicle is that then she will qualify for a larger loan for the apartment.
After varsity I never asked my family for money and had to learn the hard lessons of working with money and making the right decisions which took a lot of trial and error.
I suggested that she pay off the car herself and when she finds a place my parents can help her out, that way they get to make interest from the 4k in the meantime and she learns a valuable lessons in terms of debt.
I have no problem helping her out under reasonable terms my fear is that this won't be the last time and the when they have no money left they going to ask me for help. 
Thanks for your input :)
comment 34: your parents are lucky to have you taking care of their money
in my family, both my brothers had all their studies paid for, numerous cars, one brother had help buying 3, count them 3! properties.  I got some help for school, but nothing compared to room, board and tuition as they did, and they would not even co-sign a loan for a vespa for me so that I did not have to ride my bike 11 miles to school....  So things were uneven and probably it was because I was not particularly obedient.  Once I married and had a child they seemed to start to feel the guilt and helped me out with buying a house.  Still, the scales were totally skewed.  It's ok though because I tend to land on my feet...  Those 22 miles of bike a day were also really helpful for long term muscle building.
comment 35: I think there is always one in the family that gets a raw deal (or feels like they are).
If my parents had the money to help my siblings as yours did I'd have no issues with it. 
I think it's important for one to separate financially from their parents early on to learn independence and become self-sufficient. Otherwise you have the potential to never actually grow up, but ya that's from someone who doesn't have children and likely will never.
comment 36: Since you have power of attorney, my suggestion would be ask about this in /r/personalfinance.
What I'm thinking is maybe there are trust arrangements you could put in place that would protect the bulk of their money.  I know vanishingly little about such things, only that they do exist.
Anyway, if you could get their money locked up in a trust, it wouldn't be a matter of you having to say ""No, I won't allow this"", but instead, ""No, it's not possible, it's out of my hands, the trust won't allow it"".
comment 37: This may cost a bit upfront, but maybe make an appointment with a personal financial planner -- for the WHOLE family. Let the PFP know in advance what you are there for -- that the WHOLE family needs to understand the implications of loaning/giving money to each other. 
This way you have an impartial person giving the advice to the WHOLE family, and it isn't you being the bad guy. Sounds like your sister needs to talk to a PFP anyway, and it could help your parents out as well.
comment 38: I didn't know you could have a financial planner meet with the whole family like that. That's handy to know for the future...
comment 39: My folks did the same thing. One of my siblings and his kids got monthly checks. They were giving away a lot of money. They were saving nearly nothing despite an income of 8k per month.  Their spending could have caused Medicaid to disqualify them for a while. Mom was pissed about it, saying it was her money and she could gift at will. Eventually she cut the spending but is still in the 5 year review range. Her cutting the gifts upset a lot of people and caused a rift in the family. 
She was perfectly happy with jeopardizing her future so my nephews could spend money they didn’t have.
"
"I’ve failed as a caregiver/daughter for my mother. Now what? My mom was hospitalized with hyponatremia from late November to mid December. Just on the cusp of me moving away to start a new job. The hospital wasn’t sure if she was mentally fit to take care of herself, but decided to wait on the results of psych meds to see her progress. 
However, the Doctor in her unit decided to take her off her high blood presssure medication. When I questioned this and the swelling I. Her feet, the doctor snootily replied with “well, get her compression stockings!” And told us to see her family doctor in the new year. Well, this weekend was the first weekend since December that I was able to come home after moving for my new job. I’m in her town until Tuesday. Then I have to go back to work on Tuesday. I was hoping to take her to the doctor on Monday, I figured it would be OK to wait a month, because the doctor at the hospital seemed convinced my mom didn’t have high blood pressure!! 
When I arrived home, her legs were 100x more swollen than usual, she was flushed (arms and ears especially), said she was dizzy, and just “off” in general. I also took her blood pressure with the home device and it was absurdly high!! 200/98!!!! I decided to take her to the ER, despite her doctor’s appointment on Monday. 
Now I’m sitting with her in the ER and I feel like a piece of shit. If I didn’t move and get a new job none of this would have happened. I’m at a loss for what to do anymore with her. Clearly, I can’t live my own life because of this. How am I supposed to tell my new job that, who knows, my mom has been hospitalized on a weekend I took time off for. I also took two sick days for a medical appointment (I have to see a dermatologist for a possible skin cancer biopsy. I was given two days (travel included) to see the specialist. I think they’d be relatively supportive,  but I only just started a month ago and I’m scared! I’m only a temporary employee until November. I’m so scared I’d get fired or reprimanded. 
My mom was mentally doing fine, but now her body’s gone to hell because I couldn’t come back soon enough to take her to her family doctor. I’m so upset with myself and everything now? What on earth do I do?","comment 1: You know when you fly in a plane and they tell you to put your own mask on before helping others in an emergency? I believe you keeping your job and your own life, is ‘putting your own mask on’. 
I know that doesn’t help you in a practical sense, but you simply cannot blame yourself for this. You acted on medical advice. 
Also, if you don’t have a job, how will you pay for the things your mother needs, your flights, etc. All I can say it, having care of an old person is extremely difficult. You cannot be expected to give up your dreams. I often ask myself, what was mom/dad doing at my age? 
((Hugs)) OP
comment 2: How old is your mom?  It may be time to look into assisted care facilities.   It's not an easy thing to do, but it can be the best option for all involved.   With my mom, even with me in town with her, it came to a point where her care was beyond my capabilities.   She's been in a facility for nearly 2 years now, and I finally feel like I can breath.  I know she's cared for, eating, getting her meds, any health issues are immediately assessed.  But, you are entitled to chase your dreams also, and don't sell yourself short on that.  You have to seek a solution that works best for everyone. I think sometimes daughters are raised with the expectation of caring for elderly relatives, and it's so unfair.   And go easy on yourself,  none of this is easy, and it does not have to be 100 per cent your responsibility.
comment 3: Don’t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.
Old people are non-stop health problems. You can’t stop it and they have to accept some responsibility fo dealing with it, whether it be better diet, learning to use technology, stopping all vices (drugs, drink, sugar, cigs), or utilizing services like social workers and the VA.
I say this as someone who is watching her father and her SO’s father do little to help themselves — and it almost seems a point of pride with them. They won’t grocery shop because that’s what women are for. One is a chronic pot smoker (legal in his state). The other is an alcoholic. 
Old age isn’t for the weak. If they aren’t willing to keep fighting to have value, purpose and health in this stage of life, you shouldn’t sacrifice yourself for it.
comment 4: I know that's frustrating! Don't beat yourself up. If your mom is still mentally there she could have told you what was going on before it got so bad that she was ""off"".  You can't do everything. 
It may be time for an assisted living facility. Or can she move to be closer to you?  Any other family near to her that could check in from time to time?  Perhaps see if her insurance would cover an in home aide for a few hours a day.  Often the nurse case managers at the insurance companies have resources they can recommend.
comment 5: [deleted]
comment 6: Thanks, I needed to hear this today
comment 7: It's not your fault what happened to her. She was having issues that would have happened regardless if if you were there are not. Maybe under slightly different circumstances.
Can your mom get home health to come in every X days to check on her? Those services exist for a reason.
comment 8: You have not failed.
If anything, that doctor failed.
You can’t put your own life on hold for her.
Find her an assisted living or similar help.
comment 9: But you didn't fail. You are not only allowed to but need to live your own life, and let her go along with recommendations of a doctor about her medication. If anyone failed, it was he who did. 
And second in line is your mom herself tbh, because when she notices her feet are swelling and she feels bad, she has to say something. You're not the only mature adult in this equation, she is or at least should be the other one and the one first in line. Things like this can not depend on you being there and noticing it; if she wants to live alone instead of in a care facility, and without helpers coming by, she has to take some responsibility for her own well-being. If she can't do that, then it's time to speak to insurance and her GP so at least a service can come and check once daily, for well-being and blood pressure and for putting together medication.
I understand that you feel miserable and responsible, but this truly isn't on you. Granted, this was a gradual thing (but comes back to herself needing to alert you when things go awry), but the older she gets, the more the only way to be reasonably sure nothing bad ever happens would be to not only live there, but also never be absent for any length of time. That's just not feasible. You moving away only made sure that you don't fall into the gradual trap of taking on more and more of her care and not noticing when the time comes where additional care from outside is needed.
In a way you could see it as a blessing in disguise. Your mom isn't well right now, but it doesn't sound like it's irreversible. And what happened did alert you to the fact that it has come to the point where she needs more oversight than either of you expected. Now you can take care of that before something bad and more time-sensitive, and with more irreversible effects can happen to her.
It's so easy to take on the blame, and so easy when living with or close to someone that needs care to let your own needs gradually take more and more of a back seat. But you need to earn money to support an aging parent, and you need room for your own life so taking on the care can't take over your whole life and swallow you up like it often happens. You moving away was a necessity, and one that actually will give you more financial options when making decisions about care and visits moving forward, and one that somewhat protects you from the gradual swallowing up that otherwise can happen.
comment 10: You can't set yourself on fire to keep anyone else warm....
Self care-first, care taker-second.
comment 11: You have gotten some great advice here.  I would add that if you are not quite ready to put her in a facility you can try hiring someone to come in and work with her at specific times of the week, so they can take care of her needs and alert you to anything she might need.  If money is an issue, and your mother qualifies, Medicaid can help pay for this.  Don't quit your job or make yourself feel guilty for living your life; you are doing the best you can.
comment 12: You have gotten very good advice here - you have to live your life. You can't sacrifice your future to help someone who needs to help themselves. Every time my mom has been hospitalized she went home with a little home healthcare help. The insurance company finally started paying a home healthcare company to come in and help her regularly to help keep her out of the hospital. Make sure the doctor at the hospital knows she will not have any help at home when she leaves there. The emergency room doctor tried to send my grandma home with a broken wrist once. She couldn't put any pressure on that arm. I asked him how she was supposed to get off the couch? The toilet? They sent her to a physical rehab facility for 2 months instead. Ask to speak to a social worker in the hospital and explain her situation. They can tell you what services are available in your area. 
Is your mom on Medicaid? Contact your local Area Agency on Aging (or the equivalent where you are) and see what services are available for her.  Do you know your mom's neighbors? Does she have friends or family who can stop in and check on her a couple times a month? Can you set up Skype chats/FaceTime with her once a week so you can lay eyes on her? 
I discovered in dealing with my mom that assisted living (at least in my area) isn't a thing unless you have thousands of dollars to spend a month. But we do have adult foster care homes that take low income seniors. The threat currently hanging over my mom is that I will put her in one of these if she doesn't step up and start taking care of her business. Her psychiatrist is insisting I stay involved in her care (I've stopped taking her to all her other appointments), so we agreed that I could 'attend' her appointments via conference call so I don't have to leave work. I just scoot into a conference room for the 20 minute call. There are many ways to help your mom that don't require you to sacrifice your future, find out what resources are available and start bringing them in. It will be time consuming initially, but it's worth it knowing you've done all you can and your are free to live your own life.
comment 13: Can you bring your mother to stay with you for a little while until she stabilizes?  
I understand the worries about the job - you will need that job if you need to take care of your mother.  But I also think that if you do a good job, and the folks at your job are good people, they would understand, especially if it's something you can get a handle on.
I don't know if this is possible with your job, but it may be worth it to look into taking intermittent Family Medical Leave with your employer if you are in the US.  Basically, if you are on FMLA, you wouldn't be penalized for absences related to your mother's medical condition - for the employer, this is a legal obligation.  The ""intermittent"" part means you just take the hours needed.  I've used that for both my mother and father.  
I hope ER was able to get her blood pressure and swelling down.
comment 14: I am sorry you have to go through this. As others said, I think it is best not to blame yourself. Also it is not your fault your mom has the health problems that lead to this situation. You cannot foresee what’s going to happen with her body. By the looks of it, even the doctors don’t know. 
I recommend you a book by Pema Chodron called The places that scare you. She has other good ones.

"Lost, Overwhelmed, and Depressed: Caregiving is Difficult Hi All,
I'm (M early 30's) a caregiver for my chronically ill partner (F late 20's).  We've been together for nearly 5 years.  A bit over 3 years ago, she had a life changing car accident.  She walked away from that accident thinking she was okay, but it has changed our lives in so many ways.  2 surgeries and a whole lot of other issues later, we're still experiencing the effects.  She can do a lot, even dance sometimes, but the chronic pain and the chronic fatigue regularly pop up in our lives on an almost daily basis.  For a while, recovery was always right around the corner, and it just kept moving further out.  She's scatterbrained, tired, and stressed.  I end up performing a lot of routine tasks for her.  She can't keep track of her belongings very well due to the pain (I bought her some tile trackers, but they can't track everything).  I clean her room and make her bed.  We split time between our parents houses.  90% of the time we're together, we are at her mom's place and I really wish this was 50/50.  I do spend a few days at home alone, but it has not been a lot lately.  When she comes over to my place, I have to meet her in the driveway and help her carry all her stuff in.  She always has bags of meds and other stuff and I feel like we're carting around duffel bags.  We can't do many of the things we used to do like hike, play sports, walk long distances, or have penetrative sex (this is periodically possible, but can be difficult and requires a lot of prep and work to make it happen, even other sexual activities rarely happen due to fatigue and mood).  Our life right now consists of us sitting around talking for a few hours after work (usually about how bad she feels or how bad her day was), eating, then going to bed.  Lately I've been trying to triage our arguments once a week or so.  We've come close to breaking up a number of times.
I know this sounds so mild compared to what many of you are going through.  My partner isn't terminal, I'm not dealing with feces or urine, and mentally she's still sharp as ever (despite the fatigue).  I lost my mother to cancer a few years ago (not helping my mental health due to the similarities) and I saw my father give 110% as a caregiver.  I'm lucky to have such an amazing role model, but it still hurts.
I've been experiencing pretty bad burnout lately.  The pain has changed my girlfriend's personality somewhat.  We fight a whole lot more.  For her I think it's the pain making pebbles into land mines.  For me I think part of it is due to the lack of intimacy.  She's tried to make this easier for me.  Our relationship started open and I have her permission to take care of my needs elsewhere if I need to.  I haven't acted on this, but I may.  We've been fighting more lately.  As an introvert, the caring I do and my customer support job are all the human interaction I can tolerate and I so desperately want some time to recover and be by myself and I never seem to get enough of it.  I care about her more than anything in the world and I hug her and tell her it's going to be okay, but inside I'm crying because everything has changed.  I try to cheer her up and be positive, but I end up listening to endless angry rants about doctors and work (we work at the same shitty company full of narcissists and idiots) and it can be overwhelming.  
Recently I admitted that I was overwhelmed.  I did so at a bad time, when she was flaring up (which contributed to my overwhelm) and I had to work really hard to fix things after I tried to ditch out and take care of myself  as soon as her mother came home.  I had promised to spend the day with her, but just needed to get away and be alone for a bit.  I didn't communicate it well at the time.  I don't think she understands why I'm overwhelmed and how overwhelmed I am, and I'm scared to even bring it up because I don't want to hurt her even more.  I'm not blameless in this.  I haven't always communicated my feelings well for fear of overburdening her even more, and because it often hasn't gone well when I did.  I asked for a reduction in caretaker type tasks and she has told me that she can't separate out her life like that.  I can't be the perfect caregiver for the rest of my life.  She also feels like a burden for needing so much help.  I can't run two people's lives.  I may be young, but I can't constantly fetch lost objects, listen to endless stories of people going through similar stuff that she has found online, stand still and repeatedly ask her to talk to me when she's emotional, non-verbal (panic attacks and PTSD), and is upset with me for not handling a situation right.  I'm frustrated when I try to offer solutions but she doesn't want them and just wants to share about how hard it is or how bad she hurts.
I get it.  Being forced to rely on others is frustrating and would upset me too.  Pain can change people and would change me too.  It's hard to stay positive and I would be depressed too.
I want to make this work, especially since she is still slowly improving and getting better, but I'm having trouble communicating my caregiver fatigue and what I need.  It's not fair of me to ask her to stop telling ""depressing"" stories about real suffering.  It's not fair of me to ask her to pretend she's okay when she's not.  I'm always in trouble for making assumptions or communicating poorly and I'm not sure if these things would be as big a deal without the pain.  I'm an incredibly self sacrificing person and have overextended myself.  I'm going to start seeing a therapist for all of this ASAP, but I have already put it off for way too long.
That's not to say we don't do fun things, eat good food, watch good movies, etc.  We have definitely had our fun together and she was incredibly supportive when my mother died and continues to be an anchor when I'm struggling with things.
I feel lost, overwhelmed, and depressed.   Has anyone else gone through this?
Has anyone been where I am?  How did you get your sanity back and support your partner at the same time?","comment 1: This is very familiar to me. I have similar things going on in my life as well. My wife has Fibromyalgia, tendonitis, arthritis, carpal tunnel, and a few mental health issues that include PTSD, anxiety and Non-epileptic seizures. I get you. Nothing terminal. 
We've been married 14 years now. She started having problems before our first year of marriage. I've seen some shit. 
Who is her support network? You, and her mom from what you've stated. Coordinate. Talk directly with her mom about things. Bring her into planning conversations. Make sure she is on the same page. If you need to take a break, talk with her mom to cover, and do the same for her. You and your partner may be a team, but there are more participants that you can rely on. 
Figure out who your support network is. Family and friends that you can go to and vent about situations. People you can rely on to pickup some slack here and there for things you need. 

Mental health has such an impact on every aspect of health. When my wife's anxiety and PTSD are flaring up, her pain levels skyrocket, but the opposite isn't necessarily true. There are a couple of things I think she needs to focus on here. 
One is her mental health, straight up. Theres a lot of facets and things here, but therapy has done wonders for my wife. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can really help people recognize their emotions, and analyze why they're having it. 
Another thing is positive outlook. One of the biggest 'red flags' is your partner's focus on negative things. How much pain, how bad her day was, etc. Yes, life isn't a picnic, but there has to be some good, something silly, funny or good event that happened during her day. Try bringing those events up. Not just for her, but for you too! I know its hard to focus on those things when you're down, but those little moments can really help salvage a shit day. 

You guys seem to have a pretty set schedule, which is good. Now schedule some time for yourself. Block out an hour or two that is your time. Schedule things around it. Defend that time. Then, go do something you enjoy. Window shop. Play video games. Something that you enjoy and rejuvenates you and makes you feel good. This is the hardest thing to do on this list, and even I have a hard time implementing it (life, uh, gets in the way). It is so very worth it. 
Find a local support group for the issues your partner is dealing with. They can offer lots of advice and help when you need it. 
Also look into counseling! There is a lot going on in your life, and counselors are here to help you navigate those choices you are making. 

I really hope this word wall has helped. I'm more than happy to answer any follow up questions you may have.
comment 2: We do have surprisingly similar situations.  Lot's of familiar things in that list.  I'm sorry you guys are going through this.  I appreciate your willingness to talk about it.
We're not quite sure what all is going on because it's all still in flux.  PTSD was a big deal early on in our relationship; now, not as much!  She is dynamic and she grows and changes which is one of my favorite things about her. :)  
I'm sorry to hear about your wife's flair-ups, I know those all too well.  My partner is thankfully not terminal either, but sometimes it feels like she has everything under the sun.
I've been thinking about making a fun photo album for us.  We've done a lot of traveling when she was doing better.  We still had to be careful about walking and distances, but it worked out well and we had fun.

I do have a follow up question on the support groups.  I looked around my area a few days ago, and while they exist, almost all of them seem targeted towards people who have a dying parent or are taking care of someone who cannot take care of themselves at all.  Have you ever seen anything with more of a focus on chronic pain and being a good partner to someone who is suffering, but still goes to work, drives a car, takes vacations, etc.
comment 3: Yep, look for Chronic Pain support groups. One organization is the ACPA
If there is a specific chronic pain condition, you can usually find something. ""[Diagnosis] support group"" would bring up something.
comment 4: You and your partner's situation sounds a lot like me and my partner's except for the facts that A) we quit the customer service jobs at the same shitty company full of narcissists and idiots and B) we get along really well.
I doubt the latter would be true if it weren't for the former.
Customer service is literally just non-stop emotional labor. Making a relationship work in the circumstances you are in ALSO takes lots more emotional labor than most people contend with day to day. It's REALLY hard to do both at the same time and it is not at all unreasonable to be failing at it. It's like having to do physically demanding stuff the entire time you're at home while also working as a laborer. You are bound to get wiped out and start to struggle.
Is there literally anything else you can do?
I switched back to bartending (at what was at the time a lovely company full of empathetic and intelligent people) for a while and we made the decreased income work. We were poorer but a lot happier. (I actually now don't earn at all and we're even poorer but happier.)
comment 5: Thanks for weighing in!  You're spot on with the emotional labor.  She has non-stop emotional labor, but I managed to get myself into an auxiliary role where it's basically just my job to know everything (or how to do a web search) and answer coworker's questions.  There's something to be said for being around great people, even if the money isn't as good.  I'm happy to hear you are happy with your path! :)
comment 6: It is difficult to watch your loved one suffer in front of your eyes. No matter how much effort you put in, the pain and the suffering does not seem to fade away. But amidst all of this you need to remember that you are already doing your best and all you want for them is to understand that it can be overwhelming for you as well. The best way to make things better is to communicate with your loved one as much as you can. Sometimes pain and frustration makes one neglect the suffering of others. Try to talk to and make them understand that things are tough for you as well and it has to work both ways to make things go a little better.

"Logging land-line phone calls My friend's parents are aging and dealing with some memory issues and poorer judgment than before.  As a result, they have previously been scammed by those tech support people that call and insist they're from Microsoft.  I went ahead and removed admin capabilities from their PC, but that's not going to protect their wallets.  It's my opinion that their phone is perhaps one of the most dangerous things in their house.
They are still living independently, and phone calls are an important part of their social interactions, so I would like to find a solution that doesn't interfere with their calls from friends.  I'm a tech-type, and I was wondering if anyone out there is using any sort of call monitoring software or devices.  Basically, it would be nice for my friend to get a text or email notification with the caller ID info any time they get a call on their land line, or possibly even outbound calls which would require more specialized hardware.  The parents do have a modem on their computer, so a software option should be straightforward.  I may end up programming something on my own, but I don't have a land line to test with easily.
Is anyone using a program, device, or service which accomplishes anything like this?
Thanks!","comment 1: Spectrum has a service called Nomorobo which has been really helpful with my parents’ landline. It filters out scammy calls. All my mom needs to know is, don’t pick up the phone on the first ring. If it rings twice, she can pick it up. Maybe their service provider has a similar program?
comment 2: Not sure where your friend lives, but at my previous workplace, we had Vonage connected to a landline and a cellphone. Anytime someone calls the landline, it will ring on the cellphone as well. 
Though, I'm not sure if the caller ID appears on the cellphone (it was my boss' cellphone and I wasn't brave enough to check), but I imagine the caller ID would come through on the cellphone as well.
comment 3: I also use Nomorobo with my Comcast/Xfinity account. It works really well and is available on many cable landline companies. It's free for landlines but they charge for a cell phone ($20/year for my iPhone app). You may get a few spam calls (which you can add to the list) but the calls have been greatly reduced.  I've used it for about 3 years now. I've also blocked numbers but Xfinity will only let you block 25 numbers.
comment 4: How do I set this up on my mom's landline?
comment 5: Go to nomorobo.com to set it up. Xfinity actually recommends the website to block telemarketers. You'll need your mom's Xfinity (or whatever her landline company is) account number or login info plus password. Just follow the directions on the website - it's fast and easy. For spam calls, her phone will ring once. She can answer after two rings. She may still get some spam calls but they can be reported. I found that once it was set up, I got fewer and fewer phone calls as time went by. Good luck!
comment 6: Thanks!
comment 7: I just wanted to jump in & say yes! People keep phoning my grandmother (turning 90) and saying that her computer is going to break, & that she needs to log in with them on the line simultaneously, etc. 
The problem is, she believes them! They keep phoning her & trying the same story. Apparently from India. She really believes it. 
Luckily for us all, she doesn’t know how to log in. Terrible.
comment 8: All that from a region that brought us the word ""karma."" Good manners are no match for this level of scheming.
comment 9: If possible, limit their phones to place and receive calls to and from only those on their contacts lists.
comment 10: If only we were dealing with smartphones. They have a big Rolodex.

"Taking my partners mother to a birthday party My partner is considering taking his 96 year old demented mother to his sister in law's 70th birthday. She's been in a home for a couple of months and  thinks everyone in her life is still bounding and living it up large, even if they died 100 years ago. Talking to her is like talking to a hairdresser or shop assistant as in very superficial, but horribly repetitive tool. Trains run outside her window, even though there is no track for miles. Cats live in the grass in the courtyard. This is a really, really bad idea, yes ?","comment 1: More pressing concerns:
1) Is she a flight/eating poison/stealing risk if unattended?
2) Do some people still think she's capable of telling truth or executing contracts / promising things on someone else's behalf?
3) Is her mobility ok, ability to move without hurting herself?
4) Is she depressed/manic?
comment 2: She doesn't know where the hell she is, what she's doing their or that her mother and father, a son and husband are dead. We indulge her fantasy and it might be difficult to do so if she finds herself in a strange place asking where her deceased son is every 5 seconds. If i hated my sister in law I'd strongly recommend she comes, but I do actually care about both their well beings, contrary to my cynical manner. I've cared for her for 2 years, cooked her meals and cleaned up 70 years of her hoarded crap after she went into care, My partner is a complete wreck over it all and if i had a gun I'd put a whole clip into my f head because I've had enough. The whole point is that he shouldn't even be considering the idea of her going. I don't have any support or the means to purchase a bloody firearm.
comment 3: Sounds like your partner feels he is the only person responsible for her, both burdened to bring her and to absorb all her conversation while she's there. It's a double edged sword that's already pointed right at him. 
My two cents would be not to bring her, purely on the basis that she won't remember having gone. 2 to 24 hours she will forget. She will also forget not going.
I hope your partner can use the time to explore his feelings on his own or with other people.
As the saying goes, make sure your own oxygen mask goes on first! Good luck and warm wishes.
comment 4: He says that his mother is his last link to the past. He can't seem to let her go and is depressed. He's on medication and has often relied on drinking, which I've been trying to curb with mixed results. His mother has just lived too long, everyone she knows has gone and she had been living alone for 10 years after her husbands death. When i first met her 5 years ago i could tell she was running on auto pilot. Lovely kind polite  lady but no substance if you know what i mean. I couldn't confide in her and she had no interest in anything except her past. So she's been going down for a very long time. It's a shame they didn't move her into a retirement cottage after her husband died. It actually feels creepy here, like it's stuck in time and my partners clingyness to her doesn't help. We have a nice home to move into very soon so it's been hectic. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, maybe. I'm just so frustrated and i have nobody to talk to. 
I am certainly going to recommend not bringing her, she's in her own little reality now and it's better that remains so. She would be utterly confused and her daughter in laws 70th would be side tracked. She's a very sick woman herself. Her invite to my partners mother was a token gesture out of kindness more than anything. Thankyou for your kind words and for listening. It means a lot to me
comment 5: Well said! It's her daughter in law's day, and having her there would steal the spotlight. The whole family deserves their moments in the sun and taking turns is what your partner's mom would have wanted.
You are a caregiver to your husband as well, make sure you have your resources and backups.

"Working on software to monitor the health and location of your loved one through iPhone + Apple Watch - Would love your feedback. Hey guys,
I'm building software to monitor the health of your ageing loved-one through their iPhone and Apple Watch, and I would love your feedback + opinion. My aim is to solve the problem of a lack of visibility into your ageing loved one, as you can't always physically be there with them.
&#x200B;
Features include: 
- Emergency: A ""panic button"" they can easily activate by simply holding the Apple Watch crown and saying ""Mayday"" to Siri. This will send you an SMS + Email of their latest location and health data. 
- A dashboard to track health such as heart rate (active, resting), distance walked, energy burned (active + resting), steps walked, stairs climbed, sleep etc. 
- Location - Where are they right now? Where have they been? Where do they historically spend their time?
&#x200B;
The software will cost roughly $20 - $30 per month. What are your thoughts on this? Is this something you would find useful and if so, what would you like to see from it?","comment 1: I liked an article I saw a few years ago that was a smart electric kettle that would send a text to a neighbor every time an old man in Japan pressed the button for water which he did often since he drank a lot of tea. If the neighbor didn't get a message for some hours or a day, she would knock on his door for a welfare check.
I can see how other sensors could help, e.g. turning on water to wash hands, using the toilet, walking up and down the hallway, pressure sensor for how long in bed, hours of TV on/off.  I guess activity monitors could do the same thing with steps and sleep.
It depends what you are trying to guard against, very elderly patients at home alone that have fallen down. They may not have the wherewithal to push a button. Or a wandering Alzheimer's patient that you need to track down? If you are targeting very sick people, I am not sure if they will keep a watch on or if they will lose it. Necklace might be easier.

"Devices to assist carrying things up the stairs? Sorry if this has been asked before; I couldn't find a FAQ for the sub.  My mom is almost 80 and lives by herself, and she has no interest in going into assisted living or anything like that.  She gets around well enough, but age is starting to take it's toll.  The thing she has the most trouble with is going up and down the stairs, in particular when she's doing laundry and has to carry the baskets up and down the stairs.  I was wondering if there are any sort of devices that are good for taking things up and down the stairs?  Maybe some sort of mechanized pully system, so that she wouldn't have to carry it?","comment 1: Have you considered a ""stair lift"" aka ""chair lift""? It's basically a chair attached to rails that ferry the person up and down the staircase.
comment 2: Maybe a Dumbwaiter?
comment 3: if she owns the house,   how about putting a stackable washer and dryer upstairs so she does not have to carry laundry up and down??  Problem solved.  If she lives alone that machine will be fine for her.
comment 4: These are good ideas. You'd want something that helps but doesn't get in the way and cause her to trip. My dad had a stair lift and it worked great but they are expensive e.g. $3500 per ramp. A dumbwaiter installed in a cupboard sounds good too. Upfront costs but maybe a contractor could do it nicely.
Haven't tried this, but look up on the web for UpCart Stair climbing carts.

"What is your experience with alert devices for falls? Someone I care about had a fall recently. I am very worried about him as they couldn't pinpoint what it was.
I heard about GreatCalls being around $15 a month after buying the device for a Keychain.
Are there any of you that have experience and could share with this or similar products?
He will likely never use it but what if he did? Seems like a small amount of money for someone I care about.","comment 1: It only works if they wear the device. Spoilers, they never do.
comment 2: Is the Keychain kind different? I notice almost all go around the neck. I don't think I could ever get him to wear a neck one.
Aren't both just push a button and help comes?
comment 3: No real difference. If he has a fall, there's a good chance he won't be able to access his pockets.
comment 4: When they work, they really work. We had one on my dad and he did fall and immediately they were contacting us. If you can ensure he will wear it, it could really be useful. But I agree, if he isn't going to wear it, don't waste your money.
comment 5: My mom is very good about wearing hers, and they've helped with a couple minor incidents.  We've also had a few false alarms, but we discovered they need to be worn inside the clothing.  They swing too much outside, which triggers the false alarms
comment 6: My experience has been that I paid for MedAlert for about 6 months, credit card was stolen (unrelated) so I got a new number, forgot to update the billing info and never got a call, email or bill from them, a year later it still works and I haven’t paid a dime for it in that time. Shrug
comment 7: My mother has a necklace one that is both a push button and the type that is supposed to detect falls automatically and call emergency. She hasn't fallen since she got it, thankfully, but hardly ever wears it now because it has sent several false alarms. This tends to happen whenever she leans over to wipe in the bathroom.  Unfortunately, due to some mild dementia, she can never remember how to cancel the call. We tried the watch one too but she complained it was too big and too heavy on her arm, and also could never remember how to use it.
So, with your buddy there, the usefulness of it will really depend on if he remembers to have it on him at all times and how to use it.
comment 8: Just FYI in case you want to consider something that isn't a monthly, paid service. We got a VTech Senior Phone System for my Grandma, and bought an alert ""pendant"" that connects to the system. 
When she pushes it, it automatically dials through three pre-programmed numbers you can enter until someone picks up. It puts the phones on pager automatically so you can talk with them.
Downside is, the alert also triggers a kind of alarm that is a bit loud, and I put pendant in quotes because it is quite large to wear around the neck. We ended up tying it to my Grandma's walker. Not ideal but better than nothing.
Years ago we did try to get her one of those life alert pendants but she never wore it. She only let us get this new one because she blacked out and had a fall and had to crawl through her house to get to a phone.
comment 9: They are great to have. He needs one more so now than ever before. Your probability of falling increases after the first fall. Insist that he wears it or start to arrange care for him.
comment 10: Sometimes repeated falls are an early sign of dementia. (Gerontologist and dementia expert here). The alert systems can be great if the person knows how to use it. If it is early dementia then learning a new device may be very difficult.
comment 11: My mom uses the GreatCalls alert button around her neck.   It works really well.  My brother and I receive calls when she pushes it and medics have always come right away.  The only downside I can see is it has a distance range which for her is ok and it is extremely sensitive.like when she has taken it off to shower it has been alerted.  It’s a peace of mind for us tho knowing help is close by
comment 12: My dad is a veteran and got his for free, no monthly charges either. Vets or their caregivers or friends should check it out.
comment 13: I can’t remember the name of the company we’re using at the moment, but if you’re interested I can get it for you. They have a necklace that we use for my grandmother, and before he died my grandfather had a button that was like a wristwatch. Both activate a central box in the house and call an outside service.
So far my grandmother has not needed her necklace, but if she were to fall and not be able to move, she can use it. The service greets her by name and asks if everything is okay. If she falls in a different room and they can’t hear her answer, they will assume she’s incapacitated and send help. So it’s been a big peace of mind for us. 
You can also press the button on the main box to call for help. My grandmother did that several times and had them call 911 for my grandfather.
comment 14: I am interested for sure and would love the information. That sounds like a good service. Was the watch just for triggering the service or did it also tell time? I guess I wonder if it could replace the spot of a normal wrist watch.
comment 15: I found the company, it’s called Senior Safety. They have a website. (I have no idea if this is the best or only company, also...my aunt found this one and got it set up for my grandparents.)
Unfortunately it’s just a button, not an actual watch. It has a Velcro strap that is remarkably secure. 
Also, they have a lockbox that allows emergency services to get into the house if the doors are locked (the service provides them with the code for the lockbox), but you can get those much cheaper from somewhere like Amazon.

"Looking for recommendations Hi everyone, 
I’m looking for some advice. My grandma who has dementia/alzheimer’s ( not exactly sure)  lives with my grandpa alone together. He is her main caregiver, although she doesn’t recognize that he is her husband ( she thinks they WERE married at some point but not now ) and that she isn’t in her home. She will try and walk out the door to “walk and find her house”. My mother and I don’t live with them but we are close, we use a ring doorbell to see when she tries to leave and go over to help intervene although grandpa is usually able to handle it. My fear is that one day nobody will notice that shes left and we won’t be able to find her. 
The thing is that she always takes her purse with her, does anyone know of a GPS tracker that doesn’t need to be charged too often and works well, maybe that is compatible with an app. All suggestions are welcome. 
Thanks in advance!","comment 1: TILE works well.  It's up and running 24/7, works for a year.  It does work better in heavily populated techy areas, you might want to get a few (they're cheap) and see if it works as you'd like.
comment 2: I strongly recommend a perimeter fence you can lock, if you can afford it.
comment 3: We have definitely been looking at that, my fear is that if she feels caged in if she could get violent. She never has before though.
comment 4: Trackers and alarms are good but there may come a point where paranoia over whether or not the alarm is working, or ""did i just hear it"" in the middle of the night, can be a source of unending stress. 
Putting trackers on them might be an issue if they tend to take things off. My dad and grandma both always took off their id stuff, breaking them to get it off. Tile wasn't around then though so maybe it would've been different? Maybe it could've been sewn in to places they wouldn't notice? 
At some point for my dad, you really couldn't dissuade him once he decided he was going to leave, and he was mostly physically healthy and stronger than me and mom so he could get far in the middle of the night, and it would be hard to stop him. At some point the fence wasn't just an option anymore. :( He did seem to feel caged but.. The option was to let him go for a walk into the highway. 
Its can definitely be tricky to try to balance everyones comfort and safety.  Good luck!
comment 5: I noticed one of these... :( 
So here take this... :D
comment 6: Oof.  
I think the GPS tile type tracker is a good idea.  I don't know where you guys are and what the climate is like, but a missing senior with dementia is an emergency where I am, due to the snow/ice and extreme cold.  The potential for falls/fractures/freezing to death is there.
That said, on top of the GPS tracker, can you install a door alarm or something so that there is an alert when she is leaving?  Does she have a medic-alert type of bracelet or something to help ID her (and her medical conditions) if she were to go missing and be found by a stranger or EMS/police?  When she ""walks to find her house"" where does she go?  Is it always the same route?  Does she have a particular place she is trying to get to (even if it isn't a 'real' place) location wise?  Do you have recent photos of her, as well as a good description of coats/hats/scarves etc that she might wear if she wanders?  I'm sorry you guys are dealing with this, and hope that you are able to find a solution to help keep her safe.
comment 7: After my Nani tried getting out of the house in the middle of the night, our family decided to get 2 motion-activated cameras that send a notification that there is either a sound/motion or the door being opened or closed. That way we can get notified via an app if the door does open at an odd hour and it is also a great way to show her that the door is locked or nobody's home because she does have anxiety now over the door being unlocked or people in the house while they're out.
comment 8: Medic alert works too. Also notify local police just to make them aware.

"Father keeps wandering the streets I want to get an Apple Watch for my father to be able to track his whereabouts when he wanders off, which is happening way too often now. My concern is that he will simply take off the Apple Watch and leave it at home. Does anyone have any solution for this? Is there a way to lock the Watch to his wrist?","comment 1: I would suggest registering him with your local police departments vulnerable persons registry. It’s a GPS bracelet that only comes off if the band is cut. Have you installed locks on the doors? Sometimes people living with dementia can get busy and figure out the locks so installing it at the base of the door may help deter that. If wandering is a concern though it may be time to look into a secured care home for his safety. Good luck to you- I can only imagine how scary that is.
comment 2: Thank you for the suggestions. We’re looking at care facilities but they’re all so cost prohibitive. I’ll look into registering him with Boston police. Happy holidays.
comment 3: I agree about locks at the top & bottom of the door if he spends time home alone. care facilities are definitely expensive in the city, I live in boston & have been through this twice. if you're interested in a good day program or hiring private caregivers, feel free to PM me for local resources!
comment 4: Hi and thank you. He goes to a day program. The issue is nighttime when everyone is asleep. We’ve done a latch at the top of the door but he easily defeated that obstacle. My mother is retiring in a year and looking to sell the house to get a smaller condo so watching him is easier. They currently have three floors.
comment 5: There are GPS locators you can put in their shoes or hide in their clothes. 
You might be successful in finding a solution by searching for gps trackers for autism.
comment 6: Therein lies the problem. Today he left the house at 1am wearing thermal pants and a tank top in the middle of winter. He didn’t wear his winter jacket, which would be the perfect place to hide a tracker.
comment 7: if he takes a wallet or keys or something every time get a TILE tracker
comment 8: He has an iPhone but never takes or charges it. He also leaves his ID and everything else at home. I have tile trackers though, I may try putting one on his shoes or in his pockets. 
Thanks for the idea. 😊

comment 2: Hello?

"How can I (21F) help my mum (56F) before it's too late? TLDR: What is the best course of action to prevent my mum becoming a complete liability and revive her as a potential grandmother? Controversial situation re. money.
Feel free to skim read, or miss out the intro (masses of context).
&#x200B;
Sorry if this is in the wrong place. I understand you all must have a lot on your plates but if anyone could relate to my situation and give any preventative tips it would mean the world. 
A bit of background. My mum was a great mother while my brother (23M) and I were in primary school. She claims she 'always wanted to be a mum' and never had a career. I believe she baby-trapped my Dad (who is wealthy but an arsehole and I no longer speak to), right after she finished her late degree from London School of Economics in anthropology at 35ish. She was abused as a child and left home at 15. She is - or was - intelligent, empathetic, creative, vibrant, open-minded and the most caring person and fabulous mum.
My brother and I went to a private boarding school 4 hours from home at 11 as we got in for free and the alternatives were awful. Half way through this she moved to the middle of nowhere for the only available council house. My brother since the age of 16 has had a steady decline, dropped out of uni, falsely (?) accused of rape, attempted suicide. I've been okay. Dropped out of uni, restarted, now nearing graduation. 
The past 10 years have been abysmal for my mum since she was distanced from her one purpose in life . A slow decline into depression, disassociation, anxiety and arthritis. She was alone, far from friends, unable to work. Lost her car, got into debt. She's now trapped in a cycle of benefits (welfare) that mean if she were to get a job, her house would be taken away and she would end up with less money and no security. That combined with low confidence, low skill, and mental and physical illness have left her seemingly unable to ever rejoin society and hence she is (without sounding awful) forgetful, useless, out of touch. 
Now here's my issue. She could continue the way she is until death (which would probably be early and definitely be alone). She lives the life of a 90 year old. I could visit her for weekends every couple of months and leave her to her devices and not have a financial burden. By the time she needed serious care I'm sure I would be well established in my career and it wouldn't be an issue.
HOWEVER. I have this dream of reviving my mother to the incredible vibrant an creative person she was before we went away, as a grandmother. She needs to find this for herself first or else I would be scared to leave her caring for my children. I would want her to live near me (big city) and not 3 hours away in the middle of nowhere. 
Controversial moment here - no abuse please. I am currently dating a man (52M) who sends me 750 every week. I have been saving 500 of this (2000 of 3000 a month) in the hope of being financially independent as soon as possible. He is wonderful and caring and I could see myself settling down with him in the very near future. 
Here are my questions:
1) Should I focus on saving as much as possible so that in the next few years I could buy property and potentially move my mother in with me to break her out of the council house trap?
2) Should I send my mother money each week so she has enough spare to pursue the zest of life again and get herself out of this mental hole so when the time comes she could be mentally capable to care for herself and her potential grandchildren?
3) Should I settle down with this man, soon, be moved into a big house and potentially have a flat bought for me where I could move my mother? Risks - might not be in my name and if things were to go wrong I would have uprooted my mother from her security. I know how risky it is to rely on a man for that level of support. But it would give a huge boost.
4) Should I live a simple life and move to the middle of nowhere where property is affordable and I can see her regularly and pull her out of this hole myself (something I find very difficult to do - this whole situation regresses me to a childlike state and I hold a lot of resentment).
Orrrr something else. 
Any other advice? I understand this is all a bit... unusual. But I am home for the first time after 3 months at uni and things have escalated. Her bedroom is so full of junk to the extent she has been sleeping on the sofa now I'm here (rather than in my room). Basic chores haven't been done since I was last here. It's like returning to a time capsule except she is regressing. But there is still hope for her, I know it. 
Some more points:
I sent her 150 to get her passport renewed so I could take her to Germany this Christmas to see her dying mother. Don't know where that went and still passportless.
My brother is living in the same area as her but chooses to be blissfully ignorant. He is equally as useless in his own life. 
She has no idea about my current boyfriend - the age or the money. We aren't close. We know we love each other immensely but are unable to connect or talk. I don't know how she would react or if its worth the risk. Maybe the drama would give her something to life for. Maybe she would lose all hope, what little she has left.
This was rambly but therapeutic to write. Sorry in advance.","comment 1: Hi. I relate to a lot of what you’ve written. After trying my best to rescue my own mother for many years I’ve realized nobody can do anything for anyone if they don’t want it for themselves. You sound terribly loving and caring, and also rather codependent. I say this in a loving way, as I see myself in you. What’s been helpful for me is trying to detach with love. It’s not easy, and there is grief and anger that comes with it. Perhaps dome reading on codependency is in order? Could be helpful. Best to you!
comment 2: Thank you for your kind words and for reading. Detach from all love or just love for her? I will do some research
comment 3: I believe that what /u/anklebeard meant was to detach from your Mom's problem, while being loving. You don't have to be mean or angry or rude, you are loving - you're just no longer entangled. You still care for your Mom, but you begin separating your own evaluation of your success from your Mom's situation. You separate your emotional happiness/contentment/peace from being dependent on your Mom's emotional state/mental health.
comment 4: Yup, u/whtbrd is correct and said it very eloquently!
comment 5: Yup, u/whtbrd is correct and said it very eloquently!
comment 6: I think you're giving yourself too much power to be able to cure your Mother either by moving closer to her, or by sending her money.  
She has to want to be helped, before any of these plans can have any meaning.
I also don't want to psycho analyze you, but it sounds like you described the exact same relationship twice, your mother with your father,  and you with your boyfriend.... you might want to consider that ""coincidence"" before moving in with him.
comment 7: Oh, I hadn't noticed that. Very perceptive. Counselling might be in order, to get a third party unbiased take on it.
comment 8: Thank you. She does want help she just is unable to help herself. 
That’s very interesting and very accurate. My brother is turning into my father and I am becoming my mother for sure. Luckily I’m more attractive, intelligent, and supported. Maybe I’m trying to re-live her life and fulfil her dreams knowing I would actually be successful in some attempt to help her. I probably should try and figure out what I actually want in life, other than family.
comment 9: Oh mate. I feel this. I am also from a council estate, my mom has also made a life of terrible choices and lives in poverty. I sent her money for years and years, did everything I could to try and help her but no joy. 
Only recently did I realise she probably has a personality disorder - Borderline Personality Disorder. In short, my whole life I have had to parent my mom. This is not right. You are not responsible for your mom's life, no matter how bad things get. 
She has to want to change.
Have you ever had therapy? Explored your childhood and the patterns that have emerged over the years? I would recommend highly. 
I was able to make sense of my mom's behaviour by reading the r/raisedbyborderlines and r/raisedbynarcissists reddits. 
Finally - and I can't stress this enough - please look after your money diligently. No judgement on your older guy at all, but just protect yourself. 
&#x200B;
Good luck!
comment 10: Thank you so much for your kind words and lack of judgement. I’ve had a few epiphanies after digesting everyone’s answers. I think I’ve accepted now that my mum does need parenting, and that’s okay, but I can’t save her. 
Recently started therapy and have also been listening to the audiobook ‘it didn’t start with you’ which has been very insightful. I’m generally very self aware of my patterns but I need to figure out a way to actually want to break them and discover what I want as an individual - or is that even possible? We are where we come from and all that. 
Anyway, thanks again. Sorry about your mum. Re. The money I’ve been super on top of saving and paid off all my debts. I’m incredibly excited for my future. Let’s hope financial patterns aren’t familial too!
comment 11: First of all, don't marry the guy unless you love him. If you love each other and he doesn't mind giving you money then there is absolutely no problem with your arrangement. But if this is a guy that you wouldn't date if he didn't spend lavish amounts of money on you, then you'd really be no different than a prostitute. You seem to indicate that that is not the case.
Sending your mom money is not going to magically make her a vibrant person again. If she is like old people in America, she'll probably just spend it all on garbage from QVC (literally a TV channel of infomercials) And that was my thought before I read the part about the 150 for the passport mysteriously evaporating. 
Your mom is probably depressed. And the thing about depression is that it operates by mental positive feedback loops (a positive feedback loop is when the outcome of a process increases the probability of that type of outcome) Because of that nature it is very difficult to wrangle yourself out of it, especially if you don't have a social support system. However, and I guess here lies the real kernel of your quandary, is that you have no guarantee at all that taking measures to help her will actually be effective. So you could end up uprooting your life for her, for basically no reason at all; and then, as horrible as it sounds, you'd likely end up resenting her. So given the options you've presented, you're in a double bind.
The only other option I see is to have an honest discussion with her. Ask her if she is happy, ask her if she is depressed. If she says she is happy and that she is not depressed (as people are wont to do out of pride) then just tell her what you think. Tell her that you think that she has become unable to do the things that she believes define her life, and that because of this, she has grown prematurely enfeebled. And tell her that you want to help, but that you can't help without knowing how to help and whether or not she'd be willing to accept your help. Directly ask her if she'd be happier if she moved in with you later on or vice versa.
Chances are that during such a conversation, she would not be immediately receptive to your concerns. But you will have at least planted the seed for her to reach out. Because unless she is the one who reaches out and says ""I need help, I think these things you've suggested doing will help me."" then it is simply far, far too much risk for you to take on.
There is a huge problem with retirees in America and depression, for basically the same reasons your mom is having her problems. A lot of people define their existence by their work, and when there is no more work...well, it is as though there is no more life. I know will sound facile, but the only way to remedy this is by creating a new life for yourself. If you spend your time languishing around the house, then yeah, you'll slowly die and be miserable. But if you volunteer, or start exploring new hobbies and passions, and find new friends, then you'll thrive into old age.
comment 12: I think this is all excellent advice but I'm afraid it will be totally ignored by the OP.
comment 13: Why? Was it too long...?
comment 14: This advice is certainly the most difficult to follow through on, but I believe the most helpful in answering my question. I hope I can gather the courage
comment 15: I'm really happy that you read it and are taking it into consideration. Sometimes the hardest things to do are the right things.  I wish you all the best.
comment 16: Thank you for such a well thought out answer. It means a lot that and you told me the truth I had been avoiding. While I know she is depressed and needs to restart life with hobbies, I was hoping just throwing money at the problem would cause her to do these things on her own. But she needs real support that only a daughter can give, not an allowance like me. I’ll sit her down at Christmas with her brother and ask her what we can do for her. Anyway, all the best back to you!
comment 17: You can’t let your mental health suffer because of someone else’s. My mother killed herself over many years via drugs and alcohol and told me often that she wanted to die. I watched her dig a hole to die in and I got the fuck away and then she died in it. It hurts and it sucks but you have to realize, as others have said, that you cannot make someone change. You can encourage her to seek help but if she refuses you might be better off distancing yourself/setting boundaries so you can protect yourself. I know you love her and want to take care of her but you can’t do it with the goal of making her change because people seldom do that when they’re resigned to being miserable.
comment 18: I’m so sorry for your loss.
comment 19: Your Mother's financial issues are only tangentially related to her social issues - those are more related to her mental health. It's more likely that her mental health is responsible for both her financial and social issues.  
depression, anxiety, hoarding, self-imposed isolation, failure to clean, sedentary - the financial issues are just one of the symptoms. To be sure, they don't help anything, but just throwing money at this problem isn't going to solve it. You moving there isn't going to solve it. You throwing your life at this problem isn't going to solve it. Medical care, therapy, exercise, etc. are tools to help your Mom get on top of it.   
My advice - don't make your life plans around your Mom. Make your plans with your Man because you love this guy and want to build a life with him. Don't presume on his resources becoming your resources - focus on your education, career, and financial independence. You can be open with him about the problems your Mom is facing and how you want to encourage her to get therapy and such, but only ask him for emotional support. Your Mom dug this hole, it's not your responsibility, and it's definitely not his. If he makes an offer, consider it, but just bailing your Mom out of this hole is not necessarily going to save her. Based on your descriptions of her behavior, she'll be in this hole no matter where she's living and how much money she has available to her - until she chooses to get/accept real help with her mental health.    
Encourage her to get treatment. Offer to pay directly for the passport, the therapy, the whatever, but you obviously cannot trust her to use the money you hand her in the way it's intended, at this time.   
When you visit her, plan to help her clean up. Don't just do it for her. Arthritis is most benefited by continued activity. If you're cleaning, she needs to be cleaning.  If she's living in squalor, and refusing to clean, she might need to have adult protective services (or whatever your variant might be, since I don't think you're in the US ) called to give her an evaluation.
Of course there's still hope for your Mom. But she has to be the one choosing it and taking advantage of the resources that are available for her.  
You might also want to try to drag her to a financial advisor, because if she's on welfare and drowning in debt, and has a gov't provided housing, she might be able to get rid of her debt by declaring bankruptcy or something. She has no assets to lose, only debt.
comment 20: Thank you so much for your amazing answer. The strange thing is, she has government provided therapy now and a financial advisor who has pulled her out of debt and keeps her on top of bills etc. She’s now closer to a big city since we moved last year and has access to libraries and book clubs and spaces to volunteer in. But she’s still mentally getting worse re her standards of living. I will have a stern but loving talk with her about the hoarding and general lack of productivity and then encourage her to volunteer at a local charity shop she can walk to, and keep tabs on her social interaction/societal integration.
comment 21: You should work on u and date someone closer to your own age
comment 22: Someone her own age might not be as willing to part with 750 a month for the privilege ¯_(ツ)_/¯
comment 23: >... might not be as willing to part with 750 a month for the privilege
750 a week ...
comment 24: Oh god. I made a comment earlier about how if she actually loves him and that if she'd date him even if he wasn't able to lavishly indulge her with funds then it is perfectly fine...but, 750 a week sounds to me like she can pay all of her own expenses and then some with his largesse. So she actually is just a prostitute, in all but name. Anyway more power to her! The market determines the prices, does it not?
comment 25: “Username checks out”? Anyone?
comment 26: lol
comment 27: It sounds like your mom has some serious mental illnesses. Contact the local mental health board to see if she can get an evaluation, and then some extra support if she qualifies. I am sure the council housing authorities do not want their residences to be in squalor, so they may want to move her to a place with more support - assisted living or a boarding home where they can keep her home in order and she has access to therapy.
comment 28: Fortunately you have being given money and abundance in this aspect. Therefore you have the ability to use these funds in the most effectual way possible. If you choose to pick up the reins of leadership trust your own intuition. You never know how much time your mother has left here so, giving her and guarding her and whatever way you can without draining yourself it's probably the best course of action. I can give you my advice but I don't know your full situation. I think you already know the answer.
If it were me personally, I'd  utilize and go with number two. I would also utilize the services available if you live in the United States of America from The Division of Services for Aging and Adults with Physical Disabilities.  Estate can provide her let's transportation to take her to be around others like her, where she can draw, have people that help her with basic daily activities and visit her, engage and Musical and art therapy. If she is able to use a tablet you can find some good programs that will help her like Luminosity or others that could help her strengthen her mind. You can also with funds or money provide her with a healthy diet of nutritionally rich foods and things shown to Aid and mental and physical health. And of course spend time with her doing the things that bring back loving memories from your childhood. Not so much ones that Force you or her back into your child ego state, but when that bring you both into your adult ego state.  😉
comment 29: This sounds very much like the situation my brother and I texted with our mother even with the arthritis. We helped out with travelling home every so often to do cleaning and shopping, and helping with paperwork. With hindsight, I have no idea if it made any difference to her. It made us feel a little better.

"Can we start a list of ""smart"" devices for the home to help one parent care for the other with dementia? My parents (one with dementia) are determined to stay in their home, and the addition of smart devices may help them do so safely.  I was hoping we could start a specific list (i.e. links to devices) of smart home devices to help make their lives easier.  Some general ideas include cameras to warn when someone may wander outside, smart plugs to turn off appliances when left on, tracking devices or fall monitors, monitors in the bathroom (that also allow privacy?), etc... the caretaker parent is fairly tech savvy.  Any ideas or previous experiences are welcome!","comment 1: An Alexa echo video device. - My parents leave phone off the hook accidentally a lot. And they also don’t take meds even when we call to remind them. The Alexa echo in kitchen allows us to drop in on them without them answering (it beeps and takes 15 seconds to focus) so they know you are dropping in. And we are able to tell them to put phone on hook. Also nice to let them talk to us and grandkids via video with them not having to do anything to activate it. We also use the video to watch them take their pills.  The volume is loud enough that they can hear us from their bedroom even though it’s in kitchen. 
Google has something too but you can’t just “drop in”.  They’d have to “answer” the call...which may be difficult. 
Tile mates - used Tile mates in all their keys to find them if they lose them in apt.  GPS trackers work for anywhere but they are expensive to buy and maintain. 
August smart lock - It allows us to give codes to different workers and revoke them without worrying about keys.  It also notifies our cell phones whenever someone opens, closes, locks or unlocks door.  So if it looks like they are leaving at a time when they shouldn’t be, we can drop in on Alexa above and if necessary call security guard in their building. They’ve  never really left apt unexpectedly but others may be worried about that.  There are many smart locks but this fits on existing interior deadbolt thumbturn. Outside stays the same and still works with keys as always. That’s important because it would be hard for them to learn how to use a real smart lock. 
Smart plug - My mom was putting stuff in microwave in middle of the night that is not supposed to go in microwave.   I just bought a smart plug to disable microwave at night and repower it in morning when we know my dad is awake and can watch her.   Ideally looking for a way to control the range too since we’ve had some issues with both of them forgetting stuff on the stove. But can’t find any reasonably priced solution smart for something with that much power 
Safe - We put a basic safe in pantry where we can store important stuff like papers, I’d, meds.  My mom was taking everything and hiding in her room. 
You can get smart safes that can be remote controlled from afar to give others access to stuff in there without giving them a pin. But we don’t need it yet. 
There are also smart locks that can be fitted into a drawer to make the drawer like a mini safe instead of getting a separate safe.
comment 2: There are GPS tags that can be attached to people's clothes in case they wander.  Make sure the smoke and carbon dioxide monitors are working.
comment 3: For people who wander, the Alerta Patch & Wedge has worked well... Mainly because its not something that dies like GPS.

"(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia? I mention the UK because partly I'm wondering about resources the family (my sister, dad and I) could access or use.  
TL:DR My nan had Vascular Dementia (Early onset) and passed away in her 60s. My mum's (50s) exhibiting some worrying symptoms that MAY be due to post menopause/HRT but kinda seem like maybe they're not and I'm shitting myself. And looking for any options to deal with it.  
Long story:  
My mum's mother passed away several years ago from (I believe) Vascular Dementia - we were told this is a hereditary type and more common in women?   
a HUGE part of her problem was her total social isolation - my mum and her brother never got on with their mum (their dad died when they were teens) and left home ASAP. My grandmother stopped working when she had kids and never went back, lived in council housing that required very little interaction with people and claimed a pension (I assume I was younger and didn't get super involved at the time) church groups and other old lady clubs were constantly dropping by and checking in and asking if she wanted tea or her grass cut etc. She'd stubbornly tell them to piss off and she wasn't a charity case, eventually they stopped bothering. 
From what I recall of visiting as a child she wasn't great - like nothing awful but 'children should be seen and not heard' quite old fashioned (you CAN'T have children if you're not married!) and racist - the point is she wasn't the friendliest, made no effort to get out and stimulate herself and actively pushed people away who would have otherwise helped - even family. 
Part of this is why some of the signs took so long to be noticed - she was angry and snappy at the best of times and we only saw her a handful of times  a year.   
Anyway, I don't want to dwell on that to much, it's simply for context.  
My mum recently (few years back) went through menopause (confirmed over by her GP) and during that period and ever since has just been...not right. 
She can't organise herself (she used to run and manage a busy day care plus the household)
&#x200B;
She forgets things unless they're listed or on a calendar, she needs reminding multiple times where she's supposed to be or what she's supposed to be doing. She get angry at people for reminding her, and angry at herself for having to be reminded.   
She does things that make no sense (like my parents have two fridges and veggies always go in one of them, she'll put them in the wrong one - I know it seems minor but it's something she'd never have done before)  
It reached a peak over the summer when she had some unexplained bleeding and went to the hospital for a few tests (nothing untoward just lady parts being lady parts and it all cleared up) she was a WRECK. She had to be hand held to every appointment, my dad had to take notes for her, she got lost in the clearly signed hospital and (armchair psychologist here) I'd say she had a full blown anxiety attack and anxiety for several weeks, she compulsively made lists, lost track of them, made them again and then fished the shredded pieces out of the bin when we threw them out, whilst getting angry with us. She called me in tears because she got lost at the hospital and she kept calling herself stupid and 'better than this' I spent almost an hour calming her down and then having to speak to my dad to get up to date with her medical stuff so I could talk to insurance for her. The only minor upside is we had a small bonding moment over how awful anxiety is!  
We put a LOT of this down to menopause and hormones - I know first hand from my own experience with BC how fucking mental the wrong balance can make you! As part of the fix for above she had an IUD - half of HRT therapy.
The 'final straw' came about a month and a half ago when she passed out in the kitchen, fell and knocked her tooth out - she was obviously shaken up and what bit of confidence she had is slowly leaving her (she wouldn't even ring the GP to make an appointment because she said she couldn't keep it straight in her head what she needed) and  since then we've spent the last few weeks back and forth to the GP convincing her to try the other half - oestrogen gel.  
I went to one of the appointments with her and ....it was like taking my toddler, she just sat there quietly letting me explain these really intimate things to this GP, I felt awful and patronising, like I was stepping all over her. She just said thanks and could I text dad the details cause she'd already got a bit confused.  
About 4 weeks ago she finally started and we've been holding our breath hoping that this is the answer, the GP did say it should start working almost right away even if it takes a few weeks to go full swing. She has a follow up in a couple weeks.  
Last week we went away as a family together and the length of time we spent together made it really apparent there is still something wrong. 
She seemed almost 'off' half the time, she didn't read anything, she didn't talk much. She joined in with the things we did (like snooker) but got angry at what (in years gone by) would have been good natured ribbing (We're all terrible at snooker XD) she said 'the rules kept changing' .  
She tried to make tea by putting tea bags directly into the kettle, and then claimed she didn't do it and got angry - honestly it felt like she really truly did not have any recollection of doing that action.   
&#x200B;
She's not quite as bad as her mum in that she kept working up until redundancy about 15 to 20 years ago maybe. My dad earned enough to not worry about it and my mums always been a home maker, so she liked being home and my dad liked not having to do house stuff. Since I had my son shes loved being able to care for him as well and it's one of the few things I see her really light up about. 
She's never really been a hugely passionate person, she loved cross stitches and puzzles but her eye sight makes that hard, social wise she had my dad - both of them are just each others best friend and rarely socialise outside of the odd couple friend they have, so she doesn't have a lot of hobbies and she stopped driving years ago and is now too nervous about it to take it up again (and more recently she's got really anxious about the bus) she's almost voluntarily housebound weekdays. She cares for my son a couple days a week (And she is fantastic at that, although I am starting to worry slightly but it's like with him she switches back into old habits and has it together) and we're always over at the weekend (I love my mum to bits and the running joke is I never left home XD) so she's no where near as bad as my nan was - but it's still heavily reduced and very little mentally stimulating activities or things that really keep you on your toes yanno?  
It's to late for her to go back to work (her career credentials have expired and regaining would be like starting from scratch as it's changed so much in childcare) she has very basic IT skills (As much as I love her I wouldn't wish her on the office of my worst enemy!) and frankly she's just to nervous about everything to be of any use doing much. I'm worried the window for keeping her mind active and working has passed....And whilst I'm glad my son can help, the second I think he's in any chance of danger I'll send him to nursery full time (and my mum totally agrees, her biggest fear is accidentally hurting him)  
I firmly think, regardless, she needs counselling for anxiety but getting my mother to understand MY problems with anxiety and depression has been a long up hill struggle that only really achieved her acceptance that /I/ think I have a problem. I suggested she may need to talk to a professional and she just sort of brushes over it. My dad is only marginally better. She absolutely does not want to admit this is a problem, she may have a problem or that that problem may not be solvable with a course of tablets or similar.   
And all of this is made harder by the fact all of us have full time jobs and I have a child to run around after as well. We will absolutely figure something out to run her where she needs to be if we have to, but regardless of intention and desire the fact remains we're all adults with families that also need care and time - luckily we all live about 3 miles apart!  
I'm also aware we lose our patience with her and that makes it worse. My parents have always been sort of low key bickery but recently it's like every weekend is them snapping at each other and with the best will in the world, even knowing she might not be able to help, some of the stuff she does is maddening - i guess sometimes it's akin to asking my kid to get something and him getting distracted by a penny half way through - like I get it! but also dude come on! I asked you to go get your shoes!
I try and help by cooking but then she loiters in the kitchen looking lost and helpless and I feel bad because now I feel like I'm taking away the things that made her feel useful ><  
I'm so sorry for the huge ramble, I am so so scared this is early onset like my nan and there's nothing we can do except watch it get worse. I don't know where to ask for help, I don't know how to get her to come get help, I can't even talk to my dad and sister properly because we're all skirting round the issue hoping the gel will work and she'll start getting back to 'normal'. And I'm looking at my dad who's so far the opposite you'd probably peg him as early 40s and just wondering what the fuck he's going to with my mum over the next decade and then the rest of his life if this does go 'worst case scenario' .  
I'm hoping to find some information about how I could approach an appointment to discuss this - should I make one for me alone (can I even discuss someone else in an appointment for me?) Should I take her with me and ask to speak to the DR alone for a moment, should I just straight up mention it in front of her?  
Does anyone have any HRT experience that could tell me I'm just being an impatient twat and to let it work or adjust it?   
Is it better for my dad (as her husband) to try and seek help?   
Are there any UK counselling services for this, or is going through the GP the best?   
Are there any things we could passively encourage her towards that might help her mentally in terms of activities/hobbies/clubs etc without her feeling to 'old' or 'helpless'?","comment 1: Take her to neurologist. It sounds like dementia but only they can help determine that. Dementia can start in the 40s.
comment 2: I'd call the national dementia helpline. It could be dementia, or it could be severe depression, or anxiety or chemical imbalances. The dementia helpline will be able to give you information tailored to where you live. https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/get-support/national-dementia-helpline this is the national one, if you're in Scotland Alzheimer’s Scotland also has one
comment 3: Hi OP. I'm also in the UK and your family sounds a lot like mine in many ways, including parents being a tight unit with few or no close friends or social group. My mum started to show symptoms when she was in her late 50s. She is now 66 and it took us a while to learn coping skills etc. 
The first thing is to take her her GP. It's important to go with her and have a list of the things you've noticed as you have here. The GP needs to refer to a memory clinic for memory tests and scans that can confirm whther it is dementia and, if so, what kind. Once they diagnose what is happening they will put you in touch with different resources. The Alzheimer's Society are excellent and will do home visits, offer advice and tips and help with planning. There are also numerous Carer's charities depending on where you are in the UK who can give you excellent advice and support. There are also courses and groups specifically for early/premature onset. My mum went to a 6 week course with other people in the same situation  and now goes to a fortnightly 'sensory activity' group for people who are young onset. 
My mum also lost all passion and enthusiasm, but she seems to be getting it back with some prompting. She loves to look at art magazines, have poetry read to her, go to galleries and museums, wander around the shops, watch David Attenborough documentaries and play jenga. Stimulation is important.
We narrowed it down to a focus on three things: keeping her safe, keeping her healthy, and keeping her happy. Doing that can help you stay patient. I struggle with things have to be done in a certain way and it helps me to ask myself, does this really matter? If something doesn't negatively affect her health, happiness or safety i just let it go now. You want to wash every single bauble with shampoo before you put them on the tree - sure, go for it. 
Anyway, GP and contact the Alzheimer's society, they should be able to put you in touch with other resources, even if the diagnosis is not Alzheimer's. 
Try not to panic and catastrophise too much. Take it a day at a time, talk as a family (we have boozy 'strategy meetings') and be as patient and accepting as you can (it takes practice), but don't beat yourself up when you are not! Good luck, and if I can help in any way, let me know
comment 4: Thank you for this. It made me a feel a lot better. 
My sister is going with her to her GP appointment for her HRT review next week and I'll pass all this on for her to take with her. 
I know logically she has to go see someone to be assessed and best case they tell us nothing is wrong and we were just being paranoid. I am worried she will see us suggesting it as an attack though... we're a close family and nothing would permanently hurt that. But it would upset her. 
I want to make sure we don't let it go so far we regret not speaking up sooner...

"Discreet tracking and advice for someone who doesn't know they need help I'm posting for a friend who has a parent showing clear signs of dementia. Last night, he wandered away and did not come home. This is extremely out of character. He lives with his son who monitors his coming and goings. He's not answering any calls, which is unlike him, and the whole family is incredibly worried. 
The individual will not see a doctor and is unlikely to remember to wear the typical tracking bracelets and necklaces. Part of the problem is, he doesn't realize he needs help. 
When they find him, what should his family do? I know it sounds horrible, but can they make him see a specialist? Is there a discreet tracker they can use?
It's a horrible situation for everyone and they're all overwhelmed and don't know how to proceed while maintaining the dignity of their parent. Any advice you can give would be helpful.","comment 1: Tracking is only possible if someone takes something with them. I know they have pet trackers that are smaller and less obtrusive, maybe slip them into something the person always takes with them.
Outside of that, there's not obvious way.
comment 2: Thank you!
comment 3: I am not saying you are at this stage, but one of worst/best things that happened to my family/father was when my father was committed for 4 weeks in a hospital. He was at the gym and said to a attendant that he wanted to die (something he said to us frequently, but was never serious). The attendant phoned to police and they had my father committed. In hospital he was able to visited by a doctor every day who was able to assess his condition and prescribed the correct medication. We also had my father's driver's license taken away, which was also difficult but we are very glad we did. This is in Canada BTW. 
It gave my family time to regroup and assess how to best care for my father. A year after he was committed he was sent to a private care home where he spent the last year of his life. 
I think this event will most likely be a catalyst for the brain scan
comment 4: I heard a company just invented shoes that have a tracker in there. It's hidden in the soles. Its a new product and probably expensive. But might give the family peace of mind.
comment 5: Devices like this bandage are specifically designed for situations like this to notify the family when he wanders so he doesn't lost in the first place! It works well because its not something he will have to remember to wear. Sorry to hear about this situation-- I know its tough!

comment 4: I’m going to be monitoring this post because I am in the market for the same thing for my dad for Christmas. He has early onset and is still pretty aware. I think he’d know if we got him a watch specifically for dementia patients or tried to place a tracker on him somehow (and both would make him upset).
I will also let you know if I come across any good options!
comment 5: So far it looks like the new apple watch is the way to go. It also has some fall alert tech in on that looks pretty cool.
It also has a find my watch feature you can set up for friends and family to ping if needed. 
We will pick up a cell data plan as well since he always forgets his phone, but never forgets his watch. I will drop a reply here as well if we find something else that looks about as good. Same situation here that he is still pretty aware and very sensitive to the loss of independence.
comment 6: My husband bought a Yepzon tracker for his mom to put on her keychain. She won’t use an Apple Watch and she never keeps her phone charged.
comment 7: I looked at a number of options and eventually we ended up getting Verizon's tracking watch for children.  It is only about $100 and just a little per month on our bill.  Not near as much as some that are specific to alzheimer's.
Has time and some other options you can set alarms for things and call him on the watch.  Theoretically he can call me too but that involves a couple of steps so not going to happen.

"Dad needing tracking Hi, I hope this isn't too long- I am new to reddit and just had the thought to search for dementia and ask for advice on my dad here.
He is 64, has had vascular dementia for 3 years. He can no longer work or drive. He is depressed and has never had many hobbies or much interest in social life or picking up new activities so it's very difficult to keep him entertained- I worry about him all the time, as he lives with my mum and I live a few hours away. He goes for a lot of walks every day, to the shops but also just around their neighbourhood. We are thankful because it keeps him physically healthy, but he has more and more issues as time goes on and I'm more and more concerned. He has heart issues now too, and will occasionally have severe chest pain which leaves him basically stuck to the spot in agony. He was attacked by a dog recently while walking. He has not yet got lost but we worry about that too. I got him a tomtom gps watch because it was waterproof and meant to have good battery and be quite resilient, but it only showed where he was whenever I could plug it into my laptop later- I couldn't find him if I ever decided to open the app and look. The watch broke within a year too because he's quite rough with watches I think.
He's never been a phone guy but I purchased a phone for him and a band to wear it like a belt, a shockproof case, etc so that I could just keep the phone connected to my account and track him plus we could call or he could call in an emergency. But he never announces when he will leave for a walk, so my mum can't remind him to take the phone with him, and when I have tried to test by calling it or have tried to get him to attempt calling with it, he's forgotten how to answer or make a call (I made it as simple as I could by having only the Call option on the first screen for him but it still didn't work, I suppose because touch screens are a foreign idea to him). Walking is still one of the only things he enjoys, one of the things that's good for him, and I just need to lessen some of my constant anxiety about him by knowing that we can find him if anything happens. Does anyone have any ideas? Bonus points if you can help me with any other activities to suggest getting him into that he could do around the home- he often potters about in the shed or garden but just sort of pulls weeds or gets big stones out of the driveway because he doesn't like gardening itself.","comment 1: If your Dad obviously has trouble managing the UI of a smartphone. Forget the smartphone and get him a cheap flip phone.
At least with a flip phone, when it rings and/or vibrates, all your Dad has to do is physically open it  to receive a call...Not navigate the UI of whatever smartphone app/OS he is at the mercy of remembering.  At least that way, you have a better chance of him answering an incoming call.
Plus, the long battery life makes it more forgivable than a smartphone if your parents occasionally forget to charge it. 
Your Mom should manage the flip phone for your Dad: Dropping it in his pants pocket every morning (much less obtrusive than a smartphone glass slab,) retrieving and charging it up every evening. Make it a routine, just like making sure he has his wallet and house keys before breakfast.
The dumbest/smartest trick I learned: Setting the ringtone to an old timey telephone ring...Responding to that sound is deeply programmed into anyone around your Dad's age.

> He has not yet got lost but we worry about that too.

>Walking is still one of the only things he enjoys, one of the things that's good for him, and I just need to lessen some of my constant anxiety about him by knowing that we can find him if anything happens. 
Let go of that anxiety for now. Your Dad probably navigates the same old worn paths that he's familiar with and has liked to walk for years. 
As long as he's doing his usual walk thing and not wandering off aimlessly, and you at least have a simple incoming flip phone line he can easily answer, that's all you can really do for now.
All of my best wishes to you and your Mom and Dad.

comment 4: Apple series 4 or above smartwatch - battery can  last 24 hours.  Can act as a phone - very simple phone to use too.  Let it be your mom that charges it.  She's the only one that takes the watch off him and the only one that puts it back on him.  The watch is waterproof so he can shower with it.  It will detect falls and also monitor heart rate for irregular heart beats (though apple doesn't say it will detect heart attacks or anything) - and then send you or your mom an alert.  You can use apples find my friends to locate him with your phone.
jiobit- Does he always wear the same jacket or belt?  If so, You can put this device in a pocket he doesn't usually use or attach it to his belt.  He should never be the one that is responsible for charging it or moving it in any way that way he doesn't misplace it somewhere.  The battery lasts 3 days to a week so your mom can just be the one who charges it at a set time and then put it back right afterward.  The cost of subscription is cheaper than a phone plan.  https://www.amazon.com/Jiobit-Real-Time-Lightweight-Notifications-Reporting/dp/B07CWFBM5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8

"Just have to stand by watching it unfold Mom probably has dementia.
She says people broke into their home and stole things (including jewelry she puts in baggies and stashed everywhere, SOME of her grandmothers silverware but not all of it, and her marriage certificate), then broke in again and returned the certificate.
She loses things constantly, or I should say can never keep track of her things. Not a visit goes by without her calling back to ask if we have seen this or that which she thinks she has left behind. It could be an earring, a book, or a package of over $500 worth of fast food gift cards that they buy at the grocery store in order to rack up fuel discount points because they drive between multiple counties for their grooming, doctors, pet grooming, or to check their mail. (They own and basically live out of 2 houses, hours away from each other, and also come back to the metro area for doctors.)
Last week she told me they were at a community garage sale where my step-dad asked her for change. She said she got the change, set down her wallet to hand it to him, and when she looked back, her wallet was gone. Was it really snatched in an instant? Maybe. Did she possibly forget she set it down and walked away? Probably.
Her multiple credit cards were in there, who knows how much cash, most likely some gift cards, and her social security card. There is no reason she needs to carry all that around with her, but she has probably always done this and she is a creature of habit.
My step-father will never tell her no or make her do anything differently. He is a giver by nature and just wants to keep the peace, so I don't feel like he will ever take control of the situation. She has always been a little bit of an emotional bully as soon as she feels she is being questioned or denied whatever she wants.
And so, since they are both grown adults and she can hold a quick conversation without her shortcomings revealing themselves, this is now how it is.
He has gone from strapping 6' man to barely able to walk with a cane (or two) over the past 3 years due to a sudden back problem which shows no hope of improvement.
Their homes are both 2 story and he has ended up in the hospital due to falls on more than one occasion, once leaving my mother to have to drive towns away to retrieve him after an ambulance took him in the middle of the night. (She knows she shouldn't be driving, gets lost and/or scared when driving, yet does drive on occasion!)
I never hear about anything until later. Their main house is an hour or two away depending on traffic, the mountain home is easily 4 hours away, so with a full time job and 2 small children, I cannot be there.
My only brother passed suddenly 3 years ago after an opioid overdose and she has been in an accelerated downward spiral since then.
Apart from mentally and emotionally distancing myself from them, what coping strategies could I have? I am very strong willed, but still cant help feeling guilty that THEY moved away from the metro area we live in 9 years ago and being unable to do anything to ""fix this.""
It beats me down and any time someone mentions them or asks me how they are doing, I spiral into waves of pity for them, self pity, and resentment  (As in most cases, there are a few other mitigating factors in this family dynamic, but that's pretty much a given with anyone's story, so I'll leave out the gory details.)
When my grandmother was going through her final decade, she moved across state lines to live literally next door to my mom. My brother and I were grown and out of the house. Mom worked full time, but Grandma didn't have dementia until her last couple years maybe, and that was probably due to cancer spreading to her brain.
Meanwhile, MY mom moved farther AWAY when I was pregnant with my second child, to a town with FEWER resources for geriatric patients. I cannot be there for her, but she assured me that when the time came, everything would be taken care of and they have plans for everything.
Plans for everything...
She has been filing extensions on her taxes for decades because she cannot find her paperwork to complete them 100% accurately. This probably involves getting as many write offs for a percentage of their phone bill or mileage they want to claim for my stepfather's ""consulting"" business where he does maintenance on some friends' and acquaintances' machines.
Oh, and there are hoarding issues on both of their parts. One picks up things, the other hangs onto information of all sorts. It's a perfect storm, and apart from the 2 homes, there is another facility that probably cannot even be walked into judging from the last building I saw that housed the objects of this profession.
What do you do? It doesnt feel right to ignore it and push it all aside, but I am powerless to help. They do not want help and are dancing on the fine line between perfectly competent and questionable decision making.
TL/DR: how do you cope with feeling responsible for parents when they want to live life differently than you would see fit, puts them at risk, but does not quite count as incompetent?","comment 1: I don't know the answer to this, but I feel your pain. I struggle with it daily.  
I hope for the best, help out as gently (and sometimes firmly) as I can. And I try not to drown.  
Take good care of yourself.
comment 2: If they are competent (kinda) to make their own decisions, there is not much you can do.  You just have to wait for something bad to happen that will change their dynamic.  And something bad will happen, it always does - financial loss, dementia, whatever.  They will be fine until they are not. In the meantime, don’t let it drive you crazy. I know it’s hard, I’m in the same boat here.  My mine is 92, legally blind, with Parkinson’s - should not be living alone - just waiting for a big enough catastrophe to change his living arrangement.  Hang in there!
comment 3: It usually does not work to argue with someone who has dementia, so I used to use go-arounds.  I used her concerns about someone breaking in to offer to take some things that might get stolen and place them in ""a safety deposit box.""  This strategy worked to get one of her guns out of the house.  I also used an auto theft in the neighborhood to convince her to let me put a gps tracker on her car (so we could find it if stolen, when really it was to make sure we could find her if she got lost).  I also convinced her to let me put security cameras in the house.  These were ones that I could see using an app on my phone.  That way, I could check everyday to make sure that she hadn't fallen, and I could also watch anyone coming into the house (since they become vulnerable to scammers).  Also, when she started having trouble with food, I ordered Meals on Wheels and had other food delivery services.  I live several hours away, so these technological options helped a lot.
Also, their personality and their openness to assistance changes across time (at least that was true for my relative - not sure if that's true for everyone).  Some people who are unfriendly before dementia can become sweet after dementia.  They usually become more child-like and open to being nurtured and ""parented.""   
There are some things I just let go of, particularly if it's not a safety issue.  That helped me somewhat.   And then it also helped to think of these issues as intellectual problems to solve, so I used my mind rather than feel anxious about it.  
The other thing I would say is that whatever deep childhood wounds one has, they can be triggered by this experience.  But I think it has been an opportunity for me to face those and grow stronger.  I also have come to admire her courage and see her in a very different light than I used to.
But also, I would say that it's okay to feel pity for yourself and pity for them.  And to feel pain and sadness and anger and guilt.  I don't know that there's a way to get through this without feeling those things.
comment 4: Thanks for the advice and listening. I appreciate it!

"Your opinion on some of these medical alert device commercials? I know these commercials are nothing new but there’s one In particular that I’m getting frustrated with and I think they are taking things a bit far. I am curious what others think about this. Obviously falls are incredibly serious. I suspect these companies are tired of people poking fun at the old “help I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!” commercials, or they are just trying to drive their point home. But I think it’s too graphic. 
I know how this sounds, so hear me out. It starts out with a warning that you may be offended, and goes on to an elderly lady lying sprawled on the floor screaming and crying for help in the dark. This scene is a lengthy and very realistic. It’s pretty unsettling. The reason it aggravates me is because it really upsets my grandmother, like really upsets her. This commercial comes on all the time on a channel she likes to watch so that we don’t even put the channel on anymore. I suppose maybe there are people out there who aren’t convince that an emergency alert device is necessary for their elderly loved ones and maybe this commercial is supposed to convince them? But I think the companies putting out commercials like this  didn’t really consider how it might effect the very people they are trying to help, which includes those with certain conditions, to repeatedly see this disturbing commercial. I’m sorry if anyone thinks I am being dramatic, I am really just wondering if anyone has seen this commercial and what you think about it.","comment 1: Full disclosure- I work for a medical alert company. That's how I found the post.   
Do you remember or could you find out which company is running the ad? I would be interested in seeing it/digging around the company behind it.   
In fairness to them, it is a very serious problem and I guess they feel ""shocking"" the viewer into seeing the reality is their sales tactic. Seems aggressive and offensive to me but it must be working because they have TV Ad $.
comment 2: I’ll try and see which one it is next time it comes on. And I guess that’s what I figure too, either they genuinely want to make a point or they just want money.
comment 3: So it appears the commercial I’m referring to is from Life Alert
comment 4: Figures. Sort of their M/O to get people with fear and lock them into years of binding contracts. Ew
comment 5: That's half the reason my mom with dementia is no longer allowed to watch television. Others in the memory care unit she's in still have televisions but mostly blast CMT or something neutral. Mom when she had a a television in another room played a lot of MeTV stuff and almost all of the commercials after 5pm are aimed at the elderly, including some of those disturbing ones. She'd claim those really happened in her room or in her hall so when she moved from a regular room to memory care, television didn't follow. You're not alone in thinking they're over the top.
comment 6: Thank you for sharing your experience with it. I’m not usually sensitive about graphic stuff on tv but this is just different
comment 7: They have to be shielded from so much because they can't process things the way we do and so much more is terrifying that wouldn't have even been on their radar pre-dementia.

Does anybody here use wearables (e.g. Apple Watch) to keep track of their loved one with Dementia? Would love to hear your thoughts. ,"comment 1: I just bought the 5 with cellular for my dad. He was just diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and he mostly needs help telling time (analog is hard for him) and an ability for us to keep track of him. We track him on his phone but he forgets that (even pre-Alzheimer’s, he was not a phone guy). It also has fall detection. AND for his parkinsons, we make sure we keep him active so I wanted the activity monitor. It’s not the cheapest way to achieve this and if it’s really not working, we’ll give the watch to another family member.
comment 2: This is super insightful!
comment 3: Is there a good app for seeing where he is with the watch?  I really like life 360 but it doesn't seem to be compatible with the watch.  I don't like using apples find my phone feature as much as history isn't as easy to get.
I use the watch with my dad mainly for fall detection.  He nearly always remembers his phone so I use the phone to track him.
He always takes his phone off when showering though which is a problem.
I was tempted to get him one of those prisoner trackers so he couldn't take it off.  But thry seem to all have bad reviews and thry don't look good.
Also, there are trackers who's batteries last for a week.  If you are only using the watch for tracking, that might be an option instead.  They don't have fall detection tho.
comment 4: We just use find my friends. Haven't really thought about history as much as just looking to see that he is where he is supposed to be.
comment 5: My dad always eats lunch at restaurants.  I'm just checking his history to make sure he went out to eat in case he starts forgetting to eat.  He was losing weight for a while and I didn't know if it was cause of not eating (it wasnt).
Thanks.
comment 6: How do you get him to remember to charge it every day?
comment 7: In my case, my mother handles that.
comment 8: I added my dad to my Apple account. Can see his location 95% of the time. Seems to work ok, excepted when he’s angry at me and turns it off. 🤨
comment 9: I tried a couple of the cheap (>$100) watches and for both the GPS was always off, if you use the circle alerts, you may have a heart attack when you get a false alarm that he is 2 miles out.
We went back to the phone, he likes it. He has an Android and we use this app Localizador Corcanoe https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=corcanoe.gps.tracker&hl=es it has been very good, more accurate than the watches, it has an out of range notification and since my dad doesn’t use much the phone battery last an entire day or two. From a Mac I use the find Android to see where he is.

"Christmas Gift Advice Hi; my dad has early onset Alz (diagnosed at 56, 5 years ago) and is still in the moderate stages. Does anyone have suggestions for a simple toy or activity my family could give him for the holidays? He’s still very aware of/embarrassed by his forgetfulness and challenges so I want to find something that isn’t too obviously designed for children, like some of the Alz “toys” I’ve seen. We have an Alexa system for him to listen to music and podcasts, but he’s had a lot of nervous energy lately and needs something to do with his hands. Thanks in advance","comment 1: Have you heard of fidget blankets? I just searched “fidget blankets for dementia” and there are a ton of different options
comment 2: I haven’t, but I just looked them up and they look like a great idea! Thank you!
comment 3: Hope you find something that will work!
comment 4: My mom also has a fidget blanket which works great, but if you’re wanting something like that to carry around in public if he feels uncomfortable with the blanket, I would suggest a fidget cube. You can find one easily at Walmart or online, and it’s great for keeping my mom’s hands occupied with its switches and buttons.
comment 5: My ALZ support group leader suggested a lap blanket made of different textures for our loved ones to run their fingers over.
comment 6: Definitely going to look into a blanket! Thank you!

comment 13: Unfortunately reading and writing aren’t very functional anymore; puzzles are a great idea though, thank you!
comment 14: How about an art or craft or music or something he can do on his free time? Plus leaning new things helps.
comment 15: my dad loves music and mentioned that he wants piano lessons.  Do you have any suggestions on finding someone that could ""teach"" a person with moderate ALZ?  I thought of just calling around and telling people of the situation and asking if they have any particularly patient teachers?  Of course he won't actually be able to learn anything, but he's still with-it enough that he may be able to string together a few notes in a session...

"Seeking At Home One Patient Caregiver Appl Hi Caregivers! 
I hope y’all all are having a great day. 
Also, thank you for all that you do. It’s hard work with little thanks, but know that you are appreciated. 
My husband is the “House Manager” and caregiver for a close family friend who has MD. Our family friend is fortunate that he is able to afford 24/7 at home private care. We have also just hired two other people to assist with care. 
The issue we are encountering is a lack of communication between all of us. We need to monitor eating habits, water/other drink consumption, BM, daily mood/behavior and be able to communicate appointments, warnings and a daily general report. 
I’ve done some research and tried some caregiver tracking apps (CareZare, CareZone, CareCore, Carely, Care Angle & Capella Care), but haven’t found anything to meet our needs exactly. 
CareZare is exactly what we need, but it’s not well developed nor reliable. The rest of the apps had some key points of needs, but ultimately missed the bar. 
I was wondering if y’all had any suggestions or could refer an app. We would prefer to use an app vs paper log, just to streamline things. Anything is appreciated! 
Thank you for your help in advance & I hope you have a wonderful day!","comment 1: Clear Care is the app that my caregiving agency uses. I would recommend using an agency because they hire and train caregivers and allow family members and friends to get a break in caregiving duties.  They also can provide workmen’s Comp and insurance for the caregivers. They work with available schedules and provide both logbooks for the caregivers to make notes and communicate, plus an online app for recording incidents and checklists for each shift. The logbook should be kept in a visible common place so that all caregivers can record each shift in it. They can also make notes for one another.  There should be one relative or friend who is a point person, who helps make any big decisions.  If you get a social worker or case worker for him, they can help navigate a lot of the decision making and care.

"Does Alexa and other smart devices really work? I keep seeing these as suggestions, but my mother-in-law would NEVER be able to remember the name, and I’m not sure she would be able to figure out the commands. 
She is early (we think) in her dementia, but has a poor memory anyway and she all but needs to follow written directions to use her CD player, and always has. 
How do you get you dementia patients to remember what to say to get a smart device to play music and answer questions?","comment 1: It took my mom a while to remember Alexa. But she started using her for the time of day and date. We slowly added skills as she got more familiar. Now she uses the reminder feature for her drops (and I can program the reminders from my app) and she can use Alexa to set the temperature in the house.  Also, I programmed Alexa to tell her “Good night” and I can announce things like “your phone is off the hook”. All in all, Alexa has been so helpful to us both. With the added cameras so I can see what is going on, it has given both of us peace of mind.
comment 2: Alexa worked for a while for us. I programmed reminders. I made a wake up routine and put a sign with the start phrase beside it. I start it for Mom now, but it has become a comforting part of her nightly routine. We also used it as a backup when Mom would forget to hang up her phone. We could call her from our phone on the Alexa app and tell her to hang up her phone. We also made play lists for her. Signs beside the devices told her what to say.
comment 3: I got it for my mom a couple years ago. She barely can work a tv remote. At first, she couldn’t remember the name, so I wrote it on a big card where she sits. Then I would slowly build on that with asking Alexa the time or date. Setting up reminders has been a help for me to tell her what needs to be done at certain times, like meds.  You can get specific in saying exact wording for reminders, Now she can""t stop thanking her and saying good night. She likes the bit of back and forth talk.
comment 4: My boyfriend and I purchased an Alexa and Google home mini for my mother who is diagnosed with dementia. She's 61 and we bought them before she moved in with us thinking she will be able to use it herself since it's voice commands. Yeah that doesn't happen. She has no clue and would never remember what to say. BUT if you download the app for either device you can control it from your phone. We have the Google upstairs for my mother and downstairs is the Alexa that we actually use. I use it for my mother for just music but since she can't work the TV remote it gives me some security knowing I can play music for her even when I'm not home.
comment 5: My mom has never been able to work them. She couldn't remember the name of the device they had and then couldn't remember how to phrase her request to something it could do. She stopped trying to work it pretty quickly.
comment 6: Ma can turn on (but not off) her two bedroom lamps with the Google. We can also make announcements to her room (dinner's ready). We hoped for more, she seems content, though.
comment 7: I've thought about that too for my dad but this is a man who barely even understands his AOL email and there is no way he would figure out what Alexa is or what it can do for him.
I have thought about getting it to use as a video monitor while I'm not home, where I can call him and talk to him if I need to (if he hears me, that's another issue!).
comment 8: Are there smart devices that have helped the caregiver?  I'd like to get my elderly parents (mom has dementia) smart doorbells, smoke alarms, outlets, thermostat, etc... but only want to do so if it helps.  My dad is fairly competent using android devices.

"Any recommendation? Hi everyone, 
I was hoping someone could recommend a radio for my grandmother. She has dementia and has a lot of trouble with any device that has too many button. Lately, she has been asking for a radio to listen to Christmas music. We bought her a radio but it has too many buttons and she has a lot  trouble tunning it to her favorite stations. We found a one button radio, but it's out or our budget ($100). I was hoping to find a decent radio with preset station buttons (preferably large buttons) . I have been googling for a while, but found nothing. I was hoping someone on here had a good recommendation?","comment 1: Is Wifi available where your grandmother lives? If so I would recommend getting an Alexa from Amazon. It plays excellent music and no buttons. She would just say ""Alexa play Christmas music"". My mom has one and uses it for music. She had trouble remembering what station she liked so I put a sticky note by the Alexa that says ""70's soft rock"".
It also helps with other things, like lists, etc but my mom mainly asks about the weather and music. Also she asks what time it is a lot too.
comment 2: Hi, thank you for the advice. Unfortunately, she has a lot of trouble with names. She mixes things up a lot. For example, one of her favorite all time restaurant is called Domenic's… 2 years ago she started referring to it as Lorenzo's for some reason. She hasn't stopped calling it Lorenzo's. She does this with people's names too.
comment 3: https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Rechargeable-Neodymium-Speaker-Automatically/dp/B07415WG1L/ref=sr_1_9?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI27ev-tiQ5gIVCtvACh0rEgsQEAAYASAAEgJ2DPD_BwE&hvadid=267948026588&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9027285&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=e&hvrand=3734980745988898742&hvtargid=kwd-304790733260&hydadcr=24627_9648891&keywords=radio+for+dementia+patients&qid=1575074290&sr=8-9 
not sure if this would work but have a look. Could also consider a device like Alexa, maybe a Christmas sale. You could set it up for her to just ask to play music. her voice has to be clear tho. My dad has PD and his voice fluctuates alot and his Alexa has a hard time with him. But you can even set her up an amazon prime acct and add her fav tunes to her playlist.
comment 4: I'm sorry to hear that your grandma has trouble with radios. My grandpa is pretty much the same, except he has trouble with the TV. He doesn't like working with the remote because of...too many buttons. 
I was wondering if your grandma has a TV and has access to music channels. I think some music channels tune to Christmas music at this time of year. I have Comcast Xfinity and it offers a wide range of music channels called Music Choice. The channels are within the 400 range and I was able to locate Sounds of the Season on channel 441 (the channel plays music that goes with the season, such as Christmas as this time of year). Experiment with this with your grandma and see if she likes it. 
Hope this helps!
comment 5: Check out the Simple Music Player. It basically just has an on/off and a button for skipping songs. That’s it. The caregiver loads it with MP3s via a flash drive and sets the volume by pressing a hidden button with a pencil. It also resembles an old timey radio. Unfortunately we got it a little too late in my dads disease for him to learn to use it, but I think for some people it would be really useful.

"Dentures As my (28) father's (84) full-time, live in caregiver, I must admit, it's far less scary for me to hear him say,
""Where's my teeth?""
As opposed to:
""Pffhwairsh mah pffeeff?""
Trying to find his misplaced dentures on a now fairly frequent basis is a nerve-racking new development. It sounds comical, and admittedly it sometimes can be. Once, I found them stashed in a box of Oatmeal Cream Pies.
Does anyone have any tips for keeping better track of said chompers aside from the impossibility of truly constant monitoring? (As I think all live in caregivers know, there's also a household to take care of in addition to a loved one and chores inevitably must be done during my dad's down times. Not to mention, we need time to take care of ourselves as well.)
He says he likes to take his teeth out when he ""naps"" (he doesn't nap and hasn't since the latest progression of the Alzheimer's), ""to give my gums a rest"". But he's so up and down, in and out of bed all day long, I feel overwhelmed at the thought of dropping everything else I have to get done to help him with his teeth about every 5 minutes at least two dozen times a day. (No, that's not much of an exaggeration.)
Sometimes I'll help him put his dentures away properly after breakfast and before lunch so I know exactly where they're at and then try to distract him away from them until he needs them again to eat his other meals. But this feels.... cruel to me in a way. I don't know. I'm fumbling ungracefully throughout this entire process, but this particular thing is really wearing me down. Any help or humorous observations are welcomed. :)","comment 1: My solution is cheap web cams from Amazon. Mother in law hid a bracelet the other day and it became a ""situation"", tracked it down to a box under her bed two days before.
comment 2: I don’t have a solution but as another younger caregiver, how do you find time for yourself? Do you work? Go out with friends? I’m struggling to have my own life in some ways. I’m just curious.
comment 3: [deleted]
comment 4: Dude, your siblings should be the primary caregivers, and give you the space and opportunity to establish your own career! Unless they (or your parent?) have you in their will, in recognition of the huge sacrifice you are making.
comment 5: [deleted]
comment 6: It sounds like you would benefit from having a family meeting. They are taking advantage of you and you need to remind them that they need to be more present. I would get your thoughts in order and written down first. And assume they aren't being assholes deliberately but are not being mindful of your needs, you're dad's needs, and their actual contributions to his needs.
You should consider taking online classes that would allow you to work towards a degree online while you are your dad's primary caregiver. If you cannot afford this, if you don't have a decent laptop, then your siblings should help you with this, happily (not grudgingly!). You want to remind them of their responsibilities without alienating them. You want them to understand that you need help! In home caregivers make real money. You cannot make money while you are his primary caregiver. This puts you in a pickle! You are frustrated, feel alone, and feel your own future slipping away. You are stressed and they need to know this. You also need regular breaks that do not have you worried about him while your are gone.
How are bills paid and groceries bought? Medical care like doctors visits? 
Anyway. Yeah, a family meeting is my suggestion. If they do not cooperate and /or are jerks, I have no practical advice. But you need to look out for yourself also.
comment 7: Yeah, it’s really hard. I’m not sure what to do. Thanks for the response and taking the time. It’s comforting to know I’m not the only one.
comment 8: I found myself in a similar situation: I agreed to move my mother in law into our house without full knowledge of what we were getting into. First few weeks were a night mare, me hired someone to help during the day, but nights and weekends became hell.
From the get go I did my best to avoid getting my kids involved, they are young adults with a life ahead. Making them miserables from a decision they  were not part wasn't fair.
Eventually things have slowly  improve the last five months, a combination of better diet, no more crazy pills, huge amounts of coconut oil and CBD have made our situation tolerable. 
We are supposed to take a break for a couple of months since my brother in law is taking over for a while, I'm worried he will mess up mp progress.
As for taking time for yourself, I mountain bike as much as schedule and the wife allows, and she goes to the gym and does arts and craft. The thing is we now seldom go out by ourselves together which mis hard. But I'm working on that.
comment 9: [deleted]
comment 10: Hang in there, also do take a look at CBD, ketone diets and coconut oil. At least the CBD is good for oneself, if you won't try it on your patient.
comment 11: Also I use retainer cases for my mother’s. I bought like 5 and leave them around the house.
comment 12: No real help, but know you're not alone. My grandma does the exact same thing with her glasses. She's completely lost all her recent pairs and only has one way out of date pair, and *coincidently* has been complaining of headaches... gee, I wonder if it's from wearing out of date prescription glasses?? Not much can be done in our case, other than order a few new pairs and hope she doesn't hide/throw them out immediately. Does your dad have a few pairs on the go or just one? Have backups, just in case. And keeping track of his dentures as you do on some days is not cruel, it's helpful to you both to know their location. I'm sorry this is frustrating! Caregiving is tough and can feel very unappreciated, but know you're doing your dad a great service and it's a true act of love :)
comment 13: [deleted]
comment 14: No solution, but hoping for an answer....we are in a similar situation.  Lost teeth happen on a regular basis.
comment 15: I paid 2K for a dental bridge for my mom that got lost 2 days after I paid the bill. She is in a memory care facility. I have searched the room a couple times, but no luck.
One of those ""What was I thinking"" moments!
"
Thoughts on a wearable device for dementia We are a team in MIT Hackathon and we were interested to ask what are your thoughts on wearable glasses for patients with dementia? Is this something  the caregiver community would be interested in?,"comment 1: For what?  They'd probably take them off and ""put them somewhere"" and lose them.  
&#x200B;
IME, everyone's trying to come up with apps and gadgets and doohickeys that might work for a day or two before the patient breaks it, or progresses past being able to use it... and then those thousand-dollar prototypes are useless.  What we really need is something to help caregivers not burn out, and solid support staff.  If you design anything, how about a system for police to know when the raving elder they're trying to corral is just demented, not coked out and dangerous? 
The gadgets and apps are like watching a movie when you have appendicitis.  That's great and all, but what we need is real solutions.
comment 2: There are amazing new phone apps to address behavior issues: wandering (GPS tracking devices), sundowning (CALM and sleep apps), medication reminders and more. More apps targeted toward CAREGIVERS: addressing behaviors, bathing tips, etc. would be great. I also think the ""glasses"" idea probably won't take hold. A device to help locate misplaced items, such as glasses would be beneficial. Dementia patients ""hoard"" and misplace things often. Simple locators to attach to devices would help early onset people with dementia and caregivers.
comment 3: At least with my mother everything just ends up in the fridge.  Except the milk and butter.  So I know where to look for the TV remote
comment 4: Glasses would not be viable as they lose them often.
comment 5: I lost several pairs of my own sunglasses to my dad pilfering them somehow from out house.  But then he'd lose his in the care facility and end up with someone else's glasses, even reading glasses.
comment 6: What is the purpose of these wearable glasses? To correct vision? Or to confuse and annoy a patient who does not understand their purpose? (What is their purpose??)
It is hard enough to keep eyeglasses on the faces of patients who have worn glasses their entire adult lives. There is little chance someone diagnosed with dementia will tolerate wearing new eyeglasses for any purpose, no matter how useful they may seem from the outside.
comment 7: I agree. My mum has been short sighted and worn glasses since she was 7 and she has lost 23 pairs of glasses in the last 6 years. She also adamantly refuses to wear them on a string around her neck when they are not on her face. I feel like I spend half my life looking for her glasses. Just this morning I found her 'spare' set in  her underwear drawer. Her current main set is yet to be located today...
comment 8: There was a period where I would have been grateful for a short range tracker, that would help me find Dad or set off an alarm on my phone if he wandered out of the house. Now that he’s in care I think such a device would be handy for new arrivals who haven’t settled in yet and are most prone to trying to get out of the building. I agree that most dementia patients won’t wear glasses unless they have had them for a long time already. Dad was still wearing a wristwatch for a while and that could have been a useful place for a tracker?
comment 9: I agree completely. The most useful wearable device would be better tracker options. We just can't find a tracker that we think my mum would actually WANT to wear and on every occasion when she has properly gone missing she didn't take her phone with her so we couldn't even track that. If there was an actually attractive necklace, bracelet or brooch that she would really like that would be way better. 
This is a serious issue for us right now because she recently went missing for 12 hours and was found by police 70 miles away, at 1am. We have no idea how she got there or what happened but the whole thing was terrifying for us (she told me the next day that she had a wonderful time although she has given us no details of it)
comment 10: My sympathies! Dad walked out of hospital and up to the main road before being helped by a very nice young lady who could see he was a bit confused and took him to a nearby pharmacy and called police. I only got to stammer a brief but heartfelt thanks to her.
comment 11: Your title says wearable ""device"", but your post says ""glasses"". I'm confused about this. Glasses usually get lost or get stepped on. 
A device that a senior would wear as a necklace or such is much easier and maybe no accidents would occur with that device.

"GPS tracking unit I'm glad I found this group, today's question is something light.
Adult Protective Services was called (again) on my step father, he is getting lost. They want me to get him some sort of GPS tracking keychain / necklace etc. Looking for some recommendations.","comment 1: A simple fix if he carries an iPhone is to use the Find Friends app. If he has an iPhone and you want more into on how to set it up let me know.
My mom was/is extremely resistant to wearing any kind of tracker or life alert system which is very frustrating, but luckily she carries her iPhone around. Good luck with your stepfather.
comment 2: We installed the life360 app on my mothers phone. Obviously they would need to have their phone with them but so far she's been pretty good about having it on her when she leaves the house. It's a pretty easy set up. We have been ok with the free version so far. The free version allows you to set up two alerts so we get notifications when she leaves or arrives at her home. Though it does have a bit of a delay. I don't know if the paid version is any faster.
We are still interested in having something else as a safety net. Maybe something that pairs with her phone that would alert her and us if she left the house without one or the other?
comment 3: Identify something he always wears or carries and go with that.  We got a tracker for my FIL that we put in his shoe.  The problem was, the day he took the car for a joyride my MIL hadn't swapped out the tracker because he was going to be with her.  (But then she left him in the running car to go into the store!  Argh)  The most important thing is for it to always be on him.

"Grandma and the rise of technology. Basically, my 84 year old grandmother is wearing my mother down. We live in the same house, which is split. My Grandma has a basic apartment to herself as she is still able to manage herself to a degree. Her memory for things has greatly declined, and yesterday she pretty much forgot who her eldest daughter was when my mother (second of 4 siblings) reminded my grandma. 
Regarding my post. She insists that she continues to have a phone. Demands a cell phone or a landline. We have gone through quite a few of each. A flip phone with basic tech to big buttoned land lines. She cannot grasp how technology works anymore. She comes out and gets angry, throws fits saying how she wants a land line ""you have a land line grandma"", how she doesn't understand after we explain it both verbally and in written form. We write extremely legible and simple instructions, that she never follows.
After these confrontations my mom is in tears of frustration and sadness. There's more to my grandma's fading world, but right now my focus is on tech. Could anyone who has experienced similar suggest anything with a voice command option? has Alexa or an echo worked, something that requires no pushing of buttons as she has a light touch and claims to press buttons but ends up turning the phone off in the end. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","comment 1: Who does she want to call?  
My mother presented a similar scenario. She didn't really need to call anyone, she just insisted on having a cell phone. She had a flip phone that we set up with a single number dial for each of her children. She had a little list of who was at each number. She never used it to call anyone. She just insisted that she have it in her purse. A year later we cancelled her phone plan and let her carry her phone around in her handbag.
comment 2: Sorry to copy paste my reply from poster above, but it requires the same response. 
""She does try to call people. She has her sister and decades old friend she talks to in another state. Along with making appointments for herself and talking to a local friend or two from the local synagogue, and talking to the family Jewish center.
It wouldn't be so bad if we could just hook a phone up to an automated system that just responds to her calls, but she's still capable of calling and talking to people. ""
comment 3: If she is actually trying to telephone someone, perhaps try a product like this https://www.alzstore.com/memory-picture-phone-p/0030.htm
If it's more about seeing / believing that she has a phone, but not actually using it to make calls, maybe get an old rotary phone?
I'm sure an amazon echo or Google home could have the ""talk only"" functionality that you are looking for, but depending on her cognition, she may not be able to use the tech or even identify the tech as ""a phone"" regardless of how many times she is told or how detailed written instructions are.
Good luck
comment 4: She does try to call people. She has her sister and decades old friend she talks to in another state. Along with making appointments for herself and talking to a local friend or two from the local synagogue, and talking to the family Jewish center. 
It wouldn't be so bad if we could just hook a phone up to an automated system that just responds to her calls, but she's still capable of calling and talking to people. 
The phone you linked is one we have not tried. You may be right with her not being able to process the echo as a phone. Just trying to find any suggestion and go from there. I will pass along the info, ty.
Edit: added words
comment 5: What about an intercom with the button labeled as CALL DAUGHTER?
comment 6: She is still pretty functional with calling people and talking to relatives and making appointments as long as she follows her calendar, but your suggestion may be useful in the future. Thank you.
comment 7: Have you tried a simplified phone, such as the Jitterbug Phone? It's designed for seniors. Whatever phone you choose, make sure her contact list is limited to only a few numbers:  the people & numbers she would most need.
Updated thoughts:   Does she know how to use Siri? (if you're using iPhones) I believe you can set it so all your grandmother has to do is raise the phone and say, Hey Siri, call Sally and it makes the call for her. ...
The sad reality is that her condition will progress, and she won't be able to figure out what to do with objects like phones, no matter how simplified. Even light switches and toothbrushes become puzzling to someone with Alzheimer's, so they need more and more help. Her frustration is understandable, because sometimes during those moments, she knows something is wrong but can't do anything about it. Other times, she doesn't get frustrated, but YOU will, because she doesn't realize anything's wrong and it's a skill she knew just a few hours ago -- like using her toothbrush to brush her hair or not remembering how to put on a shirt. 
When she gets frustrated, maybe you can agree with her that it's frustrating and redirect her attention to a different solution: ""How about if I sit with you and help you make the calls you need to make? I can come by every morning or evening and we'll do that together."" And maybe her friend and sister can agree to call her more regularly, so she has less need to call them (I'm assuming they know about her condition and that she may need some help?)
comment 8: We actually got the jitterbug last week and she's still having issues with it. If i recall there's a total of 12-13 numbers on the phone. 
She would have no clue what a siri could possibly be. 
You've described a lot of what's currently going on with her. The frustration and bouts of anger, the sadness that follows as she tries to understand. This is all quite so daunting. I've taken the time and read through some of the posts on this sub and have a slightly better understanding of things to come and the patience required. I plan to show my mother these posts and have her read through as well. 
I'm pretty good at switching her moods around and focusing on other topics when i sense the conversations going one way. My mom on the other hand, see's things with a laser focus and barrels through the frustration, which adds to her own frustration. 
Tons to think about, this is quite the journey. I thank you for your suggestion and thoughts.
comment 9: I'm with you, my friend! Check out Teepa Snow's videos -- they've been so helpful for us. This video is one where she shows how to approach and walk with a patient.

"Aging parents &amp; painkillers/opioids My mother is in her early seventies and my dad is in his late sixties. I'm in my late thirties. They're divorced and both are disabled (rheumatoid arthritis for my mom, mental illness and back issues for my dad). Both have been on doctor-prescribed pain medication for years; my father is also a former heroin addict who continues to buy unprescribed pills from neighbors/dealers.
As they get older, my siblings and I had to pick up a lot of the slack for medical/financial planning, etc... and it's getting frustrating as fuck because honestly they're zonked out half the time I talk to them. For both of them, they routinely lose track of conversations after a few minutes, have sharp mood changes out of nowhere, or even fall asleep in the middle of talking/socail interactions after a few minutes.
AFAIK, my mother is prescribed hydrocodone and father is prescribed gabapentin.
Even though they're both relatively young, there's lots of hospitalizations and health issues getting out of control because they just don't take care of themselves. My mother was hospitalized for a few weeks due to an undiagnosed heart issue, is put on a strict diet, then goes back to eating fast food 3x a week a few weeks later. My father ""loses"" his pills so the doctor will prescribe him more all the goddamn time.
It's really frustrating because my siblings and I are trying to work with our parents so they have a decent quality of life in the future, but from our perspective they're just fucking high all the time. I know they both deal with chronic pain, but when I try to sit down and map stuff out with them it's just like they're out to lunch mentally.
Complicating it is the fact that they were doting parents when I was younger; they were complete shit at things like paying the rent, keeping the electricity on and holding down a job, but they were never abusive and always prioritized us at the expense of themselves.
I'm just at my wits end... I want to help them, they dont want to help themselves and it's really shitty. Anyone else been in the same situation or dealed with a similar situation? What did you do?","comment 1: Yeah I’m dealing with it now, check my post history because I don’t have the energy to explain why I get you.
My advice- don’t ever move them in with you or next door like I did. Keep a safe distance I wish I would have.
comment 2: > don’t ever move them in with you or next door like I did. 
I think that's good general advice. My wife and I actually bought a condo for her mom to live in about 10 years ago, and part of the discussion was that a cheap condo is probably cheaper than a murder charge. It's only about a 5 minute drive away, but that's far enough.
comment 3: You can't help people who don't want help.
This applies to food, drugs, alcohol, gambling, all of it. It doesn't really matter if the drugs are legal or not, prescribed or not.
You can have the conversations and try to point them in a better direction - /u/hriaz has a good post - but ultimately if they're happy, you're not going to ""fix"" them.

"Father with Early On-Set in Clinical Trial - working? https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326401.php
My father is currently in an MIT clinical trial (to the one in the article, but a similar one) that involves the use of the head device that emits sound and flashing lights. Over the course of the last few months he has actually shown an improvement... apparently, as my mom says it, a bunch of other people in the trial are also noticing an improvement as well.. could this be it? I hate to get my hopes up (which Im working through with my therpaist) but it's extremely exciting.. even the scientists were saying how excited they were. He got his 2nd PETscan last week so we will know the truth of it soon enough but as of right now, im crossing my fingers.. even if it doesn't help my dad, I hope it can help the future","comment 1: That’s awesome! So happy for you!
comment 2: That is great! My dad was in a trial that got cancelled earlier this year, but he is allowed to stay on the medication. Not sure how much it helps, but his disease progress seems to be slower than most.
comment 3: Not alzheimers related but this reminds me of a thing that happened to me maybe 25 years ago. I got a free coupon for time in one of those isolation float tanks which was already a little more new-age than my comfort zone. When I went there, they were pushing a freebie light show thing. I thought it was stupid and said no, I don't want that but the guy talked me into just trying it. I sat in what looked like a dentist's chair and they put something like a virtual reality head gear thing on me. It had a slide show built into it, just regular pieces of standard art from art history books that they cycled through, which I found a bit boring since I was an art major in college - it was all stuff I already knew anyway. I was belligerent and not into it.
After that, the guy came back and asked if I saw anything weird. Me: Nope, not all all, just the regular slides. Him: what do you mean? Me: There was just the art slides - I didn't see anything.
So it turns out there was no art, no slides, just flashing (LED?) lights that tapped into something that was firing off in my brain, and I hallucinated the art slides - but it was so damn real. I'm not a person who's ever done drugs, but that's the closest I've come to experiencing an alternate reality like being in some CIA LSD experiment.
I thought it might be worth mentioning because my response was not a typical placebo response and it was the opposite of confirmation bias - I went in thinking the whole thing was absolute bullshit, and was still busy telling them so during the debrief.
comment 4: Placebo responses are fairly robust in any disease.  We are all biased.  Personally, given the recent news, I think monoclonal antibodies are the way to go.

"Grandma is starting to have memory problems. Does anyone have any advice on how to help her manage this better? Grandma is starting to have problems with her memory. She has trouble keeping track of appointments, she forgets conversations and repeats herself a half hour later, once in a while she forgets to take her medications, etc. We are guessing this is early stage dementia. She is going to see a neurologist soon for diagnostic tests. 
Apart from the memory problems she is otherwise completely functional, but we are wondering how we could help her manage these difficulties she is having. I noticed she is writing lots of reminders and to-do's down on post-its, but it isn't very useful because she has so many little papers everywhere she can't keep track of everything.
Any advice?","comment 1: She needs a daily check list. My Father managed his early dementia for 9 years until he had a stroke.
Repeating questions is completely normal dementia symptoms. My Father now ask me what time is it every 10mins.
If possible make a video of her daily routines so she can watch and follow along. 
Good luck and Godspeed
comment 2: I'll create a daily checklist for her to use. Thanks for recommending it.
comment 3: My advice. Get a clear big clock with the date, time & month on it . Get a pill box which will allow you to separate the pills into each day & ask her if she has a power of attorney in place. Things can get more complicated if there’s no POA (making medical decisions & sorting out finances). If there isn’t one, speak to your parents & get it sorted. Also maybe get a big chalk board, put it in your kitchen & write out the weeks worth of appointments, meetings etc clearly 
All of the above helped my mom
comment 4: The clock and chalkboard are a great idea, I'll buy them for her. She already has a pillbox separated into days, but I'll get her one with an alarm as someone else suggested. Parents are dead so me and my SO are going to be dealing with this directly so I'll find a lawyer and sort out POA. Thank you for your advice, its really useful.
comment 5: Is she able to use an Alexa or similar device? Medication boxes with digital alarms are also helpful. Encourage her to have a single binder for all things important (phone numbers, an envelope for receipts, things like that), a single large wall calendar for appointments. Have her set up a health care proxy NOW.
comment 6: She isn't good with technology so I don't think she could handle Alexa. But I'll get her the medication box with an alarm, that sounds like it could really help her. I'll also buy a few binders and a big calendar so she can organize herself better. Thanks for your help

"I'm looking for feedback on an idea: A wearable arm band for chemo patients that will constantly monitor body temperature and alert the wearer, carers and medical staff if their temperature rises above safe levels. Hi!
My mother is currently going through chemotherapy and this last week she had an issue with fevers and neutropenia. She has some chemo brain happening so she thought she was unwell from chemo side effects. As a carer, I didn't think to question her opinion on this as she is usually quite unwell the weekend after treatment. As those of you who are caring for people undergoing chemotherapy are probably aware, if they have a fever they need to get to an ER within an hour.
I'm currently completing a startup weekend to make an armband that will monitor temperature and alert the user AND send a notification to nominated carers and medical staff should a fever occur. 
We are hoping some feedback from other carers about our proposed product, Temp-Band and whether it would be useful to you and your loved ones.
We would love, love, love some opinions from Doctors, Patients and Carers.

"What home automation-based applications can be developed to help those with neuromuscular diseases or their caregivers? TL;DR - Many people suffer from neuromuscular diseases which make it difficult for them to do even simple things or enjoy simple pleasures. Typically, new and expensive devices would have to be made to help them. However, with the large amount of home automation software (like Echo) available now, what can be done to help them? What applications or systems can we design which can be used by the patients to make their own lives easier? We are a group of students who want to create something in this area to see if we, or someone with more expertise, can create a better world.
Context -> Problem Statement -> Who are we
Context: There are numerous people around the world who have some form of neuromuscular disease. These are everyday people with everyday needs, but sometimes they are unable to make use of the solutions that are available. Different solutions – less physically challenging ones – are needed to help them. Traditionally, new devices had to be designed to help them but now, with the advent of home automation software like Alexa, IFTTT, Google Home etc, the opportunities are greater to make their life a bit easier!
Problem Statement: For people with neuromuscular diseases, of any age, how can home automation software be used to make their lives easier? Some use cases are listed below but please don't limit yourselves to them.

One potential use case could be to help patients with their progressive loss of autonomy in completing daily task, such as by having robotic arms help them carry out specific tasks like pull up a blanket.
Another use case could be in the area of using home automation software to provide entertainment for the patients who can no longer do so themselves. A basic example of this would be to have a smart assistant read out the news or a book to them.
One last use case would be providing help to the caregiver instead to reduce the toll on them. A simple way to use home automation for this purpose would be to help the caregiver do menial actions, like adjust the bedding (to avoid bed sores) remotely.

Who are we: My team and I are university students. Recently, we were looking for a problem to solve for a startup program. While we realised we didn't have the experience in this area yet, we were ready to move on. However, we realised that there are communities on reddit who have either the experience or expertise (or both)! Hence, we are trying to see if we can tap on the collective smarts of intelligent subreddits to come up with solutions to more bespoke problems. The bottom line is that we are trying to find ideas which can be developed. If we can't take the solution forward, hopefully students and entrepreneurs in that particular field can come across it when searching for problems and see if they can take it forward.
We truly appreciate the time you've taken to read and the input you provide :)","comment 1: This post has been removed. Please post this in the Research Wednesday thread. It can be found at the top of the sub.

"Disagreement for what’s best for maternal grandmother I am a (f26) and married . 
A little insight my grandmother was diagnosed with cognitive dementia in February of this year. I noticed a year earlier that she was having trouble remembering short term information or events. The pharmacy and the doctor’s office contacted my mother to notify her the her mother has missed doctors appointments and quit picking up medications. That sent up a lot of red flags.... November of 2018, my mother and I started spending the afternoons with her to make sure she eats dinner and takes all her medications.  
The disagreement as of right now I feel like my grandma should live with my mom for round a clock care. My make mom makes excuses of why this can’t happen right now. She has valid reasons why and I am not trying to push anything. I just feel like she blows it off like my grandmother is fine and I am always the bad guy because I have to micromanage my grandmothers life.  My mom feels it’s best to wait for my grandmother tells her she ready to move and she forgets her boyfriend.
More information
My grandma lives with her boyfriend of 25 years. He is a money hungry prick and always fusses at her over nonsense.
My mom is going through a separation and trying to get her life back on track. Her focus is mainly on her sick mother in law and guys. I am my moms life line when it comes to getting around. She can’t drive due to a disability.","comment 1: Is it possible for your grandmother to be placed into a facility where she can receive help 24/7 by professionals? I do not know your entire situation but i do not think it is fair for you to tell your mother she needs to take grandma in so she can give around the clock care. Being a 24/7 caregiver can burn you the fuck out in no time.

"Savoring moments with dad My 73 year old dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's / primary progressive aphasia about a year ago. I'm 30 years old with no siblings and it's been hard adjusting to this new reality. Yesterday I stopped by (he's still alone for now) because he was having computer troubles -- on the phone he said he kept trying to do Bank of America and Yahoo but ""no sound was coming out."" He was in a very bad place, anxious and upset and gasping for air on the phone trying to explain but barely making coherent sentences. When I got there the internet was out (was he remembering dial up?). He was worried that he forgot to pay the cable bill; even though I've kept track of all the bills the past year and they're mostly on autopay anyway, he always tries to keep up to speed and it causes him a lot of stress trying to log into his online accounts.
I reset the router and reentered the wifi password on his computer. He said something about how he needs to keep his hands off stuff now, that everything's better when he doesn't touch it. I hate to see him like that and his anxiety only makes things worse. When everything was set with the computer I said ""hey daddy, why don't you come with me to Lowe's?"" I've been fixing up my mom's condo since she died last year and I needed to get three new toilet seats. My dad was the handiest guy around  up until recently -- way more competent than I'll ever be -- and it's been hard to keep him involved with projects at the condo, especially when I'm learning as I go. But he always let me tag along with him when I was growing up. So when I need to go to the hardware store, I take him along. At least he can help me pick stuff out. 
His mood lifted immediately. At the store we admired the shiny new Kohler toilets on special and walked over to the seats. In his few words, he offered me guidance on choosing one -- plastic vs. wood, cheap vs. pricy, etc. We settled on a mid range seat, $20 with tax. He carried the stack of seats to the car. Next stop was his house for a wrench. We needed to remove all the seats at my mom's and I, being a complete beginner and all, didn't know what to expect. His basement is full of tools and he didn't really know where to look anymore, but we made it work! 
Anyway, I'm writing this because at the condo, something really special happened. I got to experience my old daddy, the daddy who always knew what to do. I let him go for it and he did it so well. He removed the bolts on the first old toilet better than me -- he actually took over when I was doing a crappy job. I stepped back and let him do his thing. Pretty soon he was whistling (!) and chatting more smoothly than I've seen inso long. By the second seat he was an old pro. He took extra time to scrape off some old caulk and I felt my heart swell. Always such attention to detail! He told a story about working at Ford, he said the guys would say ""Nutch! Are you done yet?!"" What a pleasure to see him so entranced in his work. 
On to the third seat -- this one turned out the best of all and he did it entirely by himself. Working slow, but doing it right. When he was done I said we should wash our hands, and he said ""oh yeah, <i>dirty! dirty!</i>"" rolling the Rs in that funny voice he used to use and I felt so young again. 
Standing in the kitchen about to leave, I gave him a big hug. I wondered if this would be the last time we did something like this together. Maybe not, but alz really makes you savor things differently. I'm so grateful for my time with him.","comment 1: This is a lovely memory for you to hold onto now.
I hope you have many more of these moments with your Dad.
Much love to you both.

"Medical Alert Devices Hi all,
I am a caregiver to my parents who are both fall risks among other issues. I am looking into medical alert devices for them and I was curious what others have used. My hope is that this will give me piece of mind when I step out of the house for an hour or two. I  was looking into Mobile Help. Seemed good but who knows. All of those companies seem a bit shady in my opinion. TIA!","comment 1: Are you dealing with just fall risks? Or do they have dementia as well?
comment 2: Just fall risks. They don’t have dementia thankfully.
comment 3: I also feel like those devices aren't what they're cracked up to be. My friend's mom was wearing one when she fell and it didn't kick in and she forgot to use the alert button, so she was just on the ground for 9 hours. Terrible. 
Where are you located? Maybe there's a service like this nearby where you could get someone to come by and spend time with your parents when you need to go out.
comment 4: Kind of new to this, but would a smart watch that can make calls be an option?  Apple watches detect hard falls but I have no idea if it would pick up on a home fall.
comment 5: Life Alert, but I never had to use it. We tested it, and surprisingly they were right there. In my experience, at least, I'd keep track of the line where they can't be left alone. My wife was in bed for 4 years. Once I set up the laptop on the bed, dialed my cell, and went to town. We were talking, but then she didn't answer me. I raced home to find her sleeping. :)

"What do you do with yourself when you're no longer a caregiver? For the last 3 years, I (28 F) was the primary caregiver for my mother who has Parkinson's Disease and Diabetes. My husband and I moved her in with us in the summer of 2016, when her Parkinson's symptoms started getting worse and she could no longer live alone. I'm the youngest of 6 kids, and I somehow became her sole caregiver, provider, health care advocate... Everything. My siblings were never really present in caring for her or keeping track with her doctors, medicines, disease progression, etc. So it all fell on me and my husband while we were both still working full time at our regular jobs plus part time school for my husband.
The first year was tough. We were adjusting to living together, good and bad habits, changing my work schedule so that either me or my husband could be home with her day and night, trial and erroring new doctors and meds. But we got through it. At that time, we were dealing with more physical symptoms... Like weakness and rigid body movements. But once we got settled with a good doctor, physical therapy, and regulated her meds, we didn't have to be as hands on anymore! She was able to do more for herself, physically.
The second year, we started to feel stuck. Mom had gotten so used to us being with her all the time, that even when she didn't need help, she kept us busy. She would make us feel bad for wanting to be social with friends again, or going out for date night, or having people over. We'd make plans, let her know when we'd be out, remind her, write it on her calendar, everything... And then right when we were ready to leave the house, she'd throw a huge fit about us not loving her or not wanting to spend time with her. If we had friends over, she'd call us into her room every 5 minutes to do something for her that could have absolutely waited until company was gone. She'd throw tantrums if she felt she wasn't getting enough attention. But every waking moment when I wasn't at work, I was at home with her. My life revolved around her as it was, and she couldn't let go. It was like we were living with a toddler. We tried getting her socialized... Took her to support groups, outtings with people from her exercise classes, etc. But she didn't like anything but to stay at home. It felt like we shot ourselves in the foot for being such great caregivers that first year... That when we wanted to take a step back, we couldn't.
The third year just completely sucked the life out of us. We hired a private caregiver to help take mom to her exercise classes and to give her companionship. I thought that if there was more space between us, we'd both feel better. But mom had more emotional outbursts, dyskinesia, and falls around the house. Her personality turned cruel and she'd say terrible things about us to the other, and even to my siblings. It felt like she was turning us all against one another. We got her into therapy where she was prescribed antidepressants and anxiety meds. But she wouldn't take them regularly, so it'd turn into a fight everytime. The fights with mom just kept getting more and more intense... threats of suicide were thrown at each other, furniture was broken. My husband and I couldn't recognize who we were anymore. We became short tempered, always angry with each other, resentful towards mom and my siblings... We were just so lost and frustrated with where our lives were. The question, ""what's the point of doing any of this?"" was constantly repeated in my head. 
From January - June of this year, she had 2 major falls and an ulcer that put her in the hospital for a whole week and a half, since she lost so much blood. Luckily she hadn't broken any bones during those 2 big falls... And there were small ones scattered in between. But it came to the point where my husband and I decided that what we once thought would be helpful to her, in keeping her at home with us, was only detrimental. Our home was no longer a safe space for her. Our relationship with her was so far gone, that we couldn't possibly facilitate a positive or healthy environment. We told her we were done and that we couldn't do it anymore, that this time we were serious.
At the end of July, we moved mom into an assisted living home in the same city as 3 of my siblings, which is 2 hours away from me. I'm glad to say that my siblings have stepped up a bit. I'm still handling the administrative side of her things, like benefits, doctor updates, paying her bills. But at least the siblings are visiting her once a week. 
I remember leading up to her move, that I was ecstatic. I was so excited to have my freedom back. To start feeling like myself again. To do what IIII wanted to do. I just couldn't wait for this burden to be lifted off my shoulders. But for the last 2.5 months since mom's moved out... I'm a huge mess. I'm depressed, guilt ridden, apathetic, tormented by the good and bad memories.  There's so much of me that wants to take it all back and take care of her again. And the other half that knows better not to go there. I started going to therapy. I've had three sessions now and I've shared all this with my therapist... So we're working on tackling the guilt I carry with me. But here I am alone with my thoughts. I look at pictures of me and mom over the last 3 years... And it hurts to see that we took fewer and fewer together as time went on. I still feel lost. I still don't know who I am. Being her caregiver was such a large part of my identity, that I feel incomplete now. I read other people's stories, that they've been caregiving for their loved ones much longer than just 3 years... And I feel stupid for feeling the way I'm feeling. I just don't know what to do with myself.","comment 1: I think you have to slowly rebuild your life not only for yourself but also for your husband’s sake . Pretty sure you have lost the intimacy and comfort that you used to have with one another. It’s okay to feel at a loss  and disoriented for a while. I hope you can continue your therapy. Two hours away is not impossible for visiting purposes so you can see your Mom and your siblings for visits. I would recommend taking care of yourself first, your husband second, and your mom third at this point. You have nothing to feel guilty for. You and your husband “manned the helm” for years while it was possible to do so. You deserve your new, more unencumbered life and it will take time but you can rebuild and find joy and satisfaction again. Be patient with yourself. Blessings on you and your family.
comment 2: Thank you so much for your kind words. They help me feel validated and that what I'm feeling isn't absurd. I completely agree with everything you've said... Especially about being patient with myself.
Definitely trying to find a way to rebuild my relationship with my husband. We were only 24 and 25 when we made the decision to move mom in, and at the time, we weren't even married yet. We got engaged in January of 2017 and married in November of 2017. The original plan was to have a longer engagement so that he could finish his master's program. But since we saw mom declining, we wanted her to be able to enjoy our wedding and express herself, so we chose to have it that same year. Even though we've been together since 2009, we entered into ""married life"" at such a rough time with mom that I feel like we haven't been able to really experience it.
I visited twice in August and twice at the beginning of September. My last visit was just about a month ago, and I purposely wanted to put more time and space between the visits because we still had so much friction. My husband and I are going up to visit her this Sunday for a day trip. And I feel good about it. Hoping there aren't any outbursts... From her or me.
comment 3: You are a fantastic daughter!
Being the youngest of six says you should still have a close family for support.
Glad to hear your siblings stepped up with Mom's new living facility.  I'm in that strange space of knowing things are progressing, but I am still active. 
At thins point plan a simple weekend with your husband. BnB near the beach?  Hiking Trip? Something simple and relaxing to spend time together.
Don't overlook volunteering. I'm in Austin, TX and we have a Parkinson's Boxing classes and love our volunteers (some of the more advanced can not get up by themselves but need a ""Cornerman"" to help hold them via a gait belt so they can work those leg muscles while boxing). 
Please do stop by /r/Parkinsons as we appreciate caregivers inputs. I joking tell my kid first time I break a hip, time for me to be in assisted living. Meanwhile I keep scaring my wife as I am doing things I shouldn't be cable of but getting them done, like running a 5K. Not the fastest one, but out there moving. I had the wild hair to do a sprint triathlon. My wife thought I was crazy as I didn't know how to swim, so I signed up for swimming lessons.  2.5 hours later I crossed the finish line. My legs felts like cement, but I did it. 
Hey, if you are close by I'd love help stuffing about 100 of the Aware in Care kits. :)
comment 4: Aww, thank you! I am learning to open up to my siblings... We didn't grow up close, so it feels foreign to lean on them or to share with them. But it's a work in progress.
Absolutely would love a weekend away with the husband. We're trying to plan a camping trip in November.
Rock Steady Boxing are the exercise classes that mom went to! We're in San Diego, CA. The first year, I went with her to every class and was her cornerman! When she seemed to be more independent, I stopped joining her for the class and only dropped her off/picked her up. Since I worked 10 hour night shifts, I welcomed the opportunity to not have to stay during classes so I could take a nap in the car or take the hour and a half for ""me time."" And then we hired the private caregiver to take her and be her cornerman that third year. Mom actually LOVED the boxing. It was one of the hardest things for her to say goodbye to. There's one in the same county as her assisted living home, but in Los Angeles traffic, it'd be ridiculous getting her there with her med schedule working on time, etc. Luckily, the home has daily exercise classes that mom attends. It's not as high intensity as Rock Steady, but she says it still works her out.
It's great to hear how active you are! Absolutely keep it up! I can empathize with your wife when she gets scared of the activities you're in, haha! But keep fighting!... Just stay safe, lol!
comment 5: I was out in San Diego for ""Aware in Care"" Ambassadors Program and got to meet with quite a few people in the area.
Big Bear is still one of my favorite places to go camping!  Went camping with my daughter last year, had a blast.  This year is was a long road trip and got to enjoy Glacier National Park. Went hiking with my son, did fine until I went to get down the trail. I should have taken hiking sticks! Then off to Yellowstone. I had been as a kid, but first time for my son and had a blast!
I'm the youngest of six, so I can relate how hard it was when Mom went into assisted living.
comment 6: > At the end of July, we moved mom into an assisted living home in the same city as 3 of my siblings, which is 2 hours away from me. 
The decision to place a loved one into ""a home"" is gut-wrenching.  It often comes when caregiving at home is just no longer possible but that is a different lecture.
That period of respite that comes AFTER the decision is made is very risky.  There is an emptiness and as you stated, a loss of purpose and identification. Very slowly, you need to reconnect with the outside world.  This isn't always easy.
comment 7: Yea, been trying to figure out what self-care means to me. I've been trying to reconnect with the outside world... Meeting up with friends, going to the movies, hiking, shopping, started cooking again (after mom left, I didn't touch the stove for a month, lol!). I noticed that I have a tendency to put on this ""everything is normal and great"" face, but once I'm alone again, I revert back to this sullen place. So I'm still trying to figure it all out. But glad you used the key words, ""very slowly."" I just have to accept that it's going to take come time.
comment 8: Your whole identify was probably tied up in your patient and loved one.   You became invisible.  You can go to a movie, go out to a real dinner, take a class, find a Meetup group and learn the ukuelele, etc.  You need to become visible again to the world and I know, easier said than done.  Don't expect an overnight miracle.

comment 9: I've never seen Meetup before! Thanks for the advice. I'll look into it!
comment 10: Everything from quilting to Tai Chi.  I take one of my patients to Tai Chi at a senior center and ending up joining myself.  LOL!
comment 11: I went through the exact same thing, except over a longer period of time. I'm lost and confused as well.. Feeling really guilty a lot of days and not sure really who I am either. All I can recommend is therapy. It's what I've been focusing on right now. Best of luck xo

"Considering Companion Care for recently widowed Mother My mom has had ""mild cognitive impairment"" and early signs of dementia for about 5 years. It's always been difficult but even more so now she lives alone since my father passed in spring of this year. She writes EVERYTHING down so the house is a wreck of scattered papers, and she has a hard time remembering appointments and keeping track of her belongings.
I'm just looking for advice on how to get started with this. I live near her now but may not always, plus it's absolutely exhausting checking in on her all the time and it's put a strain on our relationship. I think she'd be receptive to the help. Any advice on how to start this process and what to expect cost-wise would be really helpful.","comment 1: We found steno pads to be helpful because at least the papers are held together in one place. Then, once they are full of notes, the pads can be put all together on a shelf and my mom likes that. Well maybe it's actually her OCD that does LOL. I suppose the challenge would be if your mom prefers to tear the note out of the book once she has written it down.
comment 2: As far as check-in in on her , get her internet and a wifi router then setup an Alexa echo show 5 ($64)  in the home, so you can ""intercom"" from your mobile device, as well as setup her reminders and alarms and have the echo announce the information...
Of course  at some point  you still will need a person to provide caregiver services as.the dementia progresses
comment 3: This is actually a great idea in the interim. I guess I see ads where people can just use it to pop in on their loved ones.
comment 4: You can get people from $15-$25 per hour depending on your market.  Care.com is a good place to start.
comment 5: I would recommend getting a power of attorney and a medical power of attorney before she gets worse.   That will make your life much easier if it gets to the point where you have to handle expenses/ make financial or medical decisions/etc.
If you're in the states,  check to see if your mom's city or county has any kind of office on aging.   They can often provide help for certain things (sometimes income based.) My mom (no impairments,  just poor) was able to get some maintenance done on her house at no charge.  They can usually point you to other resources as well. 
There are several companies that provide in home help note.   There's Home Instead and Visiting Angels for example.   They can help with cooking,  cleaning,  personal hygiene and companionship.   Pretty much everything but meds.
And try to be patient with her.  She's going through a lot.   Good luck!

"Mom is visiting for 2 weeks... Mostly just a rant:
My Mother (F68, LB Dementia) arrived Saturday. We managed all the airport stuff well, I think. Were able to get passes for my father to walk her to gate and me to meet her at gate, direct flight. She still hated every second of it.
I was just where they live at beginning of August for 2 weeks, and I have to say, having her in a foreign environment has made me realize she has a lot more problems that I had thought.
She hasn't visit me in over a decade so she's never even seen the apartment I live in. I didn't realize how many things she's able to do in her own home that are very difficult in a new space... she can't remember which room is which, she can't remember where trash can is, she keeps tripping on door jambs and step-ups. She keeps forgetting to close the bathroom door, and since in my small bathroom you can't get to sink without door being closed, she keeps thinking there's no bathroom sink and can't find toothbrush, etc. I setup my google home device so she could just say, ""hey google, call Batbell,"" and she can't remember the sequence of 4 words, nor can she read them on the paper I wrote them down on for her. I set up the coffee pot every night so all she has to do is hit power button to make coffee, and both mornings so far, even with a sign second morning that said ""press button"" and an arrow, she hasn't been able to do it.
The first morning/afternoon after flight day was hell. She spent most of it sobbing hysterically about missing her dog, not understanding where she was, not understanding she'd never been to this apartment before so constantly saying, ""wasn't the kitchen over there..."" -  more sobbing, more talking about Dad having her killed, the plane flight being awful, the dog, more sobbing... took her shopping to get her stuff she didn't want to travel with and groceries and she kept wandering off in walmart when I wasn't looking. Then she scared the crap out of me starting to tell a story about her daughter.... me.... to me... like it wasn't me she was talking about...
Honestly she seemed a bit better late last night and this morning. She stays alone when she's home, so that's why we thought it would be OK for her to come stay with me for a few weeks, give Dad a break, and let us spend time together, even though I still have to go to work... she's alone in the house for the first time and all I can think about is how she's wandered around the last day and a half repeatedly forgetting where anything is. I'm terrified she'll open the front door and fall down my outside staircase... terrified she'll light the house on fire because she smokes... terrified in general.
I am seriously hoping she'll settle in and this panicked ""what the FUCK have I done"" feeling will go away.
I'm heading home at noon to get us lunch and check on her. The time cannot go quickly enough.
I've planned a surprise birthday party for her next Saturday, she's turning 69. Inviting all the friends I have she's wanted to meet and making her a super spread of foods she likes... this could be the stupidest thing I have ever done, or make her tickled pink... I'm just so worried and confused right now, and knowing she's been able to accomplish most of what she has been at home more by habit than still possessing skill to do such thing makes me very, very sad. I was hoping this would be a fantastic, cathartic, trip, and it would be the first of many. But if she gets worse before the next one, I don't even think she'll be able to live at home anymore...","comment 1: UPDATE: She was just FINE when I got home for lunch. She's decided to organize my clothes. My living room looks like a bomb went off in Macy's but I don't care, organize away.
comment 2: Phew.  That was a nice update to read!  Good luck with the party.
comment 3: The birthday party sounds like a great idea. If you're worried that she won't like it or recognize it, you could reframe it (to yourself at least). You're having a party for your friends, with a big spread of food, and your mom's invited, too!
Less stress all around. Have a great time. You're over-thinking this one.
comment 4: Thank you!
comment 5: I'm so glad that she's doing better according to your update! I have to agree....one of the scariest things is definitely having them speak directly to you and not realize you're you!
comment 6: I don't know how some of you do it without a camera or two to peek in a few times a day.  My father isn't even that bad and a few cheap wyze cams have been an incredible piece of mind.  The best part is, when I mention them he's totally forgotten they're there.  LOL
comment 7: We use a Blink camera!
comment 8: My mother is different every day so be prepared for that.  My mom is 89 and in stage 7
comment 9: Let us know how the party goes
comment 10: I put an update. :)
comment 11: UPDATE: I don't really know if this is the best way to update, but here we go.
The party was fabulous. About 30 people showed up, we had decorations, a feast, a beautiful and delicious cake, everyone sang happy birthday, and mom enjoyed about 5 hours of talking to people, and having a few daiquiris.
Of course there's still the negative seeping in sometimes each day, her paranoia never completely lets up, but she occasionally just starts talking about how many people were there, and the kids singing for her, and how much I surprised her... so the fact that she has a positive glitch to talk about in with all her negative delusions pleases me greatly.
Thanks for all your support.

"How to occupy my dad A few months ago, the first week of my GCSEs, my dad woke up and he could walk, turns out he has blood clots in his legs and lungs, so he’s stuck at home, can’t walk far and can’t do much without getting out of breath. The problem is that it was really sudden, before he was active, healthy, walked about 4-5 miles a day, and it was a sudden change for him, they told him he would be at work by August approximately, so he’s down about that, he started gardening, which is harder now it’s not growing season anymore, he also tried cooking but he loses track a lot and I’m scared of him leaving the oven on or something, and he gets really disheartened when something doesn’t work, I just need suggestions for something he can do with a short attention span, and doesn’t involve walking around or using too much energy, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading this far!! Ps I’m 16, and I’m looking for things I can do with him on my days off college, and things he can do on the days he’s alone, without supervision that doesn’t matter if he gets distracted and leaves, and there’s no danger of him accidentally hurting himself, like he’s burned himself and cut himself cooking","comment 1: What does your Dad’s doctor say about his oxygen levels? After blood clots, oxygen levels can be below normal, so enough oxygen doesn’t get to the brain. That can cause the dizziness and forgetfulness.  Does he need to be supplemental oxygen at home? If he does, he would feel so much better physically - mentally too.
Has your Dad ever done puzzles? That’s something you can work on at your own pace. You can stand up and leave it whenever you want too. Would he like to put model airplanes together, or model boats?  That might be something to pass time, sanding & glueing the pieces. Does he play games on the computer or tablet?
I hope your Dad feels better soon. I know it takes awhile, so tell him not to rush things. Make sure you take care of yourself too. It’s easy to forget that if you’re worried about someone else. Hugs from Florida.
comment 2: This is really helpful, thank you so much I really appreciate this, I’ll look into this stuff, hugs back from England
comment 3: Get him a keyboard and find him piano lessons on YouTube. Challenge him to play some of his favorite songs.
Set up an indoor terrarium or UV light garden? 
I'm guessing the internet/TV holds no appeal to him?
Introduce him to contact juggling (not regular juggling. Look up okotanpe on youtube). It looks pretty cool and could be a great party trick. The simpler movements look pretty low energy. Maybe he could pick it up?
Arts and crafts? Some adults I know are against it as being too kiddy. Same with jigsaw puzzles
Crossword/Sudoku/online chess/etc.
Have him invent a code/cipher and you can text each other in code while you're away at school. That may or may not get annoying. He could set up a coded scavenger hunt for you/people.
Organize photo album or documents in storage
Get him into meditation/reading/podcasts
comment 4: Those are really great ideas, thank you so much!!

"I know that this is going to come out sounding different than what it's intended but I'm starting to suspect that my friend is intellectually disabled and is not getting the care that she needs I don't know if this is in the right place but I couldn't find any other sub that seemed appropriate. I don't mean to sound mean, I'm just concerned for her. She calls me and she comes over a lot seeking my help for things that most adults would generally know. For example, today she called me saying that she couldn't figure out why her phone bill didn't get paid when she's on auto pay. I asked her what she thought it could have been. 
She said she didn't know because she had checked her account balance and there was more than enough in there. I suddenly remembered why it didn't work. She was already on the phone on hold with her carrier but I said wait, remember how you told me you canceled your card last week? She said that she did not connect the dots as to that being why it wouldn't have worked. I think that most people would have figured that out without having to call to figure out what happened.
She does this with a lot of other types of things too. She blanks out on things that are common sense for the average person. I know that you would say that she probably just forgot that she does this kind of stuff a lot. She can't go grocery shopping on her own because she told me that she can't add like the average person. So basically she is incapable of using a calculator to keep track of what she is spending. She told me she's had to go through the checkout three different times to add up what she's spending. That seemed odd to me but I figured whatever worked for her.
It has gotten to where she has asked me to go grocery shopping for her with a list because she can't add it up like I said, I would never ever do anything that she didn't ask me to do and I always provide her with receipts to a prove that I did not do anything she asked me not to. I cannot help her anymore because I am expecting a little boy in February and it's taking away time that I need to get ready for his arrival. I'm concerned about leaving her completely alone to do things on her own though because honestly I don't think she should be living alone. What can I do?","comment 1: Its hard to say just from your statement about potential disability. Forgive me for being so blunt, but she could just be lacking intellectually. Have you seen the story about Kevin?
Hopefully there are apps or other methods she can use to keep track of things. Maybe a life coach?
comment 2: I thought that lacking intellectually is an intellectual disability. I thought that's what it means. I just thought that lacking intellectually was basically the definition of intellectual disability. That being said, I read the story about Kevin and yes she does display some of that kind of behavior but not quite that severe. There were a few things that I identified with as far as her but she's not that severe in everything.
She cooks her own food but she cooks everything on high heat and I've told her several times that not everything needs to be cooked on high. She does this even with fried eggs. I've told her that she's going to set her kitchen on fire and possibly burn her house down and it's like she doesn't learn from past mistakes. She's even gotten mad at me when I've had to remind her several times not to do that. She's even said, well I guess I'm stupid then. I've told her that I never said that she was stupid, I was merely reminding her not to do something that could cause her injury.
I just find it odd that someone would not connect the dots like hey, I canceled my card so that's why auto-pay didn't work. Most people would know to update their payment method as soon as they got their new card. Okay maybe she forgot about it this one time but I just couldn't understand why she couldn't put two and two together about why the payment didn't go through. I asked her if she forgot that she canceled her card and she hesitated like she was afraid to answer me. She finally basically admitted that no she hadn't forgotten but that she didn't put it together that that's why her payment didn't work.
I've had to explain things to her that should be common sense to most people and she knows basically nothing of the real world. Things that are common knowledge to most people, she knows nothing about. She is severely lacking in common sense and does not take care of her hygiene properly. One time I gently asked her when the last time she took a shower was and she told me that it was 2 days ago but I know it was longer than that because I had been at her house every day for two weeks and she never changed clothes. 
I know it sounds like I'm being mean but I am genuinely concerned about her well-being. She has family up in New York but honestly they don't really seem to care that much about her. They hardly ever call her. I'm about ready to go into her phone and text her brother to let him know what's going on because I think she needs to be in either a group home setting or in Assisted Living of some other type.
comment 3: I was attempting to call her stupid in a more tactful way by using ""lacking intellectually"". Unfortunately, that doesnt quite fit the bill for disability. 
There absolutely could be a medical reason for what you're observing, from a Tramatic Brain Injury (TBI), to other things that affect the brain, like a tumor or other neurological condition or developmental disability. (Note, I am not a trained medical professional and I do not have the power to diagnose anything). 
If her family isn't willing to help, you may have to step up and attend doctors appointments with her to see what can be done. Ask her if she was in special ed at all in school (how to bring it up is best left to you- you know if she would be offended or not.) 
Also, ask her what she wants to do. Ask her if this is going to be a problem for her if you take a few steps back, and if she would want some other assistance. Your county (if in the US) could help with assessment through Adult Protective Services, or some other outreach program similar.
comment 4: I think I will call Adult Protective Services because I can't help her anymore. As I said in the post, I am preparing for the arrival of a baby boy in February, possibly January and it's getting close to that. She did tell me that the kids used to snicker when she was in school because she would have to ask the teacher to repeat something that all the other kids got the first time. So she was the one that brought it up.
comment 5: She sounds very much like my brother, who has autism with poor executive function. He also neglects hygiene, but lies about how bad it is. He can do basic adult things that are limited to following instructions, but he can’t think abstractly or reason well.
comment 6: Yeah that sounds like her all right. The only difference put between your brother and her is that she has a hard time following verbal instructions. Like it seems like you can say something to her a hundred times and it just doesn't sink in, sometimes I wonder if she's just not listening to me or if it's just not sinking in. I don't want to take away her autonomy whatsoever but it feels like I have to repeat myself with her several times a week.
I forgot that she also mentioned that she has something called auditory processing disorder. That is where they will hear things wrong. I wonder if that has something to do with it. I've heard that when you have auditory processing disorder that you can have a hard time following verbal instructions.
But I have also wondered if she has autism as well. She seems to have a high-functioning form of autism. Not really Asperger's but high functioning in the sense that like your brother she can do basic adult things daily but lacks executive function.
comment 7: Is she trying to live completely independently? She should qualify for disability benefits. We’re going through the process with my brother. He already has a job coach, and he works with a social worker to find suitable employment. We hope he’ll be eligible for housing benefits soon. He could live in a house or apartment with other disabled adults, and receive the amount of help he needs to manage daily living. My brother is also high functioning, but without the executive function, he can’t manage things that fall outside of his basic routine.
comment 8: Yes she's trying to live completely independently and I think she already gets disability. I can't understand why someone didn't suggest all this to begin with. I will ask her if she's already on disability. That actually sounds exactly like what she has because she has a routine that she does every day and gets more upset by things that happen outside of her routine. Like it takes her longer to recover from it.
comment 9: Yep, my brother has no ability to handle frustration. He is scared of change as he lacks the mental and emotional flexibility to deal with it.
comment 10: I don't know if it's so much that she can't handle frustration, just takes her a lot longer to get past it than most people. I noticed that she seems to overreact to seemingly petty stuff. Like one time, I forgot what she wanted at the store, like one thing and she completely went off on me like it was this huge crisis. Is that typical? Of course I didn't take it personally but it was something that I did notice.
comment 11: I would call the grocery episode an inability to handle frustration. My brother also takes everything personally, like it’s a calculated affront to him when things don’t go his way. He feels victimized by life, even over very small inconveniences.
He also has major overreactions, but his are more passive aggressive. So much hostile affect and silent treatment from this guy. He sees a therapist who specializes in autism. He’s making progress.
comment 12: That reminds me of her. It's like she acts like because I forgot something is like I did it on purpose just to upset her. Like I said, she treats it like it's a huge crisis. She seems to do the same thing. If people don't do exactly what she wants and she throws a fit. I've learned to just let it roll off of me. I can't do anything about how she feels about something. 
I'm not just going to drop what I'm doing to go do what she wants. I don't know if she can learn this but I feel like if she can she needs to try to learn that the world does not revolve around her and that people don't do things just to upset her. I don't know if she can understand that though.
comment 13: Wow. These two sound like twins. Brains are so interesting.
Yeah, you get to have boundaries. Especially with a baby coming. Your life comes first, including rest and mental health.
comment 14: Then it probably is the same thing your brother has. And yeah I've called her brother this morning after I got the number off her phone last night and let him know what was going on with her. He said he's going to come down and take her to a doctor to get evaluated and if it's found that she cannot live alone that they are going to take her back to New York with them so at least I know that she'll be getting some kind of help. Thank you.
comment 15: Do you ever get frustrated with feeling like you have to hold his hand through normal stuff? Like having to explain to him how things work that most people would understand? I try to be patient with her but sometimes it does get kind of frustrating because it adds extra stress to me. I know it makes me sound terrible but sometimes I do get frustrated with her. I try my best not to show it but sometimes it does slip out.
comment 16: Do any of these symptoms seem to fit for her? The example you provided reminded me of dyscalculia, but you also said there are other examples.
https://ldaamerica.org/types-of-learning-disabilities/dyscalculia/
comment 17: She displays a few of those, especially the making change and handling money and difficulty with Counting. She seems to get flustered when she has to solve a math problem even on paper. I have tried to help her learn how to add and subtract and she seems to struggle with learning how numbers add up or subtract. She has mentioned that she has dyslexia but honestly I think she may have been misdiagnosed because this sounds more like what she has.
I'm no doctor but from spending time around her I think that this is more accurate. Being dyslexic just means that you see letters and numbers backwards. She does have a habit of mixing up numbers. Like for example if I was to tell her to write the number 71 she would write it as 17.
She cannot manage her money that well and it's basically become me paying her bills for her because she can't budget her money. Like I had to sit down with her and figure out what her income was so that I could create a budget for her every month and pay her bills on time so that nothing got disrupted. She knew to have a cashier's check cut for her rent because that was a repetitive thing but as far as paying for food or electricity or anything like that, she had trouble with budgeting to make sure she had enough money for both each month. 
There were a few times that I had to come help her out because her electric had gotten shut off due to her not paying it on time. Just stuff like that. Can dyslexia also cause these kinds of problems? Oh I forgot to mention how she will have to ask someone to repeat the same step sometimes three or four times before it finally clicks. Like an average person would get it the first time but it takes her a few tries. Could this also be dyslexia? I thought that dyslexia was just where you mix up numbers but that it doesn't affect your cognitive ability otherwise. Hers is clearly affected.
comment 18: Dyslexia is more than just reversing numbers and letters, and is now usually called specific Learning Disability in reading. A person can also have learning disability in math. It sounds like she has elements of this, and also possibly difficulty with memory & processing, or ADHD. She would need to see a psychologist to be assessed to get a full diagnosis.
comment 19: I think kktbspa makes a good point that your friend might have dyscalculia. Whether that's the case or not, your friend would be best served getting evaluated by first talking to her primary care physician to rule out any medical issues (was she like this her entire life?) and if necessary, getting neuropsychologically oriented diagnostic evaluation, talking to a learning specialist, and so on, leading to strategies to live with this diagnosis. All the best to you as a caring friend and to your friend, who's having to live with such difficulties.
comment 20: I know it's not anything neurological because yes she told me she has been like this her entire life. I always feel bad having to ask her questions like I did with her card this afternoon because I don't want her to feel like I'm calling her stupid. I do remember her saying that she paid $1,000 to take a computer class but she couldn't understand anything like even basic stuff so she ended up just walking out of it and wasted the money. She couldn't get the money back unfortunately.
comment 21: Call aps but also call your community of mental health. Or Easter seals.
But really what you need to talk to her about going to her doctor and tell him everything.  Maybe go with her and help her explain. Then he get the ball rolling on getting  her tested. Cause no one can do nothing without a diagnosis. 
Maybe they can get her in a sip home. Where she has staff.
comment 22: Does she smoke a lot of weed by any chance? I'm not anti weed but some people just can't handle it. Is she on any psychoactive meds?  If she's acting like this and is dead sober it may be a disability. I have a friend that has a social worker because she needs help with everything.
comment 23: No, in fact she's very anti weed and she's not on any meds like that. She stays completely sober. She doesn't even drink. It's become pretty apparent to me in the last couple of years that I've known her that she has an intellectual disability or at least it seemed to me like she does.
comment 24: It does seem like it for sure.
comment 25: It sounds like maybe autism in some ways or a TBI. A psychiatrist or psychologist can diagnosis her more properly if she’s willing to be seen. You should probably go to explain what you observe if they’re willing to meet with you both.
comment 26: Severe depression and anxiety (or pther mental health issue) can make someone forgetful and overwhelmed easily. Do you know anything about her history or how she grew up? Does she have family you could contact? 
Hard to say what is going on. Lack of common sense wouldnt technically be a developmental disability but a mental health issue undiagnosed can cause some of the issues you described. Or if she is taking a medication for a health issue it can interfere with her mental capacity (e.g. diabetes meds). Likewise an undiagnosed health issue (e.g. thyroid) can cause mental confusion. 
First step would be to get things ruled out by her doctor like a health issue. Then go from there for more evaluations.
comment 27: There are some great suggestions here but I would also add.  You could try to connect her with your stated vocational services.  Many times there programs that help people maintain there independence by helping them develop skills.  Sometimes you can find them through your states developmental disability agency, the public library or community colleges.
This could help remain independent while building the skills through programming and therapy to allow her to  manage her finances and social interactions.
I personally believe her diagnosis doesn’t matter the support she needs remains relatively the same.
comment 28: Thanks I will look into that and tell her brother about it

"Any advice for a younger caregiver with a potentially terminal spouse? Hey. I've been debating posting on here for a while, but things are escalating lately so here goes.
5 years ago my then girlfriend, now wife, got sick. She went from fit and healthy to bedridden, often stuck in a wheelchair. She had to leave university, leave her job, and a lot of friends bailed on their friendships with her once she was no longer convenient for them.
Now, 5 years later, after two and a half years of struggling to get her treatment then another two and a half years of bouncing back gradually, she was living a semi normal life again. She had built a business in those five years, was thriving, and getting really exciting work and quite a bit of international acclaim even. I am immensely proud of her for it.
Then in the spring she started showing strange symptoms. We wrote it off as a flare up, and she pushed through.
Then her leg swelled up to two inches further around then the other leg. She had DVT. Awful, and painful, but not anything she couldn't handle after she'd already pushed through worse. 
Then it moved to her lung. She was put on an insanely high dose prescription for the max strength thinners out there. Awful, but again nothing she can't handle. At this point I've been her off again on again caregiver for the better part of a decade, and she's tough as hell (early twenties when this all started, late twenties now), and I know she'll get through it fine. She does too. We see it as a shitty inconvenience, and adjust our lives to accommodate the setback. 
Then the clots in her lung killed part of her lung. 
Then a couple weeks later a short walk around the neighborhood sent her to the hospital in an ambulance, presenting all the signs of a heart attack. By this point she's in worse shape then she's ever been. 
Then a week or so later she's told by the specialists working on helping her that they suspect pulmonary hypertension, something that can cause heart failure and which they fully suspect was to blame for her ER trip. If left to it's own devices, it's terminal. Even with treatment and/or major surgery the 5 year survival rates aren't exactly what you'd call comfortable.
I've tried looking for caregiver support groups in my area but they're all during business hours and I can't make it to them. Her family is 2 hours away, and is dealing with her grandfather's palliative care as he's not got much life left in him. So it's just me and her most days. 
She's been sick for ages, it feels, but never terminally so. Sure her condition could cause her to wind up in a fatal situation but not because the illness itself would kill her, more like it'd make her fall and hurt herself or something like that. Now her life is in real danger, and even the best case scenarios just really don't look great, and I'm having a hard time. 
It's not 100% confirmed yet. Doc said she's a textbook case, but they've gotta run a couple tests to confirm just how bad her condition is before we can move on to surgical options. 
I know I shouldn't be getting upset before the tests have even confirmed things but in the past six months I've watched my finally healthy wife suddenly decline to barely functional, with now a potentially terminal illness, and I'm at a loss for how to keep my wits about me and keep pushing on. 
I'm sorry if this isn't the proper sort of content for here, I just hoped someone else out there had some words of wisdom.
TL;DR: Wife [20s] was sick for years, finally doing better. Built her own business, was really taking off, we're on cloud nine. Suddenly she's got clots, they go to her lung, kill part of it, and now her partly dead lung is threatening to kill her. I'm used to chronic illness, but this potentially terminal stuff is out of my league and I need advice.","comment 1: > I've tried looking for caregiver support groups in my area but they're all during business hours and I can't make it to them. Her family is 2 hours away, and is dealing with her grandfather's palliative care as he's not got much life left in him. So it's just me and her most days. 
This is the toughest spot you can be in; there are no silver bullet answers.  Call Social Services and see if she is eligible for any programs, whether in-house or in assisted living facilities.  I can tell you that at some point, you will not be able to handle this by yourself.
comment 2: I am so sorry you are both having to go through this, especially when things were starting to look better. It just seems so unfair. I don’t know how many family members are helping with grandfather’s care but it may be time to reach out to see if anyone can help you two out? Friends are good but family is best in my world when it goes to hell in a handbasket as it sometimes does. And I hope the test results are more optimal.  Hugs for both of you and reach our to the community whenever you need to—members have been in similar times and understand. Blessings.
comment 3: My wife went into the ER thinking she had a really bad stomach flu. Came out with a diagnosis of stage iv melanoma. Obviously I hope this next part isn't how it'll go for you. But the cancer would eventually end up killing her. That said, as hard as it can be to believe, she died happy. Sometimes that's the absolute best we can hope for.
But I think the biggest thing for us was just continuing to be there for each other. And to be honest with each other even if it felt we might hurt the other with that honestly. She was worried about becoming a burden to me. And I was worried that she'd essentially torture herself for my sake and spend her last days or weeks on earth in agony. And the crux of it for both of us was that we were worried the other might come to resent us. But we promised early on that we'd say if that was ever starting to become the case. We both also had a couple moments crying for the other and letting ourselves be reassured. 
She knew I'd start to second guess myself after a while too and even left me a card to drive home just how wonderful she felt her life had been during her final months and giving me credit for it. 
Obviously one can't always extrapolate between two different situations. But I think our strategy just came down to understanding that we were still the same team we'd always been. How we were there for each other in practical terms was constantly changing to account for her condition. But we were both doing things for each other right up till the end. And most of all being there for each other emotionally in a way I'd never imagined. It was hard, but it wasn't hardship. If that makes much sense. 
Though she also told me something very early on as well. She said there'd be plenty of time to mourn her once she was dead. But at the moment she was still alive. And she wanted to keep spending that remaining time really living life with me. And amazingly, we did. 
Just remember that you're not in this alone. And she's not in it alone. You have each other and that can make all the difference.
comment 4: I agree with Constance, does her family realize just how ill she really is? Maybe you need to lay it on the line, so it sinks in.  I would think someone would rush to her bedside, terminal grandfather or not.
comment 5: I'm giving you advice that I didn't take myself, but look into therapy to find some support for yourself. Make sure you're caring for yourself as well. Don't be afraid to ask for help from any and all family. Ask the doctors if they have a social worker available you can speak to, they can be very helpful with taking some of the weight of research off your plate. Try to find yourself a team, no one should have to do everything alone. Even if she's not potentially terminal, she is ill right now and you don't need to take on all responsibility. People are out there who will help you. Please let them know you need them.

"Heat Shock Protein, Electromagnetic Field Waves, and the Treatment of Alzheimer's device I was a bit skeptical about the results from the latest head device for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, but I always look for a plausible explanation for apparently successful results and while this one takes quite a few connections it does seem plausible.
First step:
... therapeutic effect is elicited through the increased expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90. 
https://betweenrockandhardplace.wordpress.com/2017/03/02/brief-report-on-the-alzheimers-disease-cell-phone-radiation-exposures/ 
Second step:
""In the rostral ventrolateral medulla, the 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70), but not HSP90, confers neuroprotection against fatal endotoxemia via augmentation of nitric-oxide synthase I (NOS I)/protein kinase G signaling pathway and inhibition of NOS II/peroxynitrite cascade.""
This is important because the protein kinase G signalling pathway contributes to increased blood flow in the brain whereas peroxynitrite contributes to neuronal cell death.  Also via the phosphatidyinositol 3 kinase/akt pathway heat shock protein 70 may promote the regeneration of neurons and synapses in the hippocampus
Third step (the way in which heat shock protein 70 limits the damage of amyloid, inhibits tau misfolding, and limits neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease).
""Heat Shock Proteins Regulate Activation-induced Proteasomal Degradation of the Mature Phosphorylated Form of Protein Kinase C*"" [heat shock protein 70 and not 90 for protein kinase C alpha].
This is important because nearly every factor that triggers Alzheimer's disease activates protein kinase C.
""Malinow’s team found that when mice are missing the PKC alpha gene, neurons functioned normally, even when amyloid beta was present. Then, when they restored PKC alpha, amyloid beta once again impaired neuronal function. In other words, amyloid beta doesn’t inhibit brain function unless PKC alpha is active. ""
Before various enzymes get damaged in Alzheimer's disease perhaps electromagnetic head devices do have some benefit.","comment 1: Also, to quote you:
“ I always look for a plausible explanation behind apparently successful results.”
This is the critical flaw in your thinking - this is not how scientists are trained to think, for good reason.  My discussions with other scientists about papers often begin with them saying “well I want to believe this is true, but...”
Whenever you see a positive result, even one that is completely expected, you should do everything in your power to disprove it. If you cannot disprove it after extensive research and testing, then you can accept it to be true. This how how rigorous statistical planning for experiments works. 
You work the opposite of this with any study you find that supports your hypothesis - you pick out the parts that support your theory with no critical evaluation or consideration of counter explanation. 
If you find extensive flaws in the research design, analysis, or interpretation of the results, you really can’t take much away from a study. Yet you do this time and time again to irresponsibly promote unproven herbal remedies to patients.
comment 2: Ah, but you are doing something similar, you just don't realize.  You start with a premise that herbs cannot be used to treat Alzheimer's disease, and then dismiss all evidence to the contary as junk science.  When a meta-analysis says a certain type of treatment is inconclusive the skeptic reads that as conclusively against.  
On the other hand if the explanation produces poor results time and again (say the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease) then the reverse is done--the failed results must be caused by something because the hypothesis has to be correct--wrong dose, given too late, wrong form of amyloid.  Thus ""positive"" results are rejected because they don't square with what one believes, and negative results are rejected because they do not fit the hypothesis that many Alzheimer's researchers have based their carreers upon.  And thus no progress is made.
This anonymous quote puts it nicely:
[Clinical trials with over-the-counter supplements have concentrated either on items which suppress inflammation, or on antioxidants which scavenge oxygen derived free radicals. Most of these items have proved to be worthless in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Similarly most drugs used to treat Alzheimer's disease do little to slow the deterioration, but instead offer a mild temporary symptom relief. However, evidence has been accumulating that the primary driver of Alzheimer's disease is a nitrogen derived free radical called peroxynitrite, which may mediate both amyloid and tau accumulation as well as their toxicity. Excellent results have been obtained with peroxynitrite scavengers, with reversals of Alzheimer's disease in human clinical trials being repeatedly demonstrated. IMHO, the only thing which may be preventing the abolition of Alzheimer's disease is the mental inertia of scientists, as well as the bureaucrats who fund them. Unfortunately, most bureaucrats keep throwing money into repeatedly testing discredited interventions, while ignoring successful ones. Common sense is anything but...]
comment 3: You just don't get it.  I start with the hypothesis that NOTHING can treat Alzheimer's disease, and work backwards from there.  The genetic, human, and preclinical data on the amyloid hypothesis is extremely strong.  Unfortunately, the human trials have all shown that targeting it at all the stages they have tried does not change disease.  Either amyloid does its damage in the prodromal stages of the disease (10,20 years before symptom onset), or it is simply a byproduct of other pathogenic processes (inflammation, infection, diminished proteostastic mechanisms)  [please don't post a bunch of random abstracts to try and say that peroxynitration is involved in all of these processes].  To wit - Amyloid is most likely heavily involved in disease, we are just unable to therapeutically target it.  The clinical trials do not ""prove"" that amyloid is not involved in disease - they do seem to prove that  it is not a good therapeutic target to treat the disease.
Many researchers have also based their careers on the hypothesis that antioxidants can treat alzheimer's. These large scale trials have also failed.
When I read that meta-analyses of evidence around a hypothesis is inconclusive, I certainly don't dismiss it out of hand.  But the stuff you continually post and try to connect is really scientifically weak.  You try to connect poorly done clinical trials to cherry-picked in vitro studies to support your hypothesis when they really have nothing to do with each other.  And you post these piece by piece in a haphazard fashion which makes the evidence chain really hard to follow, instead of collating them into one cogent review citing 150-200 papers.  
Again, my problem with you is not the discussion of alternative theories of Alzheimer's, or even that you are an amateur scientist. My problem is that you discuss your relatively fringe theory as basically settled fact to a lay-patient population using jargon-filled posts to legitimize yourself while promoting unproven and potentially harmful herbal remedies.
I would love it if Alzheimer's could be effectively treated with aromatherapy, or CBD, or essential oils, or anything else that is readily available. Unfortunately that is not the case.
Using an anonymous quote that sounds like you wrote it to support yourself?  Jesus.  I googled it and you posted it almost a decade ago on another forum (that you were probably asked to leave).
comment 4: Well at least I have been upgraded to holding a relatively fringe theory since you have already acknowledged that ""many researchers have also based their careers on the hypothesis that antioxidants can treat alzheimer's.""
As far as I know there has only been one large scale clinical trial testing antioxidants for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and it was fraught with many problems.
One major mistake was to assume that because genetic mutations led to amyloid that amyloid had to be the cause of Alzheimer's disease, but those same genetic mutations led to oxidative stress first.  And amyloid is certainly not the only thing that can cause oxidative stress in the brain.  Plus those other factors lead to amyloid in the first place.
https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2014/375968/
So the problem was not that anti-amyloid drugs were given too late, the problem was that they focused on only one trigger for the disease (in this respect Dr. Dale Bredesen is far ahead most of the ""rock stars"" of Alzheimer's disease).
The quote is not mine.  I know little about the person who wrote it other than that he is Canadian and is an amateur scientist who carefully reviewed the literature.  At the time, the evidence for his position was not as strong as he suggested, but the intervening years have significantly bolstered his claims.
comment 5: The linked blog is a great summary of the current work on EMF and AD research. I will have to dive a little more deeply into the individual papers if I have time. 
From the end of the blog:
“The currently available scientific database on the impact of RF-EMF exposures on AD is too limited to draw any final, or far reaching, conclusions in relation to human health and human health risk.”
From my reading of the summary it sounds like the evidence on benefit is very thin with an unclear mechanism, and is greatly outweighed by the safety considerations. 
Of course you connect this to your peroxynitration hypothesis, using extremely tenuous connections, and a word salad that looks impressive to those without a scientific education, but in reality barely makes sense to those who have studied the field.

"Help needed finding emergency response gadgets? Hey all,
I am new to the community. I have a weird situation. My mother is not very old. She is 58.. Mostly in good health.
But recently she fell and hurt herself in her apartments basement parking lot. It was 10min before someone else came in so she could ask for help.
In the basement she has no cell coverage so she couldn't call anyone.
Is their an app or device which can notify me if her heart rate is abnormal even if she is not in cell coverage? Or at worst case notify emergency services?","comment 1: It's called Life Alert. I'm sure there are a few different companies that do this, but my grandmother had this one. Remember the old ""help I've fallen and can't get up"" commercials? That's essentially what this is. Grandma had a necklace with a button on it. If she had a fall or any other issues she could press the button. Now, they have someone call to check on the situation. If no one answers then they automatically alert emergency services. I'm sure they can save your info as an emergency contact...that way if they do get a hold of your mother they can determine the severity of the situation.
comment 2: [deleted]
comment 3: I read that some of these services can use a landline as well, but I see your predicament... if your mother is in the parking lot I'm not sure if the service would extend that far. Best bet would be to contact a couple of these places to see how far their landline coverage would extend. I think Verizon has an emergency medical alert, but there again you run into the no cellular service issue. Wish I could be more help on that.
comment 4: How close is her apartment to the basement? I have to make calls/texts over WiFi in my actual apartment because we have no cell service. You could try getting a WiFi booster that would reach the basement.
comment 5: [deleted]
comment 6: My husband said you'd need a massively strong mesh router and isn't sure it would work (he's an electrical engineer). A few suggestions, but none are simple:

Ask the building owner and see if they'll add something for safety, like install a cell signal booster (it might be a liability if someone fell and died in the basement because they had no cell service to call for help)
Make friends with someone on the first floor, get their WiFi password, and then see if you can put a mesh router in the basement that would pick up on their WiFi signal so that your mom could use that when she was down there

Does she own or rent?
comment 7: [deleted]
comment 8: Hope you can figure something out!
And then, just because we're dealing with my grandmother right now - try to get your mom into a true single story with a kitchen/bathroom wide/large enough to use a walker in. My grandmother's  single story house has two steps into the garage and they've been a nightmare. Also, move her some place accessible - my grandmother lives in a fairly remote retirement community in NJ, so she has to rely on expensive taxis because there isn't much public transportation. Plus, it snows, and since she's isn't near i-95 (largest highway on the east coast), it isn't like we can drop in to say hello while we're driving by on a road trip. If you can move here somewhere near you, that's ideal - it would make our lives so much better - but you probably can't commit to living in the same town for the next 20+ years, so just try to make it a place that isn't hard to get to.
comment 9: [deleted]
comment 10: The cell booster is a great idea.  If you are so inclined, you might offer to buy it and donate it if they would install it.  That way you could ensure compatibility with her cell phone.  Sell it on the safety merits and you're surprised they don't already have one.
comment 11: I assume you dont live in that same complex. There are devices you can get if there is someone within say 100 feet. You would need to test it tho. I live with my dad and got him a small wireless dorrbell. he puts one around his neck, the reciever is in my room and is quite loud. he presses the button and the receiver chimes and lights flash. It works by wireless, i believe 2.4ghz. Got it on Amazon. 
I dont know of anything other than Life Alert of that kind. Would want to talk to them about coverage. Same with a small radio like a walkie talkie. What about something using satellte technology? 
If you cant find anything try this....if theres a college close or just email one with an engineering dept and present your problem and see what they say. can also try an engineering firm.  Might also try a communications company. 
Cellphone boosters...would be a good idea for the landlord to put these in, in the event someone does fall or is sick or gets attacked. It is placed on the upper perimeter to boost the signal to the outside world.
WiFi-calling, which doesnt rely on the cellphones usual signal, if the basement has wifi coverage then try her phone using the wifi instead of the usual signal. You would need to check the coverage all thru the garage.
Just thinking out loud. What the landlord needs to do is put a call booster in so people can use their cells to call for help. If they make a emergency call box that people could just dial from their phone, 911 call. Good luck and hope Mom is doing ok.
comment 12: Great advice in here. I merely wanted to add: If she fell due to an imbalance or suddenly feeling dizzy, maybe she‘d want to see a doctor just in case.
comment 13: I would start by getting a cell repeater for the house. Its a plug in device that  boosts all cell signals in the area. 
Then get a smart watch, so she can monitor it herself. 
Then life alert or something of that nature where she can hit a button and call someone. 
There are devices she can have put on her by her doctor that will monitor he heart rate, if the doctor thinks it is necessary. It will usually come with a wireless unit in the house that will call someone.

"Apps to track dementia care well I’m very new to Reddit and came online after hearing about it from a friend. I’m researching care apps that you can use to track activities for your loved ones with dementia—to track medication, food, movement, etc while providing care for them. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thank you!","comment 1: ^(this sub is satirical. It’s dedicated to posting the same comic repeatedly.

I will ask my grandmother's  caretaker. She writes in a 'diary' about what when on while she was there. It kinda shows what kind of day she is having memory  wise. And what activities  they have done. My grandfather  does not do smart phones so I will ask if they have an app

"Location tracking/call screening with iPhone 4 Hi, appreciate your input. My father (73) was diagnosed with dementia a year ago. He has used an iPhone 4 since 2013... probably not going to get him to upgrade now! 
My problem is — it seems like the majority of the tracking or call screening apps that might be useful for me to put on his phone are no longer compatible with iPhone 4. Do any of you have experience with an app that still works on an ancient smart phone?","comment 1: Could you switch him to a newer iphone and keep the same case? Any chance he wears a watch and would wear the Apple Watch? Ever since I read about the EKG reading and the fall monitoring component, I have wanted to see if it could help the geriatric community.
comment 2: Thanks for the advice! I was able to get my hands on an iPhone 6, and despite some initial problems, he seems to be doing fine with it. The fact that it’s new and shiny helps a lot, and I was able to remove most of the newer features that would cause him trouble.
comment 3: Seconding what the other commenter said - would you consider upgrading to an iPhone SE? I just switched my mom from her iPhone 4 to an SE because a lot of the apps were no longer compatible, and it's been a huge improvement because of the speed, the buttons not lagging, and the responsiveness of the screen. It stops her from triple clicking everything.
comment 4: That’s a good idea ... I’m slightly concerned about him being confused by the new charger. But worth an try!
comment 5: Have you tried Life360? I used that app with my mom and she had an iphone 4 (or maybe 5?).
comment 6: alternatively can you share his location with you using find my friend.
comment 7: Just to update this, I got him an iPhone 6 and he surprisingly adjusted to it ok, despite the slightly different interface. He can’t really text much any more and accidentally butt dials people but besides that, it’s working well enough.

"Safety issues Hello. New here and still trying to figure out what I need to do. 
My 65 yo wife was diagnosed with FTDementia two years ago. Originally thought to be Alzheimers and had various scans including the expensive new PET scan that definitively ruled out Alzheimers. She also has diabetes and thyroid issues and takes a statin for high cholesterol.
While she she presents somewhat normally if you don't spend a lot of time with her it is becoming more apparent her short term memory is almost gone. Repeating things and asking questions constantly, playing solitaire on an iPad all day it allowed. She used to cook but can't really do that any longer as ingredients get left out or the stove gets left on... pretty typical behavior.
I use the USPS service that alerts you to what mail is expected each day, have moved all bills to online payment so she can't interfere and have our home phone line forward to my cell. I had it ringing at home AND my cell but disabled the ability to receive calls at home since the other day she answered a call from a scammer and gave out her medical information. Fortunately the doctors office alerted me when the scammer called there trying to elicit information.
When I asked my wife about the call she didn't remember what she told the scammer.
On one hand I hate to block the phone completely (I also screen all her email) but I don't want what happened the other day to happen again. 
Our utility has a device that can be installed on the electrical panel that allows you to monitor the electrical system and see what devices are being turn on and off. Designed as a tool for monitoring expenses but I'm using it as a safety tool to make sure the stove/oven gets turned off if I'm not around.
Any suggestions or should I just let things be as they are with calls all coming to me? 
Thank you.","comment 1: Rerouting all your calls to your cell is a great idea! We did that with my grandma in law, pretty much for the same reason. She was still able to make calls though and we left a sheet with friends and families numbers beside the phone. She needed help to use it though so it was usually an activity that her visitors could help her with.
comment 2: Hey, is there a way to let ""certain"" numbers through? My Mom is going nuts this afternoon. Scammers keep calling but of course she doesn't think they are, they're checking to see she's home to come get her, they're this, they're that... the only problem with completely re-routing calls is she has family and friends that do call to drop by, or take her out for lunch etc., and would want her to get those. If anyone knows, would be grateful for the the answer.
comment 3: I'm in Canada, so there wasn't really anything like that here. (At least that we could find at the time) But I think I remember seeing a TMobile plan or something that would only ring if certain numbers were calling. I don't know if it exists anymore though.
comment 4: It depends on your phone and carrier. I'm using Comcast for a landline and you can block all or block up to 25 numbers total. Either or. We also use a free service to block spammers (nomorobo.com).
Cell phones (at least my iPhone) has the ability to block everyone except your Favorite contacts or your address book.
comment 5: I kinda figured. It's a land line. She has a cell but was never very good at it and now forgets how to make a call on it at all most days. Blocking 25 numbers won't get rid of all the random spam calls they get on the landline. She really only can use land line handset these days, and struggles with that sometimes.

"Tracking Apps for Parent's Cellphone My dad has Alzheimer's.  He's been losing his phone a lot lately.  I have Find My iPhone on his phone, and we're usually able to locate it...however that doesn't work when he forgets to charge it and it turns off.  So I just bought him a bungee tether for his phone so i'll be attached to his pants and he can't lose it.  Let's hope that works.....
However that's just part one.  The other part is that he's getting frustrated about not being able to be independent, and he's getting very stubborn and acting out.  Sometime's he'll just go somewhere else when my mother or his aid isn't looking, and then we have to find him.  
I would like to get a tracking app for his phone that is a little more sophisticated than Find My iPhone.  Something that will have a more specific location tracker, something that has a ""geo-fence"" that will let me know when he has traveled outside of a particular area.  Preferably something that my mom can patch into and see where he is, or if she forgets, it'll tell her if he's not where he's supposed to be.  Also, and I don't even know if this is possible, something that would allow me to patch into their phone and either use the mic to hear what's around or the camera to see what's around, in case we really can't find him.  I don't know if that last part is possible.  
I know there are good kid tracking apps, but I don't have kids, so I don't know what they are.  Does anyone have any suggestions based off of apps they've used?
Thanks","comment 1: I work in an assisted living facility with a focus in memory care, and this happens ALOT. An app that I would recommend is Life 360. You can create a “circle” and that shows where the family member is, shows trip history if they were to go somewhere, and even shows their batter percentage so you can remind him to plug it in if you notice he’s getting low. You can set up notifications for when he leaves and arrives and destinations. Hope this was helpful, and good luck!
comment 2: I will look into that.  Thank you for the very quick reply, it was very helpful.
comment 3: You’re welcome! One this I forgot to add is it isn’t accurate to the point of telling you, for example, where in the house they are. But it can give an address and general area
comment 4: I second Life360. The peace of mind it's given me since putting it on my parent's phone is worth all the hassle getting him to allow it.
comment 5: My parents can't even remember how to use their basic flip phones.  They've given up even charging them.  SO frustrating!!
comment 6: I bought mom a flip phone and she won’t use it. Setup nomorobo on the home phone and she’s not happy so many people “hang up”.  I told her it’s to protect her but it falls on deaf ears.
My nephew’s wife wanted to get her a new iPhone. Yeah, no.
comment 7: Different moms are different. My 76 year old mom has had an iPhone for quite a while and does pretty well with it - and she still works, with kids, and isn’t shy to ask one of them for help.
comment 8: IMO, you want more than a phone tracking app if he's forgetting his phone. I suggest something like the GPS tiles, where you can put one on his car keys, in the car, in the sole of his shoe, in the belt he always wears, etc, and then any time one of them goes outside a certain range, you get your alert. Unless/until he starts stripping.  
This is the recommendation for kids who are at risk of kidnapping by a family member - one in the shoe, and one in the backpack strap - so then if they ditch the backpack you still have the one in the shoe.  
The other option is to put one on him obviously (like a necklace or bracelet) so that he has something to ditch if he wants to get away and he doesn't look for the other one(s).
comment 9: Many years ago - early 80’s when my mom was alive with Alzheimer’s we had military style dog tags on her with our address and phone.  It was what we had to work with and it helped to keep her safe.
comment 10: https://blog.caregiverhomes.com/the-50-best-gps-trackers-for-seniors
comment 11: Find My iPhone is pretty much the best you can get from a phone perspective. It has lower level device location access that most apps won't. Other apps probably offer better GPS location features.
For better reliability, you'd have to find a non-phone based device with much longer battery life. Garmin (and I'm sure others) make devices intended for being out in the wild with battery life's of 90+ hours. It'd be another device, but something that you could find him with.

Have you considered case with an integrated battery? It'd give him some extra battery life (double or more depending on the case).
comment 12: For when the phone is lost/dead, I use a Tile on my grandmother's phone. Works great! We also have an Alexa Show set up near her favorite chair and we can ""drop in"" on her in the Alexa app when needed. She is, luckily, not as mobile as your grandfather!
comment 13: You can also get solar cases that Habe little solar panels on the back so it’s being passively charged even if he forgets to charge it

"Using smartwatch/fitness tracker for GPS tracking? My dad hasn't started wandering yet, but we have reason to believe he will as the disease progresses, so we'd like to get some sort of device for tracking his whereabouts.  Not surprisingly, we will have to be crafty about this (he's growing increasingly suspicious of my mom, thinks she's trying to control him so she can take all his money, etc.) and we'll have to ""trick"" him into wearing a device.  Something he puts on every single day is a watch, so we thought that'd be a good place to start.  I know there are devices out there specifically for elderly patients, but he's still young (he has early onset) and he's really particular about style when it comes to watches (lol) and if it's too clunky or unattractive, he won't wear it.  There's an abundance of good looking smartwatches & fitness trackers on the market these days, so I was wondering if anyone had used something like that for tracking loved ones (vs a device specifically made for an elderly dementia patient)?  Can we enable the GPS tracking functionality with those watches to be on 24/7, or is it only active when you're exercising? Thanks in advance!","comment 1: In time he will forget to put on his watch. For my dad, we used a necklace that fit inside his shirt so he couldn’t see it. I would put it on him everyday, since he couldn’t see or feel it, he forgot about it and would keep it on.
comment 2: I heard of people sewing devices into clothing or bags, not sure if that’s something your dad would catch on to.
comment 3: I got a Jiobit for my mother and put it on her keys. She doen't leave the house without them, so I feel comfortable knowing if she leaves the geofence, I get notified and can watch it on a map where she's going/has been. The battery could be better, but the device is tiny so it's not too big.

"Preparing my mother's house for Father's progression of Alzheimer's Just curious if anyone had any advice for medical devices that may be of great help when dealing with Alzheimer's.  My father is in his mid 70s and had his diagnosis 5 years ago.  He is starting to become incontinent, and has frequent dizziness and gait issues now.  So far I'm assuming we have to make their shower wheelchair friendly, toilet handles, the reclining  sofa chair that helps you get up.  Also looking into getting a hospital bed as right now he sleeps in a king size and will be a lot of laundry and linen changing for my mother to constantly be doing.  He has not started wandering yet, and can feed himself and is starting to have difficulty with buttoning shirts and putting on jackets and buckling himself into the car.  Also does Medicare or insurance cover these items as long as the Dr writes a script?  Any advice would be very appreciated!  Sorry for the post being everywhere, but there is a lot to prep for.","comment 1: For the incontinence, put away all of his underwear and put pull-up depends/diapers in their place - so he has no choice but to wear them. For the bed, you can buy material, by the yard, for his bed that is almost indestructible.  It has flannel on each side and rubber in the middle. You can cut it to size and you can have several of them. So all you have to do is remove the wet one and put a dry one under him.
Safety is paramount if he has entered that phase. Take the burner knobs off the stove, hide the car keys,  put slide locks extremely high or low on the doors (where he wouldn’t think to look).  If he starts falling, put protective bumpers on the sharp edges of the furniture.  The best thing to do is to walk through the house and look at it as if you had to babyproof it for a toddler.  He also should not be left at home, alone. There are just too many bad things that can happen, just like that could with a child.
Please return with any other questions, or even to vent. Most of us have been through this too and can sympathize.
comment 2: Thank you!  I will look for this type of bedding.  Is it something I can find at Joann's?   They have baby and toddler grandkids that come over frequently so a lot of their things are safer and they have minimal furniture.  Any door locks recommended for basement door?  I was thinking of changing out the handle because my mom is on the shorter side.  Also I am trying to get him into an adult day care program in case I need to take her grocery shopping as he gets super irritated going these days.  He used to love shopping, do you think it would be a theraputic treatment to create a list he has to find in the store or do you think it would be overwhelming and make him more irritated?
comment 3: Also think about helpful items for eating and deinking. Plates with 90 angle sides to help get food onto spoon or fork. Tumbler cups with lids and straws...., the sliding bathtub chair was super helpful for my Mom. And if you have hardwood floors, rugs or hallway runners for high walking areas. And putting medication in a hidden spot.
comment 4: Also find whatever he is interested in and get a lot of it. My mother became obsessed with clothing catalog and kid puzzles. It helped keep her occupied and mind working for quite a while. We also child proofed the cabinets and appliances. This stopped lots of dangerous accidents as she forgot the use of stuff. Definitely get a hospital bed or add rails to the bed. We did both. Medicare paid for the hospital bed.
comment 5: Yeah, I was looking at hospital beds on Craigslist.  Does Medicare pay for entirely or does your doctor write a script and you pay a copay?  My dad loved to shop, was wondering if giving him a grocery list and taking him shopping would be a good idea.  But he does get irritated going places now.
comment 6: Hospice paid for my mother's hospital bed too and she did not die for almost 7 years after the doctor wrote the prescription. That's just what they have to write to get the bed and nurses paid for. It's scary but once you see that's the only way to get the bed and accessories without going bankrupt.
comment 7: It may vary state by state, but for my wife medicare (through hospice) paid 100% for a hospital bed, shower chair, disposable underwear, moistened wipes, lotions and soaps, waterproof pads (to put on couches, chairs...) 3x5 foam pad for the floor in case she fell out of bed, and all of her meds.
Basically anything the hospice nurse decided would be useful would show up the next day.
If you haven't gotten a referral for hospice yet, do it tomorrow morning.
comment 8: I always saw hospice as a ""he is going to die soon"" type of referral. Bi didn't think those type of things would be available for him at this stage.  I'll call his doctor tomorrow!  Thank you
comment 9: I believed the exact same thing 
Technically, the referal has to be for a life expectancy of less than 6 months, but I think that is taken with a grain of salt. The main nurse we had said she's had patients on hospice for over 2 years.
comment 10: Please let me know how it works out.

Trouble is, the devices I have found online are very  expensive, or cheap and not well regarded.  Does anyone have any advice to offer about these tools?
Thanks for any thoughts.","comment 1: All the GPS devices require charging every 1-2 days - does your relative live with someone who can do that for them?
If someone can charge the device/ We like this but it runs on a 2g network, which will be discontinued in Canada next year.

comment 2: Thanks ... I will have a look.
comment 3: No problem... there’s no easy solution if you don’t live with them. A battery that could handle a longer charge wouldn’t be as inconspicuous/easy to just clip on their house keys, purse, or belt. (Think of how big phone batteries are and that requires a daily charge. They have to update location via GPS so that’s a big drain - even if you set it to one update every minute, it’s still a big drain.)
If the relative is alone, do they have PSWs coming in? If so, are they government PSWs or private? A private PSW coming in daily might be willing to charge a device. You could buy two and swap them out.

Someone on my other thread recommended the GizmoWatch from Verizon, but the reviews aren't very inspiring. One of the reviews mentions something called a GizmoGadget, which must have been the previous version of the GizmoWatch.
Have you asked whatever specialist helps your affected relative?
comment 5: You can use a cell phone for tracking. Even a flip-phone can be tracked. That way there is a better chance the tracker will be carried and kept charged.  Help make sure it is used by calling every day or week and get others to call so it becomes a habit.

"Location tracker that isn't obvious? Hi all, 
My nana has advancing dementia but at the moment she is still self sufficient and lucid.
My grandfather passed away last week and we are concerned as she has gotten much worse with the stress of his passing and cant remember that he has died and is calling everyone convinced he is either still in the hospital or has left her :(
My mum is worried she may wander off, at the moment someone is staying with her every night but she has a few hours during the day where she is alone.
We previously gave her a Tile as she was misplacing her keys but she took it off. We now want something we can low key put in her purse that she won't notice in case she goes missing as she always carrys her purse on her. Is there such a thing?
We are looking into care options (UK) but she threw the poor nurse out of the house a few months ago that was supposed to be helping with meds and doesnt want strangers in the house. Short term any tips on keeping her safe/ keeping an eye on her in a non invasive way appreciated?","comment 1: Can you put the tile in the inner zippered pocket of the purse? it won't be obvious and I doubt she'd notice

Ideally something that could slip in like a credit card. She does have a cell phone but she never takes it unfortunately. She also doesnt have wifi in the house so need something gps wise.
comment 3: Have you looked into putting the Alzheimer’s locks on the doors leading outside? It’s what we’ve had to do with my grandmother because on her bad days she makes a beeline to the doors the minute I’m distracted.
comment 4: My aunt bought my grandparents fitbits and made them seem like it was to track their health/exercise, etc. Didn't even tell them that it was possible to track. I'm not sure how much money you're willing to spend, and it may not be the best idea since it's something she could easily take off or could lose battery.
comment 5: You can put a Tile in her purse. but you can also buy a Tile and get one of those pretty covers that has a bunch of your photographs on it, string it on a nice chain along with other charms and ask her to wear it.
Other than that, you should look into seeing what memory care facilities are there, and what they cost. My neighbor moved into one, and  it was essential because her move from mild cognitive impairment to full blown dementia was swift. They sold her house, and that's how they've been able to afford the expense.

"Seeking recommendations for tracking watch Hello, my father in law has Alzheimer's and things have reached a point where my mother in lawdd has asked for my help in finding a watch for him to wear. I've done some research and ordered one device from Amazon that turned out to only work on 2G mobile networks which AT&T has deactivated. I'd rather not get something that is an expensive wearable that is geared more toward active people and is too focused on counting steps and heart rate and such.
Has anyone here had experience with this or recently bought one that they ended up really liking? 
At a bare minimum we would want something that looks like a normal-ish digital watch and has the time on the front display. The primary purpose would be to have something that has a companion app that other family members could use to track him on their phones if he wanders off (god forbid), both android and iphone. Extra features like being able to call the watch or listen in on it remotely through the app would be nice, but aren't a must.
The one I already ordered and had to send back because it wouldn't work on the cell network (it was 2G) was this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GRZQ6SK/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_C1wDDbSJP80V7

We didn't do anything extreme. We just put those cheap alarms on the door that shriek when you open them. We also put a slide lock at the bottom of the door we used the most since those alarms got annoying. Dad never noticed the lock that low. 
Children's safety locks are also useful. They have grip and twist door knob covers that work great. 
Hope this also helps.

In  this book, former research scientist and hospice quality consultant  Melanie Merriman deliver a raw, matter-of-fact take on one of the most  universally challenging roles a person can take: that of a caregiver.  The author shares her own personal experiences to paint a stirring  picture of what it's like to guide and support a parent through old age.
With  intelligence that can only be gained by overcoming these challenges,  Merriman provides current and potential caregivers with an eye-opening  look into the struggles and joys that come along with this  responsibility.","comment 1: Great list - thanks! I love Chicken Soup for the soul books....Have you heard of “The Conscious Caregiver,” by Linda Abbie? Or “Being Mortal,” by Atul Gawande? Both were recommended to me...
comment 2: Being Mortal is such an important book.  My folks have shared their wishes for years.  Although, dad just passed a few weeks back.  In going through his wish papers, I found a few notes on things I didn't know he wanted.  If you can't talk about what you want with your loved ones, I recommend you write them down and put them in a safe place where they'll be found.
comment 3: If I may, I would like to add another resource for caregivers... lots of consolidated information in one spot: https://sagacity.care/splash/caregivers/
comment 4: Thank you! I'm new to this and everything is a complicated struggle.  I was just thinking earlier today if there were any good books - I'll have to check these out in more detail.

"Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia Basically, I'm currently living with my mother and brother at 28 due to my old roommate moving away. My uncle had a stroke about two years ago, and a couple months ago we moved him in with us to take care of him (this is the second family member we've done this with, the last was my grandfather with the same issue). They said he's had multiple ""silent"" strokes in addition to the major one, and he has trouble forming new memories or remembering anything from the last 5-6 years (for example, he doesn't remember that my granddad, his dad, passed away). As such, he needs constant care as if he wanders out, after 45 minutes to an hour or so he'll have forgotten what's going on entirely.
&#x200B;
We can't afford to keep taking care of him, I'm trying to get my own life on track and I'm giving up about a quarter of my paycheck each month towards his care, as he has to go to adult care while we're not home. The doctors are refusing to diagnose him with dementia and keep trying to send him to mental health therapists, which is causing problems applying for SSD. His daughter is 22, and basically doesn't want to do anything on her own, so she's living out of his house and was burning through about 2500 of his savings a month until my mother moved the money. If we even try to breach the subject of selling the house so that we can move him towards Medicaid she starts texting him telling him we're trying to throw her out and he gets distressed and upset because she keeps pushing the narrative that there's nothing significantly wrong with him.  
I really don't know what we can do. He barely had 10k in his savings after his daughter was done with it and that's not even going to last a year. We don't have anyone else to turn to as he's the last surviving member of my mom's side of the family, and he's 58 so barring another major stroke we're likely to be caring for him for the foreseeable future. Outside of governmental, do you guys know of any charities or organizations that can help?","comment 1: Your first call is to Social Services to see if you are possibly eligible for any benefits.  Your second call would be for a 30 minute consult with an ElderLaw attorney.  It shouldn't be that expensive.
comment 2: It's a little complicated.Has he signed a Power of Attorney over to your mother yet?  If not, then he needs to do that while he can still comprehend what he's signing.  Because this will be important for her to have when he gets to the point where he can't make any decisions, and the house absolutely needs to be sold.  Sounds like she has access to his banking so that he can continue to pay bills. That's all good, but make sure she has that POA.
He has already decided to live with you, so, if he wants, he can sell the house. However, another way around this might be to investigate on your own, what memory care facilities are open, how much they cost, and what they offer. Talk to others who have gone through a similar situation, and go look at the places they sent their loved ones. Once you have the costs, this will be info you can share with him that will point to the necessity of selling. As far as the daughter, you will have to get an attorney or a restraining order forbidding her to live in the house. It's called a move out order. If you have evidence (documentation -bank records) that she's taken money, that's valuable info for the judge.  Also, document what happens, and the dates when she's texted or called him and harassed him about the house.
Read up on Adult Protective Services.  It's good to know what they can do before you make that call.  Has he made ANY statements to you about being afraid of his daughter?   If you do, then write down what happened and when. Chances are, they'll call you back to determine whether or not there's enough evidence to begin an investigation, or if your mother has everything under control.
As far as the doctor, he needs to get a neuro-cognitive workup. Your mother should also be signed in for being the person allowed to ask for information and talk to the doctors for him.  Is he on private insurance now?  Does he need a referral, or can he just go to a neurologist?  Read through his policy and find out whether he has an HMO, PPO and how his plan works. If he doesn't have ANY insurance, then he can just go, though it'll all be out of pocket. He can, at any point, apply for Medicaid without the SSD.
Anyone can call the county and request a social worker to come out and make an evaluation of his mental and physical condition at any point.
comment 3: My mother has POA, but unfortunately so does his daughter. 
He didn't actually decide to live with us; every day he forgets why he's here and we have to tell him he's staying with us for a while and make up something to placate him. He does not have the mental faculty to know that he needs to sell his house, some days he insists that he never had any strokes and that he's fine. 
The problem is it doesn't matter how much we talk to him, his recall period is only about six hours so all he can remember is that his daughter is living in his house and that we're trying to sell it, so when she calls him and tells him that, he thinks we're trying to do it out of malice.
He's not afraid of his daughter, he legitimately wants to give her a place to stay but he can't understand what's going on because he thinks he's only been staying with us a few days when he's been here over 6 months.
As for insurance, he's on the low income version of Medicaid rn so we can afford doctor visits, but they won't cover longterm care unless he has less than 9k in assets. 
I'll see about having a social worker out but the problem is that someone just sitting down and talking to him can't really see the extent of the problem. He can carry on a normal conversation without many problems, maybe a little confusion, the issue is that he won't remember any of it later. Basically his symptoms are similar to anterograde amnesia. His PCD agrees that it's vascular dementia, but the specialist he was referred to is hemming and hawing and saying that he just has some ""memory issues"" and she can't recommend disability.
comment 4: Sounds like you may need a lawyer to pry the blood-sucking leech out of the house. That would my first stop, anyway. She's not only blocking your uncle's healthcare, she's indirectly siphoning money out of you since you're at an impasse until she turns loose of the house. I don't know all the details, but that's what it sounds like. Best wishes, and big hugs for your kindness taking care of your uncle.
comment 5: Well, we can get her out of the house, the issue is that she's going to immediately start whining to Uncle that we're making her homeless and he's going to flip out because he can't understand why we need to. But yeah, I appreciate the support!
"
"Help with early signs/symptoms? Backstory to start. My uncle died in January this year from Lewy bodies dementia. He was diagnosed at 60 and died at 68. He was the oldest of 3 children, my mum is the youngest, 12 years younger than her brother and 8 younger than her sister. She turned 57 this year.
I met with my cousin (aunt’s daughter) these past couple of weeks on our own and mentioned that my mum has been seemingly losing her sense of direction and asking me the same thing multiple times over the past few months since my uncle died. She agreed and told me that my aunt had mentioned it too. Bearing in mind that her and my cousin see us every 2/3 months, I see my mum multiple times a week and I’ve noticed it, which to me says a lot. I don’t know whether it is stress (she’s got a new job, moving house and losing her brother) or whether it is more than that. 
I am already keeping a diary of when I notice things. What else can I do to keep track of things? Do I keep it to myself for now, between family, or let my mum know? I am at a complete loss right now so anything would be helpful.","comment 1: Better safe than sorry love. An awkward conversation now could make a difference. I would mention it and maybe see a dr if she feels a similar concern. Sorry you've been through the death of a loved one. It could be fatigue and stress related but it's always good to check. Is there a history of dementia in your family?
comment 2: Lewy body isn't necessarily hereditary especially at the age on of early to mod sixties.
But back to your question. I would recommend some actual neurological testing to establish a baseline and then repeat that test some time down the road, at that point you'll have a clearer understanding of the progression.  
If there is progression and the neurologist can narrow down the cause to dementia then unfortunately it's time to have the hard conversations about how to handle it.
comment 3: Contact your Primary Care Doctor and have him or her look at your Mon.

"What to do when they don’t want to live anymore? Hi there. My boyfriend and I are in our 30s and are seriously committed to each other longterm. We once were hoping and planning to get married, and still would if it were physically and financially possible. We have lived together for a long time.
However, all our dreams died about five years ago when he very suddenly became overwhelmingly ill with a very misunderstood severe neuroimmune disease. This disease is not technically terminal, but it is progressive and degenerative, and will eventually render him unable to sit up, eat, speak, or read. This could take a few years, or a few decades. The most common causes of death with this illness are suicide, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, so it will be a very very long, drawn out torturous and painful process for him, and for me to watch the person I love fall apart. This disease has a notoriously low quality of life.
I have been taking care of him for four years, there have been ups and downs, but really only downs in the last year or so. We used to be able to leave our apartment together a few times a month and have meaningful interactions, but now his level of pain and suffering has him completely bedridden unable to even handle the volume from the TV. Conversations are rare; he doesn’t have the energy. 
His needs for the first two years were nothing I couldn’t handle, but these last two years are starting to overwhelm me (things like helping him to the bathroom, bringing him water from the next room, keeping track of his 42 meds, getting yelled at for speaking because he cannot handle audio/noise or conversation, physically helping him up when he tries to walk and falls down, preparing all his meals and sometimes feeding him, etc.
As much as it wears on me, I love him and I know however I feel about all this is nothing compared to what he feels, having his life taken from him so young, and being the one physically experiencing the pain and limitations. We both know it will only get worse too, and will end up needing extreme professional care and hospital equipment to keep his body alive down the road.
Here is the caveat. He is incredibly grateful for everything I do for him, he has never been intentionally rude or demanding, and often apologies (which I assure him is not necessary) for requiring me to do so much work. 
He is 100% ludic, and he says he no longer wishes to suffer like this and is petrified of the next stages of the disease which “he does not care to be around for, this is already beyond what he can tolerate.” He tells me numerous times he wants to die. He does not want me working to keep him alive anymore, yet if I don’t he wouldn’t die naturally anyway... just suffer more greatly. He gets furious and distraught that he feels I have to do all this for him when he doesn’t even want it, he just wants the suffering to end. 
I understand where he’s coming from, but it makes everything I do feel pointless and like a waste of time since he is already checked out. Hospice or assisted suicide are not legal options as this illness doesn’t meet the qualifications of “less than six months life expectancy” though he always makes a point to note that he would be so relieved if he found out he only had to endure six more months of this.
He has been treated for depression and all psychiatric angles but the thing that depresses me the most is, I don’t even think his feelings on this are terribly illogical. If I were in his situation with no hope and nothing to look forward to besides an extended excruciating life and death, I’d want to avoid all of that as well.
He loves me, and tells me all the time, but he doesn’t love me enough to continue suffering this way for the sake of it. I will never leave him. But I do know that in a year or so, his caretaking needs will seriously surpass what I am capable of and he won’t even want to be kept alive just for the sale of suffering longer anyway.
I am NOT asking how or if to end his life. That is not something I will ever do or even discuss despite the gnawing side thought that it probably would be what’s best for him in the long run. 
I don’t know how to emotionally cope with taking care of someone I love and who I know loves me, but no longer wants to be alive or be taken care of for what some people may see as a rational reason.
I don’t really know what advice I’m looking for other than how to stop crying and how to make what’s left of his somewhat functional time here the best it can be.
I read all these posts in this subreddit and it always seems like the caregiver is overwhelmed with their love one’s physical needs and demands and often have to treat them similar to a child. That’s not my situation at all. I just don’t know what or how to do anything right for him.","comment 1: You are not wrong to have feelings of understanding for his wish to allow himself to die. I know of no single individual who would be totally cool just existing inside  a body they can do nothing with. I am so sorry you both have found yourselves in this predicament and it sounds like he is lucky to have you help him to navigate as his disease progresses.
It sounds like the most important thing you can do for him right now, if you have not yet, is to see a lawyer and help him complete an Advance Directive so that as his condition progresses, he is not kept alive against his will. 
I don't want to say too much about this here as I have strong feelings about maintaining one's autonomy in death as in life. And maybe this goes against yours or his personal beliefs, but from the sound of it, per your writing, it does not. In that case, your job will be to become his advocate in the face of a lot of resistance.
I hope you find these words and the link below to be helpful. Feel free to PM me anytime.
National Hospice and Palliative Care
Edit to clarify: I know you are not asking how to help him die, but if his wish is actually to do so and there is nothing that can be done to prevent progression of the disease, then palliative care may be the most appropriate route to take. He really needs to see an appropriate lawyer to understand his legal options.
It sounds also like he is going to need to go into a care facility at some point as well. Is he on Medicaid? Again, I am so sorry you are both having to go through this.

comment 2: Hello and thank you for your kind response! May I please send you a somewhat lengthy dm in the morning (my head is spinning right now and I just need to take everything in for a moment) but I have a large bouquet of questions that I’d love to run by you if that would be okay. It’s so rare to come across somebody who seems to really understand everything, and I would love the opportunity to chat with you about this briefly and seek some clarification!
comment 3: Absolutely.
comment 4: I'm so sorry the two of you are going through this.  I have been where you are.  My husband was a Type 1 diabetic (diagnosed in his teens) and started to have more and more complications in his 30s and early 40s.  By 2014 he had had two strokes (the first in 2005), a heart attack, numerous falls, peripheral neuropathy which left him in near constant pain, multiple eye surgeries which left him with no peripheral vision and an inability to drive, Meniere's disease which causes hearing loss and vertigo, and was in early stages of kidney failure, and totally dependent on catheters.   He also had early onset dementia and the second stroke affected his personality (that was worse than the physical effects).  
As his complications worsened, he talked about wanting to die a lot, and not wanting to be a burden, etc.  He did agree to go to talk with a counselor, but didn't end up talking much. 
He tried to kill himself in 2015 by overdosing on Valium (which he had for when he got bouts of vertigo) and insulin.  He nearly died and was angry when he didn't.  He was in-patient in the psychiatric unit of the local hospital for a week to make sure that he was no longer a danger to himself.   I found his suicide note the day I picked him up from the hospital to come home.  I don't know why, but he had left it in ""his"" drawer in our bathroom vanity.  He started on anti-depressants and they helped a bit with his mood, but he still talked about wanting to be free of the constant pain and complications.  As with your boyfriend's condition, nothing he had was immediately terminal.  Terminal is awful, but prolonged suffering for who knows how long is too.  
As others have suggested, I recommend that you and your boyfriend talk with a lawyer or his primary doctor, and have an Advance Directive drawn up if he doesn't have one already.  We did that after my husband's suicide attempt and it seemed to give him some peace.  We gave a copy to his primary care doctor who went over it and discussed it with him to make sure that everyone was clear about his wishes. 
My husband ended up in the hospital in April 2017, after having extremely high blood sugars for days, and not being able to keep anything down.  He agreed to let me call 911, but later in the hospital was furious at me, saying he didn't remember agreeing to it and that he never wanted to  go to the hospital again.  He said his biggest fear was dying in the hospital (or in the ambulance on the way), alone/surrounded by strangers.   
He died at home at the end of April, about three weeks after he was discharged from the hospital.  Apparently his kidney function deteriorated extremely quickly.  I woke up the night he died because his breathing was loud and labored.  His glucose monitor also showed that his blood sugar was very low.   He was semi-conscious and stopped me when I 
reached for the phone on the bedside table.  I held him for a few minutes, talking to him and crying, still planning on calling 911.   He died in my arms before I could.  It was heartbreaking, but I am glad he was at home, with me and not in a hospital surrounded by strangers.  
Let your boyfriend dictate what he wants and have it in writing and witnessed.  I believe, legally, any adult has the right to deny any kind of treatment (that includes stopping taking medications, etc.), and to request comfort care.  I was my husband's caregiver for more than 10 years and I know how  hard  it is to watch the person you love suffer and how frustrating it is when there is really nothing that can be done medically to ""cure"" the person or to substantially improve their quality of life.    
With regard to the noise discomfort, what about noise cancelling headphones?  Would that help?  When my husband had his first stroke, he lost the ability to talk.  We used note cards with simple words/phrases to help us communicate.  Sign language--your own or ASL could be helpful too.     
You've probably done things like shower chairs, chairs in convenient places for support. 
My husband initially balked at the idea of a walker, but I ordered one anyway (he already had a cane from rehab from the 1st  stroke), and he did use it around the house and came to appreciate that it was available if/when he needed  it.  As you know, falls can be  dangerous for both of you.  I don't know about you, but it was challenging getting my husband back up on his feet sometimes.  I'm 5'4"" and he was nearly 6'!
I wish I had some wonderful words of wisdom.  Others have suggested looking into more direct caregiver support and I second that too.  I went to see a counselor myself for a few  months when I started feeling like I needed someone to talk to.  It helped.
I hope the best for both of you...the best it can be, for as long as it can be.
comment 5: I’m going through something similar. Early 30s, my husband and I, he was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor a few months ago. He went through radiation and his comfort and quality of life has gone entirely downhill. He doesn’t want to live anymore either. 
It’s tough because I want him to keep up with his treatment, but it’s making everything so much worse for him. I’ve had to just learn to respect that if he doesn’t want to live I can’t make him. I’m not going through what he is and I know he hates me seeing him like this even though I tell him not to be ashamed of it. 
I haven’t had the time or income to seek therapy. And I mostly cope by playing video games and keeping myself occupied taking care of the house. I guess I just tell myself that one day this will all be over in some way or another and when it is I’ll try to find therapy to deal with it. Sorry I don’t have any concrete advise other than mild distraction, but feel free to DM me.
comment 6: If you are in the u.s. call your local Agency on Aging. I know it's called Agency on Aging but they also have resources for disabled people. I have to say I commend you for doing so much to take care of him, that is true love right there. I read your post but I did say girl he should have married you yesterday LOL. I understand that it is not physically or financially possible.
That being said, the Agency on Aging should be able to point you in the direction of a caregiver to assist you who is paid for by the state. Also, you may qualify for a stipend to take care of him. I honestly think that your best course of action would be getting some help though. I can understand how overwhelmed you feel because I took care of my ex's mom for 7 years after she had a spinal cord injury and the difference between your boyfriend and her is that that woman was never grateful not once. I can count on one hand the number of times she ever said Thank you to me for what I was doing for her.
Anyway, I wish I could give you more advice than that but just try not to take it to heart when he does yell, understand that he is in quite a bit of pain and sometimes when people have chronic pain it is hard to control their reactions to other people. Chronic pain is a very difficult thing to live with and it can cause you to lash out at the people that you are closest to. I'm sure you already know this though, I just felt like it Bears repeating. But like I said call that place and see if they can help you. Good luck. You're doing a great job.
comment 7: Thank you so much to everyone who has replied, I didn’t expect so much support.
I did just want to clarify one thing though. My boyfriend is not currently being treated for his condition because there are literally no treatments or palliative measures. There’s no issue or non-issue of withholding or stopping treatment or care because, he isn’t receiving any as there is none available for this condition. The only respite he has ever gotten was from ambien for his insomnia but his tolerance peaked and that was the end of that. There is no way to medically make him comfortable or alleviate symptoms. Opiates and other obvious suspects do absolutely nothing for this illness. There is not really any current doctor overseeing his care because all his former physicians basically said there is nothing else they can do at this point as there is nothing left in their arsenal for these patients. It’s just me and him and his immediate family. The medical establishment knows and can do nothing; half the doctors have never even heard of what he has (ME/CFS). There is no experimental treatment, and nothing in the pipeline. The NIH won’t even allocate an adequate research budget. 
This complicates absolutely everything.
comment 8: [removed]
comment 9: Me Before You is a movie that has greatly angered the disabled community. Suggesting it is very inappropriate.
comment 10: I respectfully disagree.  People in dire circumstances need to know that they have a choice and need not be guilted into living a life that is mere existing.
comment 11: It sends a damaging message that all disabled people secretly want to die and it devalues disabled lives. It romanticizes a bad image of disability. That is the problem. Disagree all you want, but remember whose lives are thrown away because of it. 
We all deserve the power of choice, but disabled people often don’t get one because people decide our lives aren’t worth living for us. We do not need movies that perpetuate that message to ablebodied viewers.
comment 12: We live in an age of choice, acceptance and school shootings. Its a dilemma, I grant you but nobody makes all the rules.  Not today.  That said, we (most of us) are no longer bound by strict conventions and the fear of eternal damnation.
The only argument that remains is do we prolong life (at any cost) or do we end suffering.  There we may disagree. 
As long as I am verbal, mobile and capable of making my own decisions, I want that choice and I applaud those states that have adopted Death with Dignity programs.
comment 13: Don’t straw man me. The real issue is a movie that suggests disability makes life not worth living. 
I’m all for people making that choice. What I am not for is media that continually shows disabled people seeing their lives as not worth living.
Movies like Me Before You, Right to Die and Million Dollar Baby spread the same message that disability is a fate worse than death and that disabled people want to die. It’s a dangerous message and it’s never handled with care, and it can’t be because they’re all movies made and acted by able bodied people.
You do you, but remember that bad messages about disability are being perpetuated.
comment 14: Pass on the movie, Sea of Trees with Matthew McConaughey.   Its about a forest near the base of Mt. Fuji in Japan where people come from all over the world to commit suicide.  True story.  This movie would only upset you.   ; p
comment 15: I know about Aokigahara. Now you’re mocking the issue. How dare you. Blocked. I don’t need this kind of trash.
comment 16: Have you looked into the foundations? There are a few. They might be able to help you navigate  things when he gets worse.  (And I know I sound like an asshat)
He feels guilt.   You need to relieve that guilt. Let him know that this is choice for you. You choose to stay.  Till death do you part.  Tell him you know the door is open, but you want to be here.  I think one reason he wants to die is for you to live again. So try to live.   Let him know that he enriches your life even on his bad days. 
This shit sucks.
comment 17: You may want to cross post to r/cfs.  You may learn of some tips or treatments there.
comment 18: I already have been for years lol. It’s even more bleak over there believe it or not. There seems to be legitimately nothing that helps anybody, and 50% of the posts are about ending it all.
comment 19: Oh ok, sorry.  I also have ME/CFS. Mine keeps me housebound most of the time, but I am not as severe as your boyfriend. I am so sorry that the two of you are living through this.

comment 8: I purchased the Amazon dot for $25 for this reason. All that’s needed is an amazon login (free) and an internet connection. Granted this only works at home but I also use iPhone’s Find my Friends app to track gps location.

"Looking for a way to keep track of my Dad's location Hi all. First post here. My dad has advancing dementia. He can still (mostly) care for himself but he has wound up lost a few times, especially when he's not in familiar surroundings. He will not carry a cell phone, he's adamant about that. He never, however leaves without his wallet. I'm at a loss as to what I might do to put a tracking device on him. Any ideas? Thank you.","comment 1: I think I found it! 
https://www.jiobit.com/
Small, keychain compatible GPS tracker, with an inexpensive monthly fee. I know I can get him to put this on his keychain. I'm buying this, will review and report. 
Thanks everybody.
comment 2: Good luck and thanks for reporting back.  Also, if he wanders at night, I can see him not taking his keys with him (sorry, just had to warn you).  The smart watch can last 24 hours and he can wear it while sleeping even.  Just needs 2.5 hour charging time, maybe while he eats and watches tv.
comment 3: look in to GPS fobs
comment 4: I can't find a single one of them that is really a GPS tracker, despite nearly all of them calling themselves ""GPS tracker"". They are all bluetooth trackers that alert you when an item moves a certain distance from your phone. Thats not what I'm looking for. We don't care when he goes a few feet away from my mom's phone, we care when we can't find him. All the true ""GPS"" trackers are either too big for a key fob or require a constant power supply. 
I have a tile tracker for my keys. Its great but not at all suitable for this need. Thank you for your reply, though!
comment 5: no i'm talking about actual GPS trackers like this one
yes you need to charge it every few days, but it is what is is
we use this for our dad
comment 6: There are watches with GPS trackers built into them. There is a huge range from expensive to affordable, there are also keyrings that have inbuilt GPS. 
A quick Google search will show you what is available in your country and most are available to buy from Amazon. 
If he refuses to carry keys etc you could attach the keyring to a belt loop. Hope this helps x
comment 7: Google emergency alert trackers for seniors.  You'll find trackers that allow your dad to call an emergency service company with the push of a button and some have fall detection. As well.
Another option is a watch.  I got my dad the apple series 4 watch.  It's the only one that I know of that has fall detection though rumor is more are coming soon.  Can monitor sleep patterns too.  He does seem to wear it but it's going to take a lot of practice to get him to wear it while showering like I want him to.
The problem with both of these is that the devices need to be charged so your dad would have to remember to charge them.  Also both require a service charge or phone service charge.
I found this too but I'm not sure if the business is good so they won't go belly up or not.  Plus it's service charge is quite expensive too.  The benefit of this is that you can get a power charger attachment that let's it run for 2 weeks without having to charge battery.  So maybe you can be the one that charges the batteries instead of your dad.

comment 8: Thanks. I looked at that one. It is pretty large and doesn't appear to have a way to attach to a key ring. He's not going to remember to carry it and its too big for a pocked. Frustrating. Appreciate you advice. This is difficult. He'd never start wearing a watch, either. Ugh!
comment 9: There are skinnier trackers but they have limited ranges so I think it's a no go.
You can attach a tracker to his car.  That won't track him if he leaves the house in the middle of the night and wanders though.  There are door opening sensors that alert you every time he opens and closes the doo but this still won't tell you where he's gone
Does he always wear the same jacket?  You could put something waterproof on an article of clothing he wears.  
I think that fatter device could be put on a key ring with other keys.  I assume he always carries keys.
comment 10: I think all these responses (thank you for yours) have given me an idea. He likes to keep track of his exercise, a smart watch might just be the trick. I think I could show him how neat they are at heart rate monitoring, distance, elevation, etc..  BTW, he can no longer drive.
comment 11: The most affordable and universal one is something like SpotGPS , it's a small satellite GPS.tracker , not as small as a key fob, bit small enough.
The biggest issue with these devices.besides battery constraints is MAKING SURE THE PERSON HAS IT WITH THEM when they walk outside , of they are having memory issues, this will be a challenge.. but solvable with some diligent planning
comment 12: Thanks. He never leaves the house without his keys, fortunately.

"How long is this going to go on for and should I even be feeling so frustrated over this situation? Hi all, this is my first reddit post so I apologize if there are some mistakes I’ve made in the format (or if it’s too long, I’m trying to work on that). I even feel guilty and weird, like I’ve just come on here to complain about my loved ones when I know others have sacrificed so much more as a caregiver. To start, I just turned 20 and my dad (66) has had about 8-9 brain surgeries for these damn tumors that just won’t quit I can’t even keep track of the number over the years.
My biggest feeling about everything is that my life just can’t start until I feel someone else can take care of him. As much as I talk about being scared of living without my father I don’t truly entertain the thought of the person who loves me the most unconditionally being gone from this world. However, another pesky tumor popped up on the MRI screen while one of his new doctors stammered and stared down at his feet, repeating to us he can’t take any more radiation. But then his long time radiologist (amazing woman) came in and told him it’s possible it might just stop growing/grow around this “wall” or “lining” in his head. The future’s just up in the air now and we’ll find out how it’s progressing with another MRI next week-which I know I’m not prepared for emotionally but I’ll still end up just fine as always. It’s been this wishy washy for nearly four years, and I’m sure you’re all real familiar with how existential death and love for family can make us.
Now as for the actual caregiving day to day: Mom’s still in the picture but spends most the day working, also spends most of the day being a mental wreck of an individual as of late. She has a big heart and means very well, but she’s a heavy drinker and becomes unbearable to deal with about 30 minutes after her shift ends. She also started sneaking his anti-seizure medicine to put herself out, and it’s not a medication that should be taken with alcohol at all, it’s meant to stop further seizures after ones already happened so it’s no joke. (My dad and I hid the pills and just keep two out in case one happens) Especially since someone I knew tragically died two years ago from bad alcohol/medication combo. And that’s just one example on how little she takes care of herself but it gives a general idea. She helps out a lot during the day when she’s sober as I’m obviously not going to be the one hooking him up to his pee bag and helping him shower, she also tries to get time off for his big appointments downtown. Her family has tried to help but she’s had no problem objecting and cutting them mostly from her life, and I don’t know what to do about that. It feels like I’ll be taking care of her after dad. 
He’s pretty good on his own (uses a walker), and can be left home alone for short periods of time, but doesn’t remember to feed himself and kind of just stares at the TV or makes some phone calls, we just started watching twin peaks and he’s thoroughly enjoying it. I wouldn’t say he’s completely mentally there, like not responding when talking to him, forgetting, hard time eating right, ect. He’s fallen down once before which started a year long recovery and major setbacks with a broken back so I worry every time I leave. Needs to be driven to appointments and have someone there to listen to the doctor, but he’s a lot better than he used to be where he couldn’t feed himself.
I’ve become very depressed and cynical. I’m an artist and even when I have the copious amount of time to work on things while watching him, I just can’t find it in me. It used to be my favorite thing in the world and you couldn’t get me to stop once I started. It’s weird to remember being like that now even though it was only about 3 years ago, instead of forcing myself into making things for other people because of tiny amounts of money in return and giving gifts. Quit school to look after him, which both upset and delighted my dad at the same time. Don’t seem to have much of a future after this is all done, and he’s already on too many government plans for me to receive the medicaid caregiver money. My parents and dog-sitting for neighbors fully support me and I feel like the biggest shluck in the world. 
It feels like I’m just floating, wasting time until I’ll be too old to get back on my feet with a two year gap in my resume already. I never thought this would be me, I certainly never thought my ambition would die so fiercely. Have the best friends in the world too, but such little commitment to see them. And if I do, they’re coming to my dysfunctional household because I no longer have the energy or peace of mind to go anywhere for longer than two hours. More than anything I want my zest for life back, and respecting the mystery and confusion of the world with excitement instead of disdain
I’ve been typing for too long, I know, but it does feel good to get this shit out and hopefully to some people that can relate. If you read this far thank you, thank you for all the work that you do, and I guess the best way we can look at it is that no matter what your beliefs may be, where you are or what you’re doing is exactly where the world wants you. I mean it’s nice to think that way in times like this I guess. And I hope I get to live my life for myself soon before the world heads to climate change apocalypse in 10 years, I just want at least like 5 of those years for myself.","comment 1: Creativity only comes to a refreshed, quiet, calm mind.  There is no place for creation when you are barely surviving one hour at a time.  It will come back after a nice long rest after all of this is over.
Everyone 'starts over' on an average of seven times in their life.  Those start-overs come with marriage, new jobs, children, deaths, and geographically moves.  This, one day, will be a start-over for you.  Please remember that when that day comes you will be younger than the days that are coming.
As for climate change, political unrest, and catastrophes ... we all get trapped in depressive thinking where everything around us becomes the next crisis that will eat us whole.
Climate change is real ... but for today you are alright!  Today, set it aside since there really is little that you can do beyond go plant a tree or make an insect trash-wood house.  Deal with the crisis as they come, not a decade before they happen.
As an artist myself, over the last few years as a caretaker, I discovered that when my creativity is in the pit that learning something new could spark me back into my art.  
Try you-tubing things like cardboard furniture, or macrame wall hangings, or DIY concrete.  These are fun, dumb, and inexpensive little things you can do and learning something new often is what is needed to re-light your artistic nature.
Good luck, hang in there, and deal only with today.  Let tomorrow wait till it comes.
comment 2: >And I hope I get to live my life for myself soon before the world heads to climate change apocalypse in 10 years, I just want at least like 5 of those years for myself.
I'm in the same position too. If a climate change or a economic apocalypse happens within the next ten years I will end my own life than to live. There is nothing to look forward to in a economic or environmental hellscape other than pain and suffering.
And I don't care if people persuade me not to end my life because of a exciting economic or environment collaspe. They can enjoy their Mad Max fantasies. I won't join them.

"I made a mistake My second week working alone without a trainer at a nursing home, I absolutely get my ass fucked up. I wasn’t aware that I couldn’t leave a certain resident alone on their toilet. I needed to check another call light that had been going off for a while who gets extremely upset when I’m late.  I told the resident to press their call-light when they were done using the bathroom and when I got to the other resident’s room I got radioed that she had fell. Well I was already in the middle of toileting the other resident that I was late for so I finished them up, hurried to the fallen resident’s room and the nurse asks me what happened. The resident was sent to the hospital. This resident was a fall risk, I was never supposed to have left her there. Note to all caregivers, please please read their care plans, memorize the fall risk residents as best as you can even if you have 30+ residents that you have to try to keep track of. If you have a million call lights going off at once, utilize your coworkers no matter what to help you. 
I’m still finding it hard to face people because I still cannot forgive myself, but I have to so I can improve and try my best to serve these residents who need to be cared for. I learned a huge lesson today, and I’m still trying to accept that we can all fuck up this badly.","comment 1: Most care facilities use some sort of marking on the door (oftentimes it's a large red piece of paper with a leaf on it) to indicate residents/patients that are fall risks. You shouldn't have to memorize the fall risks, there should be some indicator in/outside their room.
This was definitely a mistake and feeling bad about it is completely understandable - but don't let it be just a mistake. It sounds like you've definitely learned from the experience! Accept that you made a mistake, but let yourself move on - I know, so much easier said than done, right? But the fact that it bothers you is a sign of your compassion. Don't let it be the end of your learning experience in this job! Keep your head down, focus on the job in front of you, and let yourself grow. You'll be great. ;)
comment 2: Recognizing the mistake is 99% of fixing any problem. Part of the remaining percentage, is not doing that again. I have been on the job for almost 20 years. I have seen a lot of bad shit and had a lot of really shitty days. Life goes on and you try to move ahead always. Try to smile and mean it,always. Take good care of yourself,always. At the end of the day,its all just another layer of skin that is getting thicker every day. Keep calm,chive on or some such common drivel. Heavy sigh.
comment 3: You have to remember that you are working with a handicap your first minute on the job.  What is the patient to aide ratio there? If it is like everywhere else, you are expected to be too many places at once. When you are stretched that thin, all you can do is your best. You may never be perfect because you are not given favorable conditions to do the job the way it should be done.
That said, I know how terrible you feel, now that your patient has fallen. It has happened to me. All you can do is learn from it. Try to figure out a way to keep it from happening again. Keep your own list of fall risks, maybe.  But move on, apologize to your patient, and I know you’ll keep a sharper eye out now.
comment 4: Honestly, thank you for sharing this story because I’ll be starting RN school and now I’ll definitely be more mindful of this on clinicals. It sucks that for us the mistakes we make on the job can actually hurt people, that’s the scary trade-off for wanting to help people professionally. You’re still a caring person and I hope you feel better soon.
comment 5: Ditto!

"Trying to make something to help people who financially support aging parents My in-laws are nearing the end of their ability to work, and have never saved well. Most of their income will come from social security, but my wife and her five siblings all realize that some level of additional financial support will be needed to help them along, especially as they become less independent. I've been frustrated by the feeling that there aren't good tools for families in situations like ours. The default seems for everyone to have half-whispered conversations and one-off support offered completely uncoordinated from other siblings or loved ones.
In my work, I'm a product guy, so I couldn't resist doing some research to understand the situation better. A Pew report shows that 1 in 4 adults with a parent over 65 have given support to that parent in the last year. Presumably, many of those people have siblings and are either 1) working together with those siblings to support the parents or 2) wish their siblings would step up and help out more...
There are understandably lots of difficult family dynamics in play. The question of whether adult children should support parents who didn't prepare well is legitimate. Yet, millions of people are contributing money to aging parents either out of a sense of necessity, obligation, or real generosity. I'm trying to figure out what would make life easier for all those people, and wonder if it would be possible to help families form a better sense of partnership in the process. 
Here's what I'm imaging—I'd love your input to tell me if I'm on the right track or totally in outer space:
There are some common problems I'm hearing (and extrapolating)... those are the headers below.
Below that are things I could picture building to help solve those problems. I'm guessing some are in the right neighborhood while others wouldn't resonate at all with people who are actually in these situations.
I'd be really grateful to hear what of the below resonates with you and your experience. Thanks in advance.
“My siblings and I are willing to help my parents, but there’s not a shared understanding of the financial need or a simple way to feel like we’re on the same page in solving it.”
Potential solutions:

Online-banking-like platform gives everyone a financial dashboard with various levels of visibility customized to the parent and primary caregiver/POA’s preferences 
Family members can see upcoming expenses, contribute to the cushion for day-to-day expenses and/or longer term savings goals. 

“I’m struggling to get my siblings to take my parent's financial shortcomings seriously and contribute to cover the needs""
Potential solutions:

Easy way to set up matching contributions—You’ll contribute more if your siblings contribute more to living costs or future savings. 
Bill forecasting for all siblings to understand when expenses are about to exceed balance in accounts. 

“I don’t know if my parent's bills are getting paid""
Potential solution:

Bank transaction monitoring to alert you when a regular monthly expense hasn’t posted by the expected date. 

“I want to contribute without encouraging unwise spending""
Potential solutions:

Separate account specific to bills, managed by caregiving children—easy contribution mechanism for anyone in the family who wants to help with living expenses. 
Ability to designate that funds contributed can only be spent on designated merchant categories (groceries, gas, etc.) 

“I worry that my parents are susceptible to fraud""
Potential solutions:

Active fraud monitoring on account, with push notifications to caregiving children when there’s suspicious activity. 
Credit monitoring with push notifications to caregiving children if there are any drops in score. 
Limited debit card for elderly parent—certain merchant categories restricted (sweepstakes, telemarketers, online gambling, etc.) 

“I’m the local caregiver and my siblings don’t realize how many expenses I’m covering.""
Potential solutions:

Special debit card for local caregiver—linked to the account into which siblings can contribute. 
Local caregiver receipt capture tool for increased accountability 
Option for uploaded expense to trigger auto-contribute from other siblings to help cover a percentage according to rules customized by each sibling. 

“As an extended family, we don’t have a good way to anticipate and work toward shared savings goals like parent’s end-of-life or moving costs.""
Potential solutions:

Shared “Savings Goal” accounts with customizable target amount and purpose. For example, the whole family can see the status of the goal “Travel for next Christmas” or “Move Mom to Condo” and chip in to help reach the goal. 
Elderly parents wouldn’t have access to withdraw from shared goals directly, but maybe certain goals could be set to automatically cover specific types of expenses. 

“I can’t find a definitive roadmap to help me navigate best practices in financial and estate planning""
Potential solutions:

Interactive, data-driven platform walks you through a personalized checklist tailored to your situation—establishing POA, adding account beneficiaries, probate avoidance measures, and everything in between. 
On demand, in-app, video-conferencing consultation with licensed legal/financial planning professionals is available along the way.
","comment 1: This is awesome! I would add a social aspect like a slack channel so real time conversations can happen and there is a record of them. You can poll in the channel, etc. as well to come to a majority vote, etc. I think this is a great idea and would be very popular. On the more somber side how-to guides for funeral planning, etc would be helpful. Good luck!
comment 2: Amazing input, thanks! Love the idea of a social aspect. If you’re willing to share, I’d love to hear more about your specific situation...you’ve navigated this stuff with others in your family?
comment 3: Yes I experienced having to deal with family members unspecified end of life choices, elderly fraud, and funeral planning. I have friends that are dealing with family squabbles over land and possessions and how to fairly contribute among siblings.
comment 4: Not what you’re looking for, but dang. One PM to another:  you really know your craft and pulled this off brilliantly. And products here are absolutely needed. 
Please shout if you want to bounce anything around.
comment 5: Ha! Thanks for the encouragement and invitation!
comment 6: PM here as well and living the ""dream"" for 17+ years (sarcasm intended).  Realise it is an emotional rollercoaster filled with culture change, past relationships, wheeling/dealing and squabbles. 
Looking at it pragmatically is definitely possible and the person who takes the time to do this will inherit the mess.  
Support parents is never equal.   How do you calculate someone time who is on site/on call vs someone who consistently checks in via phone?  Ex. My sibling has 100 projects when she comes to give us respite...and does nothing to help my parents, creating tonnes more work in her wake.  She doesnt see that, we dont agree...havent for over 10 years. 
And please dont even get started on the personal items to inherit.  
Take it slow, cover yourselves.  Have the conversations. Be that PM and take good notes and circulate them.  Establish the logs and refer back frequently.   
And realise that you will never win when emotion rules logic.
comment 7: Hmm, this smells like really good advice, but some of it is over my head. When you talk about establishing logs and covering yourself... I’m not sure where to start with that. Able to elaborate on what that looked like for you?
comment 8: I have kept minutes and notes of decisions and family meetings so every single thing is clear. No secrets on our side.  Keep in mind there are only two of us (siblings), but we are very different.
As the primary caregiver to my parents, I have ensured that their choices are documented and shared on an ongoing basis (wills, division of assets, etc).   My parents have sold their small modest home and rent the inlaw suit in our house (purchased solely for this arrangement).  Any expenses that we have shared, or my husband and I have spent are documented and made available to my sibling so later there will not be an issue (I hope).   
I have managed a risk log and made sure to have a mitigation plan because my parents should not impact my life goals  I.e. affect my marriage or retirement plans.
"
"Completely At Wit's End I struggle so  badly with this.  I know I'm a complete asshole for feeling this way, but I wish my loved one patient (patient) would pass away.  I don't  want to be too specific,  because I don't want the loved one caregiver to  know I feel this way.
Patient, a child, suffered a severe brain injury years ago, and is currently just slightly above vegetative state. Supposedly can answer questions with the eye tracking technology. However, he is so fragile, he requires 24/7 extremely skilled nursing plus one extra helper to keep him alive.  Numerous  surgeries including to try to fix a collapsed trachea, massive spinal twisting due to contractures, etc.  He has a trache, is on a ventilator 90% of the time, vomits 1-2 x per week, resulting in aspiration and frequent pnemonia, has multiple seizures per  week, has intense neuro storming daily (not a seizure, worse...very painful  and  hard to watch), feeding tube, diapers,etc. He requires 7 machines, including a cough assist (he can't cough), oxygen machine, ventilor, tanks of oxygen, etc. All of these machines and tubing require maintenance, cleaning, etc.  Multiple medications...including morphine for his storming.  He needs daily enemas to poop.  Multiple diapers and pads and is  constantly urinating on the bed and sheets and  blankets.  Multiple syringes for feeding and meds,which also require washing etc.  The house is a hospital.  He has 2 wheelchairs, a standing  machine, a special  bike (purchased for 2,000 and used once), and so much other equipment and supplies.  
The caregiver, who I love dearly, still  thinks he is  going to  walk some day.  This  breaks my heart.  Patient is obviously in decline.   Doctors have said he will never get better, in fact have recommended DNI on several occasions.  I think caregiver is in some sort  of severe PTSD mental break.  The family suffers horribly.  Sibling is suicidal, had to be in outpatient suicide program ($50k, not  covered).  Refuses school and now  has to go to a special school ($40k).  Caregiver rarely leaves house, refuses therapy, refuses family therapy (other than mandated by the suicide program).  Caregiver not taking  care of sibling as well as should be, because of depression and devoting every ounce of energy and time to patient's care.  Even with a nurse and a paid helper,  caregiver has a  full time job managing the care!!  I honestly can't imagine a patient with more  needs.  Must have breathing treatments,  be suctioned constantly, bathed, diapers, feeding, enemas, must be turned every two hours, must be stretched and moved...it's ungodly.  
I guess I just need to  vent.  House is a mess, pets are not taken care of, spouse is breaking down and stressed beyond belief.  
Everyone (including my therapist) tells  me just to quietly support caregiver.  Which  I've been trying to.  But how do you support someone when you don't support their decision (not to follow the DNI,  resulting in devastation and  the ruination of the family?).  Her life and her  family's life is currently ruined.  Caregiver likely doens't see it...like  the frog slowly being boiled,  caregiver is  used to it.  People tell me  I'm too emotional, too involved, let them make their own decisions.  I've stepped away for my own mental health - boundaries, etc.  
But I still care about caregiver and the family! How can  this go on much longer!  Do I  say something to  caregiver  about my opinion?  All I know to do is let the consequences of their decision happen. I call and  talk periodically...tell  funny stuff...listen when I  need to...but I cannot condone the ruination of the family.  Worst  of all is the refusal of therapy.  Especially family therapy.  
Sometimes I HATE modern medicine.  What life is this?  Patient is slowly dying and is suffering.  It's soooo unnatural to be this husk of a human, with food, medicine, and air being pumped into it.  Nothing in return but pee and poop and pain.  God help our family.","comment 1: It’s completely normal to feel this way and you’re not an asshole for it. 
Seeing someone in a vegetable state suffering and being fed with a million and a half machines is tough.... you think one power outage and that’s it, nature will take its course. I agree with you that modern medicine goes too far sometimes, it’s a blessing and a curse. It can help some people and rehabilitate them, but for others it just keeps them alive long enough for old age to eventually take them. 
That’s no life, maybe gather your family together and openly talk about these feelings. I’m sure you are not the only one to feel this way, and you all need to work on rebuilding your family after this tragedy, not continue to self destruct. As for the family member who is in denial, if everyone has similar feelings, you all need to be there and support them and tell them how it is, her child will never be a normal kid, they will never walk again, they will never eat by themselves again, they can never even shit on their own again. This is torture, and changing the DNR request is a humane decision, because if it’s their time to go, you’re selfish to not let them. It’s selfish to want to keep them hooked up to those machines while they suffer just so that the person in denial can feel some type of fake better of “oh see they’re better, they’ll get through this.” Sometimes the reality of things is disappointing to hear, but it needs to be said. 
Goodluck man, I hope your mental health is looked after, I know how hard it is to see a loved on in the hospital. I don’t wish this on anyone.
comment 2: At one time, these cases were referred to as ""incurables"" and as harsh as that sounds, that is what they are.
I keep  my personal opinions to myself when I come across these cases but I agree with you.  You can prolong life or you can end suffering and though I can't make anyone's decision, I would  opt for that latter.   Maybe in 100 years we will get there.
comment 3: Much like /u/oxymom2002, I can't care less about what others, including dear friends and my MIL, think about my job as a caregiver and our decisions as a family about my wife's disease.
Despite they're mostly well-intentioned (with a judgment here and there, like some things you state in your post), what other people who have never been in a situation like this think are just ignorant opinions. When you've never experienced something like this, you simply have no idea how complex it is. I know because I was ignorant before it happened to me.
It is not your place to approve or disapprove, condone or not, understand or not, your relative's decision and path unless they have asked you your opinion. It's their business and their business only. Unconditional love means supporting that person even if sometimes you don't agree with their (in this case very personal and private) life choices.
Your therapist and everyone else are right.
comment 4: Seems like OP knows exactly what’s going on and what’s required. He’s not an outsider shouting his opinion about someone else’s problem. He’s not passing judgement from a safe distance. This IS his private life. His kid. His wife. His family. He lives this life every day. He’s losing his wife and children to this situation. He’s losing everything. It’s not your place to tell him that his place is to butt out.
comment 5: I doubt a therapist would tell a husband to quietly support a caregiver wife. If it was his wife he'd have direct say in what happens with the kid. You're assuming he's the husband out of nowhere just because he has a lot of information. Even if he's close, it's not their place to intervene in this way.
comment 6: I was the primary caregiver of a total care child and I would give anything in the world to have her back. It was chaotic and hard, but she brought so much joy into our world and now I miss her every day.
I'm sure that folks thought some of the same things about us, that you are thinking about the family that you describe, and honestly I could have cared less.  I hope you do not decide to share your thoughts with this mother.  
If you are concerned about the state of the house and the dog, please consider offering concrete assistance - washing some dishes, wiping down the bathroom, folding some laundry, or taking the dog for a walk.
comment 7: >I hope you do not decide to share your thoughts with this mother.
I agree with the OP but I would never say anything.  Not anymore.  I once got upset that a patient, an elderly lady was estranged from her kids.  I basically said ""Where the   f**k are her children in all this?"".
I was given such a lecture by the social worker that I never forgot it.  I have seen several cases of this now.  I don't say anything.

"Elderly father can't hold conversation about anything not on television? Is this a common problem in dealing with elderly who are suffering early stage dementia? My father can't hold a conversation about anything that hasn't been discussed on television in the last two days. If I try to branch out and talk even the smallest amount away from what's been on television he has no idea what I'm talking about and gives a blank stare. 
His thoughts are scattered so he is unable to watch movies or sitcoms because he can't keep track of the characters and the plot so he watches nothing but cable news non-stop. 
I was just wondering if there's frequently an odd relationship which develops between elderly with dementia and television viewing? It has made it very difficult for me to talk to him.","comment 1: People afflicted with dementia will often fixate on something(s). In the case of my mom, it's washing her hands and paper products (napkins, paper towels, etc.). She'll literally want to thoroughly wash her hands 30 seconds after she's done something like clearing a plate, and will stash away napkins and tissues in her purse. She'll also insistently offer napkins that I've brought her to others, most frequently at weekly church events.  It's annoying as hell, but just how it is, and we just have to make the decision to accept that this is their reality and to accommodate it as long as it doesn't pose a threat to their well-being..

"Did a good deed for my Mom and she thanked me for listening to God. Hello,
I've posted here before but on another account but I'm using throwaway this time. My last post was about my mother ""joking"" about moving into my wife and I's house. Problem is she wasn't joking. I took some advice from here and I straight up told her it was never going to happen, giving her a list of raises why it won't.
She ended up getting up set as all she heard was ""your never moving into my house"".
It's been a few months since then she's still not healthy but her and her doctors think they have her on the right track. Which is a positive sign! 

Now we are going to take a step into religion issues, just to warn y'all.
My parents raised me in the church, my grand-parents (Dad's side) are both pastors.  Now that being said my parents would go Swing on Saturday night and go to church on Sundays morning. I was driven away from the church by the lies, hatred, and the negatives that went with church. 
My Mother still does not go to church but she's started praying. She one of those wishiwashi religious people. 

So her car breaks down and she needs some new parts and it's going to be few hundred bucks. Knowing she doesn't have the money or credit I offered to put it on my card and she can pay me back as she can.
I get everything taken care of and she post on FB how God has answered her prayers and how great God is. One of her friends asked who helped her and she just says ""well I'm paying for it cause I have to pay them back""
Okay whatever.
Next day she text me thanking me for listening to God and I answered her prayers. I couldn't help but be upset and replied back ""maybe you just raised a good son, one that will take care of you. I didn't listen to god, it was the right thing to do"". 
I just feel like I can't win some times, I didn't care about the FB post untill she texted me. 
Sorry for the rant just needed to tell someone other then my wife.","comment 1: Culturally this idea is more wide spread. I.e. ""Because you take care of your parents you are guaranteed a place in heaven"".   
We were taking care of my parents because we have values not because it is the golden ticket to the afterlife....
So, I'm with you rolling my eyes at the silliness of it all.
comment 2: I feel you, that can be rough.  Fellow church raised former attendee here as well.  It drives me nuts when my elders parents talk about how god will provide and then fail to take any action them that would help.
I used to joke and tell people that if my mother and I were walking through a forest and had to cross a river, I would stop, cut down trees, and build a bridge. Then as she and I walked across, she would thank God for providing a way across the river.
comment 3: Good for you. Never let anyone entertain or credit imaginary beings for real world acts. I've learned it's always best to be honest, be atheist, and be proud of it.
comment 4: Oh My God (lol), do I ever understand you! I am a Preacher’s kid and heard this for 63 years. My Mom died last year or I would still be hearing it. It will drive you insane. Stay strong and withstand it.
comment 5: My 92 MIL wants to move into our home and my husband keeps telling her it's not going to happen but she keeps asking.  It used to be really hard on him but after almost a year of asking he's gotten pretty used to it.  It's strange she wants to move into our home because she really doesn't like me.
comment 6: Ever since my wife and I bought our house, my Mother always joked about moving in. The whole ""joke"" started after her and my Dad got divorced about a year before we got our house. 
My wife and I had to move into my parents apartment after we got married, we planned on moving out of state but shit happened, by shit happened I mean a week long nightmare. After a couple months my wife and Mother started arguing and it get toxic. We ended up moving to my wife's parents house and within a few weeks moved into our  ow apartment.
I know my wife and Mother have unsettled problems but my mother just doesn't understand that it will never work. I've done this before and I'm not stupid enough to ever do it again.
comment 7: You are very wise.  We all want to hope for the best with family but I have found that it works out very little of the time.  When my husband first told me his mother wanted to move in, I just said ""over my dead body"".  It wasn't even discussed after that, he knew.
comment 8: I have a good job, and I make decent money, and my mother says that ""God has really blessed"" me, as though my hard work had nothing to do with it.  
""Do you realize how blessed you are?"" she says. Uhhh, I know how hard I worked to get here and how hard I work to keep it.

"am i crazy, or is this just completely unprofessional hi internet friends. it's been a while since i've ranted. i hope you are all okay. 
&#x200B;
it's been a stead decline with my mom, who has advanced dementia and lupus cerebritis. last night she spent most of the night getting up out of bed, getting dressed, and trying to walk outside. neither of us got much sleep. she keeps talking about 'waving a knife' over things, and i've hidden all the sharp objects in the house (again).   
my mom's doctors havent' prescribed a single sedative for a year. i've had to deal with these moments about twice a month (or more) the past year. i've REPEATEDLY asked our dr for a tiny prescription of ativan (it has worked in the past) for emergencies like this. dr has refused every time. 
&#x200B;
this morning, i finally had enough. no sleep, constant insanity from my mom-- a serious danger to herself and me. i called the 'on call dr' for the local hospital and explained the situation in detail to the nurse taking the info, the on call dr is busy, so they take my number and they say the dr will call me back. 
&#x200B;
and this is where my insanity really kicks in-- when she does, this is what the dr says: 'alright, what is so important that you have to call me at 6:30 in the morning?'  
i was taking a walk around the house just to get some fresh air, and i literally stopped in my tracks. i couldn't believe this woman was asking me this. i had never talked to this person before, and she had all my info in front of her (close to a medical emergency for my mom) and *this* is her attitude?  
am i just wired and hypersensitive, or is this bullsh*t?  
ugh. i end all my posts like this. i'm just venting. 
&#x200B;
thanks for listening.","comment 1: That’s pretty unprofessional .”on call” is part of their job. It’s not like you knocked on her personal residence or followed her to the parking lot.
I’d shrug it off. It’s a terrible experience but don’t let it bug you or it’ll be more burden (holding onto their rude wrongdoing). Sorry to hear !
comment 2: thank you for your input on that. i definitely am run thin and exhausted, and i feel i'm hypersensitive to a lot of stuff. 
i also have a really crummy opinion of the medical industry here. this didn't help. 
thanks =)
comment 3: I've found the medical community to be horrible people for the most part, with a handful of decent human beings thrown in for flavor.
Complain to anyone you can about that on call provider.
comment 4: thank you. it's been a solid year of this, and i can remember only one person who genuinely treated me or my mom well. i don't care how good you are at your job, if you have to treat your clients like crap, you're not a professional. 
whew. i think i'm slowing down. thanks for listening.
comment 5: [deleted]
comment 6: i would 100 percent try something like that. curious what you give your grandpa?
&#x200B;
this dr hasn't recommended anything at all like that, and i'm honestly confused why we can't just take care of some of her symptoms even if we don't know exactly what is going on. 
&#x200B;
thank you!
comment 7: Ugh. It's nice to have company in the cynics' corner. After watching how my mom was treated in ""intensive care"" wing of a for-profit complex before she passed, I basically said to their faces ""I wouldn't put a dog under your care, much less my father.""
That said, for sleep issues, you definitely want to clear interactions with pharmacist or doc, but here's what I take for my own insomnia: melatonin, 10 mg (max dose); theanine (derived from green tea); tryptophan (the stuff in turkey that makes you doze after Thanksgiving dinner); and Valerian root… all of the above natural supplements. Plus 1/2 dose sleeping pill, not the ones with diphenhydramine HCl (basically an antihistamine which sometimes gets me wired), but rather with doxylamine succinate (full dose makes me groggy next day). 
Yeah, on call means on call. Waving knives is pretty serious, as is your sleep deprivation. Me being the pest I am, would be on the phone next day to track down that person's supervisor and ask WTF is y'all's problem? What constitutes an emergency—shall I call you only when I'm bleeding to death?? But that may just be me…
comment 8: you're awesome. thanks for listening. 
&#x200B;
i actually *just* got off the phone with the dr, and she's finally prescribing ativan. it took almost a year of begging. i get that they don't want  people to abuse the drugs, but honestly-- if i wanted drugs, i could just go out and get them. this is for mom. i need them to be effective and clean. 
&#x200B;
duly noted on the natural supplements for sleep. i tried a few natural remedies way back, but none of them helped. mom is on 30 mg of prednisone right now, and i have a feeling that is one of the major factors for her night anxiety.
&#x200B;
whew. what a ride. i actually had a decent view of the medical industry before this. now i'm left with a very bitter taste in my mouth. i doubt they even have a cure for that. 
&#x200B;
thanks, friend.
comment 9: I just want to tell you I was so happy to see your update. That doctor is awful. I've encountered that type of attitude before but it never gets easy. I find doctors ""intellectualize"" the role of the caregiver (they can recite what's involved) but often can't empathize at all. Doing it day after day, and in this case with little sleep, is devastatingly hard. So glad they finally prescribed something!
Hope you can put aside some time to think through how YOU can get support. You're doing such a good job for her but be sure you also do a good job for you. Sending over some good energy from a fellow caregiver. :)
comment 10: That's not a sensitive way to reply, no question. I hope you'll be able to catch some rest soon.
comment 11: thanks, TranZeitgeist. very grateful for your feedback.
comment 12: I’m so sorry you are going through this. Until you experience this you have no idea. I give my mom a benedryl every night. Her heart dr recommended it. She still wakes up 3x. Night but goes right back to sleep and doesn’t sleep walk anymore. It’s so depressing, gut wrenching and soul sucking...:( I truly get to the point where I give zero fuks about once a month. That’s my cue that I am over tired and need some self care like a couple of nights away to rest and pretend I’m normal. Wishing everyone on here the very best! Hang in there xo
comment 13: great recommendation, flygurl1, i will see what my dr says about the benedryl. 
a few nights away sounds... amazing. it's been 396 days for us. without a single break.
comment 14: I’m so very sorry. I hope you can try the benedryl. It’s far safer than a sleep med.  My mother is very sensitive to medication and this is truly a god send. Please know there are people out here sending you strength and huge hugs and experiencing this “life”. Also, please never be hard on yourself for wishing it would stop ok? We all have those moments and we are all human.  The endless guilt is pretty bad for me. I no longer wish for a long life, just for a swift end when it gets unbearable...
comment 15: What is the long term prognosis with your Mom?  You certainly have had to considered placement at some point?
I say this because I have my Caregiver Support group tonight.  If you aren't in one, I strongly urge you to seek one out; a real one not an online thing.  They can be very helpful.
comment 16: we have zero long term prognosis. that's part of the issue. my mom's health has steadily declined for a year, and all the specialists are just shrugging their shoulders. i'm fine with lack of definition, i'm not fine with the casual way they've just stopped trying to figure it out. 
i can't leave the house. it's just me. i have started thinking about placement, but i can't stand to think of her in one of those places after seeing how terribly they treat her normally.
comment 17: > i can't leave the house. it's just me
When a person is placed in a facility we say ""Remember, this isn't for them, its for you"".  Many Alzheimer patients actually do better in a structured environment and on-call physicians KNOW they are going to get several calls during the night, which changes the dynamics.  You can get some rest.
comment 18: i really appreciate this distinction. 'this isn't for them, it's for you.'  
this changes the way i need to process this situation. it might be time. 
&#x200B;
so grateful for this community. thank you.
comment 19: Good Luck!   Its a tough decision.
My father said, he wasn't going to leave his home anyway but horizontal.    He got his wish.

"Father in Law wanders off a lot I just stumbled upon this subreddit and I hope this is a place where I can get some advice. So to cut it short, my father in law has dementia and is some days more easily agitated than others. One thing he tends to do when he gets fed up enough is he will leave the house without telling us and we usually only realize he’s gone once he’s made a good amount of distance from the house. This ends in us sending out a small search party until we find him and have to convince him to come back home with us. So we’ve got together with other family members and are looking into a form of locating device that we could put on him or he could carry that we could use in these kinds of emergencies. 
Has anyone here had similar issues with Alzheimer’s patients?
And of course the big question, does anyone know of any devices we could use to help us know where he is if he wanders off?","comment 1: I was looking into that for my dad but was told by a seasoned care giver that they give you a false sense of security. Prevention is way better. So we put those cheap alarms on the doors. That way if he opened a door we knew. Of course it scared the crap out of us when we open opened the door so we switched to a door chime sound. Worked great.
If you do get a gps device it needs to be on a non removable bracelet or anklet. If it just clips on there is a good chance he will remove it.
comment 2: I would make sure local law enforcement knows he is a senior with dementia so if they encounter him when he wanders off, they know how to approach him, and they can have his info on file in case he does wander longer than usual.
comment 3: My mom also had dementia and an ankle alert. She cut off two off them and left. So remember that it’s not a perfect system. They can be all kinds of confused but still determined to use scissors.
comment 4: alarms on the doors +cameras in the house. its always good to be able to be doing your own thing and be able to pull out your phone and check the cameras to see exactly what he’s up to, and be able to hear when the door opens. another option ive not personally tried but read about on this sub is special locks for doors that are specifically meant to keep young children and/or people with alzheimer’s from opening them. theyre usually still really easy to open but work differently from other locks so they cant figure it out most of the time. problem with that is that it will likely fuel the anger hes feeling. another option is to ask a doctor about medications that might make him less likely to have those outbursts.
comment 5: I've used an Apple Watch with Cellular for my Dad. This won't work if your an Android user. Also, if you don't want it connected to your Apple ID you'd have to connect it to a separate device with its own Apple ID. You might be able to setup an Apple Watch without a companion device now... I believe it was something they were working on.
comment 6: [deleted]
comment 7: I live with my Dad so if there isn't someone there to make sure it gets put on then I wouldn't recommend it due to the cost. It should also be charged nightly. 
I've also used Insteon (smarthome product maker) door sensors for alerts. Arlo cameras are also all around the house so I can check up on him while I'm at work.
comment 8: I put deadbolts on the doors that are keyed both sides.
comment 9: Locks and bolts my friend, besides constantly monitoring him. Then CBD oil and next Coconut oil. Check on those two. 
So far this combo seems to be working wonders for my mother in law.
comment 10: Yes!!! My great nana gets fed up and often “escapes” since we took her car keys away. She’s speedy when she wants to be...
We’ve given her a flip phone with a bunch of important speed dial numbers on a piece of paper taped to the back of it. I put the loudest ringer on the highest volume on it, and because she craves talking to other people, she jumps to answer it when she recognizes that it’s ringing. 
She’s gone on walks without telling us a few times now, but we’ve always been able to find her if two of us each take a direction, and one of us waiting on the porch. Sometimes she can describe where she is (gas station, dollar store, intersection where the streets begin with X and Y...)
We almost wanted to put something on her, but she often takes things off and misplaces them/hides them (Vicks, socks, her watch...)
Anyways I hope this helps! I’m glad that you’ve always been able to find him, and hope that you find something that works for you!

"Looking for recommendations: Mobile medical alert with pendant or wrist band My father is getting ready to move into an assisted living facility. They have the pull-cord system with only 2 cord locations in his room: by his  bed and by his chair (or he could move that one to the bathroom.)
I'm looking for something he can wear around his neck or on his wrist in case he has an emergency and is away from the pull cord locations. (Outside the facility is not an issue as he will not be traveling outside unassisted.)
Can anyone recommend a decently priced solution that has either a neck pendant or wrist wearable? Ideally it would have an option to call a number that you choose (I would just have it call the nurse station at the facility he is living in.) But 911 would be ok too I guess but that would add delays until they found out he is in a facility with 24/7 medical help available.
thanks in advance!","comment 1: We used Guardian Medical Monitoring, which is wonderful but limited to a few midwestern states. It's about $30 a month, and you can have them call whoever you choose in the case of an emergency.

Can you contact your Area Council on Aging to see what resources they might offer or direct you to?
comment 2: I'll try. We live in the Southeast so I guess Guardian is out of the question. Thanks for your reply though!

"Even after taking to counseling my father refuses to take his medications and measure his blood pressure properly. Any booklets that can help here? I am looking for a free brief booklet that has various strategies and techniques on how to make a patient fully compliant on their medications and blood pressure measurement. 
I am out of home for 15 hours a day for work five days a week and I don't even get to call home. Now, my father takes his medications as he wants. He believes he is an expert in self-medication and so he adjusts his dosages or stops taking a particular medication based upon his perceived side effects and whether a medication is working or ""working too much"". 
He also does not regularly measure his major hypertensiona and does not track his symptoms that is supposed to provide an accurate diagnosis for the symptoms he is facing. We have not been able to get a diagnosis on his symptoms and regular monitoring and adherence to medication is a must given the diagnosis is uncertain and in order to get a diagnosis you need to keep track of your symptoms as best as you can. 
My father has hypertension, 42% blockage in the carotid artery, minor blockage of the thin blood vessels in the heart, vertigo, balance problems on walking, recurring and progressive headaches, nausea, sensitivity to heat through sweating, tinnitus, hearing loss etc. The neurologist, ENT cannot say whether the problem is because of the brain or the ear or whats the diagnosis. 
I have taken him to family therapy sessions but they did not help with his adherence problem. He still clings to his ways and thinks of himself as the psychologist calls it ""a pandit in the art of self-medication"".","comment 1: I don’t have a booklet on this just my own experience... the only thing that made my dad properly take his meds was being readmitted back into the hospital. Nothing we did could make him take them so they had to change to IV and put him back in the hospital. I’m sorry you’re going through this :(
comment 2: In my experience with three older family members, there isn’t a whole lot I’ve been able to find that will change their habits. My mother brags that didn’t even take her meds when she was in the hospital under a 48 hour psychiatric hold. 
My father is generally more compliant, but like yours, he fancies himself an expert. I will admit that a combination of bad experiences with dosage and contraindicated combinations has made him understandably wary. I mean, it was pretty bad, there was such poor consideration for their existing medications that they’d get pretty messed up from the conflicting effects. Now he takes them all to his pharmacist to double check before starting anything new. 
That said, I had to let go of his tweaking a long time ago. I have no leverage. With my mom it different because her issues are primarily psychiatric in nature, so in her case they had to hide her meds and have them measured and administered to her on a daily basis. It was a battle but she accidentally ODed once and that scared my dad straight to take over. 
So like the other poster mentioned, it might be some event scaring him straight, unfortunately, or a nurse coming in and administering it through a home health agency if he qualifies. I don’t know if her defy a professional to their face.
comment 3: This has been a topic in our house more than once. My mother ""loses"" her meds in favor of supplements especially her diuretics which causes a trip to the hospital. I mentioned my concerns to her therapist who reminded me that since my mom is in control of her faculties it's her adult decision. As long as she's not endangering others like drunk driving, it's not for me to go against her choices. 
I didn't like that so I asked my therapist. She agreed. No dementia or mental illness. Lead a horse to water, cant make it drink. 
This has been hard for me but I'm doing my best. So sorry. Hang in. 
Hugs.

"Virtual Reality Test for Early Diagnosis in development Hello everyone,
&#x200B;
Since I discovered virtual reality I've looked beyond its entertainment value. That's how in 2012 I started developing PHOBOS with the first Rift Devkit (PHOBOS is an open source platform to treat and research common phobias).
In 2017 I developed PHOBOS for AR, which you can find in the App Store for iOS devices.
If you are wondering, I am a psychologist and I've worked with dementia.
Now, I have started working on a test to help detect potential early signs of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.
The test will be free, open-source and cross platform; developed in WebVR so anyone with a virtual reality headset and compatible browser will be able to use it.
We have started a Patreon to host the project, update the community and share progress and code.
We are a team of 7 developers (and 2 more potentially joining us soon) and we welcome any professionals that want to join this crusade, by developing the test, reaching out to institutions to validate the instrument we are creating.
All the money raised for this project will be used to develop the test, for outreach and to potentially fund research projects carried out by universities or non-for-profit organizations.
If you need more information, please follow the link. And if you have any questions, ask me anything.
https://www.patreon.com/alzheimerstest","comment 1: This is meant to be a constructive comment, but to ask for money while providing so little information, or providing evidence of your expertise (do you have a degree?  Have you published in the area?) makes this seem like a bit of a money grab.  Red flags everywhere.
Can you provide some details on the implementation? How about some background literature motivating why your approach will be effective?  What dependent variables you will use to diagnose alzheimers? Where is the background literature that suggests these measures are sensitive to the presence of alzheimers?
Again, this is meant to be constructive.  I hope you can provide more details (or, even that I simply missed an important link where they are hidden), but until you do that I could not recommend that anyone give you any money.
comment 2: Constructive criticism taken. You can Google me: Fernando Tarnogol. I have published in the science community more than once and in more than one area (even computer science), I have a degree in Psychology but my skills are not limited to it. There is a recent study very related to what we are doing: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/16/alzheimers-dementia-cure-virtual-reality-navigation-skillsand we are basing part of our test in the SAGE test but leveraging the possibility that VR enables, especially with measuring reaction times, visuospatial navigation and memory.
&#x200B;
If you follow the link, you will not only find details on the implementation, but a complete breakdown of it in the PDF. It can also be found here: https://gitlab.com/ftarnogol/alzheimers-vr-test/wikis/Test-Overview
There is even a complete project file with a concept that can be compiled in Unity. I am also well connected with research and educational institutions around the world since I've been doing this type of work since 2012.
&#x200B;
As I type this, one of my research partners from Thomas More University from Belgium is presenting in the XVI European Congress of Psychology in Moscow the results of the research study we conducted to validate the use augmented reality for the treatment of phobias. This will be the 2nd of 3 congresses we have made expositions within the past 2 months.
&#x200B;
Everything I do I validate it scientifically. There is no way I am releasing a health related tool without science's blessing. That's how I've worked since 2012 and I've managed to maintain a spotless reputation. I'm not going to start jinxing it now :)
I hope this clears at least some of your doubts.
Cheers!Fernando
comment 3: A quick google search only provides more marketing - I do not see any peer reviewed articles.  I did not do an exhaustive search, but the point here is that many potential investors will be dissuaded by the difficulty in finding that kind of information. Don't you think it would instill confidence in potential investors for you to provide a clear link to your publications? Why make us work for it?
I also suggest that you link to other peer reviewed articles that support your approach.  If you have not done that kind of research, then I strongly suggest you do, and that you use that prior research to motivate your approach on your website.
Again, I do this to be constructive: investors are always going to be wary of folks trying to misrepresent their expertise in order drum up financial support, and investors are wary of that.  And, I want them to be wary - many people on this subreddit are going through emotional rollercoasters, and might be especially vulnerable to opportunists.  It would be a shame if someone with reasonable idea missed out on an opportunity because they did not properly represent themselves.
comment 4: I am not looking for investors. I am not seeking to make a business or create a startup. Free and open source is not exactly a business model. With $30 per month we have everything we need to keep things running. We’ve been clear what we will use the remaining funds for. We already have the development team, our national scientific activities council and 2 universities in 2 different countries have expressed interest to do the reasearch.
Last not least, you invalidate most of your own points (mainly the ones I find mildly offensive towards myself and my track record) by saying that you only did basic research, but thanks for the good intentions.
End of this thread.

"After 4 years we are finally at end stage dementia, just need to vent a bit. We had to ambulance my dad from his last ""care facility"" a few days ago. He has kidney failure, a bad UTI among several infections, and pneumonia and a wonky heart rate.  It was a new hospital to us so we had to sign a new DNR . That decision sucked for all sorts of reasons. This morning I was told he is in what they call end stage dementia and most likely his heart will fail within a few weeks.
I know it will be for the best and at least he will be moved to a hospice in that hospital and not the shit hole he was in before. I have a lot of anger issues now and was diagnosed with PTSD a few weeks ago, but at least I got to see my psych and am working on my meds for that and my bipolar has kicked up a notch over the last 4 years as his caregiver. Off track, sorry.
I still feel guilty and I feel terrible for my stepmother. She is bearing the most of the hospital stuff and staying in his room for the last few days while I can only seem to stay for an hour . I really hate seeing him like that and it makes me super angry. I need to work on that.
Kinda interesting maybe, when my dad had his last stroke ( of several over the years ) that caused the vascular dementia he weighed around  380 lbs, at I think about 5'11"" . The first series of hospital/rehab stays got him to 350 when he came home. Over the next 3 years he got down to 320. In the last 6 months he went down to 250 lbs.
Seeing him in this last stage feels different than I thought it would. I've already separated myself emotionally and have gone over this in my head a few times, and I just had to make the decision to end my mothers life on new years so I thought I knew what to expect. And I know that even if he hangs in there for another month or two , another day is too long. It won't fully hit me till a few months after he dies, but it already feels like a culmination of overwhelming sadness about to crash down.  I'm just hoping it will fade way at some point, and that I can actually let it go and forgive him and myself. 
Needed to vent a bit. I have a lot of anger when the void of nothingness isn't in charge. Thanks.","comment 1: Relief for your dad and your family's will come soon.
comment 2: I am sorry to hear that he is at the end.  I can relate to the anger.. I have it too, but for different reasons.  This disease really sucks.  Make sure you take care of yourself.
comment 3: I think you’ll feel relief that his suffering is over. Then you’ll mourn the loss of Both parents. If you’ve been wrapped up in your Dad’s illnesses since New Year’s, then you haven’t been able to fully put the loss of your Mom in place. Remember to take some time, be kind to yourself, and stay strong.  Hugs.

"Hello, I'm looking for a Watch that can help me keep track of my grandfather movements Hello, my grandfather suffers from dementia and cancer. He sometimes wanders around the house or takes off to do some random things like going to the bank or getting vegetables from the store, without any of us knowing where he had gone to.   
Is there a Smartwatch that looks easy enough to wear and can help us track him? and is not overly expensive? Or anything that can be wearable and doesn't hinder him.","comment 1: I'm getting my dad the apple watch series 4.  It's arriving this tues.  I think pretty much any watch will do what you ask.  You can even set up his phone to do the same thing I think without having to get a watch.
But the apple series 4 is special in that it's the only watch I know of that can can detect falls and send out an alert to you and emergency services.  I posted on the Google sub asking if there was a Google watch that did the same thing but no, it doesnt seem like it based on the responses I got.
The watch needs to be paired with an iPhone that is 5s or above if you get the GPS only version. Or a 6 or above if you get the cellular version.  The good thing about the cell version is that if he forgets to bring his iPhone with him, you'll still be able to see where he is at any time.  With the GPS version, you have to wait till he gets within a WiFi area to see where he's gone IF he forgot to bring his phone.
The bad thing about thr cellular version is you have to pay more money per month for the cell service.
I'm getting my dad the WiFi version since I'm cheap and it's unlikely my dad will forget to bring his phone (its habit for him I think).  Well see if I'm right about that though.
comment 2: I like your idea. Are there any other smart watches with GPS and the falls feature? My mom doesn’t have an iPhone. I do but I live 2 hours away and not sure that would work... plus my mom no longer knows how to use any devices but does wander.
comment 3: The falls feature, no - I can't find a single watch other than the apple series 4.  If you find one, could you message me by chance?  I want to get a watch for my mom too but she's an android user.
Your mom doesn't need an iPhone if you get the cellular one and sync the watch to your phone instead.  You can be really far away from her then and it would still work but then you'll have to pay the monthly cell service.  Also, the smart watches can receive calls, calls from your phone if you sync to the watch.  I'm not 100% sure you can turn off the calls.  You'll have to ask someone with a cellular version of the phone (maybe in an apple sub). to find out.
comment 4: Interesting idea. She couldn’t answer the watch intentionally or run it. She likes to go for walks and generally walks a specific route but she’s declining and who knows what could happen. I will look into it some more.
comment 5: Hey, is it your grandfather or your mom that had dementia?  If it's your grandfather and he doesn't have his own iPhone, if you go with a watch, you will definitely need the cellular option and to get cell service cause I assume the iPhone won't be within range of the watch all the time.
Another option besides a watch is to sign up with a paid alert system.  It's  typically more expensive than getting cell service for a watch.  But some of the devices can also detect falls similar to the iphone.  And if your grandfather has health issues, he can push a button and there will be a person on the other line that talks him through what to do and will send emergency services.  Your watch can call emergency services too but you wont have a special person on the other end talking him through things.
comment 6: Sorry I think I confused you by highjacking the post. It was OPs grandfather, but I was commenting about my mom ... thanks for the suggestions!!

"Upcoming Care Home Performance -- Opinions/Ideas/Tips? Hi there,  
I'm new to this subreddit but I really ought to have joined a while ago, as I've been employed as a carer for the last 19 months. I knew virtually nothing about dementia when I entered the care profession, but once I realised the majority of care home residents were afflicted with some form of dementia, I began scouring the internet for any information, research, and advice I could find! I've learned quite a bit both on the job and through my research, but I'm always anxious to learn more.  
Anyway, I dabble in musical theatre in my spare time -- to the point where it's basically my avocation -- and often sing to the residents at the various care homes where I contract. This always seems to receive a positive reaction from both residents and staff, so at one care home, I half-jokingly asked about being added to the home's entertainment roster. The activities coordinator asked me to put together a short show with backing tracks, which would serve as a sort of audition, and said if the residents enjoy it I'll be welcomed aboard as a fully-paid entertainer at the home beginning next year (she books all of the year's entertainment in January), as well as receive a ringing endorsement if I'd like to do shows elsewhere in the meantime.   
I've decided to call the show ""Special Requests"", and put together a setlist by asking residents with a greater degree of verbal capacity (as well as the family members of those with less) for songs which mean a lot to the residents and are likely to get them singing along. While I wasn't able to garner a request from each resident -- and it would have been difficult to fit 33 songs into a 1-hour performance slot if I were -- I think the set has a good variety, and most folks in the home should find a lot to enjoy. This is my setlist:  
1) You Are My Sunshine
 2) Moon River 
 3) Dancing Queen
 4) What a Wonderful World
 5) Tutti Frutti
 6) Hey Jude
 7) Hey Big Spender
 8) Take Me Home, Country Roads
 9) Danny Boy
 10) Pretty Woman
  11) Maria (Blondie)
 12) My Way
 13) Show Me the Way to Go Home
 14) Bring Me Sunshine   
This home, located in a former B&B on the coast of Morecambe Bay (Lancashire, UK), houses 33 residents, each with severe dementia and challenging behaviour. The residents range in age from 64-91. Most are mobile to some degree, but about a third spend most of their time in wheelchairs. In addition to encouraging everyone to sing along and/or dance, and adding in banter/jokes, I'm going to be passing out a variety of easy rhythm instruments -- tambourines, maracas, bells, triangles, etc. to residents who would like to play along.   
What do all of you think? The show is this Monday, July 1st -- I have taken this week off, spending much of my time putting together the show and practising. Do you have any advice as far as additional interactive elements I could add to this show, or other fun stuff I could throw in to increase general enjoyment (without spending any/much money)? I know it is only an unpaid sample/audition show, but I'd really like to make sure it goes well, and that I give the residents something to enjoy.  
Thank you so much for your help! <3<3","comment 1: This sounds great!!
comment 2: Thank you! <3
comment 3: For the ones who weren't able to give a favourite song, ask their families when they visit.
comment 4: I did, as much as possible. I gathered requests from every visiting family member/group over the past month. :)
comment 5: Wonderful!! Music is so important. Adding the instruments for them to participate is a great step. They will be delighted to hear songs from the past and hope it brings them good memories or feelings
comment 6: Great setlist, another set of songs that seemed to really engage them were old commercial jingles.
comment 7: Ooh; I shall have to look into that for future shows!

"Alert system? Special circumstances inside. Hey all, I have a request for an alert system. We used to used our Google home to send text messages to my phone and that worked great for years - until recently it broke and refuses to send text messages. I was wondering if anyone uses/knows of an alert system that has a button or a speaker my mom can use that can be set up at home that sends a message to my phone when she falls? And if it has a monthly cost, not too expensive? Thanks!","comment 1: I am following because I probably need to know soon.
comment 2: I ended up buying this and it arrived today, if you're interested. Haven't used it yet.
comment 3: There are several.  I recommend Life Alert.  Patient wears a necklace with a panic button on it.  Press the button and a call goes out to a call center which responds immediately.
If the the patient lives alone, they recommend having a lock box and a key outside of the property.  EMS will be notified of the combination of the box, get the key and go inside.  Saves them from having to break down the door or break a window.
I don't know what the fee is.

"Advice needed: grandmother with Alzheimer's is having trouble using charging cables Hello wonderful community. Any advice would be appreciated.  
My grandmother has Alzheimer's and plays Candy Crush-style games as her main source of entertainment. It's great that she has this outlet because she finds it difficult to read books due to her failing memory (she has some insight into her condition). She plays the games on an old iPhone 5 and first-generation iPad Mini. The problem is that, as her cognitive decline worsens, she's increasingly having trouble working the charging cables for the devices.  
She forces the wrong cable into devices, damaging both. She constantly breaks cables and misplaces them. She puts cases on the wrong way, covering the charging slot, and wonders why it isn't working. She assumes a device is being charged even when the cable hasn't been properly inserted. Ultimately she gets very frustrated and upset when her devices run out of power and she can't play her games. Her family also gets frustrated with her regular phone calls asking to drive over at all hours to help her with the devices.   
I've looked into wireless charging stations but they don't work for iPads or pre-iPhone 8s. Besides the charging issues, she also has trouble loading money into iTunes to unlock game levels (which is important to her) and needs constant help with that. She doesn't necessarily need a smart phone as the game are the only thing she uses it for.
&#x200B;
So, does anyone have suggestions for:
1) A basic handheld, touch screen gaming device that has access to Candy Crush-style games? 
Extra points if you can just purchase the games outright rather than a freemium model where you keep having to pay to unlock things.  
2) An alternative to standard insert charging cables for Apple Devices? Wireless charging isn't an option unless we buy her a new model of phone.  
Thanks all!","comment 1: You can get magnet charging sets  https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+magnetic+charging+cable&oq=apple+magnet+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l3.3545j0j4&client=ms-android-samsung-gs-rev1&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8, she would only  have to hold the charger near it to connect it which might help with the picking the wrong connector
comment 2: That's a great idea, thanks!
comment 3: Yeah, I was going to recommend this.
comment 4: Ooof, that does sound tricky. I needed to buy tougher cables, several in bright colours so that they didn't get damaged or lost. But she can still plug them in ok.
Is it possible to have someone (neighbour, paid carer) pop over on a nightly basis to check that devices are plugged in to charge overnight?
comment 5: Thanks for your suggestion! She's currently living in a low-care assisted living home (not memory care) and my family has encouraged her to ask the staff there to help. Unfortunately it's often at night that she has the most trouble (sundowning) and there's only a skeleton crew of staff on hand.
We've tried tough cables but unfortunately she still manages to break them by being too forceful.
comment 6: Hey, what did you end up doing for her? I think the magnet was a great idea
comment 7: I've been looking into ordering those magnetic cable adapters. Really great idea. Think those might do the trick because you can't really ""force"" them into the input. As for the gaming device, we'll stick with the Apple devices for now. The system we've been using is loading on iTunes gift cards when she needs to top up for her games but that's something we have to do for her (she can't remember passwords or how to navigate the process).  
I'm a graphic designer who's interested in accessibility and product design, I love products that offer real solutions to enable people with cognitive decline to participate in their world and maintain quality of life. There's a lot of brilliant senior-focused tech out there for communication and safety but I find entertainment tech for seniors is lacking.   
Having seen the pain points in entertainment tech for those with cognitive decline has really made me want to develop something more suitable (I'm pipe dreaming here...). It sucks that a person can regularly access loads of entertainment options (eg. games, on-demand tv) and then have them taken away just because the mediums that host them (gaming devices, smartphones, smart TVs, complex remote controls etc.) become too complicated.
comment 8: I also suggest stocking up on used devices. Try freecycle.org where you live. Tell them your reason and people will be glad to help. Also try a group online for the game to see if someone knows a freeware game that would be indistuingshable to her.good luck. Great project for her to have.
comment 9: Great suggestion, thanks!
comment 10: You can add a credit or debit card to her Apple account. Then she wouldn’t need to load funds to iTunes. She would have to remember her Apple password, though. But she could have it written down somewhere in front of her.
If you ever want to limit the amount she spends, buy a Visa gift card and use it.
comment 11: If all else fails paint round the power slot on device and the front of the power point that goes into the phone with bright nail polish. It will be easier for her to line them up and connect the right way round.
comment 12: Good idea. Might be worth a try.

"Holding vigil for my father Six months ago my father (age 76) was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's.  The guy was a brilliant man with a Master's Degree in Biology, who spent a really successful career as a real estate agent for an oil company.  He gifted me with a great head for math and a love of science -- some of my best memories of him were when he showed me Jupiter and Saturn through his back yard telescope.
That man literally gave me the universe, and he also gave me a sense of my own place in the working world.  Important context, my biological parents divorced when I was two years old, and I was raised by my mother and stepfather.  The most significant time I spent with my bio father was a summer that I worked as an intern at his company in another state, and that's when I kind of sensed that I had a future in the corporate world.  And it's worked out exactly that way.  He worked 35 years in his company, surviving a spinoff and a buyout that had him moving states more than once, but by the end of his career he was literally the only person left from his original department from 35 years before.  I've always felt that was something to aspire to, and as of this writing I've made it through 17 years, 4 promotions, a merger and a reorganization at my own company, where I recently survived a layoff.  I credit my father for showing what that kind of work ethic looks like in the corporate world.
So I knew something was off over the holidays last year when he started inventing memories that I knew never existed.  Like for example, I mentioned that I'd been called for jury duty, and he started talking about his own jury duty experiences, in places I know he's never lived.  He's brought up celebrities from the 60s and 70s who he shared a beer with -- people like Elvis, and the Bee Gees, and Willie Nelson -- all those stories are false but they are based on a true story he told me years ago, when he really did share a beer with Harry Belafonte.  So that was the beginning when I knew things were wrong.
He got diagnosed and the whole family is adjusting to the new reality.  But this weekend there was an escalation.
For the last three years, he and my stepmother have been the owners of a Jack Russell Terrier.  One of the ways we've been trying to support him during the development of his condition is that we've allowed him to take the dog on walks.  Most of the time he's ""present"" enough to stay within his neighborhood, but twice now he's gotten lost and wandered several miles away from home before being found and brought back.
We've made arrangements to keep him tracked through geofencing on his phone, and for the most part that's worked.
Until Saturday when he forgot to take his phone with him.  He ended up about 4 miles away from home, lost and confused, at which point the dog keeled over from heatstroke.
The police found him, looking confused, not really sure where he was and not knowing how to deal with the situation.  He didn't have his ID on him and he didn't remember his address, but he was present enough to direct the police back to his house.  They also took the dog in to the local humane society, but it wasn't enough.  The dog died.
The dog's death is everybody's wake-up call.  He now needs more help than we can give him where he's at now.
I don't know why I'm writing this, necessarily, except just looking for a support system of random reddit strangers.  I'm heartbroken at what the world is losing in this process, and I hope I can find a way to help make his transition better.","comment 1: I am sorry to hear this. You think you're doing okay, and the disease ratchets itself up a notch.
comment 2: I’m sorry about your father. This disease is awful!  
I recommend the book:  The 36-Hour Day
A Family Guide to Caring for People Who Have Alzheimer Disease, Other Dementias and Memory. I’ve used it as a reference as needed. 
I have two years of experience with this blasted disease.
comment 3: Will look it up in Amazon
comment 4: I’m so sorry. This disease breaks your heart in new ways constantly. And it’s good to get it off your chest, so share away. My dad also has Alzheimer’s and he’s at the point where he can’t be left alone. And not too long ago, he’d also go on walks and get lost. It is awful. Feel free to dm me if you ever need to get anything off your chest. I wish you all the best.
comment 5: Watching a parent slipping into the clutches of Alzheimer's is one of the hardest things you'll ever go through. My mother lost her battle with the disease back in 2010. Every new phase your father enters turns into your own personal hell.
We're here for support if you want to vent. Also seek out support in the real world. Talk to clergy, see if you can locate a local support group, consider joining a charity to raise funds/awareness of the disease. Talk to your SO and family.
comment 6: Sorry to hear that, same boat here, just my mother in law. I fooled myself to think we had things running smoothly... until this morning.
Not sure where will be in 6 months, but I'm sure I need to find a way to release the stress now.
comment 7: One day, one hour at a time. (((Hugs)))

"First-time look at finances and email and I am horrified My 75 yo father has been in the hospital and/or rehab for at least four months. I don't know much of the specifics. Because I am deemed ""the responsible one"" I am taking care of paperwork. Finances, email etc.  At least he is relatively mentally sound. 
If I wanted to drive there it would take me at least 20 hours and I don't particularly get along with him. He is very manipulative and I'm not interested in the hit to my mental health that a visit of any length would cause.
Finances
He is tens of thousands of dollars in debt. How? I have no idea. My mom died in 2005 and he has a severe disability that puts him in a wheelchair. 
I've added all of his finances into Mint so I can at least track when bills are due. Whatever happened was in the distant past/several years ago. I have no idea how he pays his bills, because the money he owes (even with minimum payments) exceeds the money he brings in. I have power of attorney but none of the credit card companies can take anything but a fax (no secure uploads either. It is 2019 ffs.).
At least so far I do not see anything recent that is suspicious. He makes enough in social security that in theory he should be able to live relatively comfortably in the low-cost state in which he lives.
Email
The spam. Oh my god the spam. He has SO MUCH OF IT. If I were to report spam and unsubscribe I would be doing this probably all day. These are the following categories.

Marketing emails. Hundreds and probably thousands. He must be on a list of chumps who buy stupid flimsy stuff on the internet. Sports gear. Dresses for young women. Shoes that he can't wear. Camping gear.
Hateful political emails. Dozens a week. I know my father is conservative but these are over the edge.
Weird religious healing emails. From a scammy preacher who says if you pay money to him, the Bible will heal his disability. He has paid this preacher a few times from what I can tell.
Guns guns guns! He literally cannot pick up a handgun he is so weak.

I have no idea how he can tell what is important and what is not. I am not an inbox zero freak but I do like a clean inbox and keep my newsletters to a minimum.
Mystery policy
He claims he has a policy that pays his minimum credit card payments on his *checks notes* ten credit cards that he currently is making payments on while he was in the hospital, yet I can find zero evidence of this policy. He is past due on a few of them, some of them two payments past due. The individual cards do not seem to have a policy (I checked to see if there were recurring charges for something like $10/month and don't see anything like that). He seems to think it is a blanket policy from a single company that covers these issues.
Any ideas what this is? 
ADVICE WANTED: An easy, cheap way to fax without having to go to a FedEx store and bring physical pieces of paper to fax? I want to send PDFs.
He is also makes incredibly sexist remarks to the nurses at the rehab facility in which he currently resides and I'm trying to get him to stop doing that. I do not think he will change. He says they are jokes and I truly think he believes that is the case, but I don't think he understands how that makes women feel.","comment 1: 
Do not pay on any of his debt.  That will start you down the road of being accountable and the credit card companies will try to put you on the hook.
Talk to a financial planner that can advise you better, but his best option might be to claim bankruptcy.  
Get POA and living will documents together ASAP
At this point you are wasting your energy trying to change your fathers behaviors.  He is not the first sexist old man that they have dealt with and he won’t be the last.
Good luck with everything!

comment 2: Thank you for the response. To clarify:
1. I am definitely not using any of my funds to pay for his past mistakes. I won't ruin my future for someone who has always been bad with money. This is all coming from his money. I just have to decide where it goes.
2. Brother is handling some of the lawyerly stuff since he is local, and I may ask him to bring this up.
3. I have POA and medical POA, but not a living will. I'll ask brother about that.
4. Unfortunately I realize this but ughhhhhh.
comment 3: Hang in there, I wish I could tell you it will get better, but somethings you just have to keep going until you get through them. There will always be some new surprise waiting around the corner.  Hopefully this is the worst of it though.
Also, I have used the  tiny scanner app for documents and it is seamless.
comment 4: I second the bankruptcy. There’s no reason to keep paying on what appears to be interest on interest. Stop whatever service he claims is paying his bills. He’s most likely paying for that service too. 
Get a new email set up for him, and redirect any needed emails to that account. Delete the old one. It’s much easier than going through so many emails to unsubscribe. 
As for his actions, you can try, but he won’t change. You can apologize, but it’s not your wrongdoing. Just let him be. His aides are trained on how to handle that behavior. 
I’m sorry you have to deal with this.
comment 5: Email - I use a service called Unroll.Me to manage my spam and promotional emails.  It’s a well reviewed system and has been easy to work with, for me at least. It’s a good way to corral all of those crazy emails.
Fax Service - I use an online one for the occasional faxes I send for my business (I’m a health care provider and a few insurance companies will onlh accept documents via fax) I use one called click to fax - but there are a bunch of other ones out there.  There is a monthly service fee to keep the number and for a certain level of security(to maintain hipaa because I’m a health care provider), but I think there may also be free services available if you just use it occasionally.  You can send PDFs without issue.
Good luck with the other issues - it’s good that you can help out, it’s a tough job even when the person you are helping is really organized and easy to deal with! And prayers for your father....
comment 6: Unroll.me is amazing. Thank you for that recommendation. Now I have to go through the 400+ services that he's managed to subscribe to.
I'll check into the fax service you mentioned.
Thank you for the advice.

"How Can I Use Technology to Help My Grandfather? My grandfather is 87 and has been having some trouble around the house lately. I recently found out that he was laying down a blanket for the dog and fell. He stayed on the ground for a few hours then was finally able to crawl up onto the bed where he stayed until someone got home.
&#x200B;
I am wondering if there is something I can place around the house so he can call for help if he needs it. I thought maybe Google Home devices so he can call someone in the family or an Apple Watch with cellular so he can use Siri to call family or at least hold the emergency button on the side to call 911. 
&#x200B;
He has a medical alert system already but he either forgets to wear it or, in the case of the other night, already took it off for bed. Does anyone have any good ideas to use these devices for help if he needs it?","comment 1: The only idea I have is to make sure he is wearing the medic alert at all times. My mother has Life Alert, which I believe is the company name, and she has a central unit in her living room, which is a big box with a very big red button she can hit for help. She also has a bracelette with a button, and a necklace. She doesn't use the necklace because just knocking it on stuff would call for help occasionally, but the bracelette doesn't seem as senistive and she wears it all times. And it has served her well on at least two occasions. You can talk to whatever company your grandfather uses, and maybe they can set up more of the stationary boxes, like one in every room. But other than that I would suggest really trying to stress to him that whatever is wearable needs to be worn at all time. It seems to be what is working best for my mother. good luck:)
comment 2: I agree with the medic alert bracelet. You are suppose to wear it at all times. Some are even waterproof so you wear them in the bath. My Papa even wears his if we go out of town, where it’s completely useless - but that’s better than not wearing it.  He likes it because it looks like a men’s watch.
Did you know they have a version that detects a fall and alerts on its own?  It’s programmed off of the height of the user. Pretty cool.
The only problem I see with a device like Alexa, is the range. Would he be in the right location for the device to hear him?
comment 3: I’m wondering if an Apple Watch might be a better alternative to a Medic Alert bracelet. I know I can call people using mine (1st gen) and have it on speaker via the watch. They also have fall-detection in the Series 4. It would combine the medic alert bracelet and the Alexa you were thinking of. He could charge it only when he’s in bed.
comment 4: Going off this, is there any way you can maybe tie something to your dog's collar? then he can call the dog over and not have to remember to wear something. 
The other idea is does he have any old school ritual like he always prays using a rosary or bible before bed or waking up? Then you can make it a habit reminder for him to put on the watch/life alert before praying so he doesn't forget. Or maybe he drinks water every morning from the same mug tie it to that?
comment 5: My mom fell a few years ago in her apartment and was able to yell to Siri on her Iphone to call 911 and paramedics came. She was across the room when she did it.  She also has the Alexa Show device now that allows her to call and video call anyone with her voice.  I can drop in on her anytime and see her room even if she doesn't answer it verbally. It has been incredibly helpful. One thing to think about is that  even with all these devices seniors often forget what to do when they fall or need help.  My mom forgets sometimes the way to answer Alexa or even the fact that she can use her voice to get a call or help.  That can be hard to help.  The life alert and med alert pendants are great as others have mentioned especially when they react based on the fall motion so no action on the senior is needed to indicate they need help.  So finding a way to make sure they have it on is key and can be tough if they don't want to wear it. I know they have ones work on the hip in addition to the typical pendant style. The other thing people do is have a big sign on the wall that says what to do if I fall that reminds them what their options are if they fall when they are alone.  Hope you can find something that works for him:)
comment 6: Thanks for the advice. We ended up with an AppleWatch for him which he thinks is the coolest thing ever. We like it because it will also text us his location if an emergency is triggered as sometimes he goes on walks. I showed him some videos on the fall detection so he’ll know what to expect if he falls or accidentally triggers the alert. I also showed him the walkie-talkie feature so he can use that in pinch too. He already knows Siri from his phone so I made sure he got a lesson on how to activate that too. Lastly, I made sure he knew how to use emergency sos in case something happens and the fall detection doesn’t trigger. 
We covered pretty much every way to use the watch to call for help.

"Advice for early stages of dementia, wandering, etc. My grandmother has dementia and forgets things often. She gets upset often and accuses my grandfather of not telling her of plans that were made often, such as vacations and family get togethers. She has started to wander recently and had walked to her sisters house who hasn't lived there in a long time (or ever?). It doesn't help that family in-law tries to convince her that she is wrong. She's taking medication, not sure what exactly. But I'm guessing standard medication.
What should be expected?
What are your advice for dealing with situations like this and those that are similar?
For wandering, what should be done? I was thinking about a GPS tracker but the thing is that she won't want to wear it, and she is already wary of tracking and doesn't fully trust or believe that she needs it.
For medication, I've heard it's only effective for 6-12 months but is there anything else that we should know?
Any other advice or things we should know?
Thank you all.","comment 1: For me, one thing I learned was just to go with whatever she believes. It can be hard when they're aggressive, or if they're still fairly aware of what's going on, but I try to just kinda agree with her, and offer some excuse as to why these things have happened. 
For example, if she says ""Why didn't you tell me about the holiday?"" Don't bother arguing about it, because you won't convince her, just say ""i forgot"" and let it go.
Also, if it's any help, you may want to see if you can make friends with a neighbour or two. We had a neighbour on the corner of our street who was a stay at home mum. We friended her on Facebook, and any time my grandad walked past, she'd send me a message to let me know. It was surprisingly useful.
comment 2: She needs someone there watching her full time.
The mat at the front door is a good idea, it’s amazing how so many small things like that can make a dramatic difference. 
But at this stage your grandma needs someone watching her full time.
comment 3: My Papa is still alive and well but he isn't always able to be watching her. She had left early in the morning while he was sleeping.
comment 4: I take it that he was away at the time?
Basically somebody has to be there at all times, so he needs to schedule things so that somebody is there or, that she is in fact asleep.
How I did it with my grandmother is after a big meal, she would sleep, and as soon as she did I’d leave immediately.
Also, you can get cameras in the house that would alert you when something moves. 
This worked pretty well for me.
Your papa could contact a family member to watch when he leaves for a while.
He can deactivate it when he’s home and most camera systems have geo fencing connecting through an app on your phone, where it automatically deactivates once you get home anyways.
I used the Arlo cameras. 
They’re wireless and about $300 for 2 of them and the base station, they come with batteries and last for 3-6 months if you only turn them on when your gone.
comment 5: He was sleeping I think. But I like the idea of cameras, sounds like a bit of a cheaper and less invasive solution, as I don't think she would be happy about having to wear a GPS tracker.
comment 6: If she's wandering, she's probably not in the early stages. More like a middle stage. I encourage you to search for all the resources you can get. If you're in the US, you should be able to contact social services, or an agency on aging. We had a social worker and aides come in to help my FIL.
Regarding the tracker, you might be able to get some that go in or on her shoes. We're considering this for my own mother. If she's still driving, make sure there's a tracker with the car, but on her body somehow would be better.
I'm sorry you're dealing with this. It's a truly horrible oddessy. Good luck to you and your family.
comment 7: This has just started, so I'm not sure. But you might be right yes. I saw shoe ones online but still a bit wary because what if she doesn't wear those shoes that day.
Thank you.
comment 8: I know. That's the same question we have. I think sneaking pairs away to limit how many she has, or buying multiple sets of trackers. It just sucks ... .
comment 9: Does she carry a handbag or a cell phone when she wants to go out on her own? It's not hard to set up tracking on a cellphone, and even flip-phones can be tracked.
comment 10: Sadly she doesn't, but that would be an easy solution. She refuses to carry an iPhone around because she doesn't know how to use it.
A flip phone that's easy to use might be an idea, only thing would be if she remembers to bring it I suppose.
Thank you for your response!
comment 11: Getting them to carry one can be hard - once my father realized he only ever got calls from me on his it started being left on the dresser.  Fortunately he doesn't wander outside these days.
comment 12: It might be worth trying a matt black rug/mat at the front door. I heard someone on here suggest that: apparently it gets perceived as a bottomless pit, so stops the wandering. Worth a shot, but please report back to us if you try it. I haven't reached that stage yet with my mum.
comment 13: Oh interesting. That's actually really useful to know. Thank you!
comment 14: You may want to read this article, and see if any of the recommendations made therein could be employed. Anything that might help in such a situation is worth considering. I personally was diagnosed with Early Onset 7 years ago, but have found this (along with Bredersen's other studies) to be very well worth embracing. Had I not done something, I doubt I would be able to participate in a forum such as this.

"Emergency Alerting System using Alexa Requesting advice about technology that could be used as a reliable intercom system. We are looking for a way to ensure that we can communicate between rooms in case of an emergency with our grandfather who lives at home but recently needs to be watched full time because he is unable to swallow properly. Our grandfather has recently been placed on 24 hour care because of asphyxiation risk, so he has an aide in his room all night to monitor him. His wife is currently sleeping in the guest room downstairs but needs to be alerted at a moments notice without the press of a button if the aide needs assistance in the case of an emergency.
They’ve tried baby monitors so the aide could yell for help in that scenario, but they are disruptive to his wife’s sleep because she can hear him coughing in it or the aide watching TV ect.
Recently they’ve been trying an Amazon Echo system with one in grandfathers room and a dot in her bedroom, but sometimes when we try the drop in feature it does not work. 
I would really appreciate any suggestions you have for a communication system because they are helping keep my grandfather safe and as comfortable in his home as possible.","comment 1: My mother has a Google home, not sure if the same program is availabl on Alexa, but on Google they have an app called ""Call my buddy."" When my mom falls, she says ""Okay Google, call my buddy!"" it will then (after setting it up) send a text alert to my phone letting me know something is wrong. It's the best solution I've found and it's free, or you can donate a small amount of money a month through PayPal for more texts.
"
Alexa So my mom has Alzheimer's but it hasn't progressed to the point where she can't be alone for short periods.  Unfortunately she had trouble with answering the phone.  So of course when im at work and call to check on her and she doesn't answer I go into panic mode.  So I bought an echo dot.  Privacy and problems that have been reported aside I got it for one reason.  Drop in.  It's a life saver.  I can call the dot basically and talk to her.  She doesn't get frustrated with the phone.  I can make sure she is doing ok.  Stress level dropped significantly.,"comment 1: Ya, tech has helped me too.
Wyze cams.  About $25 on Amazon, can monitor for motion or sound and send an alert to the phone.  I'm worried whenever my father steps out of the house.  He likes to go get the mail... several times a day.  Stuck one on the front door and one watching outside.  When he goes out I can watch him, if he falls I have a few people I can call when I'm at work.
Also, since they can't remember much, asking them why something happened in the house is useless.  ""Which cat is puking?""  Wyze cam answered that question and others.
comment 2: Yes! My cameras should be here today. We have pt and ot coming in too when im at work.  Just added peace of mind
comment 3: 1)  The PTZ ones, I have two and rarely move them.  Just buy the cheaper ones.
2)  They seem to have really inconsistent audio.  One close to the TV can barely tell it's on.  One on the other end of the room hears it plain as day.
3)  The audio OUT of them kind of sucks.  It's either too quiet or blaringly loud and distorted.
4)  They will actually live outside if you don't put them directly in the rain.
Just some FYI for others that may happen to read this.
comment 4: Are the cams only motion activated?
comment 5: No, you can do a lot with them actually.
The cams will record 24x7 (a 32GB card will do 7-8 days on SD IIRC), on a schedule, on sound, on motion or you can do no recording and just use it as a live cam to log into whenever you feel like. 
You can turn on motion and send alerts to your phone.  You'll get free 12 second cloud storage.  So the camera sees motion, you get an alert on your phone, hit the notification and the app starts up and plays a 12 second vid of the motion.  If you put a 32GB micro SD card in (about $8) it will also record a 1 minute video on the card and you can connect from anywhere and watch that.  Sometimes dad will pause at the door and the 12 seconds ends so I'll connect to the cam and watch the 1 minute or the live to see what's happening right at that moment.
Also have the ability to set a detection box.  So I can draw a box around the cat feeder and only motion in the box will trigger it.  Used that yesterday to see if the auto feeders were working.
There is a pretty good series of videos on youtube by the company themselves going over all the features.  There's quite a lot for what they are, I was surprised.  Things will even do time lapse video.
There are a couple of different types of these things, like the Arlo or the Blink cams.  They all have their little specialties.  These were cheap and worked for me.
comment 6: I never knew you could do drop in on a dot until someone in this sub recommended it, definite game changer. Now, I’ll be looking into wyze cams
comment 7: I can understand how it seems a little.... invasive... but when you can't get a hold of someone with Alzheimer's,  it can create huge panic.   I don't mind the FBI listening in as long as I can talk to mom when I have to be gone.
comment 8: I honestly don't get this. Could you explain how that's done?
comment 9: Download the amazon Alexa app on your phone. Once you set it up to communicate, you’ll be able to drop in on your echo dot
comment 10: Wow. 
I never.... this just seems sooo 1984.
comment 11: Ok, but it’s 2019. Are you asking about how the app works, or are you getting worried about big brother? If you, or anyone near you has a smart phone, consider everything you say as being monitored, echo dot/amazon app or not. The way I see it, if there is someone out there listening to anything I’ve got to say, they’re going to end up bored.
comment 12: Neither, to answer your question. It just blows my mind that the technology exists to do that.
comment 13: I have Google Home , does it do a drop in style service? 
Thanks
comment 14: My dad also likes Alexa for listening to Pandora. Most of the time he can remember how to tell her to turn on music (he can’t figure out the radio, etc.). And if he can’t figure it out, he can call me and I can switch stations or turn it on/off using the app.
comment 15: Oh wow.  I set it to play music but I didn't know I could turn it on through the app.  I just got it yesterday so I'm still learning too.  Thanks for the information! Mom loves listening to music but after a bit it's too much stimulation

"Dementia and alcohol I'm trying to get to grips with my mother's situation at the moment.  She's 76 and seemed ok until a couple of years ago, slowing down with age but nothing majorly different.  She's always enjoyed a drink, but it started becoming every day, a bottle of wine, or at least half a 70cl of spirits daily and her behaviour became much more erratic once she'd had a glass of booze.
She's suffered a few falls due to this, 2 involved hospital, first a fall on stairs with head injury and more recently she broke her wrist but can't remember how.
She was referred to a ""memory clinic"" by the NHS GP (we're in UK) who saw her a couple of times but have said they can't do anything because of the drinking, they'll see her again in 18 months if she refrains.
She has avoided alcohol for the last couple of months but is noticeably deteriorating, eg, she's not eating during the day, has seeming forgotten how to use all household devices (kitchen stuff, TV, even the phone), and can't find her way away the town she's lived in for 50 years, even struggles with where the toilet and her bedroom are in the house she's lived in for a similar duration at times.  I'd previously attributed some of these these things to her being drunk, but now they're happening when I'm sure she's sober.
I'm living in the house with her now so I'm ensuring she has a dinner and keeping on top of cleaning and stuff, but I work during the day and I'll come home and find odd things like a tub of margarine upside down in the washing machine.  I'm happy to look after her where I can but would like some help, I risked going away for  a week's holiday a while back and she was found by a neighbour screaming my name on the street, apparently convinced I was dead.  
Sorry for the essay, I guess it comes down to 2 questions:
Am I kidding myself that as she spends more time not drinking she might improve?
How can I get help?  GP has already referred her in the past but that option won't help for a while, are there other referral options?","comment 1: My father tried to cover his deterioration by drinking.  He would use it as an excuse.  If she has symptoms when she's not drinking, she probably won't get better.  Make sure her doctor knows what's going on.
comment 2: Has your mum got a definitive medial condition? MRI done etc ? What medication is she on?
comment 3: No, nothing diagnosed.  I'm not sure what the process is, I think the GP refers to the memory clinic who then assess and decide how proceed, but they won't continue because of booze?  The was a scan which found evidence of a mini stroke, would that have been MRI?  I've only got the info my mum has told me about what tests have been done, so it's not fully reliable.... Would her GP provide details to me ?
comment 4: I'm not in the UK, but Canada so I would imagine some things are similar. In order for the GP to tell you things your mum would have to have you come to the appointments with her/give consent, but your best bet is getting power of attorney for both finances and personal care. That way you are in charge and they can tell you everything. I don't know why they would have said to abstain for 18 months, that seems excessive. As far as I'm aware an alcoholic with liver disease is eligible for a transplant after 6 months sober for example. You really do need that diagnosis to proceed with certain things so I would contact the GP, express your concerns and see if they can expedite things. Even without the POA you can tell them things, they just can't reveal a patient's history. I hope that is relevant.
comment 5: Yes yes,POA pronto while your mother can still give consent.
comment 6: I would advise that you make an appointment with ur mum to visit her GP together and perhaps call the GP first yourself to discuss your concerns. Discuss with the GP how you mum has been in the last 6-12 months. The GP should do some ' Mental status tests’  and evaluate your Mum (Mild Moderate Etc) and diagnose Alzheimer's, or due to her strokes Vascular dementia. 
This happened with our Mum, the GP advised that she stop driving, my mum started to get VERY anxious and did not want to me left alone and continued to be VERY forgetful. She was a shadow of her former self very quickly. 
We went back to the GP again recently and said that we would like an official 
medical diagnoses,  Alzheimer’s has a wide spectrum. So in order to medicate correctly we needed to know what she had exactly in order to do so. My mum was given Mirap (antidepressants) and it has completely changed how she was a few months ago, eating well again, much more confident and a lot less ‘confused’ she may even be allowed to drive again.  We have told her that they are her new ‘Sleeping’ tables and because of this she can not have anymore alcohol ever again (In fairness she did like to have a drink or 3) but she has stopped from this point on. 
So GP referred for MRI and results came back with Vascular dementia (cant remember the exact name). After MRI we quickly met with a consultant Psychiatrist, who gave us more details and clearer view of outcomes etc.
We know this is not a cure and never will be. We hope just to manage the next few years with her to be as best they can and well, hope for the best really. 
So in short, and on my limited knowledge, get a proper medical diagnoses and don't give up until you get it, then work with her GP for the best medication for her needs. Also, she must stop drinking Full Stop.
comment 7: Couldnt have put it better,my Dad had Vascular Dementia caused by a stroke
comment 8: Sounds like my dad - look into Wernicke’s Encephalopathy. He got the diagnosis and is much safer and happier in assisted living for memory care.
comment 9: Go to the Docs,he will refer you to a Psychiatrist ,insist on an assessment,it may be because of her drinking they are refusing
I am from the UK and how the system works is the Doc will refer her to a psychiatrist who will diagnose her,send her for scans to determine the type of Dementia and issue meds,if she is not drinking anymore that should not be a problem
She cannot drink while on medication

"Dealing with stubborn parent(s) My (44) dad (76) has been showing cognitive decline in the past several years. The main symptom by far has been memory loss. He is still pretty sharp about some topics, but I'll hear the same story and get asked the same questions again and again. He doesn't seem to be showing other symptoms, such as getting lost, and his vocabulary is still pretty good. He seems to be able to do his regular tasks, such as making coffee etc. He thrives best when he can stick to a regular routine and be in familiar places.
His memory loss symptoms are becoming quite noticeable and it has got me thinking about the future for the sake of my mom (76) who would be/is his primary caregiver. This issue is that he is deep in denial, and I can tell he works hard to hide his issues/confusion (i.e. he will change subjects, dominate the conversation, or go quiet etc. in order to avoid showing his lack of memory about certain things). 
Because of the responsibilities he holds (including overseeing their finances, and doing all the financial investing), I think that the next step is some sort of medical assessment. They live part time in a small community, where the local clinic did do some sort of short cognitive test last year that apparently showed he was ""fine"". However, my mom (who is dealing with her own issues around denial) did not get the results directly or follow up with that doctor. We got the results through him, so I'm not sure how accurate what we heard is. 
They share a family doctor in a larger nearby city where they live for the rest of the year, and he gets check ups with this doctor, but my mom has not yet taken to time to alert their doctor about this. Obviously that previous test was not comprehensive enough, and I feel that the next step is a proper assessment so we have a better idea of what might be happening. 
However, how do we convince him to get such testing? And also convince my mom to take a more active role in tracking his health?","comment 1: Your Father is in the very early stages,it's vital you find a way to have him assessed,try explain to your mum the sooner he can be assessed the sooner any recommended treatment can start,catching it early is vital
I am not sure which country you reside in so it's difficult to give precise advice,I live in the UK and from what I read on here treatment and diagnosis are very different
"
"What activities can someone with AD do on their own? My mother has early onset Alzheimer's. Her memory isn't terrible, but she gets confused easily and can't keep track of tasks that require multiple steps (like making coffee for instance), and she can't read because she can't keep track of where she is on the page.
I'm looking for suggestions as to what sorts of activities she can do on her own when we aren't able to give her attention.
So far we have
Coloring book
TV
....and that's kind of it.","comment 1: That depends on the stage and the individual and even the time of day =/
A couple of thoughts though:
So when my mom was less advanced she enjoyed Instagram. I set it up. And I just showed her how to scroll (not comment or post), just scroll through accounts of family, friends, or those that shared her interest. She was able to handle just scrolling (for awhile). 
I also set up a bird feeder and birdbath. A lot of them actually. My mom loves to watch the birds. It's potentially something to do independently as well, not just watching them but refilling the bath and feeders, making suet etc.
Watering the garden is good for the earlier stages. This year I'm planting a butterfly garden and bringing caterpillars in to raise. 
Flipping though catalogs and magazines is easier than reading a book. The type of magazine depends on specific interests.
comment 2: I like the magazine idea! I'll try that out thanks!
comment 3: I second the magazine as well! LO still insists on the New Yorker despite holding it upside down and flipping between the table of contents and the cover. She was a reading fiend at her mental peak so the wall of text is comforting to her, rather than the ad-ridden visual stimulation of say People Magazine. She also likes Time and will borrow her father's when we visit. New Yorker also has very nice illustrations and cartoons in it. And poems. 
&#x200B;
but stick with what she knows.
comment 4: Folding laundry. Going thru photo albums.
comment 5: Laundry is always a good thing to give them to do! I have found that my residents of all stages can do it.
comment 6: puzzles, and theres a load of good apps if you have an ipad she can use! puzzle apps, all sorts of easy games and plenty of apps that are designed for people with alz. 
gardening if physically able could be fun too, my grandmother can spend hours just walking around her yard picking up leaves and twigs and putting them in a little bucket.
comment 7: We got my mother a therapy cat that appears to breathe. Not in NY (not in the States actually!) but this is the same model. She seems to love it, according to my sister. I haven't seen her with it yet.
She did jigsaws for a while but got frustrated. The puzzles we got her had too many pieces and she would put them in odd places. Although to be fair they did seem to fit where she put them. We now have puzzles with fewer pieces, but she seems to go through them rather quickly.
Tried getting her to listen to music with this simple player but we were kind of limited by what music we had to hand and it's a mixed bag. My dad keeps forgetting to put it on for her and she won't do it herself.
comment 8: I would also have to say laundry. Looking at books or magazines, any kind of sorting, cleaning. A lot of times activities that make them feel like they have a purpose helps. They want to feel like they can help still. My residents do well with sorting and looking through greeting cards. Sometimes I ask them to help me find the matching envelopes or to find a specific type of card to “give to someone we know”.
comment 9: My dad was often let alone in the house. He's a musician, so we set up speakers around the house playing some of his favorite old artists. We also let him do the dishes and clean because he used to be a custodian and he loves to clean. I say do anything that connects to their life before they got AD.  Some other ideas include:
-puzzles
-fidget toys 
-anything to sort
-old picture albums
comment 10: Lots of folding laundry.
comment 11: If she cleaned all of her life, she would probably be content with that. Give her a dust cloth or a broom. Give her towels to fold. Let her make the bed. Give her unbreakable dishes to wash (even if you have to buy some). If she gardened or had flowers, let her putter around outside. Give her mail to do (junk stuff only). Really, any busy work you can think of.
comment 12: Shred old papers
comment 13: My aunty does lots of word searches when she's visiting us but does (simple / kids) jigsaws at home
comment 14: There's always rummaging - maybe put a basket out with a lot of little interesting items?
comment 15: 1) Puzzles : get hold of kids puzzle sets. Those with large but fewer pieces
2) Kids Basketball set : gives individual a chance to toss a ball into net. 
3) pedal cycle : stationary pedal cycle.
comment 16: Coin sorting, sock matching(I have a basket of socks for only this), dementia puzzles(larger and less pieces), fidget blanket(lots of different type of closures to fiddle with), a purse with stuff she can fiddle with, and children's picture books or magazines.
comment 17: We gave my grandma laundry to fold, a big box of junk mail to shred and sort, worksheets of arithmetic problems free from the internet. 
She was able to be out in the garden for a while but after eventually she would start pulling up actual plants and digging up the dirt around our house foundation :p 
When she was far gone enough to not be able to tell the difference, we got her one of those baby dolls whose eyes opened and closed when they laid down. The baby doll would keep her happy bc she liked taking care of it, amd it kept her from wandering around too, bc she wouldn't want to disturb it by getting up out of her chair. I dont know it this would work on others tho..we found out on accident, so keep the reciept if you buy your mom one in case it doesn't work. After the math, laundry, paper shredding, gardening stopped working, the doll worked pretty much up until the end.

"Need help with telephone solution Hey everyone- 
So my mom has occasionally started forgetting to hang up the phone, which leaves us unable to contact her throughout the day. I've found a couple of products online that will automatically hang up after a certain time, but I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions or experience with anything like that-
Or, as another thought, does anyone know of anything that would work almost like an intercom- a device/app where I could place a call and end up on speakerphone without the need for her to physically answer the call? 
Any and all suggestions greatly appreciated!","comment 1: lol, man this is a throwback .... my mom did this a few times, heck I got a $125 bill for a long distance call from the Philippines, my brother and I blocked all international calls and she has to use a phone card.  As for your mom, heck we actually got the Google home hub, I think you can get a free google phone number and she can only make local calls online.   ALSO it's bigger than a phone and all she has to do is push the green button and it hangs up when the other user does, hope this helps
comment 2: Will definitely look into this. We already got her an Echo, and I know there’s a way to link phone service to it, but she forgets she has Alexa
comment 3: it's visual as well so it has a camera and it turns black when the caller hangs up, pretty handy
comment 4: Side question, is she hearing impaired?  If she is, she qualifies for a free CaptionCall phone through the Federal Gov't.  It does speaker as well as handset.  If she can push a button to answer the phone, it avoids her having to pick up the handset.  Not sure this is the optimal answer, just trying to be helpful. As they forget how to do things, the phone certainly becomes an issue.
comment 5: Not hearing impaired, but thanks for the info- I’ll look into that
comment 6: We just set up an Amazon Show on the same account as my sister. She can ""drop in"" whenever she likes and the camera is pointed towards the living room/kitchen area and she can also disconnect the ""call"" at her leisure. I printed out instructions in how to drop in on her kids if she wants, so we are testing out that feature now. But my sister having the authority to drop in at max volume so she can summon our parents to the living room is the best option we have found so far.
comment 7: This sounds perfect, thanks! Looking into it now
comment 8: I have Amazon Echo Dots set up around the house and I can literally drop in whenever I feel like. It creates an intercom system throughout the house to my phone. No requiring that he answer.  I just start talking and he can talk back.

"A Phone for a Person with FTD Hello all,
My sister was recently moved to a memory care unit and for years her primary means of communication with family & friends was with a Samsung smartphone.  One of her favorite things to do is call friends and family, but even with Samsung's ""easy mode"" feature (that gives a simplified UI), she has difficulty making and receiving calls.  And, to be honest, the phone app interface is not setup very well at all.  She gets stuck in ""recent calls"" section of the app and it's not intuitive to get out of it.
A flip phone or something she has to dial isn't a good option because she is terrible with numbers, so she needs something where she can press one button with someone's name to make a call.
So I'm looking at alternatives.  The senior-focused phones/devices like the Jitterbug and Grandpad have mixed reviews when it comes to dementia patients.  And there aren't a whole lot of other options out there that I can find.  I'd be interested in what has worked for others.
Thanks!","comment 1: For the brief time between ""can't use cell anymore but can still make calls"" and ""can't make calls at all,"" my husband set up for my father-in-law a Google Voice number that rang an ""old-fashioned"" cordless phone, with speed dial programmed with the numbers he might need (mother-in-law, husband, me, maybe one friend?). I don't know if this is a feasible setup not at home.
comment 2: Thanks, I'll look into that.

"My 91 mom forgot my birthday for the first time ever last week My mom realized today that she forgot my birthday last week. She is currently in rehab after a fall.  I told her that it’s really hard to keep track of days in a hospital type of setting.   
I told her that I knew it had been my birthday that day and that’s why I brought her the beautiful basket of yellow pansies. A celebration of her bringing me into this world.  
We had a wonderful hug.  She’s 91 and I love her so much 💛","comment 1: Thats so sweet of you.
My mother is 85.  She forgot my birthday for the first time this year.  I'm hoping with the help of technology (alerts on my phone), I'll never forget any of my children's birthdays!
comment 2: That's very sweet of you.  I'm sorry she forgot your birthday, that makes me sad.

"Mom willingly gave up keys to car, but is now dangerously wandering My Mom hasn’t been definitively diagnosed, it’s could be Alzheimer’s or Dementia, she is 65. 6 months ago she gave up the keys to her car, because she no longer felt comfortable driving. Over the past two weeks, she has stolen the car and gotten over 100 miles away, and walked on an interstate for 3 miles, in separate instances before being apprehended by police. In the most recent wandering incident, she crossed a diamond highway interchange on foot. What can we do? She is lucid most of the time, and will know she is in a looney bin(please excuse my language, I don’t know how to word this)if we get her into adult day care. Is GPS tracking an option? If anyone has any experience with a wanderer, please dm or leave a comment, any experience is helpful.","comment 1: Disable the car so it won’t start. If your Mom is pretty out of it, you can put new locks up near the top of the door frame, where she won’t think to look. 
If she keeps this up, she won’t be safe to be left alone. Someone would have to be with her 24 hours a day. Hiring help is quite expensive. A Memory Care facility may be needed. But that would be better than her being hit by a car or falling into a ravine on her long walks.
Time for some difficult decisions. This is hard and not fair. Best of luck to you and your Mom. Stay strong.
comment 2: Look into medical alert bracelets. There are GPS options, and at least people will be able to help if she wanders and someone finds her.
comment 3: So the first thing you need is a diagnosis, that’s the key to starting any sort of process for additional care and support. There’s a chance it might not be dementia at all so you really need to get this part sorted . Not sure how it works where you are, in the UK we just book a GP (primary care physician ) and take our relative along and say ‘I’m worried about their memory ‘ and it goes along a diagnostic and referral process from there. 
Until you have a diagnosis you can’t make informed decisions about what should happen or how you’ll access those next steps. 
Also there are many many different types of dementia (you mentioned Alzheimer’s, that’s the most common) and they all have different characteristics, meaning the challenges you encounter in the early to mid stages are different.
comment 4: Stealing the car and wandering miles and miles from home is the reason a lot of people end up needing to be placed in memory care units. As long as a loved one can manage the majority of their personal tasks, an assisted living memory unit is often fine. Once a loved one deteriorates where they're unable to feed themselves, walk, need a hoyer--then it's time to consider a nursing home. Most assisted living facilities are not equipped to manage the latter stages of dementia.
comment 5: I was thinking that you could try geofencing.  Basically setting up GPS alerts when she travels outside some area.  You'd have to look at a device that would work for that, possibly a medical alert watch/necklace, or cell phone if good with that.  At least, you'd know where they likely are, but nothing is really foolproof.  If they continue to have problems, then you'd have to look at other options.
&#x200B;
Here is a blog about some aspects that I found in my google search: https://www.zanthion.com/blog/alzheimers-patients-and-wandering-how-gps-can-help/
comment 6: In terms of the car, it only costs about $100 for a mechanic to install a simple kill switch.  If the vehicle isn't driven often, just unhook a battery cable.  Even if she sees you do it, a person with dementia isn't going to solve the puzzle of fixing it.
Unfortunately, wandering is a very risky behavior.  Unless you're 100% certain that she won't walk into danger, it may be time for a locked memory care unit.  But in the meantime, unhooking the battery will prevent her from endangering others.
comment 7: I recommend getting a nanny cam for the house so you can check up on her. for the wandering make sure it's an anklet with GPS because they never think to check the ankle. Good luck!

"Recommendations for GPS tracking bracelet and door alarm I’ve just joined this subreddit and I did try to scroll through to see if there’s any posts about this but didn’t see any. 
I live in Canada, my grandpa is declining FAST. Here in Ontario it is a 2-6 year wait to get into a secure care home. 
Until then, can anyone recommend a brand of GPS tracking bracelet and door chime that they have used. And what other equipment or resources have been helpful for you? 
Any help would be greatly appreciated","comment 1: My dad (73) isn't in the wandering stage but he lives at home with me (30/F). Besides some theft because he's leaving doors open, I decided to install security cameras that send me an alert whenever they detect motion. That way I'll know when he's left, what direction he went, what he was wearing. It's peace of mind for me since I work an hour away from where I live. 
I've also installed Echo Dots around the house so I can drop in and turn them into intercoms. I can set up reminders, etc.  Doesn't answer exactly what you asked but might help lead to some better solutions for your predicament.
comment 2: Thank you for your recommendations ☺️
comment 3: Apple Watch or iPhone with find my phone locator thingy turned on is what we use.  We used tile for a bit but it is reliant on having people with devices around so we weren’t comfortable with it.   The hard part now is getting him to keep the watch on though.

"Progression: what to expect, how to maybe avoid the worst (From a previous post of mine as per request.)
&#x200B;
I am going to be the bearer of bad news because it's easier to hear from an anonymous source.  If you're feeling awful and depressed, STOP READING NOW.  This is a hard thing to take in.  MAKE SURE YOU'RE OK BEFORE CONTINUING.
​
Dementia is essentially untreatable, irreversible, is a horrible thing to live through, and ends in death.  There are a few drugs out there, but most of them don't do much and the side-effects are worse than their benefits.  There are a few Human Drug/Treatment Trials going on, but they're few, far between, you have to live near a hospital that offers them, many times they don't work, and anything they do find is years away from being available to the public.
The sufferers and caregivers who do the best with this disease are those who plan for the future.  They know what the next stage is and they've already done the research and signed the papers.  The best prepaired progression is usually:
&#x200B;

""impaired cognition"" noticed by family, usually in ""help me find my  car, I don't remember where I parked it"" situations.  Electronic GPS like a Tile can help here. 
POA/Healthcare POA signed by sufferer, or other documents such as Trustee, etc. 
All financials nailed down, local laws researched, support group/network for caregiver found and activated
DNR, ""quality of living"", death, corpse arrangements, burial arrangements discussed ahead of time
Long-Term Care Health Insurance attained (ASAP, the longer you wait the more expensive it will be) 
Shared home prepared for sufferer to live with caregiver (separate doors, ramps, extra rooms, extra baths, etc)
Patient diagnosed with dementia, usually ""mild to moderate"" stage
Medications to deal with side-effects prescribed, such as Sundowner's, violent tendencies, hallucinations, etc.
Medications to help with actual Alzheimer's prescribed.  They are usually not very effective, and are expensive and have serious side effects.  Some experimental treatments, such as specific forms of light therapy, are showing promise but these will not be available from HMOs for 7-10 years from now. 
Driver's License revoked
Apply to state/fed/insurance for any assistance, from financial to in-home.  This may take many tries and many years.  Talk to your hospitals' Elder Care Representative.
If sufferer is violent, hallucinating, or wanders, talk to local police so they can be prepared.
Get an electronic Tracker, bracelet, or other identifier for any wandering patient.
Around this point a few sufferers take their own lives to spare  their loved ones from dealing with a body without a mind.  This is not  common with Boomers and Silent Generations as they generally believe  suicide to be a sin, but we're seeing it become more and more common in  patients who are younger.
This is the point where we used to institutionalize our elders.  It  was very common in the 70's and 80's and even 90's to put them in Care  Homes.  Now we know that they decline MUCH faster when  institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home,  where they get better care.
In-home care becomes necessary during the day.
24/7 in-home care becomes necessary or the patient needs to be  admitted to a Memory Care Facility.  This is a locked ward where trained  professionals deal with hallucinations, violent tendencies, etc.  This  step is usually triggered by a tragic incident, such as patient  wandering and being found by authorities, patient harming caregiver,  patient injuring self, etc.  Memory Care Facilities are not cheap, they  can run between $2,000 - $10,000+ a month.  << this is where  caregivers with insufficient preparation or insufficient healthcare  access burn out... badly. 
Patient loses memories entirely, needs help with every daily activity 
Patient loses ability to feed self
Patient loses ability to swallow

​
Please note that this progression can take months or decades.  I hope that anyone else can chime in if I've missed anything.
​
ETA: Thanks to u/Mitzukai_9 for the tips on costs, and added/modified points 1, 5, 9, and 18.","comment 1: It always hurts to hear, but it’s good to be prepared and know. 
We just buried grandma (96) today; she suffered from this horrible disease also. It’s wasn’t as bad a journey as my mother with early onset/FTD, but it was a difficult journey nonetheless. My dear aunt had most of the caregiver/decision making duties for grandma, so it was hardest for her.  My aunt was mostly relieved with grandma’s passing this week—she joyously proclaimed that no one has the dementia diagnosis in our family now and we hope it stays that way. 
God speed, everyone dealing. I wish you peace.
comment 2: Thanks for this coherent list. Desperately trying to get my 80 year old dad (main caregiver) to plan ahead at the moment, but he is so stubborn and also totally knackered from lack of sleep! We're between step 11 and 12 currently.
comment 3: This is incredibly helpful. Thank you for posting.
comment 4: How can I prepare without a diagnoses? I'm getting more and more worried about my mom. There's been a pattern of her saying things that are totally wrong that she should really know. Like she said she worked at a textbook company in Knoxville 15 years ago the other night at dinner in front of extended family. This company is in New Jersey and she worked there well over 25years ago. We  corrected here but she stubbornly refused we were right until a couple minutes later. This has been happening more frequently as the past 2 years have gone by. She's increasingly loopy and out of words/content when she starts saying something or making a point. Sometimes she says things that are just completely wrong that were her own personal experiences we all know about. When we correct her it's like she doesn't even hear it and just keeps going on like you agreed.
&#x200B;
Her grandpa had alzheimer's and I'm afraid this disease is taking her at the young age of 65. It's eating me up inside, and my dad has acknowledged a couple times that he suspects she may have it. I told him it would kill me to see her go like that. It's too heavy a subject for us (my brother and dad) to really talk about or consider. How do you talk about that, and behind someone's back? It just feels wrong.
&#x200B;
She's so stubborn, she's not gonna go to the doc for it, none of us have even mentioned we think she may have it to her. She's always been very, very stubborn and it would not lead to anything good. I think it would be perceived as an attack.
&#x200B;
How can we achieve steps 2-5? Also, can we REALLY know until it's too late?
&#x200B;
I'm scared, and as time goes on I fear that this is the reality. I spend as much time with her as I can these days and we have a wonderful relationship that never really existed before. I try to cherish that. Also, I hate speculating, it just feels wrong to me. It's just these changes in behavior are so jarring I can't ignore it.
comment 5: > How can I prepare without a diagnoses? 
You can't, you're not her caregiver.  The only things you can do are work on you and support your dad.  I'm really sorry.  This is a horrible disease and you deserve better.
comment 6: Thank you, I mean I still have a sliver of hope that it isn't alzheimers. I don't think he's prepared at all either, he's ADD like me and doesn't take very good care of himself. She's the one who always kept him in check and made our family work financially. I try to make conversation with her but more and more she just totally goes blank with her response. She plays solitaire constantly before work, after work and anytime she isn't cleaning, and I try to talk to her and her response is increasingly ""oh...?"". Like something just isn't registering and she's back to solitaire. I just hope it isn't what it seems and she isn't becoming a shell of herself, but if she is that's something I need to accept and help deal with.   :(
comment 7: It could be a low grade infection, like a uti or something, or even dehydration.  Have you told her doc?
comment 8: Its been progressing consistently for a few years now, but I suppose it could be. The other thing I failed to mention is that she drinks too much wine every night and has done so like clockwork since I was a kid. I suppose something like wet brain is possible, but my dad drinks every night too and exhibits some impairment but not at all to this level. I also notice this ""absentness"" before she leaves work and when she first comes home. I know for a fact she doesn't drink at all before she comes home.
More and more often I will tell her something and have to tell her again and again the day after and so on. I even frustratingly say ""We talked about this yesterday"" and I don't know why I do that, it's just a way of expressing my concern I guess. She actually does seem to make a point of drinking a lot of water.
Both my parents have high blood pressure and mine is always above 140/90, so I made an appointment to see the family doc in a couple weeks about that. I do plan on telling her about this, is that a good thing to do?
Thanks for responding by the way. I've just really found myself worried about this lately. Some of the interactions I've had with her the past couples days have been very alarming to me. I do have GAD and social anxiety, so I always know I may be blowing things out of proportion.
comment 9: Thank you for this information. My grandmother lost her sister a few months ago and her Alzheimer’s and Vascular Dementia symptoms have gotten so much worse... she still thinks she can drive but it is terrifying. And we can get her to give up her keys. She seems to have forgotten she was diagnosed a few years ago. She started having symptoms back in 2008. She forgets to shower and brush her teeth. We ask her about it and she says she is fine and to worry about ourselves or she insists she will later but later never comes. She hasn’t brushed her teeth in almost 2 months and she has always been EXTREMELY hygienic before this. I have no idea what to do. She is still mentally there enough to be stubborn and think we are being ridiculous when we try to help her or ask her about stuff like bathing but at the same time she is far enough gone where she forgets to take care of herself and is getting lost.
comment 10: We're at #17 and it is becoming clear after applying for all state benefits and trying to get my father in a nursing home with our limited funds and only Medicaid to pay; I honestly hope he moves on to the inability to swallow stage and chokes to death. I said goodbye when he still knew who I was. I've grieved, cried, said help to the Lord. So let's get on with this. Let the guy die. Peacefully though; I really don't want him to choke but it's the next stage left. As for me; if I ever realize I've got Alzheimer's/Dementia I most certainly will commit suicide before becoming a burden to my family or drain in society.
comment 11: I am 100% with you on the last one.  And I'm sorry, perhaps I should have been more clear: the last stage is not choking to death, it's wasting away from no food or water until they starve.

"Dementia and Technology Hi everyone,
My mother-in-law is not diagnosed with dementia currently, but we believe she is in the early stages. She won’t seek help to determine whether she has dementia, but that’s another story. I’ve done work in skilled nursing facilities and have hands on experience with certain aspects of dementia. A lot of the behaviors my mother-in-law has are at least very similar to stage 4 of the 7 stages of dementia.
Anyway, other than the standard, daily things that are problematic, we are also currently having A LOT of issues with my mother-in-law and technology. She has always suffered from anxiety and depression, but lately, all she does is stay at home and move from her bed to the couch and back and spends hours upon hours staring at Facebook and texting and calling just about everyone in her phone. She is on her iPhone non-stop, and her confusion is making her use of technology problematic.
Her use of Facebook is both a privacy, financial, and safety concern (posting very specific personal information like everywhere she is or specific home addresses and details, and constantly getting hacked and at times even people targeting her for fraud financially), and somewhat damaging to social and professional relationships for herself and her family (she’s posted almost creepy details about friends and they no longer want to speak to her, and has liked pages for the places that family members work at and “accidentally” posts things to those pages...jeopardizing careers at times). 
We’ve also had issues with her confusing phone contact information, calling people she shouldn’t be calling, calling people 10 times in a row when they’re at work and can’t talk, calling at 3am repeatedly.
When we try to calmly discuss any of this, she either shuts down entirely and forgets or screams at us, claims we’re trying to steal her phone, and then forgets. She then immediately goes right back to doing the same things. 
I know all of this seems minor, but it’s becoming a large problem. I’m also quite certain that it will get worse as time goes on and she declines more. Since previous generations with dementia didn’t always use technology to the extent that people do now, I’m having trouble finding resources on how to handle the current problems and how to handle things as she gets worse.
Does anyone on here have a loved one with dementia who is it was an active user of technology, and how have you handled things when they could no longer manage certain or all aspects of technology as time went on?
(This is coming from someone who is usually a big proponent of assistive technology and its ability to help people. I’m out of my element here!)
Thank you.","comment 1: I think monitoring what she is doing is best. As long as she doesn't know about it there is no harm. 
It's probably very important to her that she be given the illusion that she is using technology normally. If she has dementia, she will likely not know the difference. Now, if she becomes annoyed or enraged when she does discover the monitoring there is nothing you can do. You are protecting her and care about her and she your mother in law! 
That said, I know absolutely nothing about this. I would consult a professional who aligns with your mother in laws ethical framework (were she in her correct state of mind of course). I don't know, but I imagine there are many qualified professionals who could provide more help than this thread. You would of course have to be able to access them financially logistically etc.

"My Mom is taking a 12 week long night job at Walmart as a “Remodel Associate” at 70 - Help! My mother has many issues, does not make wise major decisions, and willingly puts herself in hard and stressful situations. She is 70 years old, single, lives alone, only has my siblings and I left in her life. For the last few years she’s slowing been declining mentally and physically, not enough that she can’t take care of herself but enough to see that she could use someone around and is definitely aging. She just started to receive social security, my sister is moving in with her in 2 weeks to help her with bills and in general. 
For over 20 years my mom worked hands on in a woodworking shop until it went out of business 3 years ago. She was severely depressed about this, she came over to our house for dinner and told my husband and I she lost her job while sobbing in grief like someone had died. She told us she couldn’t eat and that she wanted to take her shotgun and blow herself away. Obviously this was very disturbing and I tried to get her help. This made her extremely angry and was refusing at every attempt,  I just gave up. She has had 2 jobs since then in the same field but neither of them lasted long. She’s been out of work since December 2018 and her mind has been on one track since then: getting a job, any job. She has fallen for online scams guaranteeing she will be hired for a fee, and gets endless notifications and calls from “jobs” on her phone. 
Last week she told me she was going to interview at Walmart and when followed up to ask her how it went, something was off. Then she tells me she has orientation there today, and I ask about her position there. She got hired as a seasonal “remodel associate” for 3 months working overnight 5 days a week for $12 an hour. I was shocked that this was even offered to her, based on her elderly appearance alone. Obviously Walmart is not known for their ethics which is what all of her kids warned her about when she applied. The more I kept asking questions about it she started to change the subject and I straight out said “mom, you are changing the subject because you don’t want me to ask questions about this Walmart thing. I feel like you are being taken advantage of because you are desperate to work.” she kept insisting that it was all fine and she really wanted to do it. I looked up this position it says it is fast paced and psychically demanding, and that the duties are unloading trucks, removing and installing fixtures and stocking. She has a bad knee and can barely do stairs, and has a difficult time focusing let alone follow directions. She refuses to listen to any of my siblings or I about the dangers and insanity of her doing this job and keeps insisting she can do it. She said “ I AM taking this job. I NEED to get my foot in the door.” and keeps repeating that she NEEDS THIS JOB like a robot.
Meanwhile my sister is coming to help her so she doesn’t have to work or if she really wants to, can work part time at an age appropriate job. I am at a loss as to what to do. I am concerned for her well being, especially with this being overnight. She is depressed and sleeps a lot, and also won’t drive at night but she conveniently “doesn’t mind” now for this job. I have a newborn, my sister is out of state and my brother also doesn’t know what to do.  Any advice is greatly appreciated. ","comment 1: Let her do it. She's an adult. It sounds like she needs motivation. I work in cancer care and had a patient who worked overnights in a grocery store doing stocking and similar remodel stuff. She was quite unwell, but kept going to her job throughout her treatment. It was part of who she was even though she was sick and limped and was slow. For her it gave her meaning. Personally I would never do that, but to each their own.
comment 2: She needs a job. Maybe not for the money, but because she needs something to do, to feel useful, for her emotional health, possibly for her physical health since keeping moving helps.
Reading between the lines; She's been telling you this, but you don't seem to be listening.  
Working this job might really help her to combat her depression. Physical activity, personal accomplishment, social interaction, common goals, etc.  
Is this the best or right job for her? probably not. But it's something, and she seems to be grasping at straws.
Walmart is an EEO company, and it very well may be that they hired her just to say that they aren't discriminating based on age. If she gets injured on the job, she will qualify for worker's comp.    
If you want to help her, and I really believe that you do, try helping her look for a job during her off-hours - one that might be more permanent and more suited to her skills.
Maybe helping assemble cakes in a bakery, or candy-striping at a hospital, or assisting in serving lunch or intake hours at a daycare, or reading books to kids at a library on the weekends.  
You don't need to say ""better suited for your age"", but can go with her timeline - she found a temporary job. She's going to need a new one when it's over.  
If there's a bigger disconnect (like she thinks she has to have a job for the income, whereas you know that's inaccurate) then you might want to consider a family counselor, one who specializes in aging parents. They can either help you get through to her, or provide you with a path forward in talking to her Dr's and getting POA if she's mentally slipping badly.  
comment 3: Let her try it.  Physical  and mental stimulation may be good for her.
comment 4: Walmart hires many senior workers, they're not going to have her swinging from ladders, she'll probably be unpacking merchandise and stocking shelves or something. 
comment 5: The things that age a person the most later in life is not having a purpose and not having social outlets. It really doesn't matter what the purpose is: it could be an important job, singing at religious services, crocheting hats for infants. Whatever makes them feel valued and purposeful is healthy.
You mom obviously places a huge importance on her job and has worked physical jobs using her hands. Working is best for her. What types of jobs do you think are available for someone who is 70? How many 70 year olds are working in your company or your siblings companies? You have a big chip about Walmart, but they employ many older people when others will not.
She went through an interview and they saw her ability level. I am guessing they have a balance between younger people doing the heavier lifting and older people setting up displays. But if the job turns out to be too much for her, then she will either leave or let go and that will be a learning experience she has to absorb to plan her next move. If she can't drive at night then she loses the job. If she can't concentrate and put things together then she loses the job. If you truly feel like she is in danger of physically hurting herself then you should go watch the orientation and see how the labor is split and get a manager contact.
It would be nice if you and your sister were supportive of her trying to navigate getting older instead of telling her what she should feel like at her age. My sister and I had to learn that - what we think is right for them is just our thoughts, they are actually living being older and we can only guess what that is like. We have had to move my mother from Assisted Living to an Apartment only to move her back 3 months later in order for her to finally settle in her mind she isn't independent any more. It's tough.
If you think she is having some cognitive decline then its a good thing for her to face reality. It's also a good thing your sister is moving in because she can help steer things in the right direction. If this job is beyond her then maybe she can find meaning in another way, otherwise she will stress over this and actually worsen her symptoms.

My uncle is going through this disease. He is an elderly person. He has always lived alone and has no children or wife, only us. Last week, he went for a walk and fell, hitting his head very hard. Fortunately, our neighbor found him a few minutes later.
This has been the last incident in a long list. We try to take care of him (he doesn't want a caregiver, only us), but we have decided that he can't go out for a walk without supervision. But he hates this situation - we understand - and is getting agressive. So we are looking for a device so that he can go for a walk and we can know where he is and if he is ok.
We tested - without success - a device like this and this one. But he didn't use it. He also hates tech (no even regular phone, since I have memories), so an smartphone is discarded.
We have thought of giving him a smart watch (analog appearance). Maybe he wants to take it and not take it away, but we're not sure about this.
Any ideas? Any source to look for a solution?
We just want him to be happy for as long as possible, but in a safety way.
Thank you in advance","comment 1: They have systems like this that may help:  https://www.angelsense.com/protect/dementia/?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=DSA_search_dynamic_US_Can&gclid=CjwKCAjw-OHkBRBkEiwAoOZql5vpYpqQn7IgSTuWN9glGGSTzHuCmHG_USbo3RhIXvsr2dhMw8AIWBoCqdMQAvD_BwE 
comment 2: I'm checking this and the GPS Shirt could be an option. It's similar to his ""inner shirts"". Thank you very much!
comment 3: you could attach a bluetooth tracker like Tile to items he usually carries, such as keys. it's not 100% coverage but a good backup if he forgets or disables another device.

"Baby-boomer parents are starting to have problems with being independant Apologies in advance for the wall of text, but here it is.
So my dad is 76, mom is 72 (I'm 33, no siblings or even first cousins). Up until recently, I and some family friends have noticed that mom's driving abilities, balance, memory, etc., have been declining. Dad is good for the most part, I worry about his driving as well but he does have some health issues that aren't bad yet (fingers crossed! It could be much worse). Today mom began being very vocal about her recent shortcomings with the aforementioned. She's always been the type to worry about everything- now she's terrified that we will put her in a nursing home (we keep reassuring her that we won't need to do that anytime soon). The last thing I want to do is take away their independence. They basically just go to the store, get lunch with friends or, sadly go to funerals. I have HUM devices on both of their vehicles, but the tracking function doesn't seem to work very well. On top of that their house is a mess, it seems like mom goes out and buys duplicates of the same antiques, books and kitchen wares- making for a semi-hoarder scenario. The house is a giant cluster-fuck. Gonna have to use about 30 or 40 hours of free time to get it organized. So I'm doing my best, at their house twice a day to make sure nothing crazy is happening, and on top of that a few of my friends drive by and make sure that everything looks ok (not the best neighborhood). 
So between working my ass off and trying to get the next few classes needed to apply for med school, it's hard to know what to do. It doesn't seem justifiable to take mom's keys away, which would mean that dad would have to drive her around, and on top of it all, emotions and empathy aren't a ""thing"" in my family. We'll die for each other but talking it out is inconceivable with them. Mom kind of wants to talk about it, but is too worried and talking about it seems to make things worse; dad won't talk about any of it with me. Ironically, he's a mortician. I just don't know how to handle or process any of this. Probably freaking out a bit too much.
Thank you for reading this giant wall of anxiety. 
Any response or insight is deeply appreciated. And big ups to reddit, what a great platform.","comment 1: It’s good that you’re helping, but don’t lose sight of the fact that keeping up the house and so on isn’t your responsibility, it’s theirs. Even now. Help them as sparingly as you can but don’t take it over. This could go on for many more years. 
comment 2: You are definitely right about this. Luckily, she hasn't bought extra stuff since she quit driving. I threw away TONS of useless junk/trash/god-knows-why-it-was-their stuff. But part of it is a bit of my responsibility, should have been on top of this a while ago
comment 3: You have my sympathy - I have been going through similar things for the past 5 years or so. Fortunately my sister and I are tag teaming everything because it is a LOT of work.
I have to say that it sounds like your moms showing signs of some type of cognitive decline or dementia. That she is worried is what you need to respect about her the most. Dementia is a brain disease that can affect spacial relations (driving and particularly parking), memory, and reasoning (buying extra stuff, no longer being able to organize, not having the attention span to go through the mail, etc).
If your mom is amenable, make a list of things that concern her and accompany her to her primary care if she has one. If not, you can make a list of your own and email it to the doctor prior to her appointment. She will likely go through a short cognitive test and if needed will be referred to a neurologist for more in-depth testing. There are medications that can somewhat improve conditions and slow the decline and they work better in the earlier stages of dementia, different medications for different types of cognitive issues, so it's important to get a good diagnosis. Our personal experience is that it takes months to get on their schedule so start now.
There are other possible causes of these symptoms too but only professionals could diagnose so please take her symptoms seriously, especially because any anxiety she has will only make them worse.
If it is a dementia, most are very slow moving fortunately. It is a whole world that you have to learn about to navigate, and if so I would suggest seeing an Elder Law Attorney (certified) to help your parents plan ahead while your mom can participate. Planning for the end game is dreary, but you have to do it to protect your father if he outlives your mom, and provide the best possible care for your mom if the other way around. There are lots of options for getting care in the home, adult day cares, etc. so nursing homes are only at the very end if at all, and you want to make sure they have a cash flow for care without spending everything, especially if Medicaid is involved.
And ""The Car Keys"" - the bain of all children taking care of older parents! There is no good time and no good way to take them away. It's a final admission of no longer being independent and it's so hard.
I would focus on getting her a good diagnosis first and other things will fall into place. And please, remember to practice self care. Helping your older parents can and has given many caregivers health problems of their own. There are tons of closed support groups on facebook too!  Good luck!
comment 4: Thanks for the response! I wasn't aware of the medication options for this, and I plan on accompanying her to her PCP. His kids and I grew up together and we are acquainted. 
I've finally convinced her to go see him, dad and I will be there to make sure Dr knows what's going on. Her dad died at 92 recently, was fairly aware and capable until about 90. She thinks that her Dr will ship her off to a nursing home. We tell repeatedly tell her that this is not how it works. I'll hold that off as best as I can.
She doesn't want to drive anymore, and I did tell her about Uber/Lift. The cab companies in this town charge 2 or 3 times as much. Thanks again for the post, been stressing hard the past few days
comment 5: The sooner you can get them into developing new routines, the better they will be able to handle them.
e.g. your Mom needs to know how to use Uber/Taxis as an alternative to driving. If she can get comfortable with it now, then she won't feel as helpless when the time comes for her keys to be put aside.  
You need to take care of yourself, too. 2x per day is a lot for you to be at their house. If you can get it down to once per day, then they can call you in the morning so that you can help them in the afternoon, or they can call you in the afternoon so you know exactly what they need help with the next morning - you'd still be checking on them 2x per day, but not in person.  
Then, you might be able to work on their house during your daily visits. One massive push for organization is intimidating and massive - so instead, look at one corner of one room. Decide what needs to happen, talk to them about it in your daily phone call so it isn't a big surprise or upheaval. It's a small thing, it's manageable. Every room might have 4 to 8 sections that need to be looked at - but that's a few months of smaller projects. Not a single enormous chunk of time that is impossible to find.  
Get on their HIPAA forms at their dr's offices. If her memory is slipping and she doesn't want to talk to you - you can't trust her to remember her prognoses or diagnoses and communicate them to you or your Dad accurately. You'll need to get it directly from the Dr. You might not be able to make it to the appointments, but you can get on the forms to get the information for yourself.  
Give her a GPS necklace, maybe one of the ones that has the button she can use to call for help - directed to your phone. Then you don't have to rely on her being near her car to be able to find her. Your Dad can have a bracelet or something in his wallet.  
Do they have a neighbor that you can trust to check on them if you're unable to make it over to their house? Next door or down the street?
Do they have a neighbor with a kid who could be paid to come over and do simple chores - like helping move small furniture out of the house, or mowing the lawn, or changing a lightbulb, or even driving somewhere? It isn't only you - there are other people in the world.  
And finally - have my sympathies. I am in something of the same situation as you, except it's my in-laws. And they live 3 hours away. I think we finally have an interim living situation so we can get their house sold, but just cleaning out their 10K square foot, ex-marina, stuffed house with a 3K sq foot carport, and multiple vehicles and boats on the property that aren't in running condition - it's stressful just to consider. I could probably get some anti-anxiety meds for the heart palpitations I swear start up any time I think about it.  
comment 6: I’m not the OP but you gave some great advice.
I never knew there was a GPS necklace, I’m going to look into it for my mom. Right now all I can do is track her iPhone which she often forgets to take with her, the necklace sounds like a great idea. Getting her to wear it will be a different matter but I’m glad to know it exists!
comment 7: I never realized that I can't be the only person who has a parent that frequently loses her phone. Bought her the first smartphone she's ever had, she loses it frequently. Definitely gonna get that. Also, check out wyzecams. The nicer model ($10 more) has a speaker and connects via Wi-Fi. Built-in speaker allows verbal communication with your smartphone
comment 8: Luckily for me, dad has always had a great routine, even after retiring about 8 years ago. He wakes up around 6am, reads the paper, stays busy for the most part. Mom has never had much of a routine after retirement, despite our trying to fix this. I know that diet and a sedentary lifestyle has not helped, on top of her having surgery and chemo a couple years ago.
The 2x day split with calls is a great idea, will definitely incorporate that!
I have some close friends that live around the area and will come check, and help if they have the time. You're really on point about getting someone who is more available. Luckily the live in a college neighborhood and maybe I can find some young, well-minded college student to help them out.
Good god, I can't imagine taking on the task you have at hand. Good luck and you'd be surprised who may be willing to help for a good price. When my grandpa was in a similar situation we hired local high school kids/farm hands to help. Cleared out a bunch of old tractors and other industrial-level machines. Good luck, and thanks for the words of wisdom. You have my sympathies as well
comment 9: “Elder care/Senior Care” are the search words you want. There is an entire industry built on the aging. Everything from getting a intermittent housekeeper, to hospice. Jump in there, it’s time. 
comment 10: You really are right. We never want to go through this but there is no option. Failure or buckling down under pressure is no option. Knew it was coming but they seemed fine last month. Thanks for the heads up man

"Hey all ! Researching family caregivers with COPd, Alzheimers, and Cancer First and foremost, I want to say thanks for demonstrating how much love we humans are capable of having for one another. I'm glad to have found a group of people that care for each other on a daily basis simply out of love. I'm currently a research student at California State University Los Angeles, and I am helping conduct a study about how caregivers such as yourselves communicate with chronically ill family members and their doctors. Unfortunately as you may realize, few resources focus on the additional impact that illness has on family members who care for the patient. 
We are conducting this study to better learn how to support YOU. As a part of this study I'm looking for respondents such as yourselves who are willing to take a 20 minute survey on their experiences as a caregiver. By doing this, you are contributing to better understanding and support for other fellow caregivers. I understand many of you are busy, especially with the responsibilities of caring for your loved ones, so any help is greatly appreciated!
This study does not seek any financial or monetary gain-it is simply to better support caregivers. I really appreciate you all taking the time to read this post or consider the survey. I wholeheartedly admire the strength you all display on a daily basis in caring for your loved ones.
Survey link: Please enter my name (Alexander Guillen) as the person who referred you to the survey at the end.","comment 1: This post has been removed. Please post requests for research in our Research Wednesday thread. It is stickied at the top of the sub.

"Grandma just diagnosed. Could use tips Hi all!
&#x200B;
I come here today with sad news. My grandmother was officially diagnosed with Alzheimer's today. This was not a huge shock to the family as she has been showing heavy symptoms for months now, but still devastating none the less. I am taking this particularly hard because she is the person I am closest to in the family. I visit with her several times a week. I help her out with any issues shes having around the house, and just stay and chat since I am the only grandchild nearby. She is one of the most important people in my life. 
&#x200B;
I come here today to ask for any helpful tips you might have for helping me deal with this and things I can do for her. I already had to install a tracking app on her cell phone since she has gotten lost several times. 
&#x200B;
Thank you all so much!","comment 1: Here are a few tips or hacks that were helpful for us, there's no way of knowing if they work for you: 


arrange so that she can listen to music easily


talk about her childhood and teen years


get a pet


get organized (google for Getting things done, for example, use todo-apps)


learn mindfulness (as a bonus, a mindful person is a little like a demented person :D )


study at least websites, perhaps books, too


take the legal steps as soon as possible


teach her to use alarm systems when she still can learn (i.e. now, if it's not too late)


things will get worse, be prepared 


try to find out how this crisis can be an opportunity, how you can become a better person, for example


Start writing about everything that's going on to your favorite relative(s). That way you have a record of the things you'll forget and an ally or several to talk to about your worries and plans.


comment 2: Get as much speech therepy as possible as soon as possible.
Try to keep her exploring and inquisitive. 
Be patient and keep her talking. 
comment 3: 1st, sorry to hear about your grandma, my mom has it but just keep remembering how things were got me through some of the frustrating times. 
BUT I will say find a Alzheimer's support group for you and your family members LOCALLY, trust me your going to need it for the long haul for support as well as getting tips locally in terms of supplies/help as it progresses. As much as reddit is a good online support chat, nothing is going to beat being with other people who are experiencing the same issues as you so you don't feel alone in the world.  
Good luck to you and the family, it's not the end of the world but really cherish as much now as you can with your Grandma 
comment 4: Thank you so much for the advice! I have already started looking into local support groups. I am also very sorry to hear about your mom, hope all is going well on your end.
comment 5: thank you for the comment about my mom, still the greatest woman in the world but not in the greatest shape ... she's in a home now just because I want her to have more social interaction than I can provide especially since I have a full time job and travel.  I really can't understate the support groups just because I didn't know more than half of the knowledge they had because they went through it.  I would do it sooner than later because it will get frustrating trying to understand her actions in the future and not feeling alone in the process was a huge benefit 
comment 6: Patience is the best thing. My grandma has had it for about 5 years and it can be frustrating and heartbreaking. Know you’re not alone. Feel free to pm me if you need someone to talk to. 
comment 7: As you are learning more about the disease, get a Power of attorney, medical power of attorney (and DNR if that is her wish) done. She has to sign in front of the notary.
Make sure you know her wishes as far as burial/cremation if you don't already know. Also, if she gets to a point where she can't eat, does she want to have a PEG tube for feeding?
Alz.org is a great place to start. There is also a wonderful group on Facebook called Memory People. PM me if you want me to get you added.
I would also suggest that you get her to a neurologist or psychologist to help with meds. Aricept is usually the first thing they will put her on. ❤️
comment 8: You said you added a tracker app to her cell phone. Keep in mind, that the time will come when she will lose her phone, maybe repeatedly. Have a back up plan, if possible. 
Get her to tell you about her life: her childhood, her fist job, her wedding, etc.  Once she is gone, that history will be lost.  If you can record her, even better.
Make things as easy for her as you can; repetition helps. Have her toothbrush in the same place, same with her hairbrush, her meds, her glasses, whatever.
The MOST important thing you can do for her: when she is confused, do not correct her, join her.  If she wants you to make sure to wake her up for work in the morning, tell her absolutely - don’t tell her that she doesn’t work anymore.  She will relive various stages of her life, you have to join her there. She will think you’re crazy if you try to correct her :)

"Patient - a man trapped in his own mind Hey guys, I’m currently a university student at the University of West England, and I’m working on my graduate film at the moment. Out film is about dementia, hence the tag line of this post, something myself and several of our crew care deeply about, and we really want to help with awareness of this cruel illness. Our film summed up is about an old man who views himself as his younger self, and because of this he’s confused as to why he is in a care home - struggling with care workers that aren’t looking after him in the best way possible. Our film is inspired by a real life case of neglect in a British care home. I don’t wish to be insensitive, or to communicate crassly about a really important issue but we’re currently raising funds so we’re able to create our set and pay our lead actor so that we can do this issue justice, the crew have all donated money to our kitty but any help would be appreciated. Our script is in it’s last stage of development, we’re shooting on an Arri Alexa mini, and we’re securing a studio so that we’re able to make this as cinematically pleasing as the message we are conveying. I’m happy to show a copy of the script to anyone that is interested in donating or just generally interested in our project! I’ll leave the link for our gofundme below, and please feel free to contact me on email! Thank you! 
david2.neale@live.uwe.ac.uk :) 
patient - gofundme","comment 1: I'm really torn about this post. On the one hand anything that brings awareness to this illness in a professional way is welcome and needed. On the other you are asking people dealing with it firsthand to help fund your graduate studies. A graduate school film, no matter how well done, is unlikely to actually help advance research so in my mind it would not a donation to the cause, but mostly to you. I can think of better places to actually donate that can directly help and if you read most of the posts here the illness places financial stress on a lot of families. I don't get the impression you have dealt with the disease in your family from the post, though maybe you didn't mention it.
&#x200B;
I am not trying to dissuade anyone if they feel like giving, just wanted to put my thoughts out there.
&#x200B;
EDIT: I saw this is your first post as well so you obviously are not familiar with how this works. Self-promotion is typically frowned upon.
comment 2: I completely understand where you’re coming from, I’m aware of how sensitive a post like this is and the implications of it- I’m working as the producer of this project but this is an issue close to the heart of our team and my director (who initially pitched this project), my grandmother suffered with brain tumour associated dementia so I understand.
I was trying to be sensitive towards this subject and I apologise completely for any upset caused, it’s difficult to find the appropriate forum/tone for this. 
If you have any other thoughts about this I certainly welcome hearing them and I’m open to any conversations, I appreciate your thoughts 
comment 3: Reddit is a very diverse place and there would be appropriate forums/subs such as /r/gofundme for example, there are likely many more - you just need to search for them.
comment 4: I hope you do keep us up to date on the film though, would love to see the final product. Should have mentioned that earlier! :)
comment 5: There has to be a better sub than this to post to. Most who post here are struggling to pay caregivers for their loved one, looking for a musing home they can afford etc.

Any recommendations?","comment 1: I need something like this for my mom. She basically OD on pain meds and thinks she went to ER for a back issue. We don’t trust her with meds anymore. Keep me posted on info on this please.
comment 2: The opening item was the closest thing I found for what I was looking for. The company said try tapping/covering the audio part.
If I remember correctly I may have come across some more expensive pill planners, where they stay locked unless it's the one that needs opening. Google searching the first 2 pages for ""best pill planner for seniors"" or something similar will likely pull up the one I have in mind.
comment 3: You could use an Alexa device and a hue changing light.  Have Alexa change the color from red to green when she says she took medicine, and then red again at midnight or 4am or some time out of the way.  There is an Alexa skill I use called pill popper and two daily reminders. That way there is a log of what I did and I could tie a bulb to it too.

"A bit a of story with my mom who suffered last year with dementia. I recently lost my mom who I dearly love who was only recently diagnosed with dementia. 
I would end up writing a book but I would like to try to keep this a bit short and explain my story.
I was adopted by my mom when I was a bit under 8 months old she was in her late 50's when I was afopted, I have in total 8 brothers and sisters who are about double my age who all have kids and are about my age to give you perspective.
I was born paralyze on half my body and had a heart murmur. in later years I went to special ed (there are other funny stories and such but for another day) and fast forward about 10 years and my father passes away from cancer. My mother is mentally destroyed by this and she never fully recovers from this. I believe this is when her depression began.
fast Forward about a year my mother decides that I should see a psychologist (my father never believed that i should take medication) and it also where I discover I have 2 different mental disorders. Bipolar and IED. 
&#x200B;
Fast forward about 10 years (during this time i have tried to harm myself and been in and out of hospitals which 99% of the time my mom had to call the cops on me).  My mom starts getting physically sick at this time and was also the last time I go to mental hospital. I start changing mentally and start focusing on taking care of my mom, I decline socially and just stay home only going out for appointments or going to the store. I should mention my 8 brother and sisters all live in the same area and as do most of my cousins who about a few years older.
&#x200B;
I am mostly taking care of my mom, by myself (I cook, I clean, I do laundry for both her and me)while she is getting heavy depression and uses a wheelchair. at this same time while Taking care of my mom (mind you I am on SSI and I give half to my mom every single month as rent)  during this time one of my sisters basically has me watching a toddler and mind you there are times where she would ask me to baby sit for 8 hours almost every day while she works there were times where I would get sick of it and tell her no and she would try make me feel bad but I would just hang up, she would just call my mom and tell her she is dropping the baby over even though I said no my mom would tell her ok. (also mind you I was doing this for about 3 years total and check this out.. 8 hours a day almost everyday for 3 years and in total she gave me in grand total close to $100). At the same time I have 2 delinquent cousins would would often stay weeks to months at a time and not offer anything while sleeping and eating here, not even there mothers would compensate (they all work btw). 
&#x200B;
Lets fast forward to one  year ago from this year, I am noticing BIG changes in my mom, she is talking to the tv she does not know where she is at times and she is getting a UTI almost once a month.  The doctors are telling me its her meds doing this (mind you I had to take her oxy and zanax away from her because she kept forgetting she took them and this is when I started to be in charge of her meds)
The sister i was baby sitting for finally understands I am under insane amount of stress and finally I am no longer baby sitting. My other sister (she works but lives in the same complex as us) starts helping by giving my mom showers and changing her bed and cooking for me and my mom.
Mind you I have also just found out about this time I have another mental disorder, which my therapist one day tells me why did no one tell me I have aspergers. anyway the IED(anger disorder)  I can not control the anger at first so you need to understand me and my mom would verbally argue alot and I said a bunch of things a regret, I would say mean and hateful things which I did not mean, this is also why I stop being social because I had done it to close friends and I would say stupid shit that I did not even think I would say.
&#x200B;
Lets fast forward about 3 months ago. My mom is in and out the hospital and she has like uti, her blood is infected(forget what they call it) and bunch of other stuff and to top it off she randomly tried to get up and walk to her wheelchair because ""this is not her house and she wants to go home"" mind you I take a medication that knocks me out about 30 min after I take it and for the last about 2 years my mom has fallen so many times. ok back on track, when she is home I find out she fractured her spine when she tried to go in the wheelchair by herself and the wheelchair slammed back to the tv stand and she hit her back with it.
&#x200B;
Fast forward about 2 months ago. My mom is showing signs again of uti and blood infection and she has not been eating (mind you she is showing all the signs of dementia and I am having to deal with this and it is very hard for me). (I forgot to mention we been using doctor's on call for the last couple of years) I tell the doctor and he keeps telling me her attitude and behavior is the meds and i keep telling him i do not feel right giving her meds if it has been a week since she basically stop eating and I cant give her meds in empty stomach but he insists she must take them and I comply. The next day I have to call the ambulance (I ALWAYS go with her even if my family is right there, but whatever I told them to stay and be with mom while she is in the hospital at the very least and for the last year they have done that at least.)
I visit my mom every few days, mind you the reason is, its the same each time ""I tell her hi mom, I give her a kiss and right away she tells me these people are keeping her hostage and I must take her home, I inform her as much as I want to I can;t you are sick ""she would go into a range and cuss and insult me and physically try to hurt me"" (hence which is why I told my family they need to be there for her when she is in the hospital)
&#x200B;
She comes home about a week and a half later, her decline really starts here. I notice she will not even drink ensure's. She is constantly complaining of stomach pain and just overall in constant pain - she basically can not even move and is not going to the bathroom at all. She refuses to go back to hospital.mind you I am doing my best to get some kind of liquid or food in her but I have no choice and a few days later I am a nervous wreck, my mom has not eatin good in weeks and is not using the bathroom and the doctor told me to keep giving the med, I say hell with it and call the ambulance. she is there with of course UTI and a few other things and 5 days later they send her right back home.
&#x200B;
I am pissed as hell because I see my mom is not eatting still and she does not look any better at all (I know because I went to the hospital the day before they sent her home) well I open the door and they bring my mom home. she is in her bed they leave and I  try to get her to drink ensure. she asks me for a pain pill (which I told she did not get one today in the hospital) so I tell her drink some ensure and I will get a pain pill for you. so I so give her the pain pill and I kid you not, 5 minutes later she is puking blood. not even home for 30 min and I have to call the ambulance.
&#x200B;
This post is getting long so to keep it short. she is in critical care, she has a HUGE stomach ulcer and they need to do surgery, me and the whole family are there mind you. they tell us they finish the surgery. all in all she passed away in the middle of the night,
&#x200B;
I wanted to post this to tell a little tiny bit of my story, I am still in pain I am crying as I write this. I miss my mom so much as she was my purpose in life. 
&#x200B;
Also just to make things worse, because my mom was my payee to social security they took my check away and her check and the account is negative over $2k right now. I won't be able to fix it because social security says this can only be done by appointment and the earliest they can do on march 20th.
I was able to pay jan rent before they took the checks back, my sister is going to pay feb rent and me nor my family have no clue what to do for march rent and I can not do a dang thing until I get my check back and have cash to get a apartment I can afford.
&#x200B;
I will be ok, but I am just so tired at times. I am lost and have no clue what to do.

I don't know anything about how you could get help, and I can't do anything to help right now. Did your mom have life insurance? I guess probably not. It sounds like you never really had a time when things were going well.  I hope that time is ahead of you. Gosh, I hope it gets better for you.

"Levels of self compassion in carers of people with dementia... As carers we know you have a lot of compassion for others, but how much compassion do you have for YOURSELF?  You are invited to take part in a questionnaires which aims to assess how much self-compassion you have, with the results being used as part of a university dissertation project. 
Research suggests that helping carers have more compassion for themselves may help with their wellbeing, and by taking part in this questionnaire you will be helping to further our knowledge in this subject.

"Medical alert bracelet suggestions needed Hello,
I'm researching different options for a medical alert bracelet, to notify emergency response if there is a fall, etc.  Monthly cost is a factor for me, so I'm looking for a budget option that is still reliable. 
My mom prefers something that is bracelet style, as opposed to a necklace or device to tote in a pocket or something.  
Are these ever waterproof?
Thanks!!","comment 1: I did a bit of research on this a few days ago to someone that had a similar question. My response is here

"I am just so exhausted I've been my mother's only caregiver for a very long time. She has so many health problems and can't be left alone as she falls very easily. My brothers are no help and the only break I get is when she is at dialysis a few times a week. But then I have to use that time to run errands.
She has been on oxygen for the past year and has progressed to were her oxygen drops into the 60s when her canula isn't on, and she keeps taking it off in her sleep. I tried everything I could think of to keep it on and finally broke down and bought a video baby monitor. But I'm still having to wake up at least hourly to check it, to make sure her oxygen is still on. And then I have a hard time falling back to sleep because my mind keeps going, ""What if she just now took it off? She'd be without her oxygen until the next time the alarm goes off."" It keeps replaying over and over in my mind that it will be my fault if she dies, because I didn't check the video at the right time. I can barely sleep at night and my mom gets up early. I can't nap during the day, because she doesn't want to wake me up and ends up falling trying to get to the bathroom by herself.
I have been begging her health care provider for months and months, for a pulse ox with an alarm. At first they kept telling me there was no such thing, then after doing my own research and finding one, they are dragging their feet on whether or not they are going to approve paying for it.
Her worker, home health nurses and everyone else that comes in, are making me feel like I'm doing a bad job taking care of my mom, because she's missed an appointment here and there that was first thing in the morning and there are dishes in the sink and the laundry is piling up. I've lost track of how many times my brother has said, ""how is the place this messy when you are here all day""
I am just so tired and frustrated and feel alone in this. Like no one, especially my brothers, understand how hard this is. ","comment 1: If you can't find a way to sleep, get some rest and get some time to yourself, you'll fall apart and won't be able to take care of your mom anyway.  The next time your brother makes a comment like that, say, ""Hey, I'm glad you feel that way because I need to be gone for 3 days and you will have to take care of her.""  If nothing else, make one of your brothers come over for a few hours a week so you can go decompress at a movie or something, even if you have to fib to them about why you're gone. For things like the pulse-ox alarm, try requesting medical equipment or supplies through one of the home health aides or workers. As much as I hate to say it, sometimes those companies are more 'financially motivated' to help you.  You might also broach the topic of a 'sitter' through either the home health nurse or directly through your mom's insurance (if she has it).  Is assisted living an option either of you could or would consider? 
Talking to a therapist might help - some will do Skype sessions now.  You need to know it will not be your fault if your mom dies. She clearly has multiple, serious health issues and no matter what you do, she will die at some point. Does she have a medical POA and/or a DNR? Do you know what her wishes are?  Is she happy?  You being there for her and caring for her is a wonderful blessing, but please give some thought to your own sanity or health. 
Sorry if this is rambling or comes across as harsh in any way, that is not my intent. I'm not always great at communication and, like a lot of caregivers, I tend to have a 'solver' mentality.  Give yourself a break - you are doing the best you can and sometimes you will have to settle for 'good enough' regardless of what others might think.
Wishing you some downtime and a good night's sleep.  
comment 2: Assisted living is an absolute last resort. She's been in one, it wasn't a pleasant experience and she's terrified to go back. She's fine at home, where she's happy, and I am able to take care of her just fine, it's just the whole not being able to sleep thing that's become a problem.
I've been so sleep deprived for so long, that I didn't even realize how bad it had gotten, until she was in the hospital for several days, and I was able to get several nights of truly restful sleep. It's just seems so much harder now.
comment 3: I'm sorry assisted living was a bad experience. I admit we, as a society, have a loooong way to go in improving the quality of care facilities.  With dialysis and such a low room-air (unassisted) oxygen level, I, like some of the others here, am surprised hospice hasn't been mentioned yet. I can say that the amount of care and the quality of care definitely improve at that level, although in at least one situation I had to fire a hospice company and hire another - the difference between them being like night and day.  
But her removing the oxygen cannula at night - is it discomfort? Or dementia? Or are you not sure?  There are pads that can go over the ears to make the tubing more comfortable there, I think usually supplied by the oxygen supplier? There is a way (can probably be found online) of draping the tubing in the back instead of the front.  I've read that wrapping soft medical tape around the tubing on the face can help. For any dryness (which is always a big gripe), you can use KY (or any water based lubricant) in the nose and beeswax on the lips.  A lot of people suggest putting mittens on the person's hands, even taping them at the wrists. I've seen this work but, in my case, with a family member who had dementia, it just drove her crazy and made things worse. We finally just  decided if she removed the oxygen and something.....happened as a result, it was meant to be that way.  That sounds callous, but it was in fact a very emotional, heart-rending decision. 
To be honest, I'm amazed that someone with oxygen in the 60s, even when sleeping and on room air (ie, unassisted) is not in the hospital.  
I pray you find a way to get some good sleep, as it is vitally important to your well-being while living in such a stressful situation.  And I hope your doctors and nurses and everyone else stop being obstacles and start being helpers.  
comment 4: I'm so sorry you're going through this, and that you have no family support. I'm taking care of my parents with my sister and I know how exhausting physically, mentally, and emotionally it can be. Anyone who hasn't been through this really doesn't understand. We finally switched from home health care to hospice for my father who has Parkinson's with Lewy Body Dementia. We now receive so much more assistance. Besides the aide and nurse that come we also have a social worker, chaplain, volunteer to stay with him occasionally and we have up to 5 days per month that he can go to a nursing home to give us a break. I have also notice a huge difference in the attitude of the hospice workers compared to our previous home health care workers. Hospice is SO much more kind, caring and compassionate!  With all that being said, we are still looking to hire extra help for evening for bedtime. 
If you've not looked into palliative care that may be something to investigate?
I truly hope things get better. Don't worry about the little things.  Dishes and laundry can wait. If you have some time, take a nap and get some rest. That's more important!  God bless you. This sure isn't easy!
comment 5: Is it not time for hospice yet?  It kinda sounds like it is.  Has the topic of quitting dialysis ever arisen?
comment 6: Drop your mom off at your brother's house saying you will be on a week's vacation.   Leave detailed instructions.   
comment 7: How do you survive?
You say nothing about a source of income, then at the end mention ""her worker, home health nurses and everyone else that comes in"".  
I feel for you, I really do.  It sounds to me like you are not making appropriate use of the help being offered. These are the people that can give you the best advice, as they are aware of the situation.
Please take care of yourself.  If your mother didn't want you to live, you wouldn't be here.
comment 8: I'm making the best use of the available help that I can. The state home health regulation format or whatever its called that they use to determine how many hours a day they will pay a caregiver, is only 3 hours a day. Which is what their magic calculations determined she needed for ""active care"". My mom requires 24/7 supervision and 3 hours is not enough time, nor enough for me to work outside the home. So I am the paid caregiver, between what I'm paid and my moms retirement, we manage. 
Which is neither here nor there. I thought this was a place to share and talk with other caregivers who would understand how hard this is... not have yet another person tell me I should be getting help from the agencies, which have thus far, proven to be decidedly unhelpful. I have been run ragged and in circles, I have gone back and forth between my mom's primary doctor and the pulmonologist to the social workers and medical supply/ insurance company. Gotten the prescriptions and every other red taped hoop they wanted me to jump through and still those people have dragged their feet about getting the pulse ox with an alarm so I can get some rest. All well saying they can't approve more hours so I can get another caregiver coming in here. 
By worker, I meant her Long Term Care worker and LTC nurse.  She also has physical and speech therapist that come into the home as well. 
comment 9: I was not trying to be critical, and I'm sorry that you seem to have taken it that way.  You didn't give many details and I was trying to find support that you may have missed.  I have been in a similar situation and always found the outside agencies to be very helpful and supportive.
Good luck.
comment 10: Sorry, Rereading what you wrote, after being able to sleep in a bit this morning and having had coffee, I realize I did take it the wrong way. Thanks for trying to be helpful. :)
comment 11: A lot has been said already.  Just want to add that you may want to consider finding a geriatric care manager.  These are like privately paid social workers.  For what it's worth,  they'll dig up all the info you need to find to get the help you need for your mom. There are a lot of resources, some free.  Those hospital/LTC give you the minimal. A paid GCM will come up with a lot more.

"Caring for a caregiver Hey everyone. Hoping that someone in here has some advice that I can pass along. At worst case it will hopefully feel good to vent. Throwaway account just in case. Think it's going to be long, so strap in.
&#x200B;
Years ago my SIL developed an illness that caused seizures and swelling in her spinal cord that put her in a wheel chair. She has no use of her legs and limited use of her hands and arms. She went through some therapy and was eventually able to move out on her own. She moved out of state and was involved with some great organizations that allowed her to work in an area she enjoyed and paid her enough to be able to continue to live on her own. 
&#x200B;
I don't know the whole story, but early last year her condition started to change/worsen. By mid summer she was in icu because she was having trouble breathing. Many options were put on the table, including physical therapy, certain medication rounds, and a few others I don't know about. It was said from the start that the breathing mask was a temporary solution because it can cause skin to break down around the mask area. So the options presented were to work toward getting off the breathing mask. After being presented with all of these options and then looking to good old google, SIL told the doctors that she wanted a trach put in instead of the other options. My inlaws strongly advised against the trach but ultimately SIL went that route. 
&#x200B;
I get that SIL is an adult and because her mental capacity has not been effected she's of sound mind to make her own medical decisions. Here's where the problems start. Because she has been classified as disabled she is still on my inlaws insurance. My inlaws have very good insurance thankfully that has covered most of the expenses that have been incurred in this whole ordeal. After deciding that she wanted the trach, SIL also informed my inlaws that because she will need full time care after the trach, she's moving back home. 
&#x200B;
My inlaws are very well off, to the point they live a comfortable life and don't have to worry about every penny they spend. But by no means are they wealthy. Because my SIL has decided to move home, they have incurred huge financial costs related to moving her in. The first thing they had to do was have the main floor bathroom in their home completely renovated to accommodate her large wheel chair. Total cost of this was around $30k to do everything needed done to make it work. Then they had to pay to have an industrial lift put in the garage that was able to handle the weight of her wheel chair, as well as have a platform put in for her to be able to get into the house. Now they are talking about the need to get a wheel chair accessible car because she is constantly going back and forth to dr appointments. Even after insurance helps, they are looking at another $50k out of pocket. All in all they are going to spending around $100k out of pocket just to be able to move her in. 
&#x200B;
Then as things progress we learn more. We knew sister required 24/7 care and monitoring. Very good insurance that my inlaws have cover something like 100 hours per week of care. Which means that since SIL decided she was moving home, not only have the inlaws had a huge financial burden to move her in, they are now her full time care giver at least 8 hours per day, every day of the week. Even longer stretches on the weekend while they are home. They even had a no show from a night nurse so my FIL had to take the 10pm-5am shift and then go into work. This means that once they get out of work they come home to work. They have no down time, no off time, no time to relax. They can't leave the house together at the same time, even to go out to dinner together.
&#x200B;
Now my inlaws have been empty nesters for about 3 years, and have really taken advantage of it. They have enjoyed going on dates, cruising around different areas in their car, and were able to get back into their favorite hobby of travelling in their newly purchased RV.  All of that is gone. Because this situation is still unfolding, I don't think it has fully sunk in yet, but I'm incredibly angry for them. A decision that they had no control over has cost them money and their freedom. My MIL had their annual vacation trips planned for the next 3 years and was excitedly planning for those. She can't go on those any more. They had talked about taking all the grandkids to Disney next summer. That's out the window. And the worst part of it, both my MIL and FIL have been counting down the days to their retirement as they both work incredibly stressful jobs. Before this whole thing with SIL happened, my FIL was talking about fast tracking retirement to this year. My MIL had a calendar with every marked with a countdown to when she could retire next year. And now both of them have said they will not be able to retire any time soon because of the financial burden of SIL moving home and needing to keep the higher more expensive insurance to care for SIL.
&#x200B;
Bottom line of everything is that my wife and I can already see that having SIL home is going to kill my inlaws. There are already medical issues that have been watched that are getting worse through this whole situation. 
&#x200B;
If you're still with me, you're a trooper and I appreciate it. What I don't know is what happens to people that don't have parents that have enough money to pay to accommodate them at home. I get that my father in law is trying to take care of his kid as best as he can, but I feel like there have to be other options out there. Some kind of care facilities or homes that would be great for SIL, and allow my inlaws to feel that they are giving her proper care without having to destroy their lives in the process. 
&#x200B;
I know it's a sensitive topic and one they may not be open to at first, but I would love to be able to give them some kind of options. We care for them, they are great people, and have earned the right to enjoy their success, and it's being ripped away from them and they haven't been able to prepare other options. What can they do? What is out there for them to be able to help? Any ideas or services you might know of would be greatly  appreciated. 
&#x200B;
Thank you! ","comment 1: Your SIL has no income and should qualify for supports that will modify her living space and the primary vehicle used for her transport.  Or a transport service could be used.  
Make sure that she has applied for all assistance she qualifies for and take advantage of all of it.  For example, if she gets SSI, she may qualify for food stamps.
As for the rest?  There are not a lot of solutions.  I'm so sorry.
comment 2: Thanks for the info.  I know they have looked into some things, but she seems to be in a weird limbo where there aren't government programs available to her. Because She was diagnosed after a certain age (can't remember what it is atm) she doesn't qualify for SSI and because she doesn't have 10 years in the workforce she doesn't qualify for disability assistance. I'm sure there are other things out there but I am just starting trying to figure out where to look. Thanks again! 
comment 3: I don't think your information about SSI is correct.  Please check it again, there are no age restrictions for diagnosis that I am aware of.  It's worth taking the time to explore, because so many services are tied to having it.  
comment 4: It may not have been SSI. There was some assistance program that I thought was that but must have been something else that she didn't qualify for. I'll dig into some SSI info. Thanks! 
comment 5: Best place to get info is directly from Social Security. try making an appointment!
comment 6: What your in-laws need are resources. It appears to me that they are in the mentality of ""we can afford this, we dont need outside assistance"" but the question becomes for how long. 
They're already feeling the financial burden of living with a disability, and I commend them for the steps they have taken to ensure their daughter can live as well as she can given her circumstances. 
Outside help is required to ease their burden, and throwing money at the issue is just going to make things more difficult down the line. 
I'd like to offer to look up some resources in their area, a zip code should be enough for me to work with. You can reply with it, or PM me and I'll find what I can with the info you've provided.
One bit of info I would give is always look for resources and assistance for anything regarding care. Don't just take the insurance recommendation, do some legwork of your own, and see if their suggestions are whats best for your situation.
What I would be looking for:


Paratransit. - if they live in a metropolitan area, odds are there is a disability program in their public transportation system. Paratransit operations that I know of have door-to-door service, wheelchair accessible vehicles among other things. 


Insurance. Its great that your in-laws have good insurance, but is it possible for her to get her own? Your state's health options may be able to help out, and may come with a social/case worker  that can assist in other ways. Multiple insurance policies can work together- you dont have to have only one.


assisted living there are organizations out there that may be able to help her get into a more assisted living community. She could have her independence but the assistance she needs when she needs it.


Theres a lot of research to do! I hope your in-laws are willing to let others help them. It may save their financial future.
comment 7: All good suggestions. Everyone in the family needs to be proactive in looking into options. Asking for advice in online forums like this is a great way to find ideas you might not think of on your own. 
That said, you may find you in-laws and/or you SIL unwilling to consider other options. Your in-laws DID agree to let her move back in, and paid for all the alterations to their home. Your SIL obviously decided that was where she wanted to be.  So you might meet some resistance. But knowing options available to her is a great idea. 
I have seen parents lose all their retirement savings and even go bankrupt trying to support their adult children, so I hope this doesn't happen to them.  
I wish all of you - the whole family - all the best.  
comment 8: Wow, that was quite the ride. I wish I had something constructive to tell you, it's a terrible situation for your in-laws. I don't see how your SIL will ever move out, or what options are available to her now. Your inlaws will care for her until they can't, then what? You might want to start checking for alternative care for the SIL sooner than later. The best thing you can do to help is give your in-laws some time if possible.  Other than that, feel free to rant anytime, we're here to listen. 
comment 9: Appreciate it! 
comment 10: Yes; what a ride. It sounds like you have a close-knit, loving support group throughout the family—a real blessing. Many hands make light(er) work. Maybe you could offer to spell them for a bit, something you may have thought of, so they can escape, decompress. If in-laws have, as it sounds, white collar jobs, they may well have access to an Employee Assistance Program. This can be a starting point for complex needs for professional help—referrals, directions to seek when they don't even know what they need. I'm wondering whether getting an attorney or estate planner involved, one who specializes in disability issues, might not be wise. Your inlaws will likely predecease their daughter/your SIL, and caring for her may speed up their need for asistance. It may not be soon, but the ""now what?""question will eventually rear its ugly head. Best wishes and virtual hugs.
comment 11: Thankfully my FIL has a very clear cut estate plan for when things do come up. Both inlaws are very wise with their money and have made it a goal for the kids to have nothing to fight over when they are gone because everything is pre planned. Thank you! 
comment 12: Also at some point we would like to be able to spell them for a bit but because the person ""on duty"" is technically a medical care person there are quite a few training programs that her parents had to go through to be able to qualify to be the person on duty. Eventually we would like to get that as well, but it was something like 30 hours of training needed to be able to help. 
comment 13: I know I'm late to this but if you're still needing advice,  seek a Geriatric care manager in the area.  These are like paid social workers who dig up all the info and resources in the particular community that pertains to the particular situation. There's a lot out there that could make your SIL's life and as a result your in-laws' much more bearable. Like someone else said,  your in-laws have to be open to receiving help though because it could be a very long ride.

"Memory clinic expectations... Hi, my mum is 73 and has had a memory clinic scheduled in 2 weeks time. She has become forgetful and thinks her neighbour is stealing her money sometimes and had a few episodes of being very upset.  I call with her most days if possible and have noticed same recurring question ( do I want tea, am I busy in work, how's the kids etc) then asks the same ones soon after.  She isn't sure on days of the week but I can understand if you don't have daily tasks it's easy to lose track.  She never really knew what year it was at best of times, she just loves in the here and now.
So what expectations should we have at this clinic ( in northern Ireland ).  Can they diagnose at this clinic? I hate explaining to doctor or social worker about her while she's present as she doesn't see that anything is wrong. ","comment 1: I’m in the US, so I can’t speak to how Ireland’s system will work. We did have the opportunity to speak privately with a social worker and the dr. You could call the clinic ahead of time and ask them what to expect. Or you could also write down your concerns and present the letter to the clinic ahead of the schedule and bring a copy to the meeting in case the first one is misplaced. 
I also tried to make corrections discretely during the meeting. For instance the dr asked if Mom made her own meals, and my mom said yes, when in reality, I made the meals and Mom reheated them in the microwave. So when Mom said yes to the dr, I shook my head no (behind mom’s view) and said that I brought over a lot of meals and Mom heats them up and also gets her own morning cereal. 
comment 2: I was forthright about my observations even though my mom was present - the examination and dx are too important not to be direct and as the interview went in it was clear my mom wasn’t a good historian and my input was valuable.
comment 3: Thanks for your views.  It is certainly an important interview but it's perhaps an idea to write a statement pre interview and let doctor assess her without too much input, only when necessary.  It's most important to be honest about everything while trying to stop mum feeling overwhelmed or feeling I'm against her.  I just want an honest determination so we can move forward.  My mum's mum and all her sisters unfortunately suffered so I hope to lessen my mum's anxiety with early intervention and a decent care package. 
comment 4: Hi Betty,

comment 5: That's very decent of you to pass me the information rikwilliams.  I'll get a read over it and perhaps ring. 
comment 6: No problems. i work in the Digital team at the Society, but the Helpline team exist to speak with people just like you. Best wishes. Rik. 
comment 7: i'm from canada, so ymmv. during the interview i had re: my grandmother, they asked me to explain things 'subtly', as in, using code words to explain things as she was being tested. or, as someone else said, using head gestures. if you talk to her often, which it seems like you do, you'll probably know best what she will/won't pick up on. but the social worker and/or doctor will probably remind you not to try and influence her answers, which is also really important!
good luck - i'm sure you'll be able to get her the help she needs, whatever that is. and remember to take care of yourself as well, i know the process is very exhausting.
comment 8: We take my MIL to a geriatric doctor, and with them we’ve gone through a few different methods of talking about her. From the beginning they’ve had us fill out our own paperwork while she does hers. Then they compare our answers and since the beginning my MIL will write that everything is fine, she feels great on every question. During the appointment, there’s a lot of head shaking behind her as the doctor asks her questions, and prompts from us to a more accurate answer. However, the last few appointments the doctor just says things to us directly like MIL isn’t in the room, including very negative things about MIL and she just nods and smiles and tries to pretend like she has a grasp on the conversation. It’s changed a lot as she’s gotten worse. As far as diagnosis they had her do a short (15 min) memory test and once that came back with poor results they had her do a long (1 hr) memory test and thats when they came back with Alzheimer’s. Though we sort of already knew by that point and it was just formalizing it.
comment 9: You HAVE to be candid.   I see family members struggle with being candid vs being ""kind"" and staying silent.  Believe me, your doctor does not have ESP.  Doctors are overwhlemed, over worked, and rushed.  So they don't have time to get at the symptoms from each and every angle.  Very few doctors are experts in dementia, and those who are not will not even know that you're holding back.  
&#x200B;
Further, you are not being kind with these omissions.  You're actually preventing the best care and a clear diagnosis.  You don't have to be rude and overly blunt.  But be as honest as possible about distressing symptoms.  Otherwise they don't get on the table and will not be addressed.  You're not the bad one, the disease, whatever it is, is that bad thing.

"Just became a caregiver, looking for some kind of alarm system My grandfather is extremely ill and I've moved in with them to help take care of him. He's fractured his hip from a fall, which makes him uncomfortable, so he likes to be moved a lot. This isn't so much of a problem during the day, but at night all the bedrooms are towards the back of the house and the sofa is in the living room (where he likes to move to) and it's very hard to hear him when we are asleep even with our doors open. Is there any kind of alert device that is very simple, maybe just one big button, that he could press and alarm us loud enough at night to know that he needs help?  
I'm completely new to caregiving but I don't want to leave him in a position where he is calling for us and I'm so sound asleep I can't hear him. I've heard most people use baby monitors, I'm just worried I'll either A. not hear him as I'm a very sound sleeper or B. The feedback will keep us awake. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.","comment 1: Smart Caregiver Two Call Buttons & Wireless Caregiver Pager https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0032FMSWS/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_hUXbCbY6HTSDF
This thing has saved my life and his. Very loud and worn around the neck and the pager can stay in your pocket or on a belt. Works everywhere around my house and yard. Allows me to stay active at home and not worry about him doing something and not being able to call me. 
Cheaper than most baby monitors. 
comment 2: THIS is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much.
comment 3: I used a baby monitor to listen for my wife (she was in a hospital bed downstairs, I was up in our bedroom). It never bothered me with any sort of feedback, and I woke up instantly when she called. Admittedly, I'm a light sleeper, so YMMV, but it's a good first step before springing for something more fancy/expensive.
comment 4: I appreciate it. I guess I'm just gonna have to try it.
comment 5: I care for my father with the wonderful assistance of Hospice. I realize Hospice may not be an option for your grandfather, but Hospice ordered a bed and chair alarm for him.  It’s called MultiPro Safety Alarm from the Skil-Care Association. It literally was just delivered so I can’t speak to the effectiveness yet or the cost as it was covered by insurance. It’s essentially a pad that has a pressure sensor and will alarm if he moves from it. Skil-care.com 
comment 6: Yeah we looked into hospice and unfortunately his needs are just too sporadic that he really needs someone here all day long. I will check out the alarm though.
comment 7: OP, sorry to hear his health has declined. I do want to thank your posting this question and keeping it up. It has helped me with deciding what to purchase so we can help out with my aunt as we care for her.
comment 8: He actually passed yesterday. He is at peace now though so I'm not so much upset. His quality of life was not great towards the end, so I'm glad he got his peace.
comment 9: My condolences. May your hearts heal soon, glad he is at peace.
comment 10: Whistle around his neck?
comment 11: Another option that might work for some situations and people is a desk bell like you might see at a hotel front desk. You don't need to pick it up to use, just hit it with a part of ones hand. You can buy them online. I think the loud pager might be better but sometimes it is nice to have two ways for a patient to contact a caregiver or have different options to consider.
comment 12: His health nosedived and he is on the home stretch of his journey now, so he is past the point of needing to contact us. I should have deleted the post honestly but it's just been hectic around here. I do appreciate it though.
comment 13: I am so sorry to hear that. You are so kind to have done all you could to help him. Not every grandchild or child would do that. I am sure your presence was a source of comfort to him. Hoping he and you get all the help and comfort you need at this time.
comment 14: Oh no I quit my job and moved in with them for it. 3-4 hours of sleep a night. For my family that's just normal. There is no chance that someone wouldn't have done this if I had not.

"Help with parent wishes vs medical advice My mother has lived alone with in-home help for several years. She was never diagnosed with any cognitive deficits. We have suspected, but she is particularly non-compliant with the advice of medical personnel. I live more than 700 miles away from her.
She recently had a fall that was very bad. She went septic and almost died. She was very incoherent when they found her. She made a recovery after several days in the ICU, running IV antibiotics through an intrajugular central line and transferred to a rehab facility to strengthen her up. She attempted to sign out AMA and was very non-compliant, but eventually we worked out an early discharge plan with home health services I arranged.
She was home about two days and began repeatedly falling. She sounded drunk when she talked. She was unable to walk and I had to carry her to the bathroom. She had cigarette burn marks all over the house and her clothes. She had been urinating on the couch and defecating in a trash can. She sounded drunk, but mostly made sense. I had to call EMS five times in 3 days to retrieve her from the floor. I made the 700 mile trip to retrieve her to bring her home with me.  The intent was to bring her home with me and get her stronger to come back to her home.
During the trip, she hallucinated frequently. Seeing little girls, thinking traffic lights were Christmas lights, seeing pizza restaurants that weren't there. She attempted to eat the power window buttons stating they were her pills. Instead of taking her to my home, I took her the hospital where I live immediately since this was definitely a change. She was asleep for nearly two days. She woke up still sounding drunk. Her lab work was good. Everything was good (acutely) and she was diagnosed with dementia. She was fairly calm, but continued to say she wanted to return to her single bedroom apartment. She was then transferred to rehab.
She became irate, called my fiance a bitch, me a piece of shit, and seems to think we tricked her. She stated we tricked her by telling her we were ""adopting a baby"" and we haven't even remotely done such a thing. She began calling all her friends back home (700 miles away). She then had an episode in which she believed that everyone was being murdered at the rehab facility, and become so impossible to contain, she was then sent a psychiatric hospital.
After a few days, she was diagnosed with dementia again. She refused to be discharged back to the rehab facility due to the supposed ""murders"". She hates me and my fiance at this point. The facility neurologist/psychiatrist thinks she needs 24 hour care.
She has been calling her friends and states the nurses are stealing medicines and abusing staff. Her friends believe her and are imploring me to sign her out of that place AMA. They say she is caged like an animal and that as her son I need to remove her immediately. Two people who are causing problems are her former home CNA and her caseworker. They have lodged complaints with the state, gotten ombudsmen involved with official complaints, etc. They state she has been functioning for years without my intervention and that I have overstepped and need to return her. Her family friends who begged me to come and help her because they were tired of getting her off the floor in the middle of the night are now telling me to basically sign her out AMA and return her home.
She apparently scored well on a memory exam, but the neurologist thinks that she needs 24 hour care due to delusions and hallucinations which seems reasonable to me. She definitely seems better to me now. I just know that my mom would not do well in a nursing home. Her friends are tellingme they will take care of her, as well as this caseworker and aide, who have seriously been troublemakers for me. However, these were the people taking care of her when this whole thing began.
So I guess my question is an ethical one: I think my mom would be very happy back at her home, but she has a very poor track record recently. I can't help but think that if she did well on a memory exam, and is just delusional maybe she could exist in her previous living situation?  I am currently on track to get guardianship and seek 24/7 care, but I'm racked with guilt over having to decide to put her in that environment. Are these friends and her old caseworkers delusional? Or am I just jumping to nursing home placement too soon. I did want her to live with me but I have small children and I am afraid her delusions and hallucinations place them at risk, especially at night.","comment 1: It is very,very common for elders to see a worsening of dementia-like symptoms after a bad illness (especially infections), and they sometimes recover completely.  Since her memory is now back to normal and utterly unimpaired, the rest of her symptoms might improve too.  When the troublemakers call, tell them that the doctors won't release her yet, but she's getting better and there's only these pesky hallucinations to get over, so please pray for her oh and has someone gone by mom's apartment to air it out, gather the mail, clean out the fridge, check for leaks, etcetcetc?  These tasks, such as praying and helping make the apartment ready, are far harder to do than harassing someone on the phone.  If they REALLY want to help, they can do those real things that REALLY need to be done.  And if they don't want to actually do those things, it'll at least shut them up. 
Additionally, talk to your local police.  Let them know where your mom is staying, show any documentation, names of who might call to make trouble, etc etc etc.  This will head the troublemakers, or your mom, off at the pass.  It will also be a reference for the police in your mom's home town, if something happens there.
comment 2: You should definitely seek a care facility for your mom. It will be lots stress managing emotions with  her dementia. Some people get aggressive too and with a child you should not risk it. Get others to take care of  her its a huge relief.
comment 3: Thanks for the reply. It is a difficult decision to do that to a loved one, exacerbated a hundred times when people in your life tell you you are doing the wrong thing. I’ve decided I am listening to doctors, psychologists, caseworkers, and lawyers now, not family friends.
comment 4: Yea, I had the same guilt with my mom. We to had ask social services and they suggested getting her involuntary committed to hospital. I couldn’t even schedule the day. My brother did it and my mom felt betrayed and said lots of hurtful things. She hated him for awhile but the memory issues plus constant visits helped her stop being angry. Dementia is so messed up, you can help a loved one by lying to them and they won’t remember and it’s ok later but at same time they are losing there former self.
comment 5: Obviously the people back home did not see her when she was in her worst state. That means they are using invalid information to base their complaints. They either need to come see her in person or shut up. You, as her soon to be guardian, have the final say. She cannot stay at your house, since you have small children. You should place her in a nursing home or memory care/psych care near you. That way you can visit, when you want to (give her a few weeks to adjust before you visit). Also, you do not need to visit everyday. I know this is an awful thing you are going through, but you are doing it to get your Mother the best help you can. Stay strong and calm, best of luck.
comment 6: 

An elder of mine took a nose dive mentally following a bout with a brush-with-death respiratory illness.  Basically went from what we all thought was mild dementia & not that much of a concern for living on their own to ""Oh hell no, they need care yesterday.""  That level they were at while sick prompted us to get them in a home. 
 Then, they rebounded close to mild dementia again for about 2 years before they reached that same more moderate-to-severe stage.


If she's not able to care for herself, it's more think of your self as the parent or the adult in the room.  Total role-reversal I know, but it sounds like she cannot evaluate her own situation.


Take care of yourself first.


If the current in-home care situation isn't working, it isn't working.  What's worked for many years may no longer work.  I had an elder couple that strived to stay at home until they passed.  One managed that.  The other wound up moving to assisted living a couple years before their death, realizing in-home care was getting too complicated.  


With the hallucinations she may have Lewy Body Dementia.  Just throwing that out there.  It presents differently than some of the other types and can have different medication indications.  


>Hallucinations—Visual hallucinations—seeing things that are not present—occur in up to 80 percent of people with LBD, often early on. They are typically realistic and detailed, such as images of children or animals. Nonvisual hallucinations, such as hearing or smelling things that are not present, are less common than visual ones but may also occur. Hallucinations that are not disruptive may not require treatment. However, if they are frightening or dangerous (for example, if the person attempts to fight a perceived intruder), then a doctor may prescribe medication. Source
comment 7: Thanks for a great reply. LBD has been mentioned. It also explains periods of semi-clarity with periods of an almost drunken stupor with word salad. It also explains the hallucinations as well. We plan on getting her into a dementia care unit, under the care of a neurologist, and then hope to move her back to a less restrictive living environment if her symptoms are adequately controlled or truly do improve.

"Disabled, aging mother can no longer care for herself I'm trying to figure out the best course of action my sister and I can take to help our mom. She is 67 years old and has been disabled (medical issues) for nearly 20 years. She has lupus, diabetes, kidney disease, heart problems, and is mentally ill (bipolar/likely BPD). She has lived on her own for the last 5 or so years but has gotten to a point where she can no longer care for herself, although she disagrees. My sister and I think she needs to move into an assisted living facility, as living with either one of us is not an option. My mom will fight tooth and nail before moving into assisted living, so my sister and I are trying to figure out where to go from here. Sister is local, and I live 2 states away. 
My mom lives alone in a section 8 subsidized apartment in Orange County, CA. She receives SSI disability and social security. After paying rent and utilities, she spends the rest of her funds on pot and cigarettes, leaving little to no money left over for groceries and other necessities. She has gotten to a point, mentally, where she can't keep track of doctors appointments, can't remember information that is relayed to her by the doctors, and can't/won't eat according to the diet her doctors have told her she needs to follow in order to keep her kidneys as healthy as possible. Recently she's been awoken at night with chest pains but refuses to call an ambulance, and can't follow, much less remember, most doctors orders in order to treat the various medical problems she faces. She also abuses her prescription pain medication (has for years). 
We think living alone is unsafe for her and would like to explore what options we have for getting her into an assisted living facility, which will likely be against her wishes. Should I seek a conservatorship? Can I do that while not living in the same state as my mom? Do I need to speak with a lawyer? We are overwhelmed and have no idea where to start. Any advice that can be given would be greatly appreciated!
Additional info that might be helpful:
She is on Medi-cal
She has an in-home support/caregiver type person who is allotted about 30 hours per week. She is supposed to come in to cook, clean, etc but does a very poor job, and my mom lets her take advantage of her. What little food she does cook for my mom, my mom will mostly give away to her neighbors. 
Financially, I am willing and able to pay for part of the cost of assisted living, so we wouldn't rely entirely on Medi-cal/Social security.
Thank you!","comment 1: I do not have details on a conservatorship, but I recently read an article in OC Register (Sept 23, 2018) about Probate and Conservatorship that you should read.
I personally have Power of Attorney for my mother established a few years ago and it gives me full power over her financial details. My sister is my mother's Health Care Proxy and she handles all the details of my mother's health with various doctors. If your mother is willing to go to an elder lawyer and sign these documents, it will help you tremendously. Use an elder law specialist.
My mother lives in an assisted living complex that also has independent living, which is what she thinks she is. Technically this is correct, as we are not paying extra for nursing assistance because my sister is able to attend to her once a week and prepare pill boxes and test blood. The city she lives in has limited nursing homes, which is where she will go if her physical limitations overtook the abilities of the nurses at the complex. There is also a special memory care unit where dementia patients are separated, but again if their physical needs went over a certain level they would be asked to leave to a nursing home.
What I'm saying is that your mom's living situation will depend on what's available in her location. You will have to research what is local and how they work, what they cost, etc. Be careful what you sign in terms of guaranteeing payment. I signed one for my mother as POA for paying the assisted living place with her money, but won't sign one for a nursing home which I know will require filing for Medicaid once her money is spent down. I don't want to guarantee personally paying $13,000/month at a nursing home!
First, though, she will need a nursing evaluation to determine her level of care needs, which I assume she has since she qualifies for home services. It probably needs to be updated. Can you replace the bad help?  Can you hire a nurse to come once a week and fill a pill box that separates pills into am/pm? If her level of care is requiring more then she might qualify for more help.
The easiest way to keep up with her doctor appointments is for you or your sister to take control. Speak to her doctors and get the necessary forms signed by your mom, hire elderly transport services for her appointments and remind her a lot!
At some point, we all have to go against our parents wishes to remain independent when it becomes clear they are a danger to themselves and/or others. I've had to do it with my dad and the time is coming when I will have to again for my mom. It's hard but ultimately it's the most loving thing to do.
Edit: the article in the first paragraph pertains to Orange County, CA
"
"Writing this for myself, mostly. I'm writing this for myself mostly, in hopes it may help to type it all out. 
It began with the usual, forgetting minor things. I didn't really think too much of it, figured it was just something that came along with old age. My dad had children much later in life than most. He's 77 while I'm 25, my sister being 23. Growing up I knew it'd be different to have an older father; I'd never thought about this though.
One of the first times I noticed a change was when we repairing a small hole in our shed. He kept insisting that I should I put way too many screws and nails on just the one small board.  This was unlike him as he had always worked on projects and was very smart about it. He'd been smart his whole life. He was voted 'Most Likely to Succeed' in his high school, was an allstar athlete in football, wrestling, track, he got a full scholarship to West Point Military Academy , was a Captain in the Air Force over in Vietnam, worked as an engineer for Honeywell, received a Masters in Business which led to being a well known, successful Financial Advisor, a Retirement Advisor ironically enough. He was also an avid Bridge player, a game I'll probably never be able to understand. It was unlike him to do something that didn't make any sense. 
About 2 years ago, after a few dings in his car, we realized it was time for him to hang up the keys, which he did, not quietly though. This was just after he finally retired. So without the ability to drive, and without a job to do, he spent all his time walking the dog in the woods/neighborhood and chatting with neighbors, still does I suppose.
He really doesn't know there's anything wrong with him, which is both a blessing and a curse. It would be deeply depressing for him if he were aware (he'd told me years ago that he'd shoot himself if he'd ever become a burden on us.) While at the same time, he is disagreeable and difficult when someone says he needs help or can no longer do something, thinking people are just being mean. 
He's always been one of the most pleasant people I've known, and everyone who talks about him says the same. He's always wanted to help out, he's always been a great dad. I accredit most of the way I am to him (and my mother of course), they'd let me do nearly everything I'd wanted, within reason. He taught me to drive at the age of 14, in the snow, with a trailer of atvs. Perhaps that wasn't the most responsible decision on his part, but I'm so thankful he gave me experiences like that. I like to believe having an older dad growing up, with that parenting style, allowed me to make mistakes and learn from them, and thankfully I survived all those small mistakes haha. He grew up in a small town in Northern Minnesota, hunting and growing his own food, working and earning everything. He was raised without his parents hovering over him and he raised me the same way. He was active as a scout leader back in my scouting days. We would go fishing, hiking, camping, hunting, 4-wheeling, together. He taught me my love for the great outdoors. I owe him a lot.
The thought that I won't have him around when I have kids kills me. He would have been a fantastic grandpa. He asks me if I'll be getting married and having kids soon. I wish I could be happy about those things. I wish I could have shared that with him. The only thing he loves more than a dog is a small child. Nothing puts a bigger smile on his face. He asks me to move back into their house so I can always be around, and that hurts too. 
My mom has been taking care of him all this time. I really don't know how she does it. She'd taken care of her mother for a few years (similar mental condition), until \~4 years ago. Just after that she was diagnosed with breast cancer (which has since been resolved-thank god). And now her life is supervising his every move. He doesn't appreciate the stuff she does, thinking she's just being an asshole making him do all these things. As if being a caregiver isn't difficult enough; it's a thankless job. My sister and I try to be around as often as possible, we used to come every second day. But now we can't leave her alone with him for that long, or else she'll completely lose it, understandably. My aunt is here helping now, but that's soon coming to an end. I'm thankfully a seasonal worker so I have time to be around, since winter is here.
Just recently my mom let us know she can't do it anymore, which I completely understand. It's astonishing that she's been able to stay sane this long. I wouldn't have blamed her for just running away. She's without a doubt the strongest  person I know, the person I respect the most. We're currently trying to figure out the whole nursing home situation, which will be an absolute shitshow. He's got the money for it, but at \~$8000/m won't last forever. Not that it's a money thing, but of course it's always partly a money thing. We figure that if we tell him he's going to be working there, helping out, then he'll be more open to being there; he talks about wanting a job so hopefully that'll help a little.
His whole life he's loved dogs, and his dog is everything to him. In the past few months, he's been very weird with the dog. Making sure she's in her kennel at certain times, saying things about how he needs to be sure people won't kill her and stuff like that (she's definitely in no danger and idk why he'd ever think such a thing). Something he used to do was both laughable, yet infuriating, he had a ritual that he had to give the dog one piece of cut carrot every night. He would cut up an entire carrot, take just one piece for the dog, then put the rest in a cup in the fridge, and there would be hell to pay if you moved the cup. He said that if she didn't get the carrot, she would die. You can't try to find logic in any of it, because there is none. Just yesterday he said he was going to go outside to look for ""the other dog,"" thinking we had more than one; that was a new one. We just roll with it, no sense it telling him he's wrong, that'll only cause more confusion. Taking him to the home, without his dog, is going to be horrible.
I'd usually been able to decipher what he's talking about, he's usually pretty close with things, as in if he's talking about the cat, he'll say dog. He once referred to the cat as our little chicken, we smile about that one. But we're having a harder and harder time figuring out what he's talking about. The time for meaningful conversation is essentially over, which of course crushes us. You just have to smile and agree.
I keep telling myself life always seems to work itself out, and I'm confident things will get better, they always do. And I do believe that. But holy shit, it's all so so terrible. I think I'm handling it as well as I can be. Some days are harder than others. I finally cried about it after reading that other post on here today. 
Whatever the afterlife is, whether it exists or be it nothing at all, it'll be better than this, for him.
Really makes you wonder what to hope for. 
To anyone reading this, take the time to ask your parents/partners/etc anything you want to know, say what you want to say while there's still time for them to understand. You don't want to have those regrets, really.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the bummer.
&#x200B;","comment 1: Your dad reminds me of my dad. Vietnam vet, salt of the earth kinda guy. It’s so hard going through this. If you ever need an understanding ear, hit me up. You are doing good, don’t forget that. 
comment 2: I’m so sorry you have to go through this, I have been taking care of my grandmother with dementia for 4 years now and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.  I’m thankful she’s not my parent because it would crush me, so I can only imagine what it feels like to lose someone so special.
Please know that you taking an active role means so much to your family and it will make all of you stronger no matter what.  My family has fallen apart over this and I have a lot of resentment for being the granddaughter taking care of the grandmother rather than her own children, and receiving criticism. 
There is no easy way to cope with it, I find humor in it and sometimes I’m great with her and others days, I don’t care if I make her cry because I’m so frustrated and tired of the weird shit she says and I’m 32 with not nearly enough experience for this. 
Her stories are absolutely crazy and I could relate to A LOT of what you said.
Your family being together and helping one another with this is the most amazing thing you can ask for, and when the time comes to move him somewhere that he can have the care he needs, it won’t be nearly as difficult as a family torn. 
I genuinely hope the best for you and your family during all of this. 
comment 3: I am so sorry for what you’re going through.  If you don’t mind my asking, how will you handle taking him to the nursing home?  Might he figure it out and just leave?  Will you break it to him that this is where he lives now?  I’m asking because I’m anticipating the same thing with my mom in the near future, just wondering how others gear up for it.  This stuff is so hard.
comment 4: Sorry for getting back to you so late. We're moving him into the memory care facility on Tuesday. Our plan is to take him to a walking track (which we frequently do) then stop at the home on our way back. Our best plan is to tell him he has to stay there as it's ""camp"" or something. Might try to tell him the house is getting worked on and he has to stay there for awhile. It's going to be a shitshow and we all know that won't go over well. We're also going to tell him he works there and has to help out, as he's always loved being helpful and maybe that'll be something he'd accept. 
He won't be able to just up and leave when he gets upset. Doors to the outside are kept locked. The way the place wants us to do it is to drop him off and just let them do their thing. We're not supposed to come back to visit for at least 10 days. It's a really nice($10k/month..) place so they have a lot of good methods to help people adapt(as well as possible) to the new living situation. It's going to be a shitshow but that's just the way it is. 
Sorry to hear about your mom. Idk what her situation is but if possible try to maybe talk to her about it long before it gets bad to the point you can't effectively communicate with her. 
comment 5: OP, I’m so sorry that your family is going through this.

"Advice on moving from home to care home. I''m wondering if people out there in redditland can provide some experience and advice on the transition of loved ones from private home to nursing / care home.
My mother-in-law has been suffering from a form of dementia (tests are on going) for quite a few years.  She had been living alone since her husband died some 5 years ago and the disease has ever so slowly eating away at her independence and faculties.  A year ago my wife & I moved her from her home in Ireland into a small house a few streets away from us (in England) so that we could be on-hand to provide company, assistance and care.  Over the last 12 months those three things have changed in order of significance.  We have nurses & companions visiting two times a day to administer meds, food & company and we visit in the evenings after work to walk the dog, stock the fridge, talk and provide evening meal.  At the weekends we can devote much more time and do shopping trips and family meals.
It is strange and stressful as someone becomes mentally younger as they get older.  The loss of language and understanding of fundamentals of life such as time and functions of things like cookers, TV remotes, telephones, showers, dog bowls..   
Yesterday I did a small shop to re-stock the fridge and set about fixing a non responsive TV (usually a two second job!). I said ""how about a cup of tea?"" and asked if the dog had been fed...  Simple questions but what a disaster!
Last week she could have easily fed the dog but not now. 
She: (coming into the living room holding some gubbins from the bin) ""Is this the thing?"" 
Me: ""No, that's not it"" (it is old Pasta parcels taken out of the bin where I put it a few days ago). ""Let me show you where the dog food is.  That needs to go in the bin - it is not good for the dog""  
She: ""Oh"".  The pasta shapes fall out of the packaging and all over the floor.  The dog leaps onto them and starts eating them faster than I can pick them up.  They are mouldy and nasty!   I salvage what I can and drop them into the bin again.
She: ""There's no...  I don't...  Where's food?""
Me: ""Here's the dog bowl and his food"" (pointing to dog bowl & food container on kitchen floor next to dog bed.)
She: ""Oh, but it is empty""
Me: ""No, it is filled with food"" (I open the lid & show the food)
She: ""Oh""
I know she can do this - I've seen it many times.  I go back to the living room to work on the TV and return to the kitchen after a short while to see the food in the bowl and the dog eating it.   Phew.   I get back to the TV.  Now, normally the TV is not functioning because of socket being turned off or some such simplicity but not this time.  We have sound and channel change but no visuals.  I get stuck into this and after checking cables, batteries, sockets, input device and running through a few re-boots I determine that the backlight has gone and the TV is done-for.  Dang.  The TV is vital companion for the periods where there is no carer.
I go into the kitchen to explain that the TV is broken and that I'll have to pop out and get a new one but I arrive to see a disaster zone in the kitchen.  She has taken out one of the ready meals I had bought (a rather large Fish Pie) and hand-scooped and squished the contents into the dog bowl.  There is food all over the place!  It's all over the worktops, on her hands and up to her elbows, on her face...  She is busy trying to wipe everything clean with a kitchen cloth but basically speeding fish pie everywhere.   I gasp and let out an involuntary cry of dismay.
She: (angrily): ""What's wrong?""
Me: (deadpan) ""Ah, oh, er.. no.  Erm, OK.""
She: (very angrily) ""I'm giving him his dinner.  There is no dog food!""
Me: (in dismay).  ""But there is! Here it is (shows dog food)""
She: ""No, that is empty so I've fed him this and now I'm cleaning""
Me: ""Right, OK""
Meanwhile the dog is getting stuck into a massive pile of fish pie.  She continues to wipe and wash things.  I check the fridge and see that in fact the Fish Pie is not the only foodstuff that has been opened.  There is Prawn Curry too.  So the dog has had crusty pasta, dog food, fish pie and some prawn curry in the space of an hour.  This is going to have an impact...
So, things have rapidly changed over the last few months, weeks and days.  Her behaviour has become increasingly irrational and we have definitely reached the point where a home with other residents and 24 hour nursing has to happen.  The only alternative is for one of us to give up work to become full-time carers or get a live-in carer but what she really needs is company and a safe environment - not being closeted up in her own home.  Not that she will see it that way.  I foresee tantrums and difficulty.
As if by magic our preferred nursing home (nicest, friendliest & they take pets!) advised a few days ago that our time on the waiting list is over and we can have a room next week.  We have said ""Yes"" and will be moving her on on Monday.  We know this will be a huge stressful event and are mulling over how we should announce it and perform it...  Any experiences good / bad and advice would be gratefully received.    Apologies for the diatribe - I couldn't stop it!

Summary: Dementia getting worse.  What are the Do's and Don'ts of transferring to a specialist care home?","comment 1: You're doing the right thing.  Don't tell her ahead of time.  Dementia patients don't remember the details (or generalities) of discussions, but they do remember emotions.  Don't get her upset for no benefit.
comment 2: Thanks.   We've decided not to tell her until the day of the move and are going to start preparing over the weekend to make the room as familiar as possible.
comment 3: Maybe a favorite chair, lots of pictures on the wall, we have residents that have a wipe board or a calendar and write down when family saw them and when they will be back next so the hcw can show them if they ask where everyone is. Favorite dry foods can be kept for them, a lot of my residents have ginger ale in the fridge and cookies. Paid companions are great they will take your loved one out to get their hair or nails done or out for lunch because the hcw on a unit well be looking after 6 to 9 other people and won't have a lot of time to socialize with the resident. 
comment 4: Thanks for the reply.  Unfortunately her favourite chair is in fact a rather large (and lovely) sofa which will be too small for the room.  We do have a familiar chair and cabinet and plenty of pictures and bits and bobs to bring...   A family album of pictures is a good idea - we'll put something together an try that as a distraction.  She always hated photos (of herself) but I think she might not remember that any more.  We have got a whiteboard for the carers and us to write on - we were hoping that she could read it to understand what is happening each day but sadly her concept of time is shot and reading comprehension is low.  Still, its a good call to bring that too.
comment 5: Something else we did was to take Dad over for lunch a couple of times so going there wasn't strange or unfamiliar.  I'm sorry you are going through this.  All of us here know how soul-killing this process can be.  Take care of yourselves and carve out time to have fun.  It's important. 
comment 6: Wonderful that you got a space to take her. There is no easy way to do it. Think of all the things you did when you sent your kid to school for the first time. One constructive thing you can do is to try to make the new place smell a bit like the old place. Bring in whatever perfumes cleaning products, room sent Etc that she used it home. I wonder if they have a room scent called stinky fish dog.? Don't try to think of everything at once , You can always bring different things over later. When I moved my uncle, and he would start complaining about it, I just kept telling him this was the what the doctors said to do. I am sure the staff will have lots of tricks to help you also
comment 7: Stinky fish dog!  Yes, scent is a really good idea.  We'll add perfume to the list of things to bring when setting up the room so that it can have a familiar odour.   I was comparing to to first day at school too... I think there are a lot of similarities as she becomes mentally younger.
comment 8: We told my dad that we had to do repairs on his home and he had to move out until they were completed.  We furnished his room as much as at home as possible. He always asked about going home and would become extremely agitated if we told him it was impossible, so we learned to let him believe that going home someday was a possibility even though it wasn't.  As you've seen, reasoning with them is impossible, they live in an alternate reality.
comment 9: Thanks.  We wondered about this too.  The roof needs repairing or some such...  We will probably use this as an approach until she becomes calm or forgets.   The trick, I think, is for us to make the room as familiar as possible.  Transition day is all about a house move but concentrated.
comment 10: I'll share this story again as maybe it'll help you. The day we took MIL to the long term memory care unit, she would not go. My husband and BIL called me to come over and help as she was being stubborn and argumentative and even violent in her resistance. When I got there she was covered in her own excrement, wearing her underwear, and yelling/screaming/punching back at her boys. I redirected her via distraction. I got her dressed and into the car and by then she'd completely forgotten where we were going, or so it seemed. As we drove she suddenly got it in her head we were taking her out for lunch. (We did not tell her we were taking her to lunch). She got all excited about it and chattered away for the 30 minute drive. 
We got to the home and she still thought we were going there for lunch and she was still upbeat. Hubby went in ahead to let them know we were there (weren't sure we were at the right building) leaving me with MIL in the car for a few minutes. 
It was at that time that MIL got completely lucid, and told me that she knew this was the memory care unit. And she told me, ""Please, I am going to object, fight, yell scream.... but don't let the boys falter. I know I need to be here. It's become really scary to be at home alone. My memory is just not that good anymore."" She made me promise over and over again. 
Then hubby came back, and we got her out of the car, and by the time we entered the unit, she wasn't lucid and yes she fought, yelled, screamed. 
But I kept my word. The brothers didn't believe me but it really did happen. 
She wound up in that home for about 5 years, we visited her frequently, until she passed from cancer. Before the cancer she was safe, sound, healthy and well cared for, beyond what we could provide. 
I should also add she had a dog she loved. That winter before admittance, her memory was so bad, she let the dog out to pee in a snowstorm. The dog was found days later frozen to death. That was one of the turning points when we realized it was time. In later years she didn't remember her beloved dog at all, even though we shared pictures. 
comment 11: Wow.  Thanks for the great reply.   We experience the same lucid and non-lucid moments...   I think for us we are hoping that she won't be that lucid so that there will be less fighting against the move.
comment 12: Set up her new room prior to bring her.  We had one adult take mom to visit at their home while we worked on moving stuff out of mom's house and into her new place.  We got the place all set up nicely with her own bed, lazy boy chair, small table & chairs.  And pictures hung on the wall.  The home may have a list to help you remember all the things you should bring (ie. sheets, toothbrush, etc).  Having the room set up ahead of time allows her to come into a peaceful environment rather than being in the middle of a chaotic move.
comment 13: Thanks.  This is the approach we will take. !  We are off to the home shortly to assess the room and then start preparing the list of things and how to do it.  You're right - we should ask the home for a list and their best practice for this kind of thing.  
comment 14: I'm going through this right now, too. It's so difficult. He has been living in an independent housing where they provide one meal a day. He has somewhat of a companion, but recently she's been declining and so has he. So, my family and I think it's time to move him into a place with much more care than he has now. Even though it's going to be hard. It's taken a toll on me big time. 
comment 15: Update:  We moved Mother into the care home yesterday.  It was not easy.  She was furious. Livid. I prepared the room ahead of arrival and we managed to cajole her into the car and then out of the car and into the entrance and then she refused to budge.   She did a sit-in on the porch but after coaching and coaxing and ultimately ignoring her she walked in by herself.
We knew that if we had given her forewarning it would have made the move much, much more difficult.  We have a difficult week out two ahead but fingers crossed she will calm down and ultimately see that the community she is part of will be much healthier, safer and happier than being alone with this dreadful wasting disease (that she refuses to accept is happening).

"Automatic lights etc I just wanted to share that I bought an Echo for my mom and some smart lights and it’s really great for her. She is having a harder time getting around and this makes things a little bit easier. I put her favorite songs on an Amazon playlist and she can just ask Alexa (she was trying Alexis for awhile like that SNL skit, lol) when she is in the mood to her all her old songs. ","comment 1: I wish I could get my parents to use an echo but the concept is so far beyond them it is impossible.

"How to handle my grandfathers anger? I was raised by my grandparents since the day I was born, my grandmother passed away from complications from her diabetes and seizures in July. My grandfather (78 in March) was with her for 56 years and took care of her for all those years of bad heath which started before I was even born and has since felt a hole in his life. One night two months ago he started saying he was seeing explosions and hurricanes outside and was hearing my grandmother talk to him. He also couldn’t remember where he was at though he was sitting right in his dining room of the house he has lived in for 40 some years, he never had a problem besides the usual misremembering names but knowing who you were. We took him to the VA of course and they diagnosed him with Dementia. 
He is now living with his nephew’s wife because he grew up with her and he needs a woman his age around to “take care of” and her take care of him (meals, meds, cleaning) just like him and my grandmother lived. He also said it was too painful to live in his house with out his wife there with him. It was all going well and the meds seemed to calm him down and he was on the right track but lately he has such bad anger. Everyone is a piece of * or a motherf** and he threatens our lives and his life and hits (with his fists or with objects) and grabs hair. 
He has such a good moments most of the time but at night or randomly through out the day he’ll get so violent and we don’t know how to handle it. We don’t know if it’s time to find him assisted living, which he’ll fight on that, or if he just needs us to do something we just don’t know because this is all of our first time dealing with this awful disease. 
I’m only 19 and my sister is 24 and we are all he has really because everyone else is too busy with their lives to take care of him and talk to him everyday. His late nephews wife is getting tired of being verbally abused so she is thinking about sending him home to us but I just don’t know how two young girls will be able to take care of a strong 78 year old war vet with random violent tendencies but we also feel like it is wrong to just give him to a home because our grandmother told us to take care of him. I know she didn’t know that this would happen but I feel like I’d be letting her down if I gave up so fast.
I’m sorry this is so long but we just don’t know what to do and need advice or tips on how to handle this situation.
TLDR cause I know this is long: 78 strong grandfather with recently diagnosed dementia randomly gets very violent verbally and physically, including threats of murder and suicide and we don’t know how to calm him down or handle it at all ","comment 1: Your Grandfather absolutely should not be with your young children. His reasoning is gone. He wouldn’t mean to hurt a child, but he might, given the opportunity. Or he might not. The unpredictability means you can’t take the chance. 
A nursing home has training on dealing with violent patients. They will also get his medicine straightened out, hopefully to stop the attacks. As far as promising your Grandmother that you would take good care of him - you are not able to the way he is now.  Let those who do this for a living help him.
comment 2: I would say it is probably time to look at assisted living. I work in a care home specialised in dementia and quite often when people are becoming aggressive it's best to just leave them be. I'm a stubborn person and hate to lose arguments, but what I've learnt with dementia is you will never win the argument. 
Plus, if his aggression becomes worse its draining. And it's hard caring for a loved one who then lashes out randomly. It stops you seeing him as him but rather as this person with dementia, it will make it harder for people to cherish the memories they have of him before his dementia. 
Medication can sometimes help to keep people settled, possibly look into that? 
Distraction can sometimes work, a cup of tea, watching a nice film, getting out photo albums but sometimes it doesn't. What works one day to help calm him possibly won't work the next day. Dementia is a day by day learning curve as I'm sure you know! 
Obviously you want to stick to your grandmas wishes, but by putting him in a home doesn't mean you're not looking after him. You want to look after him, but is it in yours and his best interests? You can still visit, where I work families are allowed to decorate the rooms, bring in old furniture. 
Threats of murder and suicide are common with dementia but are also still to be taken seriously. 
Thinking of you and your family, this is such a hard situation to be in. 
comment 3: Thank you so much for so much advice, it’s so much to consider and I’ve of course gotta go over all this with me sister but I think a nice home would be the best because we have small children under 3 living here and I wouldn’t want anything to happen to them and they love their pap and I just don’t think it’s right for them to see him like that 
comment 4: Currently dealing with this with my grandmother. She isn't violent physically or doling out threats, her words are more hurtful than violent. She has had really bad episodes in which she just won't calm down. Certain factors meant that we all decided to have her live in assisted living, and they have dealt with the episodic outburst. The doctors have adjusted her medication which has helped but one contained sedatives. So, while she was calm, she now had her eyes closed a majority of the time. They adjusted the medication again which now allows her to keep her eyes open.
comment 5: I hate that the sedatives they are giving him are just putting him asleep for most of the day because even though he has dementia and is violent  that’s still no way to live, I’ll bring it up with the doctors if there are other medication options that will calm him but not just put him asleep for hours. Thank you so much and I’m sorry we have this in common, I know it doesn’t get better exactly but I hope things start looking up for you and your family <3

"Frontotemporal Dementia Journey Hi everyone.  I'm 36 years old and smack dab in the middle of the the biggest challenge of my life.  In 2013 my brother passed away from an undiagnosed enlarged heart.  We all took the loss hard but Dad (age 63) really struggled to cope.  I knew from the moment that we found my brother deceased that something broke in him that day.  Fast forward to 2015.  Dad's behavior progressively became more erratic, violent, and lacked any sort of empathy for his actions.  His wife (my mom) left him after 43 years of marriage due to his behaviors and he often reportedly lacked insight into how any of his behaviors may have contributed to the separation.  I always thought that he behaved in a narcissistic manner and just chopped up his lack of insight to his narcissistic personality.  In 2016 Dad was arrested for the first time in his life for showing up to a football game intoxicated.  He was put on Diversion and as part of his punishment, he was required to complete a mental health exam.  Upon completion of the exam, the psychologist recommended that Dad complete a physical exam and a cat scan.  In 2016 a scan of his brain was done and sure enough....Frontotemporal Dementia and an Alzheimer's diagnosis.  
After meeting with his newly acquired Neurologist, Dad (age 63) was demonstrating symptoms associated with Frontotemporal Dementia, Behavioral Variant type AND Alzheimer's.  So not only were his days a major struggle behaviorally, but every day is a new day and he doesn't have any recollection of the previous day.
At first I was unsure about his diagnosis but the more I learned about the disease and observed his behavior on a daily basis, the more it was evident that the Neurologist was spot on.  
Now that mom has left him and my sibling is no longer living, I am his only family and sole support system/caretaker.  To add a wrinkle to the story, his mother (age 90) is still living and was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's as well.  Her symptoms progressed rapidly and due to Dad not being cognitively able to manage her or support her, I became her POA and recently moved her into an assisted living facility.  
Dad lives in Grandma's house and he even still drives.  Most people gasp when I tell them about him driving but part of his FTD is routine and he drives the same routes every day (40-80 miles per day), to the same 5 spots in town, over and over and over again.  He eats the same food each day, doesn't attempt to cook at home, and I track his every move through GPS software.  I ride with him weekly to monitor his speed, distance, decision-making, etc.  He's still an excellent driver....UNLESS there is a distraction such as a ball or tangible item that may seem misplaced on the side of the road.  He stops and picks these items up every time and that worries me.  I'm trying to promote his independence as much as possible knowing that there is no turning back once the keys are lost but I also don't know at what point that decision should be made.
So here I sit....A 36 year old male, who owns and operates 5 businesses, POA and ultimate caregiver to Dad and Grandma with progressing Dementia/Alzheimer's, and I have a wife of 13 years and 3 children...ages 8, 5, 4.  I'm trying to balance everything but undoubtedly this caretaking role is taking its toll on my mental and physical health, my marriage, my ability to be the best parent possible,  and my effectiveness as a business owner.  I'm in the acceptance phase of this process.  I know it's going to get worse and not get better.  But I feel like I am on my own island here and I could use some advice, direction, resources from people that have been in a similar situation.  
I'm open to any questions, feedback, suggestions, or input as to how I can continue to navigate this without sacrificing everything.  Thank you in advance.
Brian","comment 1: Unfortunately you are going to sacrifice something.  This disease is worse on the care takers than the afflicted.  Easiest thing would be pitting him in an assisted living or hire home care.   Something is going to fail otherwise. I find my job is taking the toll then my marriage (lack of one on one time).  There is adult day care too. 
My father has dementia and he refuses to do adult day care and he won’t do what is best for him because he thinks he is fine.  He can’t drive any longer, he’s starting to get lost, he doesn’t remember how to use an ATM. At this point I am stuck what to do as he doesn’t have enough resources  to pay for assisted living and we don’t have enough to supplement it. We are waiting in medicaid. 
comment 2: Where are you located? I work for an agency currently part time, let me ask if they know of any emergency help.
comment 3: I am located in a suburb of Omaha, Nebraska.  I'm learning that there are not many FTD resources in this area and I am thinking about getting involved and changing that.
&#x200B;
comment 4: Thank you so much.  I very much appreciate your feedback and I am sorry to hear about your Dad.
comment 5: No worries. We are here to help each other. It’s a horrible disease. It takes a toll.  All we can do is try to be patient and do what we can.  
comment 6: I think the narcissistic behavior should be mentioned more when speaking about symptoms of dementia, especially the FTD. In our case, my father is a retired neurosurgeon so he had that element of arrogance (you want confidence in a surgeon!) But note try telling him he has dementia. Here's a brain surgeon!  He knows better.
 My poor mother's health rapidly declined in her final two years and she passed away at age 71 the year. Everyday there was something about his health that had to be addressed. To be fair he's got severe arthritis and has had almost 10 surgeries for ankles, neck, back and replacement hips.
But he also is very OCD and knows so much that the slightest sniffle had to be addressed immediately.  Calling and bugging his doctor friends got ridiculous and embarrassing. 
My sisters blame my father for my mother's death bc he was so selfish. Mom couldn't leave him alone for the last two years of her life. She did tell me before she died that she felt guilty bc she didn't recognize the dementia earlier. We thought he was at just being a selfish asshole. 
He wasted a lot of his savings, but we are still able to afford in home care. For now. His dementia seems to be slowly progressing and his family lived well into their 80's. I can't even fathom trying to address moving him into a home eventually, but we are lucky that a memory care assisted living center is being built close to his home. 
He's gotten sweeter in the last few years, but still doesn't get that he has it and occasionally tries to override decisions bc he's a doctor. 
We recently had to put vitamin C's in an accessible cupboard for him that resemble his pain pills bc he was insistent that he could self medicate. He goes to that cabinet at least ten times a day. The doctor says it just goes straight through him and is luckily safe. That was a very difficult aspect of his care bc he'd forget we'd given it to him and argue about it. 
I'm actually surprised at how much he has willingly given up. Driving for at least four years. Still had to hide car keys though bc he'd try and sneak off to the liquor store, but other than that, he's dialed back a bit on the narcissism. 
It should've been a huge flag to us though. 
I hope you reach out to his friends.  We've found that people will come and take him to movies or out for meals when we contact them and it makes him so happy.  Even friends he hadn't been close to before this all started. 
Good luck and check back here occasionally. It's not a hugely busy sub but there is support here and some good ideas for care.
Stay strong. I wish you well. 
comment 7: Good idea about reaching out to his friends! My patient's frat brothers from decades ago still come around and visit all the time.
comment 8: That's awesome!
comment 9: Thank you so much.  I have reached out to his friends and they have been great despite them feeling quite uncomfortable with what to say, what not to say, etc.  
comment 10: They get over the nervousness the more they come around. 
I also should've mentioned leaning on your own friends also. My best friend is in town for the holidays and texted me to ask when would be a good time to swing by so she could see him knowing he's so lonely. (I live out of state)
I have great friends. I'm sure you do as well. And they know you're struggling.  But if not, they'll be glad to know why and want to help.  
Good luck and remember to take deep breaths. They don't get enough credit. 
comment 11: I'm not even really sure where to start. I have been caring for a man with rapid-onset FTD for the past year and a half. I actually have a decent amount of experience, training and knowledge working with dementia and Alzheimer's patients but hadn't heard of FTD until I started with this patient. This by far has been one of the most gutwrenching, devestating jobs I've ever had and I have a lot of patience for people especially with neurological diseases. But this is an entirely different beast. I've told my friends and family many times, this disease just keeps finding new ways to break my heart.
My boss (his 44 year old son) and I have literally just sat and cried so many times before (tearing up thinking about that). He's somewhat in a similar position as you. Very little family input so all of the responsibility, including taking over his father's business, falls on his shoulders.  He actually does have an older brother but he lives almost 4 hours away and it seems ""can't be bothered to help."" I won't go into a tangent that I could about him.
Anyway, not sure I have a lot of advice. But I would preach self-care for sure. As caregivers that is shoved down our throats because there is a HUGE chance of burnout. Enlist help, if not from family, then see what his insurance covers. Look into respite care.  There's actually a lot of resources and support out there. And I'm happy to talk and help if possible. Hang in there. 
comment 12: Thank you so much.  I spend 50% of my day managing Dad, another 20% of my day with my grandmother with Alz, and I also own and operate my own business.  With this routine, there isn't much time to spend focusing on my business or my wonderful wife and 3 young children.  I appreciate the support.
comment 13: I told my boss about you and he said he'd be willing to talk to you if you'd like. He is 44  and primary caregiver of his 75 y/o father with FTD.
comment 14: That's an amazing offer.  Thank you so much!
comment 15: Of course. Just let me know. You definitely have support. :)
comment 16: You need help. You are in a situation that you can't handle alone. 
My Mom (94) began showing signs of dementia at age 85. She is in her final stages of dementia. She is currently in the memory care unit at a nursing home. She is receiving excellent care there. She is no longer lucid, and is unable to care for herself at all. 
Here are some things that worked for my sister and me. I encourage you to do likewise: 
1) I contacted a local Alzheimer's support group. I went to several meetings and found out about local resources for help. 
2) I went to a nursing home with a memory facility, and spoke to some nurses there. They helped me and informed me of resources available for help. 
3) My sister and I drew up all of the legal documents for my mom that are needed for eldercare and end-of-life situations. In my state (Texas), there are five or six:  


a will, listing my sister and me as co-executors


a legal power of attorney, allowing us to make legal decisions on Mom's behalf; 


a medical power of attorney, allowing us to make medical decisions on Mom's behalf; 


a HIPPA form, allowing doctors to inform us as to Mom's medical condition and test results; 


a do-not-resuscitate form (DNR, also called Physician's directive), informing medical  personnel what to do in case Mom cannot be resuscitated; 


Additionally, there is a ""Guardianship in case of incapacitation"" form, which makes the children legally responsible for the elderly parent. We decided not to execute this document, because it would make us responsible for all Mom's actions, such as, if she had an accident and hurt someone, we could be held liable. We decided that the Power of Attorney and Medical Power of Attorney gave us the authority that we need, so we decided not to do the guardianship form. It seemed that the downside outweighed any advantages.
We had all these documents drawn up by a lawyer, and we met with a mobile notary and had Mom sign them all, while she still had cognitive ability to do so. 
Ensure that you have multiple signed, notary-stamped originals of all documents. We executed 3 signed copies of each form. Some government agencies will not accept photocopies, they require an original document. 
4) During all of our searching for financial aid and resources, we found that there was a special program available to the elderly surviving veterans and spouses. My father was in WWII for three months, but that qualified my Mom for $1,100 / month assistance benefit. I applied for it and was turned down. Then I found a specialist in applying for military aid, and he reworded my application and re-submitted it and it was approved. 
This is the beauty of networking with support groups and nursing homes. They can help discover assistance programs that you never knew about. 
5) We became co-signers on Mom's bank accounts. This has helped in handling her financial matters. We also tracked down all of her insurance and other accounts, and ensured that her Medicare supplemental was adequate and up-to-date. We found all of her bank accounts, and consolidated it all to one account. 
6) Do not give your father any money. If you do, then the money you give him may be determined to be ""income,"" and he may be turned down for charity or assistance later on because of the ""income"" you have given him. He needs to completely deplete his own financial resources, then apply for charity or assistance, then, after that, if money is still needed, you can help him out. 
7) In the earlier stages of her decline, we hired a home senior care person to come in and sit with Mom several hours a day, and to cook meals for her at her home (www.homeinstead.com). They were wonderful. Eventually Mom declined to a point that she needed 24/7 care, so we put her into the nursing home. 
If your father is already showing substantial decline at age 63, you might look into both Social Security Retirement benefits and also Social Security disability benefits. 
Hope this helps! Message me separately if you need to. 
comment 17: Wonderful feedback.  Thank you so much.  I am his POA and we have adjusted his trust/living will.  Banks are on board.  Dad has BOTH FTD and Alzheimer's so we are trying to reach out to the local resources to find support for both diseases.  
comment 18: Hi, I wanted to let you know you're not alone. FTD especially the behavioral variant is extremely tough.  For now, there are quite a few resources about legit support groups, https://www.theaftd.org/living-with-ftd/support-for-care-partners/
Aftd is a great resource.  Support groups are more helpful than you think. And to be very honest,  I doubt your dad will have the capacity to drive much longer or take care of himself.  Please start researching care facilities or care givers to help. 
My husband has had PPA for about 3 years and is starting to demonstrate behavioral symptoms which can happen between the two variants.  He can no longer care for himself. 
This will be hard but hang in there.  You're not alone and a social worker and a psychiatrist may be your best bet 
comment 19: Thank you so much.  AFTD has 0 resources in Omaha, NE.  My degrees are in social work and I am thinking that getting involved and helping to to bring these AFTD support groups and such to Nebraska.  I can't change the diagnosis for Dad but I am 100% committed to doing what I can to spread the word about this terrible disease and find ways to reach others that are in this struggle as well.  
comment 20: Seriously good for you.
comment 21: Hello, my condolences to your coping with this tragic disease. My mother displayed a very similar progression. I also can’t really tell if she has Alzheimer’s with frontal symptoms or straight out FTD because she does have all the behavioral stuff that goes with FTD. The neurologist doesn’t know either. I’m just going with FTD because it makes the most sense. Anyway, the best bit of advice I can give you as someone who is similarly situated is that you need to hire help. I had a real struggle to get my mom to accept a “housekeeper,” but ultimately it has been a lifesaver because I’m not responsible for every detail of her dysfunctional life and she can still live with my dad at home. I did take away her car. Like your dad, she was basically a safe driver. But I felt that her lack of ability to plan or deal with changes and her impulsiveness could set her up for becoming flustered in an unexpected situation. You’ll know hopefully when the right time to take the car away is. Feel free to DM me anytime. This is a really hard thing to cope with.
comment 22: Thank you so very much!  I am going to have Dad go through the simulation driving test at the local hospital.  I don't think he will pass.
comment 23: Shockingly my mom passed. Alz is different than FTD in this way IMO- the patients can pass tests much better for longer  even if they are just as impaired as Alz patients. I ended up taking her car away anyway. I did it in a sneaky way though. I told her the car was broken, which it was, and then have the mechanic tell her it was a irreparable. Since then, 2 years ago, we have been “looking for”, and “shopping for good deals.” But it’s amazing we just haven’t found a car yet for her!
comment 24: WOW!  I drive with him a couple of times per week and can't believe how good of a driver he is.  That's a good solution you provided.  Luckily his vehicle is a lease and has to be turned in soon.  That may just be a blessing.  I've explained to Dad that he won't be able to drive much longer because insurance won't allow him to with his diagnosis.  He just looks at me with a crooked grin ;/ which I always appreciate.  Sometimes you have to just laugh in situations like this.
comment 25: Hi Brian,
I am 34 and my father (62) too rapidly progressed in his disease of FTD. He is currently on a ""legal 2k"" hold for psychiatric disturbance he recently caused. I too am a business owner and operator of a consultant group and  work with a few companies in leadership roles. However  I am not married but do have a LTR with no children. I too am my fathers only relative who can manage and care for his affairs.  I am currently in the process of gaining guardianship, which has been difficult due to my fathers reluctance and non-acceptance of his failing state.
I just want you to know you are not alone, and that people like you and I are forced into this position and in many ways can have closure for the ways our fathers behavior may have impacted us. What i use to think was narcissism was really just early stages of degeneration. What i use to think was embarrassing shameful behavior was just an early sign of devolution. In some ways, although this feels like the worst time of my life (business is not doing to well and financially insecure), in many ways i feel the most sense of relief.  My only worry now is that my father is safe, i can manage his affairs, I can maintain my relationship and stay a float financially. On top of this I am calculating how I can try and prevent or stall this disease from consuming me, if it does.
Anyways, if you ever want to be a pen pal, i'm here. Good luck with everything.  Find balance, and learn everything you can.
cheers,
Steven
comment 26: Thank you so much Steven!  I am so sorry to hear about what you are going through.  Your feedback is spot on and this has been a journey that I wouldn't wish on anyone.  
I've made the decision to put dad in AL.  It's for his safety, well-being, and for my own relief.  I have come to grips with the fact that I can't protect him from this and I need to lean on professionals.
I'm here for you too if I can assist in any way.  Even to bounce ideas back and forth.  
Thank you!  Brian Fox
comment 27: i think you mentioned the difficulty and lack of resources/process there seems to be available in these matters.  I believe we share in this frustration. I would like to fight for protocols to be in place, similar to that of a psychiatric disturbance, which can be initiated to identify and prevent further tertiary destruction that comes with these situations. In the event of a suspected early onset or rapidly progressive dementia, or even during a late /normative onset dementia, in which a patient can be brought into a neurocognitive unit, receive proper diagnosis and if client meets criteria to have a temporary guardianship facilitated at the hospital.  Then to allow for an after care plan to be established to minimize confusion for all parties and prevent further hardship.      
&#x200B;
I am not sure where you are located  but i am out of Nevada and we do not seem to have anything in place to make this efficient or effective. I hope my fathers legacy can be the initiation of such a procedure.  i hope.  Best of luck to you as well and thank you for creating a forum for this discussion.

comment 28: I'm also 36 and my dad has FTD, and it's the hardest thing that has ever happened to me.  I don't have a lot of advice except to recommend you try to do at least one thing each week just for yourself, something that you love. I find that goes a long way.  Will be thinking of you.
comment 29: Love this.  Simple solution but I am not currently doing this.  You are so right and I will start implementing this.   I'm sorry to hear about your Dad.  If I can be of support to you in any way, please let me know.

"I guess it's time for *me* to share. TL;DR at the end.
The past couple of months have been rough on me. My wife (who has multiple debilitating physical conditions, Fibromyalgia, tendonitis, arthritis, GERDS (just to name a few) and some mental health stuff leftover from her stint in the Navy) has been having some severe 'episodes' where her muscles contract along her spine and shoulders. This has been going on for months, but as of a couple of months ago, they have been getting increasingly worse.
Initially, it started with some vertigo when she stood up. Then, whenever she bent/knelt down. Soon, she would have the muscle spasms, but nothing too bad, then it became a whole lot worse. She would severely stutter. She would lose her cognitive ability (she told me she looked into a mirror and couldn't recognize herself). In a couple of instances she stopped breathing, even though she said that she was afterward. The strangest part is that the episodes last just a couple of minutes, and she would be just fine once it has passed. 
We quickly learned that if I press on those muscle spasms, they would eventually release, but not without a serious fight. If ever I was thankful for all the heavy lifting jobs I've had since I've left the military, it is now. It takes some serious effort to apply enough pressure to release these things. It's the only thing that has helped her get through these episodes. 
We've waited to get to see her doctor at the VA clinic nearby. Our thinking for this was to get her General Practitioner on board with what was going on, and go from there. We've had an at-home nurse drop by and agree that waiting to get to see the doctor was a good plan, since Emergency Rooms generally don't like people coming in and saying ""Hey, watch this!"". It doesn't help that the closest VA emergency room is in San Francisco, an hour drive away in good traffic. We don't want to play the Russian Roulette game of ""will the VA cover this emergency room visit to a civilian hospital"". 
Once we got in to see the doctor, we talked about what was going on, then demonstrated it for her, and the concern was quite obvious. She was dumbstruck, and had almost no idea on how to help. She knew that we needed to see neurology, but going through 'proper channels' it would take a while to get us in.
She told us to go to the ER, since they could fast-track us into an appointment, if we went during normal operating hours. So we did. We didn't know what to expect, so we planned for hospitalization. Went to SFVA the next day (last Friday). We saw a nurse practitioner, explained what was going on, and demonstrated it for her. After a battery of labs, she informed us that the Neurology department wanted to admit her next week (Tuesday- holiday weekend). It was such a relief to know that this is being taken seriously.
We went over to the Epilepsy Center, and got the orientation packet, what to bring, what to expect, who would be seeing us, all that jazz. We left feeling relieved and happy that this was going to be a good thing, to figure out what was going on. The biggest stressor was just not knowing what was wrong. 
Her in-patient stay is going to be a 3-7 day EEG. I apologize in advance if I'm not as responsive during this next week, but I will be with her the entire time (save for some sanity breaks, and/or possibly a couple of meals). My children (all four of them) are going to be with my mother during this time, who has generously offered to take time off of her work to help us out. She's had them since we went to the hospital, and staying with us this past week to help us out. I really don't know how we'd do this without her help. 
We've talked about possible diagnoses, from a seizure disorder, to cancers.. but right now, it doesn't matter. I got to spend a wonderful weekend with just my wife and I at home, talking, playing games, and a nice dinner at Olive Garden last night. We're hopeful at whatever news comes our way, since at least then we can talk about treatment, whatever that may entail. 
TL;DR:
Wife has bad spasms that cause her to lose consciousness. Doctor told us to go to ER, and are being admitted on Tuesday for 3-7 day EEG. Looking forward to the results and whatever comes from it. 
Do NOT wait to go to the Emergency Room. Lesson learned.","comment 1: Best wishes to you both. You sound like an amazing couple. And thank you both for your service.

"What are my obligations to my aging parent? Moving in with my mother was a mutually beneficial arrangement. Shes 72 and ""retired"" after leaving her  last social work job. She couldn't keep paying the mortgage on social security and things didn't work out with her previous roommate. My wife had to make a career change and lowering our rent allowed us to more easily afford some time with her out of work, plus we could start saving for a house. After a year and a half, and multiple discussions, my mother continues to violate my wife and I's boundaries by moving our things around (problematic for my wife), eats some of our foods (not basic staples, problematic for me on shift work), and doesn't want to share the common parts of the house with any of our stuff. No shoes or jackets by the door, none of my wife's DVDs or books down in the living room. Very little closet and storage space.  I spent $1,000 and a few weeks last year remodeling the attic into a loft so that we'd have our own space, but it's not habitable year round due to limited climate control in the summer. 
I know this stuff is pretty petty but here's the thing. We've discussed this multiple times and things haven't changed. We pay half the mortgage and 2/3 of the utilities but have very little storage and living space. I know that bothers my wife more than she let's on. With my wife stable in a new career track and some money in the bank, what obligation do I have to my mother and her continued aging in place? She can't afford the house without a roommate. A roommate wouldn't deal with the lack of respect for boundaries as long as we have. She's not abusive, she's just a dick who's hard to live. I'm 31, going on a year married. I want to start my life with my wife, not be buried away in a small bedroom and a loft, but then my mother's comfort and quality of life could take a severe dip if we leave her on her own. My dad, and my in-laws both sit on piles of money. She's the only parent with an insecure (more like nonexistent) retirement. What do? ","comment 1: There are subsidized senior living apartments if you do a little digging and work. Maybe this would help. It doesn't sound as if you living situation is going to be very beneficial for your marriage. A senior living community might be better for her socializing anyway.
https://www.after55.com/blog/how-find-low-income-senior-housing/
comment 2: I moved across country to help care for my mom/parents and am in very much a similar situation, minus them needing my money. They do need my assistance as mom can't safely cook, drive, or be alone for long periods of time anymore due to dementia/other health problems and my father is either slow to learn or just unwilling to pick up the slack. Maybe a little of both.
Your obligation goes as far as you can extend it. I personally feel we should all care for the elders in our family, but we are people with lives too. You need to have a frank discussion with your mom. Tell her the situation isn't working, and you and your wife need your own space, either that or she has to allow her space to be your space. If it is the former, it is possible she may just have to sell the house and find a more affordable living situation for herself. If it's the latter, then you need to set some ground rules.
For myself, I'm moving out. They don't need my rent so I can swing by a few times a week and do meal prep for them, take mom shopping, and clean. You could move out and give your mom some sort of allowance, but realistically if it's going to be just her, then she needs to find an appropriately sized/priced home or deal with the risks of roommates.
Life is tough all the way through mommy. We have to make hard decisions at every turn and no one is every going to be able to just take the wheel from us and let us coast.
comment 3: >I want to start my life with my wife
It's time you do so! Nature intends for baby birds to leave the nest, so do so.
Options for your mom include a 55+ apartment where the average age is about 70 so she'll have lots of socializing she can do. No, it may not be what she wants, but, right now, it's not what you want, so you figure out what really matters. BTW, your wife might ask you to choose between her and your mom, and you better know what you want!
Unfortunately, we often have to let things fall apart for our elderly parents before they realize they can't keep living like they used to. The generation over 70 never really had to care for their aging parents because back then, people died mostly before they were 80. So, the over 70 generation thinks they'll die still owning their home, and their death will take a few weeks at most.
Read Atul Gawande's Being Mortal if you haven't already. Wise knowledge is you don't move in with your parents, nor have them move in with you.
How it will unfold with your mom is she might get some tenants after you leave, and they'll make her miserable (be sure the tenants sign a lease because evictions take months even with a lease, longer if without - search r/legaladvice for more on that). After the tenant fiasco, she'll have some other crisis (health, bank repossessing the home, etc) that will force her to move. It's much better if she can decide on her own to move before that happens, so be sure to inform her of her future before it falls apart. The over-70 crowd in general doesn't believe they are over 50, and live in denial that things are changing.
Source: Read some of my replies here an here, this isn't my first rodeo, and the one I'm in now is ongoing. 
edit: typos , and will ad, in 2018 and beyond, I'd say you have an obligation to help her stay safe with food, clothing, shelter, and medicine, but you don't have to pay for a level of living that isn't financially tenable (if she's living beyond her means, she needs to change how she's living, send her to r/PersonalFinance for that). She is still responsible for how she manages her possessions (her home) and if she screws it up, then she screws it up. If you've warned her, that's, sadly, often all you can do. There are options for her living arrangements, maybe even with some financial support from you (send your $ directly to the apartment complex or utility, don't give it to her willy-nilly unless trust is absolute.).
comment 4: You really aren’t obligated to do anything, but understandably you don’t want to put your mom into a precarious living arrangement.  
We’re considering looking for a house with a detached MIL apartment.  We live in a different state and things are looking like she will need to be closer to people who can give her more support than she is currently getting.  I can barely survive a 10 day visit with her in my space, so she will absolutely need her own living quarters.  We live in a high cost of living area, so she won’t be able to afford her own place.  A separate house/apartment on the same property that she rents from us feels like it will be the best solution for our situation.  
comment 5: sell the place you have now and get a duplex?
comment 6: I’ve asked her to sell her to consider selling her house and buying a condo cash. She refuses. If my wife and I can swing a duplex that’ll be nice but it won’t be with any help from my mother. She should have sold this house and purchased something smaller when her and my father got divorced. She didn’t though. And I’m not expecting it now. 
comment 7: "" but then my mother's comfort and quality of life could take a severe dip if we leave her on her own. My dad, and my in-laws both sit on piles of money. She's the only parent with an insecure (more like nonexistent) retirement. What do? ""
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ sounds like you'll have to force the issue if you want real change. I would move out and let her know she can now go to rest of family for help. Then if the rest of the family won't help, she can move back in with you, but it will be your house and your rules.
comment 8: There is no rest of he family.

For a approx 3k, invest in a mini split ductless unit for the loft.
Yup.... That's money that's supposed to go into your new home savings account.
Screw that. You are in survivalist mode. Plus the aggravation you are both going through can't be good on your marriage.
Get the ductless unit. Put a mini fridge in attic. Put a lock on the attic door.
And take the unit when you move.

"Caregiving for my father is unsustainable. Doctors don't understand. Help? Posting from a throwaway because I'm a big believer in keeping personal and online life separate.
Some weeks ago my mother passed away after her fourth battle with cancer. Left behind are myself, my sister, and my father with dementia.
My father is in no way capable of taking care of himself. He can't keep track of the date or time, pay bills, go to the store, prepare meals, or clean up after himself. On several occasions he's made near-catastrophic blunders like bringing tanks of gasoline into the basement near the heater's pilot light.
However, between his lies and doctoral incompetence, we've been completely unable to establish the gravity of the situation. His GP remains convinced that he's still capable of caring for himself. An ER doctor who saw him the night before my mother's death, him believing it to be the 1970s and that he had no family or home, diagnosed him with depression, for which his geriatric specialist prescribed an SSRI and called it a day. Social workers have told us there's nothing they can do because he isn't in imminent danger (because we who live with him been breaking our backs to keep it that way for our own sakes, let alone his). He himself can't be confronted directly because he's always had a paranoid streak and becomes angry and abusive when pressed on even minor issues.
I'm 30, and between caring for my parents and my own health issues have never had the chance to make a life for myself, and certainly not now that we're down a set of hands and with somebody needing constant supervision. My sister, now the sole breadwinner, is getting three hours of sleep a night after everything is said and done and is a car accident waiting to happen. Extenuating circumstances prevent us from moving out, as if we had the time to search. If we're lucky he'll concede to give her DPOA and we'll be able to do something the next time he has a crisis, but there's no guarantee that he will (as he's perfectly content to make us come to him to rubber-stamp the bills), and even if he does I'm not sure we can hold out until the next crisis.
We can't keep this up. Has anybody heard of any similar situations? Any advice?","comment 1: You should ask for a referral to a neurologist and psychiatrist as together they can diagnose correctly. Need mri and ct and the psychological testing.
comment 2: You may need multiple neurologists.
I went through the same as OP with my dad. He absolutely was not able to live by himself. We were trying to get him declared “benefits eligible” by his long term care insurer, but the first neurologist and his primary doctor were dismissive of his condition and adamant that he be sent back to his house to live alone.
Never mind that he would call me to ask what city he was in and if his mother was still alive (gone 20 years) and he fell and hit his head in the bathroom sink and he wasn’t eating. 
The problem was that I’d put a nice clean shirt on him and get him a haircut and a shave and he’d arrange himself so he could convince the doctor he was fine.
Finally one day I let him get himself ready and he looked awful. I told the doc about the difference and he bought it.
comment 3: It’s awful how the doctors won’t believe people and what family members suffer because of this. However, I guess what I want to ask you is what would you do about it if they will diagnose him as incompetent/having dementia? If you put him in a home, be aware that it costs 5-11g per month. And Medicare will make sure he has spent every cent he owns before it will cover anything. And when he runs out of cash, proceeds from the sale of his house, where it sounds like you guys are living, will have to be used to pay for it before Medicare will step in. It’s a shitty situation and I’m sorry. Nobody would diagnose my mother either for years. And I mean she didn’t know what decade it was and couldn’t look after herself in any fashion.
comment 4: Call Adult protective Services. They'll send a social worker. He won't be happy, but it might be what you need to do to get him a proper diagnosis. Looks like you need to see a new doctor, one who might have more experience in this kind of situation. 
comment 5: He needs to be on meds. That will give you some stability. 
In his non parinoid and aggressive moments talk to him about how great he managed all the details of your family and that you need his cooperation to continue that work. If he is diagnosed he can go on SSI for example
Remember all you can do is be good daughters and give him value love and respect. 
My husband has had this for 4 years and like you i do everything i can to make it all seem normal. That is my job. It isnt normal but to on lookers im doing a good job
Because it is HELL 
STAY STRONG AND PRAY
I will say a few for y’all today
comment 6: I’m thinking a referral to a geriatric dr for a geriatric evaluation which is multidimensional, multidisciplinary assessment. This helped us get our mom on the right track.
Ditto what SoloHappyCup said about finances. 
comment 7: If he wont consent to  a DPOA , eventually y'all are going to have to get that done. It will reach that point so better to face it now and plan . I wish I had some good advice for you other than keep reaching out and don't be afraid to ask for help.  Unfortunately one answer would depend on his insurance and what your options are financially. If you can find another doctor he would be willing to go to that might be more sympathetic to this specific issue that couldn't hurt maybe? 
IN my dads case as I got more involved with taking him to doctor visits I realized this is the same family doctor he has been going to for years. And while I have no doubt he did counsel my dad about his overweight issues and lack of exercise as he had two previous strokes before this last one that brought on the dementia, I feel like for years he somewhat enabled my dad by giving my dad reassurance that he was fine.  380 lbs and 0 exercise is not fine doc, sorry. I felt like he was pretty out of touch with the whole thing and had zero confidence in him compared to my dad.
Good luck. And if you notice any family member trying to 'take care of everything' themselves, do your best to help them, and yourself. No one should have to do this alone.
comment 8: Well what culminated in the family doctor taking us seriously was when my mother lost the car and denied even driving it and parking it. Prior to that the family doctor refused to believe there was anything wrong as mum was able to always appear alert and normal when speaking to outsiders. So yes I totally understand.

"
"A thank you and search for a fresh perspective Hi all, stumbled into this community a few weeks back and come here often to read people's stories and advice. It's hard to express how helpful this subreddit has been in removing that feeling of loneliness and isolation. So I wanted to start with a huge thank you to everyone that posts and comments, and an ""I see you"" to all the caregivers on this sub. 
Just a bit of background: my fiance and I said yes to moving in with my grandma last summer to help take care of the house and make life easier on her. We're the only ones local family, my dad lives 2 hours away but we're lucky if he comes by once every few months.  At the time we moved in, she was still pretty independent and was able take care of herself for the most part (bathing, cooking, meds, finances etc.) which was great because we had just transferred to a 4-year university to finish up our bachelor's, so we were gone for most of the day mon-thur. 
Since then, my grandma's health has deteriorated, slowly at first and then a couple months back pretty significantly. At first, things went pretty well but over time we were asked to take over more and more responsibilities and now we take care of practically everything, minus baths which she gets help with from a home health aide. Back in July she decided to go on hospice, and they've treated her pretty well but there have been some persistent issues with her leg and breathing ( gma has the trifecta of diabetes, CHF and COPD) and her condition varies wildly from day to day. 
That's the thing I think I came to ask about... How do you deal with the massive uncertainty and accompanying anxiety? Some days it seems like she's going strong and there's nothing to worry about, others we worry that she's not gonna be with us the next morning. And she's gotten increasingly paranoid, to the point where she has insisted that someone be in the house with her 24/7. On top of it all we're worried now that her mental faculties are fading (constantly forgets conversations, sometimes immediately after they occur, forgetting basic info about herself, losing track of when she takes her meds).  You know, we love her dearly and want to take care of her, and she doesn't seem to have any other options but a lot of times we feel in over our heads. It doesn't feel like there's any escape or path for releasing some of this tension and worry. 
We've rearranged our whole lives to try and accommodate her, but now it's starting to hurt my relationship with my fiance and our relationship with grandma and it's made it impossible to focus in school or make any long term decisions (we are both in the sciences and are looking at grad school... But how can we when we can't leave where we're at?). Based on this current trend I'm worried things are only going to get worse, and the burnout factor is already really strong. 
So, what do you do when your future is on hold indefinitely, the post caretaking period is likely to be a financial nightmare with no real way to prepare for, and the stress of everything is eating away at the core relationship in your life? 
Agh. Sorry for turning into a venting machine. And if you read this far, thanks again. I dunno what to say, guess the stress of the last month or so just finally sank in. 
/End rant","comment 1: [deleted]
comment 2: Thank you so much for your kind words! I have family on my mom's side that's offered to help but it's been really tough convincing grandma she'd be ok with one of them. I'll share your message with my partner, there's a lot of wisdom in it, and it's something we both need vitally need to remember. 
My best wishes to you and your family! The same offer extends to you, my inbox is always open. Take care!

"Can I help my mom vote? Does anyone know if any laws prevent me or my dad from helping Mom vote? November is coming up and we always vote, but mom has trouble filling out forms. She's gonna need someone to help keep her on track and help her remember who is who and so forth. ","comment 1: My mom actually included that in her power of attorney, so I am designated to help her vote. We talk over the issues, and then I fill out her ballot. Contact your local county elections to get directions on the signature part. 
comment 2: We've wondered this for my dad too. I feel like the rule is 1) over 18, 2) not a felon, and 3) not mentally incapacitated, so they'd not be able to due to the 3rd one...
comment 3: According to this she can still vote,(https://blog.alzheimers.org.uk/campaigns/general-election/) and even if that were the case I wouldn't consider her mentally incapacitated. She has plenty of opinions about politics and knows who she wants to vote for She's Just crappy at forms.
comment 4: It appears they can still vote.  It may be easier done as an absentee ballot or defining a proxy.  May be too late for this election to designate a proxy or setup an absentee.
https://blog.alzheimers.org.uk/campaigns/general-election/
comment 5: There should be plenty of time to get an absentee/mail ballot in most states. Usually they can be requested online and arrive quickly. If you don't have enough time to mail them back you can always drive them to the elections office.
I took my mom to early voting in 2016 and was allowed to stand in the voting area with her. They didn't have ""booths"" so much as little tables with privacy guards on them, but they showed us to one that was far away from everyone else. I talked my mom through her voting, while being very careful not to indicate a preference. Many local races she said ""I don't know."" She did, as it turns out, have a very strong opinion on who she wanted for president (Same candidate in both primary and general) and one of the local legislative candidates was someone she'd taught in Sunday School so she was pretty adamant about that. I filled her ballot in for her.
&#x200B;
This year .... no. She can't do it -- even by absentee she lacks the ability to indicate a valid preference, and she was never uber-partisan so we couldn't even predict who she might vote for if she could understand it. We officially disenrolled her so as not to spoil her perfect lifetime voting record. :-(

comment 6: That's what I want to be able to do. Voting is something we can definitely get her out of the house for, and it will make her feel involved. She's always voted at the polling place and I don't want that to stop now.
comment 7: I voted by absentee ballot for my mom. My state allows anyone 65 or older to request an absentee ballot for all future elections, including primaries. I have full power of attorney for my mom. When filling out her absentee ballot, there is a place where you indicate whether the voter completed the ballot themself or with assistance from someone. If it is completed with assistance, there are boxes to check indicating why, one of them is the voter is disabled. That's what I checked for my mom.
Check with your Secretary of State'd office to be sure.
comment 8: I worked with a woman who 'helped' her mother vote using an absentee ballot - the mother did know recognize her daughter, did not know current events or day of week, so basically it was her daughter voting twice.  In this situation I don't think it is appropriate to encourage a vote. 
comment 9: As I said earlier, she's plenty lucid to have opinions about how the government should run, she's just no good at forms
comment 10: Ok, you know this better than us, and the more engaged you can keep her the better.

"Assisting with taking care of dad with dementia I am currently helping my mom pack up so my dad, who had dementia, and her can move halfway around the world to be closer to family. They are going to move in with my brother till they find their own pace near by in Brooklyn.
I'm trying to make a list of things that he'll keep him occupied and not anxious. I noticed tv works well but almost too well. He needs a clock to tell him it's bed time, I'm thinking a toddler clock that shows red for sleep time and green for awake time night be good.
I'm also thinning about gps tracking. What's a good option for someone that doesn't always bring a phone or wear a watch?
Lastly, any other tips? I'm worried that the new environment will be trickier than any of us imagine. He is slowly getting into the realm where his speech only make sense 50% of the time. I think he can somewhat recognize family but it's not 100%, even with his wife and his siblings or kids.","comment 1: Favorite singer/band playing quietly somewhere can reorient someone w dementia. Make sure to have thier favorite foods on hand, helps Them feel like they belong there if stuff they snack on is around. (my GMA has to have orange soda at all times or she thinks we hate her and want her to die or that she's just visiting and wants to go home) Idk if any of this will help but its important to our family when dealing w dementia. Sorry I don't have any really good tips. Good luck.
comment 2: Thanks for sharing, I think this is a really good tip, didn't even think about it
comment 3: Lots of different GPS options these days even including things like shoe inserts.
If he is liable to wander it would be worthwhile asking local police if they have a scheme to register his details with them. They are usually known as the Herbert Protocol in England.
comment 4: Will he keep on a medical alert bracelet?  Your father needs some sort of identification on him in case he wanders off, which can happen in a new environment.  
A sensor for the front door that beeps will be helpful.  Also- pictures help.  A picture of a family member (even one from his childhood) on the front door will help him to know that this is the right house.
Night lights for the bathroom and hallway are a must for people with memory issues in a new location, as it can be hard to know where to go in a strange house, in the dark.
I have found that fewer possessions make things less confusing for memory patients.  It's nice to have comforting items with them but too many things can be disorienting and makes it easy to lose things.
comment 5: We got my father-in-law a clock like this: https://www.amazon.com/American-Lifetime-Newest-Version-Clock/dp/B019G79V1Q/
Seems like a rip-off for what it is, but it was worth it.  I had been considering using an old android tablet and a clock app/screensaver, but I tested it at home and it would occasionally freeze or the screen would sleep and it would need to be restarted/reset.
comment 6: Amazing how something so simple is so expensive. Thanks for the heads up on your Android experiment.
comment 7: I got this exact clock for my mom, on a whim, as we were relocating my parents closer to us. She thanks me for it every single day. She relies on it to keep her grounded in time. Otherwise, she would easily get her days and nights jumbled. 100% worth the price, imo. Doesn’t need setting or adjusting... automatically sets itself to the correct time and day when plugged in.

How do you keep yourself organized? How do you to keep track of everything that needs to be done? ,"comment 1: A few organizational things I do . 
I keep loose leaf binder with folders in it that contain all the medical information. Bring it to every appointment and make copious notes. I have a copy of every pill taped onto an index card so when she argues with me I can show it to her. 
A smartphone is a great tool, reminds you of all sorts of things, I have an app that makes its peak my reminders out loud when it's time. I used to also enter reminders on her phone when she still could use one. It's amazing how a spoken voice can motivate.
A 30-day pill box is a must so you can make sure pills aren't taking more than once Etc. 
I have a group text with other members of the family. Keep all messages, they may come in handy even two years later to remind you of what went down.
I put a dry erase board with calendar Etc on the refrigerator for everyone to refer to. We used to keep a separate calendar that she would write notes of who she saw each day so she could remember she was not alone.

"Can anyone recommend a GPS tracker with its own sim card that doesn't require the person with Alzheimer's carry a charged cell phone? Are there any good wifi-enabled TV remote controls, or reminder iPads that can be managed remotely? For background, my divorced dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a month ago, after I virtually had to physically drag him into the neurologist after a shouting match. He accepted the diagnosis with grace that day, but now he thinks the neurologist was corrupt and that he has no serious cognitive problems, despite the fact that I had the neurologist write out the diagnosis on a piece of paper. His short term memory is pretty much shot, and he scored a 9/30 on the MMSE. He accuses me of being malicious mean and cruel whenever I remind him that he has Alzheimer's, and tells this to other family members when they call. His long term memory is starting to go, but he can still cook, and is still fastidious about checking burners before he leaves the house. I don't know how the hell I will get him back to the doctor, who he now hates, and I don't know if he will ever realize that he has severe memory problems. 
At his home, the police called another family member after he repeatedly harassed his neighbor for stealing his guns, all of which were found in his hoarder house. The neighbors threatened to call adult protective services and sue him if we didn't move him. He is currently at the family cabin being regularly visited by a caretaker who he thinks is Mom's cleaning lady. 
He did get lost once, and someone drove him back to the cabin, though he claims he wasn't lost, but that he just hitchhiked because he was tired. He never mastered a cell phone, and when he had one, he never carried it with him, but he is always preoccupied with his keys, and I'd like to attach a GPS tracker either to his key ring, or his ever-present dog, perhaps one a caretaker could switch out. I think his dog is one of the main factors keeping him from getting lost, dragging him around on a tight leash. 
At night, I call him to try to coach him to turn on the smart TV and watch the local news, sometimes with success. He absolutely loves youtube and netflix, to a lesser extent, but I won't be able to train him to do more than turn on the TV and change channels. I do plan on getting a big-button remote, but I would like to be able to be able to put youtube on a continuous stream in the evenings.  It would be great if there existed a wifi enabled remote so I could turn on youtube for him. I was thinking of getting a video-enabled Amazon echo spot, and was wondering if anyone else has done something similar.
It would also be nice to have an iPad-like picture frame that I could use to give him reminders. Right now, I can't be with him all the time, and I can't afford to move him to my hometown because he will probably never agree to power of attorney, and the lawyers we've talked to strongly suggested waiting until things get much worse before pursuing a contested guardianship, which could drain his savings if he hires a shady lawyer. 
Any technological solutions that allow me to improve his quality of life would be greatly appreciated. He wants to buy an e-bike, which will probably get stolen eventually, but might make his life better for a bit.
Thanks for any and all advice. I'm very new to this.","comment 1: You may want to consider the tile. It’s generally used to keep track of a person’s keys, but might work for your needs.
I see so much of my situation with my mom in you. I’m an only child and my mom is also divorced, and only 64. I had the same conversations with attorneys that you describe here. 
I’ve now been at this for 2 years and am burned out and angry. Watch your boundaries, friend.

comment 3: Could you get a cheap phone with a cheap data plan and hide it, plugged in, somewhere in his house? I’m in a very similar situation but fortunately my Mom uses an iPad (with almost daily assistance via phone). I’ve put Tiles on her keys, her wallet and a jacket she frequently wears. Because her iPad has the Tile app running in the background and her Tiles are shared with me I can see details on where she is. 
I wish we could chip them like a cat. I’m well aware of the ethical and privacy issues with that but there should be exceptions for dementia. 
comment 4: You do, but he doesn't. The downside to tile is that it's Bluetooth, not GPS, meaning you can't just track where he is, you need to be near him so your phone connects to the tile. Someone else's phone (who has tile) can also pick up his location for you to see, but they also need to have their Bluetooth on. This may be helpful in a big American city, but wouldn't be too helpful in rural locations unless you could go looking for him yourself.
comment 5: You could try a gps tracker for dogs. We have the podtracker and it works well. You do have to pay a small monthly subscription, but I can open the app on my phone and geolocate the tracker anytime. The battery lasts about four days. We bought a spare battery and just swap them out when the one on the tracker gets low.

comment 8: I'm in the early stages of a similar problems as yours and have also been dealing with my mother in law who has memory loss, but without the added aggressive denial.  
For communicating with your dad - I HIGHLY recommend this book, which has a method for talking to people in denial.  I've used it to make progress with my mother, where my siblings have been shunned.
&#x200B;
For my Mother in law, we use this GPS watch.  It works pretty well and has circumference alarms, checkins etc.  If you can't get him to wear it, maybe attach it to the dog.  It needs to be charge about once a week.
&#x200B;
For daily reminders, an Amazon Alexa Show could work well.  It will do reminders and will display google calendar entries.  You can also do video conferencing and MAY (I'm not 100% sure here) be able to configure it to allow you to just drop in and listen to the room.
&#x200B;
Hope this helps.  I'm new to this as well.

"My Grandpa's Story Hey everyone I just stumbled upon this community and I wanted to write a little bit about my grandpa who passed away last saturday. 
A friendly disclaimer beforehand, I am from Germany so excuse any potential mistakes concerning grammar or terminology and whatnot; I also don't know if posts like these are allowed/appreciated. 
My grandpa passed away last saturday after years of fighting off the inevitable. Even though we were kind of prepared it still hit us harder than we thought. He was diagnosed with Alzheimers in 2014 I think but at that point he was not even able to write his name ""Alexander"" or even ""Alex"" in short in his medical evaluation so I guess he already had it for a lot longer. He had mixed up the names of my Dad and me for years and he sometimes had trouble ""finding the right words"" and finishing sentences. In 2013 when I was at their house during lunchbreak he would later tell his wife that ""the tall guy with the bag"" (that is me) had been there cause he couldn't remember my name anymore. 
What I found weird was that compared to other documentaries I had watched about dementia and alzheimers was that he also degraded physically a lot. It came to a point where he could not move for longer than a minute and he couldn't walk down the stairs to their basement. His overall movement became very slow and it took multiple tries for him to get up from a seated position. 
From 2016/2017 he was constantly in and out of hospital with pneumonia, high fevers or other things. Sometimes he would wake up at night and not realize he was in his own home and other times he would not even recognize his wife, his daughter or his sister. A few days before his passing he came out of the hospital again and they told us they had moved him to palliative care which was a bit of a surprise for us. He often refused to eat or drink, sometimes consuming not more than 2 or 3 glasses of water each day. Maybe he didn't want to life anymore? There was one weird instance in 2014 a few weeks after his official diagnose. At this point he was not able to walk down the stairs for quite a while now but one night he managed to get down the stairs, woke up his SIL and basically told her to lock him up and beat him to death which was odd and totally out of character for him to say something like that and since then this event stuck with us...
He was 75 years old and an avid runner. Going through his notes I have learned that he wasn't born a strong runner but he had the motivation to change his life in his late 30s and he wanted to do ""something sporty"". So he started off slow and painful and through hard work and determination (he ran 15 miles at least 3 times a week) he was able to run one marathon (26.2 Miles) after another. I can't find the exact number but it's gotta be more than 35 marathons and he even participated in a few 100 km (62.1 Miles) and 24 hour runs. In 2003 he also flew to Nepal to go on a hiking trip. There are so many things I've learned in the last few days and I'm quite amazed about the things I read. I think it's a shame he could never tell me these things personally and convey the emotions he must have felt during these achievements. The burial is this friday and until then I hope to learn a lot more awesome things about my grandpa which light him in a different, motivational and happy way.
Thank you all for reading this! I just wanted to share this story... rest in peace Opa Alex","comment 1: I'm so sorry for your loss.

"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it. Hey guys,
I'm posting here because this is fairly recent, and I've mostly been alternating between crying and denial over the past two weeks. My situation is... problematic, to say the least. I'm 22 (almost 23), transgender & finishing up my transition pretty soon (October); my brother's autistic, high functioning and 24 and violent/unemployed/NEET-ish; my mom has issues of her own, undiagnosed. Myself -- I work as a software engineer, I'm known to be pretty intelligent, I can more than ably take care of myself and have a good circle of friends and support more or less. Most of my misery in life comes from my family, not really even due to the transgender thing (which is usually pretty bad by itself).
For the purposes of below, my dad is about 59, and my mom is about 57.
The past two years have been a rollercoaster of heartbreak, mostly - my dad was fired from his job of 20-something years in October 2016, and I helped him a new job around April 2017. He was then let go from the new job in March 2018, and was supposed to start another job (in Florida, away from my family) in September of this year. He was fired for reasons I don't want to get into, but the running diagnosis up until there was unmanaged bipolar disorder, leading to episodes of mania and culminating in an involuntary psychiatric hold in October 2017 (my brother was also put in psychiatric hold at that time for attacking my mom).
Over this past year, my dad has been somewhat forgetful, and more distant from me conversationally, which I also ascribed to my transition (aka not knowing how to relate to a daughter, rather than his son). He's also had 4-6 minor car accidents. He's also on a cocktail of meds (Abilify, Prozac, Trazadone, Valsartan, Atorvastatin, Antabuse, Omeprazole, and Vyvanse) and historically has depression and alcohol issues (partially due to family drama). 
Last month, my mom took my dad to see a neurologist (funnily enough the one who I used to see for my juvenile epilepsy, which thankfully I outgrew). The neurologist, owing to what my mom described and observing my dad, recommended my dad for further testing and told him he should minimize driving as much as possible.
Today and this past week, my dad's been going to testing at UCLA, which culminated in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, which detected significant impairment in my dad's visiospatial & mental tracking, and mild-to-moderate in verbal memory. This is indicative of cognitive impairment, and some amount of decline.
My greatest fears is - does this likely point to early-onset familial Alzheimer's dementia? His dad died of Alzheimer's related dementia around 82, and his side does have a history of it, but from what I know in old age mainly. I don't know of any other sufferers of EFAD in our family line, but I can start searching.
Also - what does this mean for me? I'm in the process now of trying to schedule APOE/PSEN2 testing if I can get it, but I don't even know exactly how I'd handle the results if I get them. ","comment 1: Goodness that’s a lot to handle at 22, and your family certainly seems to have a lot going on as well. 
So here are my thoughts and hopefully other people will be even more helpful. First, you don’t know your dad has Alzheimer’s. He could have any number of cognitive issues, particularly one triggered by alcoholism. Second, even if he does have early onset Alzheimer’s  it doesn’t mean you have a genetic risk for it. Sometimes terrible things just happen.  
The question of a genetic test is one many people struggle with. So I can only answer for myself. Personally, if I took a genetic test and it showed a genetic predisposition I would try to use that information to do all the things that have been shown to forestall the disease like cutting out sugar and taking up a second language (for instance).  
In terms of your family, I think a good first step would be to contact the local chapter of the Alzheimer’s association. You can call the 24 hour helpline at https://www.alz.org/ and they can put you in contact. One of the nice things is you can meet to talk to a social worker and they can lay out some possibilities. After that you’ll want to talk to an attorney to create a financial plan and get documents in order. You’ll have a much better idea of where you stand after that. Hopefully, you can work out a plan where this will not become your full burden and responsibility.
comment 2: The genetic component of early onset Alzheimer's is really misunderstood. If your dad doesn't have a first degree relative with early onset Alzheimer's, then his case is unlikely to be of the familial type (at least, one of the currently identified familial types). It could be some sporadic type, or associated with a gene not yet identified, or alcohol related, or who knows what. 
That said, diagnosing Alzheimer's based off of one MOCA assessment would be pretty difficult to do. Hopefully the doctors did a lot more testing than that, because there are other, more likely causes of early onset dementia besides Alzheimer's. In my mother's case, she had repeated neuropsychologist testing over a couple of years, several MRIs, and finally a PET scan (which pointed toward Alzheimer's and pointed away from frontotemporal dementia). 
My mom's case sounds a lot like your dad's. Early onset (though she was in her 40's), history of alcohol use, fired from her long-time job, then problems trying to keep a job after that, several minor car accidents, etc. She's now 59, in the late stages of the disease and in a nursing home. It's bleak.
I'm lucky to have worked for years in dementia research, with some of the leading researchers in the country. I had the opportunity to talk in-depth with a genetic counselor within our neurology department to discussed genetic testing. Because my mom's Alzheimer's is not likely to be familial (she has no first degree relatives with early onset Alzheimer's), genetic testing would not offer me much. 
Very simply, testing ""positive"" for the APOE allele associated with Alzheimer's doesn't mean I will get Alzheimer's, and testing ""negative"" doesn't mean I won't get the disease. Unless your family carries one of the few rare identified familial genes for EFAD, genetic testing won't help you sleep better at night either way. And if your family carried one of those genes, you'd probably know about several relatives who had early onset symptoms. 
In the end, for other reasons I did the 23andme ancestry & health testing, which actually does tell you your APOE status. However, I'd recommend speaking to a genetic counselor or at least reading a LOT about what that means before looking into that option, because it's definitely not a test that will tell you if you will get the disease or not. 
Sorry, that was really long and rambling, but I felt compelled to respond because your situation sounds a lot like mine. I am my mom's only family to speak of, and have arranged all of her medical care, tests, financial stuff, and care for the last ~10 years. Please let me know if I can help to answer any questions about all of this. For now, maybe start with:

Help your father apply for disability. This may require more extensive testing to prove he is disabled, but those tests will be helpful anyway.
Have you dad assign power of attorney and fill out advanced directives for his health care wishes.
Consider asking his doctor to evaluate if he is still safe to drive. If he's had 4-6 accidents, he's probably not safe.
Thorough neuropsych evaluation (way beyond a MOCA)- this will help to measure your dad's progress/decline over time, will speak to his ability to drive safely, and may help him build a case for disability.

comment 3: The best initial advice I can give you is don't panic. Alzheimer's takes a long time to progress. Also, take care of yourself and finish your transition. You can't take care of anyone without first taking care of yourself.
You make a great living at 22. I have a similar income and I'm also the sole breadwinner. My mother started having symptoms around 58 with a similar downward spiral. She's now 64 almost 65 and lives with me full time, and isn't able to do much on her own.
It's best to start looking into your options now. Find your local chapter for Area Agency for Aging and Disability, they are the gatekeepers for many of the assistance programs. Also after the testing is complete, get as much documentation together from doctors, former employers, and start a claim for SSD/SSI. Early On-Set Alzheimer's qualifies for a compassionate allowance from the SSA and can be processed more quickly, but don't be surprised by a denial. SSD will can get him Mediciad and Calif9rnia has expanded those services. Your brother would also qualify as a dependent for support in that situation. Your mom likely needs to look for work if she isn't already. You shouldn't be expected to bear the burden alone. 
Most neurologists will likely take your dad off the meds and place him on a Keto diet to see if there is contributing factors from either source, but only if it is ALZ. The best way to confirm is an MRI and Spinal Fluid analysis.
Check with your employer about assistance for legal fees and caregiver relief options. Most of the tech companies in your area do that. Also see if there is a legal aid society to help with any financial issues, forgiveness processes on debts. 
This will likely dent your plans for your startup, but it doesn't have to be a life sentence. Keep your head up and take it a day at a time. 
comment 4: To be honest, that medication cocktail would have me presenting severe Alzheimer's symptoms. 
comment 5: It's incredibly frustrating,  but there won't be any easy answers.  A lot of this will depend on evaluations over time and determining the extent of changes in his cognitive abilities as well as MRI results.  I'm more familiar with frontal temporal dementia and the genetic implications.  My mother passed away from this.  If she carried the genetic marker, I would have had a 25% likelihood of developing it too. The  neuropsychiatrist took a blood sample from my mom to see if the gene was even there.  However, I chose to have him throw out the sample and cancel the test and not know.  It would have been too easy to label any odd behavior as an indication that I might be developing it.  Even without the genetic testing,  I'm still anxious a lot of the time.  I think you just need to prepare for the future and this would be true  regardless.  If dementia doesn't get you,  there are multiple other diseases that might.  There are no guarantees in life.  
As far as your Dad is concerned,  I agree that you need to get some things in place - a financial and a medical POA,   a plan for the future.  Do talk to your local Alzheimer's organization.  They have many resources.  If your Dad is eligible for VA benefits,  check that out now.  It can take months to get them started.  Make sure you're talking to the right kind of doctor(s) and that they are the type of people who will patiently answer your questions.  Get those meds evaluated.  That just sounds like a lot of stuff and I agree... those would cognitively impair anybody. 
Finally, live your life.  If this is dementia, you can't change the outcome.  It is very easy to take on so much responsibility,  you sacrifice your own needs and wants.  Your family should sit down as a group and collaborate.  I know you're worried about the implications. There are counselors who work with adult children of dementia sufferers,  frequently licensed counseling social workers.  I started working with one several months ago and its helped me clarify a lot and make decisions based on what was in my best interests.
Whatever you learn,  good luck.  You sound like a very competent,  caring individual.  Its unfair of life to saddle you with so much to worry about at your age.  Just remember,  you can't take care of anybody else unless you're  ok.  So don't forget to take care of yourself,  too.

"I don't know what I'm doing My patient reminds me of this often.  It's true. I'm operating on intuition, informed by experience and, I trust, the Holy Spirit.  It's the best that I can offer.
In his kinder moments, he's told me I'm the best. He's also said that God will help us, help me, and that I've been blessed--all things that I acknowledge as truth.
I challenge him regularly by reading aloud, bringing new music, making notes of my observations to track progress (mostly up, rather than down).  However, he also regularly attempts to hit and/or kick me, call me stupid and a liar.  Those things are annoying but not imminently damaging, but the overall arc of deterioration is hard to be around.
His wife of 50 years endures the same and worse. Since I arrived a couple months ago, she's trusted that I can lighten her load, almost more than I'm comfortable with. Such as directing me to do things that are more about busy work and doing her housework than helping the client.

"Need advise on how to handle making sure someone is meeting dietary/nutritional/hydration needs when they refuse to accept they are not being met I've been caretaking for my father who has fairly advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD) for a while now. He prefers to keep some autonomy, which can be helpful and take some of the burden off of myself and my family, but has it's own difficulties. As of the last year I've been more closely observing his water and nutritional intake and began to grow concerned about a few things, chiefly not drinking much water and having a very low protein intake.
First step, I got a general idea of a minimum daily water intake, found an appropriate container and kept it simple: Make sure you drink this entire container (~60 fl.oz.) of water a day to be in a fairly safe place. 
The next step, we started recording what foods he was eating so that we could enter them into a food tracker so that we could see information such as calories, macronutrients, etc. and have an idea of what needed to be adjusted. It was also a good excuse to get him to challenge himself physically and mentally by learning to input this information on a computer.
Well, we started. And then it all fell apart. 
All of a sudden he stops drinking enough water, and more-over, stops using the water jug set out specifically for him. His reason was, ""Oh, I thought we were done tracking my water,"" even though nothing of the sort was ever even brought up. It was always intended as a permanent solution to ensure his hydration, but he just out of nowhere comes up with that.
Now he's drinking very little water, with the worst day recently being something around 16oz of fluid, which I find concerning. When I talk to him about this, there's always some reason or excuse. Stuff like: 

""Well, when we first started tracking my water I was doing really well""
""Well, yesterday I drank enough water."" (usually not actually the case)
""I thought I was doing well.""
""I drank a lot of water today,"" (he hadn't, and if I show him the jug of water he finds another convenient excuse)
""I didn't know we were still doing that.""
""I didn't feel I had to.""
""I'm working on it."" (x hours later he hasn't drank more than a sip of any liquid)

When confronted with the facts, he just finds another excuse. If I show him how much water is left in the container, he ignores it and changes the subject. If cornered, he simply becomes upset and tries to disengage from the conversation.
Tracking food and nutrition is almost the same exact thing. He doesn't always meet caloric goals, and he's generally very low on protein. Because of his condition with PD, musculature is a big deal since he doesn't have very much to begin with - he is a very small man and very low on weight with very little muscle to boot. He can't really afford to lose weight or muscle mass, but over the last year he's dropped a few pounds, and with his eating trends, it's concerning.
Reason doesn't seem to work. There's always an excuse. I want to be able to give him some sort of autonomy, but it's beginning to seem like that's simply not realistic. I'm not really sure how to handle this. I can't just force-feed him, and it feels wrong to tell him he has to sit at the dinner table and drink all of his water and eat all of his veggies before he can leave the table. I can't get him to eat or drink the way he should and there doesn't seem to be a way to make sure he's going to. So some support and advice on how some of you have tackled similar situations would be really helpful and appreciated. Thanks.","comment 1: I am a caregiver for my grandmother who does not like to drink water. Sometimes if you put flavor in the water they will be more likely to drink more. For protein, you could try an protein shake or ensure or boost as a meal replacement if you are really concerned. Make sure you check with his doctor before you decide to use a meal replacement.  Good luck.
comment 2: My dad won't drink water without Mio drops anymore and he has a chocolate  protein shake every afternoon. I used to worry about everything too then finally realized that it doesn't make a difference.
comment 3: My mother loves mio lemonade drops, she only drinks water with it. I also feel the same, what's the use in worrying? If something happens, it happens. We cannot control every tiny aspect of their lives, and they still make decisions.
comment 4: Don't overlook cognitive issues.  
It takes work and effort keeping track of fluid and what you are eating.  I have a hard enough time tracking my medications, thankfully now every four hours for Sinement due to DBS, but other meds are every six hours (I can eat those with foods), but tracking water is a challenge.  Bottled water is expensive, so I like your idea of the jug of water but still hard to keep track to remember to fill that.  
My wife often will ask what I had for lunch. Somedays I just get sidetracked and forget to eat.
In a way having a scale that automatically measures the weight of the jug would help in tracking and reminding him to have a glass of water.   Our Parkinson's workout coach always reminds us ""1 oz for every two pounds of body weight"".  I'm at 240# at 6'3"" but 120z of water just seems too much. Yet I can drink four 22 oz bottle of water without much thought.
Oh, Parkinson's also plays havoc on our bladder.  Both loss of control, and not being able to empty it.  I've learned it is easy to empty more of my bladder sitting down than standing, but that takes time!  Other times my bladder lets loose without warning, yes there are Pads for that, but my not drinking water before running errands or long drives, less of an issue.   I realize not good.  
comment 5: Thanks for stopping in, ParkieDude! I see you around a lot and know your username well enough, so it's always nice to hear what you have to say, so I appreciate you taking the time. 
Cognitive issues are certainly a (major) part of the problem here, and memory as well. He's been through DBS surgeries and recovering from the final one for the second side. Prior to DBS surgery he needed a neuropsych evaluation and was diagnosed with mild cognitive dysfunction. So it definitely is a factor and we are aware of it, but it is difficult. But the worst is that he becomes very stubborn and refuses to accept some things, even if they are right in front of him. This may also be a result of the cognitive issues, but the tendency towards stubbornness makes all of our lives more difficult and is something we are slowly trying to work on. Though it's hard to know exactly how to work on it, sometimes.
We've taken steps in order to combat that, such as leaving simple instructions, notes, to-do lists, etc. The water jug is ~2 quart (~64 fl.oz.) pitcher which we use and keep on the kitchen counter so that it's always in view when he's around the house and eating, and he can see how he's managing his water. We just fill it every night and record how much is left - no worry about keeping it filled, if he needs more beyond 64 fl.oz. then he can drink from the brita or bottled water, or whatever he chooses. It's mostly just to get him over that minimum goal and keep him aware of it.
There's also a chart on the fridge to show how much water (from the juge/pitcher) he's drank (drunk?) during the week, and in larger letters at the top it reads, ""/u/half-wizard's father's Water Progress: at least 2 quarts/day"" where we record how much water he's had over the week. We also have ""drink more water"" on his Daily Routine / To-Do List, and we often remind him.
But for example, as of 1pm my time today, he'd drunk less than 10fl.oz. of liquid, so I told him that he should work on drinking more water, to which he replied, ""I've been drinking lots of water."" I then turned to the counter beside me and pointed at the almost-full jug of water, to which he then replied similarly, ""Well, I've had a lot of water."" Well, no, he hadn't, and it was plain to see, but he wouldn't accept it and kind of brushed off my request to drink more.
And I think that's the heart of the problem, and the bulk of the trouble. We're trying to deal with it, but it can be difficult. Hence why I turned here. I certainly appreciate your insight.
> My wife often will ask what I had for lunch. Somedays I just get sidetracked and forget to eat.
To be fair, I do that often enough, myself! lol :-x So I can hold that one against him. 
Generally, for him though, it's rarely that he forgets to eat, but more often that he focuses on eating lots of carbs. We've taken steps to address that as well (reminders, ease of access of pre-made foods that aren't carbs, etc.), but the ""stubbornness"" / cognitive issues does trip us up.
>  I've learned it is easy to empty more of my bladder sitting down than standing, but that takes time!
Definitely. I read that somewhere, maybe from another post you'd made, or someone else or somewhere else. But we've been encouraging him to sit more, which can be helpful, but he doesn't always remember.
In general, though, the days he drinks more water are the days he tends to have the least amount of trouble urinating.
comment 6: I take care of my grandparents, both have many dietary restrictions and my grandmother, who also has parkinsons, is insanely picky. When I've spoken to their doctors about similar issues they've told me, generally speaking, that as long as they know the consequences of disregarding the restrictions -and in my grandmothers case usually refusing to eat anything healthy- then leave them to it. 
You can also try Gatorade or similar if he is not responding to water. Ensure and other nutritional drinks could be an option as well. My grandfather is on a strict water intake but he gets incredibly bored with plain water. Adding in some fruit juice/tea/gatorade or other flavoring helps it become palatable. 
Could it also be he just doesn't think about taking a drink? He may not feel thirsty so he just doesn't think of it? Maybe set a timer to remind him to take a drink a few times an hour or if someone is home with him bring him a smaller cup (8 oz or less) of water a couple times an hour and have him take a drink then. Possibly bring him a few grapes or a small piece watermelon or other fruit at the same time and try to encourage him to take a bite or two. You'll get a little more nutrition and fluid into him and may also help encourage thirst. 
You are right that you can't force feed him but if you feel that he isn't mentally sound to make these decisions for himself speak with his physicians directly, they may suggest a feeding tube if he is fairly (of his own accord) malnourished. To that end, pointing out to my grandmother that a feeding tube might be necessary if she won't eat something healthy each day does help. It's not mean or a threat it's just a reminder of the reality of the situation. We've only had to remind her a few times but if there are memory issues you are dealing with it may have to be a frequent conversation. 
Aside from all of that, take a breath. You are doing all that you can do. It's extremely difficult taking care of an adult who has their own ideas about what is right/enough and add in any memory issues or extreme stubbornness and it can all feel impossible. Remind yourself- as much as you remind him to drink water and eat right- that you are doing the best you can and that is all you can do.

comment 7: I use tricks to get them to drink more.  Jello with EmergenC in it is good. Apple sauce, variety of drinks, no one  drink plain water. Same with foods, my goal is to make food they eat healthier rather than feed them healthy food. Small servings that look good help. I have been taking a client to the senior center for low impact aerobics, bingo and lunch. The socialization is helping. 
comment 8: EmergenC isn't necessary as we already have him on a routine of taking multi-vitamins and his vitaminC and other vitamins/minerals are at a safe level. It's mainly the macro-nutrients and water that are a big deal right now.
But the jello - that might be a great idea. I'm not sure if he'll actually do it, but it might be a good way to water down some jello and get him to have some. I'll see if he'll go for it. 
He does like using applesauce for a lot of things, but that isn't a primary source of hydration.
>  ...no one drink plain water.
As someone who is currently drinking plain, iced water as I'm typing this......
I lol'd.
> Same with foods, my goal is to make food they eat healthier rather than feed them healthy food. 
I've been trying to focus on this. My father and his wife aren't particularly good cooks and tend on the very simple, very bland, very... boring.... side of food. So I've been trying to liven it up a bit for him to try to get him to eat tastier foods which are healthy.
>  I have been taking a client to the senior center for low impact aerobics, bingo and lunch. The socialization is helping.
Keeping him active is a toughie. Hes reluctant to do a lot, and doesn't like being around people. His stubbornness, unfortunately, goes as far as to being active and doing things and has hindered progress in that domain as well. 
We've just finished a round of surgeries and he's recovering, so hopefully after he's fully recovered we can get him out doing more. But I'll give a little more emphasis on trying to get him doing a little more in the social aspects as well.
Thanks for your time and response :)
comment 9: Although to you the facts and reasoning are extremely valid talking to an elder oftentimes is like talking with a child, in my family the nurse that takes care of my father plays with him to make him drink water ""did you notice who finished that cup? i thought it was for me?! "" Maybe finding a ""fun"" way to get him to eat/drink could help you!
comment 10: My Grandmother lost a ton of weight when she was in a nursing home and was actually diagnosed with anorexia. After I had her transferred to assisted living, I started buying her protein enhanced water and a special high calorie ice cream. The protein water is flavored, so she enjoys drinking it and she loves ice cream so she didn’t even notice that it was actually a nutritional supplement. She also takes a daily multivitamin to help meet her nutritional goals. She was able to gain 30 pounds in a year with these minor changes. Similarly, when my dad was going through chemotherapy, he often refused to eat or drink anything but strawberry milkshakes. Nutrition is important, but when someone is dangerously thin, getting them to eat or drink anything is better than nothing. 
comment 11: Thanks for your advice!
We do make sure he is getting multivitamins to cover those bases, but protein is a bigger problem for him. I'll discuss protein powder / drinks with him, but that really seems like something he will stoutly refuse. It might just have to be a, ""here, drink this"". 
But we'll give it a shot. Thanks.
comment 12: ""Food fights"" were among the most heated and frustrating when I provided caregiving for my father.  The first few years we were caring for him we were actively trying to keep him healthy and avoid suffering.  The stubborn insistence on dietary and fluid control made sense to me, his caregiver.  What was I doing if I just facilitated or tolerated insufficient or indulgent food & drink choices?  Caregiving is always an emotional roller coaster where regular rules don't apply.  A patient may be dealing with something they don't want to share with you...urinating may be getting increasingly difficult...so they choose not to hydrate.  They may find it humiliating and exhausting they are being micromanaged by their child.  This is a critical juncture where their remaining autonomy is important.  Yes, their choices may backfire on them and even cause you more work and suffering.  Perfection is the enemy of the good.  Don't aim too high.  Find accommodations where you can.   Bless you for caring so much, and for wading through the turbulent waters of caregiving for one's own parent.  Role reversal is one of the trickiest components of it.  I often used this thought to calm myself.  ""Would I be mad at a toddler for not eating their veggies and drinking their milk?""  No, just concerned.  I would also work to find creative ways to get the desired result.
comment 13: Thanks for your support, it means a lot.
I definitely understand what you mean with the ""food fights"" and this all really hits home. I try to be very mindful of it, and as much as I don't like to think of it in that way, I do kind of see it as a role reversal, and I think it's somewhat inevitable. But I try pretty hard to allow him autonomy, but it is difficult, if not impossible, to do so all the time. Some days he simply can't, and some things he just can't manage on his own. No doubt this stresses him out, but I try to encourage him to work together on this, as a team, because if we just butt heads and disagree all the time it will only make it harder.
> Perfection is the enemy of the good. Don't aim too high. Find accommodations where you can. 
Thank you. I try to be mindful of that and I'll try to keep that in mind as I go forward.
>  I would also work to find creative ways to get the desired result.
I totally agree. Unfortunately, that's one of my shortcomings. I tend to be someone who can, at times, be whimsical, imaginative and creative - but it has to just simply come to me. In a way, I'm a showerthought king - if I do not find my muse, I sit in the quiet dark, and no amount of trying is ever actually being creative. Part of the reason why I'm here looking for help.
Thanks again for your response.
comment 14: Sometimes people with cognitive difficulties can't explain why they don't like something, so come up with ""other ways"" to say it.
Has his voice changed any?  More slurred, or softer or lower or raspy or mumbled?  He might be losing control of his throat muscles.  That affects speech but also how we swallow.  Could be he is slightly choking when he swallows water, so he tries to avoid it.  If you see any of those signs, take him to a speech therapist who can retrain those muscles to work together.
Is your Dad still able to use the toilet on his own?  Some people avoid drinking water if they're afraid they won't make it to the toilet in time.
He might just not be able to remember to drink water or eat the right foods.  But rather than admitting it, he says stuff like ""I thought we were done with that.""
Another possibility is that Parkinson's plays with the autonomic systems, so he might not be feeling thirsty or hungry, even if he is.
Talk to his doctor.  Maybe he needs a caregiver to come in and be with him while you're at work, to make sure he's getting nutrients.
Another thought--if he's topped up on meds before he eats, then he might eat more because he feels like it's easier to move.
Does he like soup?  That's an easy way to get veggies and water in at the same time.  Ensure tastes good and is water and protein together--another benefit is that it's very easy to drink so it doesn't take much energy.
Are you aware of the interactions between protein and l-dopa medications?

has anyone had any success with using GPS-tracker wristwatches bought online from sites like amazon? ,"comment 1: It will be possible to take the watch off, so there is the chance of him wandering undetected even if you have the device. There will also be battery and network communication issues to consider.
That said, what about something like this?
- Amazon: 3G WIFI Phone Call GPS Smart Watch, Tycho Real-time Tracking SOS GPS Tracker Watch, Geo-fence Elderly GPS...
comment 2: My father has also started wandering (we had a big scare earlier this week) so we've also started looking at GPS watches.
To get him something right away, we purchased a LG Gizmo Gadget https://www.verizonwireless.com/connected-devices/lg-gizmogadget/ but we're afraid that he'll take it off since it doesn't lock.
https://www.adiantmobile.com/product/mx-locare-gps-monitoring-watch/ which also comes with an optional locking accessory so that you can't remove it without a hex key.
https://theoracare.com/theora-connect/ is another one that just recently started selling, but I don't see any ability to lock it onto the user.
Unfortunately I can't seem to find reliable reviews on any of these, which is super frustrating. I'd love to hear from anyone that has tried these.

comment 5: I can let you know specifics and send you some screenshots of how it tells you the GPS and how it makes the SOS calls/texts. You get the location of the tracker by texting the tracker. But when they press the button on it, it can text and/or call you (and up to two other emergency contacts), the text provides their co-ordinates but also a direct Google map link to where the tracker is :) 
You can call the tracker and it picks up automatically so you can talk to them through it. 
It has automatic fall detection. 
If they press the button and you set it to call the emergency contacts, they can talk to you through the tracker clearly and easily even with it in their lap and without them still holding onto the button. 
It was super easy to set up and the prices aren't too expensive :) 
You can also set alerts so that if they go out a certain radius then the tracker alerts the contacts that the tracker has left the set perimeters so you know the person is wandering :)

comment 11: Not an option for those of us with a parent with a penchant for turning a pot on the stove to high and walking away. When I was 9, she did that with a shallow skillet of oil to fry tortillas and burned up the kitchen. (Who even DOES that? A 1/4 inch deep skillet of oil is spattering hot in what? Twenty seconds?) 
I'd hate to see her do that all these decades later in her present condition and not be able to get out of the house!

Came by and saw a straight fire in the microwave and she was just watching it and didn’t mention that it was a fire. But now she’s in stage 7 and doesn’t really do much of anything. So the precautions are less needed, but still done. But really I just never leave. But yeah, would come back to find the milk in the cabinet and random things like that, bathroom sink on full blast.

Once you can do this then geofencing can be set up.  
comment 2: They also need (or did when I looked into them a few years ago) daily charging.  It seemed to me likely that when it would be needed that it would be removed or have a dead battery.  
comment 3: Yes that is another consideration. 
We were planning on getting carers to charge it each visit. 
However my father was moved into a home before this was tested.

[/r/dementia] has anyone had any success with using GPS-tracker wristwatches bought online from sites like amazon?

This is the alarm we've found to work the best for us. We put it on a lanyard and my Grandad wears it around his neck, then he won't remove it. You can also put it on a keyring and attach it to their keys if they're more likely to go wandering and take their keys but not wear a lanyard. Or a keyring and attach it to their wallet if they always seem to remember their wallet. We found by putting the lanyard on my Grandad part of the daily routine he got used to just having it on and forgot to take it off when he went wandering. 
We liked this one because it was easy to set up, has no monthly charges or hidden fees and works like a mobile phone so we can reach him as long as he is somewhere with signal. 
You can customise it to do loads of different stuff for you but this is the sort of stuff it can do. 


If they press the large silver SOS button in the middle it will call and/or text their first emergency contact. The text will say 'Help me' and will provide their co-ordinates and also a direct Google maps link to their location. The call will ring through and if you answer it, you can talk to them like a normal phone even though they aren't pressing the silver button anymore. If the first contact doesn't answer, then it rings the second emergency contact. If the second doesn't answer it rings the third. As it's set like a mobile phone it always rings from the same number so I always know it's my grandad calling so to answer that call. Even if he has the tracker round his neck, or in his lap, the microphone is really clear too. 


The GPS co ordinations have been super accurate so far. 


It does need charging most nights but we just charge it when he's asleep and put it on him in the morning. 


We can top it up easily online using debit card, there's no hidden charges. 


It has fall detection, so if it detects a fall it will call the emergency contacts automatically without him needing to press the SOS button (this can be disabled) 


You can set it so that if the tracker goes outside of certain locations it alerts the emergency contacts via call or text so you know the person with the tracker has gone wandering 


It is small and discreet for him 


If we call the number of the tracker it answers automatically (he doesn't have to press anything) and we can chat with him, and check he's ok, at no cost at all. This is the best thing. 


comment 6: I would like to post such a product elsewhere on social, but the product-displayed doesnot work well on google plus, because it clearly says s.o.s. & that's not good for passive marketing a good product in sensitively anxious communities.
Do ya think that you could get in touch with them to give another page with a different picture (maybe the back of it) and then link to that main-product page, cheers (?)
soz - should've PM'd you , really.
but I've ideas of how'd it could be improved.
comment 7: We're currently using the Jiobit because of its small size. So far it appears to be working fine but haven't had to use it much. The watches my dad hated the size and would take it off.
We tried those SmartSoles so that we can put it in his shoe. Our experience with that was terrible. The customer service was fine but they simply kept messing up, The soles would stop sending the gps location, or stop charging, or never update etc.. They have enormous quality control issues. The first ones worked fine... for a year.

Any experience with iTraq Location Tracking Devices? Looking for best device for cell phone forgetting Alzheimers patient ,"comment 1: Haven't used iTraq, but we have a tracker on my mom's dog called Whistle. Function is very similar. It also tracks walks, patterns. The charging thing can get tricky especially if your parent is suspisious. Going through their wallet might be problematic. It is a life saver.

"Best GPS tracking device for someone who wanders? My grandpa has Alzheimer’s and he recently started wandering. We are trying to find GPS tracking device, but which ones are the best? Which one would you recommend?","comment 1: I have no tracking device advice, but have you consider contacting the police department preemptively? I know our local dept. keeps records on vulnerable adults (read: wanderers with dementia). They will take a photo, description of the person, and who to call when found.
comment 2: [deleted]
comment 3: I've recommended this in  a different sub, #1 on this list is solid: https://bestchoicesforseniors.com/gps-trackers-for-elderly. The only negative is a monthly fee but there are plenty without.  
Give me your budget and I'll fire over a few more.
comment 4: Some of the shorter range devices (like tile trackers) aren’t as reliable in, well, a longer distance.  There are some GPS trackers out there, but many seem super sketchy, banned in the US, or still in development.  It might sound cold, but perhaps check ones made for pets? Not to attach to your loved one - but maybe to slip into their wallet / pocket / whatever.  The new Apple watches have it, i think, but I know they’re not within everyone’s grasp (financially, situationally, etc). 
My dad (thankfully) doesn’t wander, but his fear is being left behind. I got him a roadID (no affiliation - just used to be married to a cyclist who swore by them). You can customize what’s printed on them, they Velcro on and off, and there’s a decent selection of bands that are water resistant - so you don’t have to fuss with it coming off and on.  I know it’s not quite the same, but it might provide a little peace of mind until you find a better solution.

"Gps tracker for shoe My step dad ran away the other day because he was angry and over-stimulated. He has dementia. He got lost in a forest and we had to call the sheriff to retrieve him. We'd like to put a GPS tracker in his shoes so that way we have some idea of where he's gone next time this happens. We estimate he has another year or two before he needs to be put in a home so we'd like to preserve his freedom as much as possible.
Does anyone have a suggestion for some affordable small GPS trackers that we can either put in his shoes or in his clothing? Our thought is that he will remove or lose a dongle or a watch.","comment 1: It’s been a few years since I checked but the downside to these types of devices is they have to be charged often.  I decided that it wouldn’t work well for my situation because it would need nightly charging.  I hope you find one that works for you.  
comment 2: >downside to these types of devices is they have to be charged often
That's why we installed institution locks on all exterior doors instead. They ain't getting out unless you want them to get out.
comment 3: Good idea. Has to be something that makes sense and affordable. 
comment 4: You could try a Tile but the range is pretty limited, the best one is up to 200ft. Does he take his phone with him? If he has a smart phone, you could put the app Life360 on it. I use it with my mom.
comment 5: I have my fathers' phone (flip phone) on my cell phone plan and when he would decide to go out for a walk I was able to track his phone.  The advantage for using a cell phone is that you can call  as well as track it.

"Help with remotely accessing our mum's tv Noob Alert!
Be gentle, this is my first post! Although I have found many interesting articles pertaining to dementia and posts regarding remote access of all kinds, I have yet to find anything which specifically answers my query below. Of course, if you can direct me to something I would be most grateful.
Our Mum is 95 and her memory is diminishing day on day.
She is otherwise in good health and we, as a family, are trying to allow her to keep her independence for as long as possible.
We have installed 4 Nest cameras (connected via Wi-Fi to her high speed Virgin broadband router) in her flat so that five family members – across the globe - can make certain she stays safe. 
Although her family phone regularly, I was thinking how useful it could be if we could remotely ‘interrupt’ her TV viewing and ‘force’ a connection with some form of video chat such as Skype, Google Duo, Whatsapp, Messenger etcetera. We feel this would be helpful for her as she is finding it more and more difficult to put faces to voices and, therefore, reinforce the memories/connections of her extended family. It would also be a more effective means of reminding her to get her breakfast/lunch/tea (regarding Mum’s TV, it is quite a dated so I will be purchasing a Smart TV and advice/suggestions would also be helpful).
Does anyone know of a way we could do this using an App on a mobile device?
What sort of interfaces and other hardware would we be looking at?
I did find this guy’s YouTube channel with his clever system of voice activated home automation utilising Broadlink RM Pro 2:
https://youtu.be/DJIhEyMQ0TI
 but, as I say above, our family would really like to be able to access remotely via the internet.
I may not be the quickest to answer your replies but do bear with me.
Many thanks in advance","comment 1: I'm sorry I don't know of anything but just wanted to say that I have been wondering the same thing myself. We are four siblings on three continents (2 are local to our Mum) We would love a way that we could check in on her and remind her of things. 
I have been talking to people about ideas for family members with dementia. I believe there are great opportunities for app developers and entrepreneurs to come up with ideas to help. 
Sadly our Mum has been deteriorating quickly and I'm not sure she will be in her home for much longer. 
comment 2: I must say the Nest camera system is fantastic (should be seeing it's a Google product!).
Obviously you'd need a strong, consistent broadband to start with. We now have 4 cameras, living room, kitchen, entrance hall and her bedroom. Only my sisters are privy to the bedroom camera, I can see all the others. The latest camera was only installed recently as mum took a fall in her bedroom and it was only by chance one of my sisters was passing and dropped in. Fortunately mum was fine. She has worn a linkline pendant which is pressed in case of emergencies but nowadays she only perceives it as a thing she wears and didn't think/remember to press it for assistance.
All the cameras have a 10 days video recording facility (paid for by subscription) although you don't have to have it. All have a microphone which you can talk through via the app on a phone/tablet.
You can set up specific zones to be covered and set for notifications of people, movement and/or sounds.
I installed 2 Nest CO/smoke alarms which can be tested via the app and will notify us if there is an issue. They each have a night light which can be set to turn on if someone passes in the dark.
They are ideal if anyone has a big property because if one alarm is triggered it will 'speak' to all the other alarms in the house stating which alarm was first triggered and where!
If I manage to work out a system regarding the tv I'll post it ☺
Thanks for your reply and hope your mum's ok.
comment 3: Is your mom good with technology? My mother had to get an upgraded cable system and cried because it was ""too complicated"" for her. We ended up getting the old one back for her. BUT I think if you don't already, maybe try getting her a smart home device. My mom LOVES hers. She has a Google home and she can ask it questions, turns on the lights (we have a smart plug adapter), set alarms, appointments, etc. I would definitely think about getting her one (and cheaper than buying a new TV)!
Edit: oh, you can also get apps. We have one that when she yells for help it sends a text to my phone to notify me.
comment 4: Unfortunately Mum was never good with tech so, at this stage, nigh on impossible to introduce anything new. Like your mum, we tried a more modern wire-free, digital phone some time back but had to quickly revert to her original. It does have 3 quick dial buttons for those of us nearest to her which she can use.
I love the idea of the system you have set up but Mum's memory couldn't retain the instructions for anything even slightly complicated.
When we phone her to remind her to get her tea/supper from her fridge, if she doesn't do it within 30 seconds the memory is gone. She lives very much in the moment these days. Still a beautiful, positive woman.
Thanks so much for your reply and hope your mum has a happy life 😊

"Finding a facility that takes mother with dementia and an ostomy bag, and brother with downs together... I'm posting on behalf of a coworker: 
I have a 86 year old mother with an ostomy bag and dementia, and 52 year old brother with Downs syndrome. Up until now,  they have always lived together at home. My sister and I have shared responsibilities when it comes to their care with daily visits, and in home health care an hour a day. 
My mother has started decline  over the last few months. She falls frequently, she breaks her ostomy bag and covers the house in feces without realizing it, etc. She can't be at home anymore, and it is getting to be too much for my sister and I.
My brother  is a creature of habit, and also needs some care to keep him on track thought the day. To have them move and separate all at once is just too much. I am trying to find someplace that will take them both. So, memory care and assisted living together in a single unit with double occupancy. My mother has Humana for insurance, and brothers is Medicare and Family Care through Wisconsin. She had enough money in her account to self pay for a year or two, maybe, but no more than that.
So, my questions is; does anybody know of any resources for finding such a facility? We have been turned away from a few of them so far because of the differences in care required by them individually and don't know where to turn for help in this, but just can't keep this going as it is.","comment 1: To the coworker:  You and your sister have done an amazing job with a difficult situation.  Please take a moment, even if it's just the two of you, to acknowledge your having made it through these past years successfully.  This next step isn't going to be easy, no matter how it goes down.  You may not be able to achieve all that you want in one step, especially since good facilities, even if you can find one, often have waiting lists. I'm in MN and have never heard of a place which could take and care for a pair of people with this level of difference in needs.  I'd start with finding a place for your mom, even temporarily, (maybe to a rehab facility) which will allow her the best quality of life for where she is now.   I understand that is hard to think about separating them, but it won't be easier for your brother to adjust when your mom suddenly passes, (assuming she goes first).  It will help him to have a new routine in place, and you and your sister will be better able to focus your energies productively to help each of them in these next years.  You don't have to think about this separation as permanent, but it is unrealistic, in my opinion, to insist on not moving until you have the ""right"" place.  There are many group homes for adults with Downs, and you can search online by county.  Once he is settled, you can start looking for a dementia group home or facility close to him for Mom.  Sorry you are going through this, and best of luck.   
comment 2: For your friend, what I've heard is that it's a good idea to get people with down's syndrome in a home when the parent can no longer care for them. It's even worse to move them after the parent has died, because they don't understand why mom/dad isn't there. It's a no-fun decision, but the down's syndrome kid needs to be moved to a home for that.
I used to live in CA, now I live in WI, and I'll say that finding homes for elder care in WI is much, much easier than it was in SoCal. I live in Madison, and have relatives here in a elder care facility, and one in a place between here and Milwaukee. 
Finding a facility requires leg work. Your friend will have to find assisted living places in his/her area, see if they will take mom (maybe son?), visit and tour several, and make a decision. 
There is a service called: A Place for Mom, but I found it unhelpful. 
Also, regarding the down's syndrome man, do move him. Help him and the mom Skype. Maybe video record mom having a one way conversation with down syndrome man so he can watch it every day. 
Good luck.
comment 3: This may be an interim solution while you're searching for longer term opportunities...adult day care centers provide daily care for seniors (including seniors with dementia) and adults with disabilities.  Most centers provide transportation to and from the center, in addition to taking members to daily appointments.  I know a few folks whose parents or disabled siblings attend an adult day care center.  Most centers are Medicaid Waiver providers and are credentialed by the Veteran's administration.  Hope this helps!
comment 4: As a lifelong Wisconsinite AND a mother of a disabled adult child (who has Medicate and Family Care) I suggest you get in touch with your brother's case manager. She can help you and put you in touch with other agencies that might be able to help further. DHS has many resources. My son, who is 28, lives in a great group home that Family Care helps pay for. There are plenty of middle aged and older adults in the group homes owned by the company that runs my son's home. 
Your mother won't live forever. Do your brother a favor and get the ball rolling NOW. Transition is hard for people like your brother and my son. Start now so he can move before it becomes a crisis situation.
Call the caseworker and then try this:

"Need to vent Let me know if this post doesn't belong. I'm just feeling overwhelmed.
My SO and I have been staying with my father in law and just started home health and home care services for him. And it's rough. We keep having issues with his catheter. My husband is not handling the stress of care at all; he's doing the best he can, but he's not used to taking care of people and sometimes it feels like he's someone else to take care of.
I'll finally be able to get a day tomorrow and have time to myself, which has been severely lacking. The other day, I'd just had coffee made when my FIL woke up and needed help getting up and wanted me to cook breakfast. Then the therapist came while I had sausage on the stove! That was actually kind of funny.
I have a therapy session tomorrow, but I'll only be able to go twice a month or so. We haven't heard from respite care about some time we need this weekend (we're in a wedding). It's really hard for me not to be resentful Tuesday my FIL or my husband, who ""gets"" to go to work a few days a week. 
And now this is starting to sound like Alexander's Horrible, Terrible, Very Bad Day, so sorry.
And I'm so full of questions. Can we get home care long term? What happens when my SO and I are both working? How can I convince my SO to seek help and where (neither of us has mental health insurance right now).
Sorry for the long post.
TL;DR How can I keep myself and my SO same while we take care of his father?","comment 1: You mention a catheter.  If that is a long term solution, it probably isn't appropriate to continue home care.  This person requires 24 hour, 7 day a week medical care, and it is breaking you.  You ask how you can keep yourself and your SO sane while doing this, you can't.  You don't want to put him in a nursing home, and he probably doesn't want to go to one.  But you have to consider: would he want you to ruin your lives for him?  Would you want your children to ruin their lives for you?
comment 2: Hopefully he'll get the catheter out next Tuesday. If he can't, then a nursing home would be the only option. Thanks.
comment 3: Unless you have a serious budget to worth with, in-home care isn’t a long term solution (when things progress and he requires round the clock care). It’s ideal if you can afford it, but it’s not a feasible option for a lot of people. It doesn’t seem like you are up for the task (not a criticism, just a reality - it’s a huge undertaking and it’s only going to get more demanding and require more specialized care), and if you’re going back to work you’ll need someone there all the time. Now is the time to start looking into memory care facilities and nursing homes. Don’t put off planning for this eventuality, you don’t want to get caught by surprise and not be ready. It’s super important that you talk about this together and all be on the same page. Research the options in your area and go to a financial planner. Make benchmarks, and stick to them. If the trigger for him moving to a nursing home is him not being able to use a catheter, or no longer being able to dress himself, whatever it is - talk about it. If everyone knows the plan, no one will feel betrayed or shocked when it’s followed. Find the Az resources in your area and call them, tell them you’re trying to come up with a plan and ask them for help. Best of luck to your family, I know how hard this is. Wishing you all the best 
comment 4: Thanks!

"How to respond? My mom is in her late 80s and is on the cusp of dementia (can live independently, but has forgotten things she once knew at an expert level, has mood swings, etc.). She has been living in a really nice retirement community for the last three months and it was her own choice to do so.  Once every couple of weeks she decides she wants to go back to her house (which has been on the market for a bit and is virtually empty)or she starts feeling sorry for herself (today it was “I’ve lost everything”- untrue, as most of her nice things were moved in with her).  I sometimes go to “Now, Mom, we’re not going to go there” and get accused of being not loving.   My DH & I sold our house, moved in with her and I even took early retirement so we could handle her affairs after my dad died.  If I get my brother to call and check in on her, she’s all chipper and happy.  DB is angry and sad that Mom decided rather suddenly to move to this place, but he offers no solutions, as he was content to leave me to deal with the day-to-day stuff.  He only is present for the crisis stuff and leaves as quickly as he can.  My dads cousin is around and has done a lot for her, including finding her apartment and handling the house sale, so I’m not totally alone in this.  But I am the recipient of her moodiness and self pity.
I don’t know how to respond to this—she does depend on me for a lot of things, and I don’t really want to leave her to her own devices, but I also don’t want to have a guilt trip laid on me when my DH and I have done quite a bit for her.","comment 1: You could try to turn the conversation around by asking about some times or things that you know she would associate with that - try to get some reminiscing on it - like 'Wow, I remember the flowers - they were red weren't they - did you plant them?' or a remark about how much work spring cleaning was - and if you can remember a funny story about it that could be a plus.  The idea is that reminiscing would calm her down and distract her for a while.

"Am I doing everything wrong? Rant post... sorry This is going to be a lot, and probably really long... I appreciate anyone who manages to get through some of it. I've only very rarely frequented this sub Reddit, as I've kind of just felt lost and didn't feel up to reading it all. I hope that my less-than-sugarcoated approach to writing about my experience with my mom does not offend anyone. I also wrote this over the course of several, sleep-deprived hours. We all have our coping mechanisms. I'm not great at finding humor in this still. There's a lot of dirty laundry from the past that prevents that, still. 
I'm 26 (27 in a couple months), living with my parents, and my mom has early on-set dementia. She has pretty much three settings:
1) Desperately loyal housewife: She goes to extreme lengths to please my dad, which recently included forcing her bedroom door closed while I was trying to get in to get toilet paper so I could pee at 2 in the morning. When she's like this, she's extremely paranoid about doing something to upset my dad (even though he really doesn't get mad at her.) When she's like this, she'll often make sweeping statements about how ""Oh we all love him, he's so wonderful, aren't we lucky?"" Considering the past problems our family had before my mom got sick, it's pretty tough to hear.
2) Bitter, vicious bitch: Self-explanatory. Yes, I know it's not ""really"" her, and no, I generally don't let it affect me. Our family has always had a pretty screwed up power dynamic, and my mom always had her passive-aggressive side and a hot temper. Trying to discern in my memories which times were really her and which weren't have been a thorn in my side. 
3) Confused child: Meek and confused, very much needs help to get a basic command done. We see a lot more of this these days. 
So yeah, that's my mom in a nutshell. She's been deteriorating for years, but my dad wasn't on board and was in denial right alongside her. My sister and I ended up feeling like we were in some twisted Twilight Zone where we were seeing things, maybe we were the ones going crazy, because no one else would admit to seeing what we did. Eventually my sister got a chance to move out, I didn't, and here I am. 
I've finally figured out what I want to major in and pursue in my life. I've been at the city college on and off for years, working on and off at crap jobs, going back for a semester, rinse, repeat. I've been massively depressed for more than half of my life and fell into the trap of ""well I can handle it."" Now I've aged out of my dad's insurance, I have no job, and am living off of about $800 left of financial aid until I find a job. I'm gonna be fine; my dad doesn't let me starve. He will pay for gas if he needs to. But I still feel like I'm just incredibly stupid and useless and doing it all horribly, stupidly wrong. It feels like life isn't worth living when up against the utter crap I can't seem to fix or get out of. My mom is dying, my family is screwed up, my dad is still in denial in some ways, and I just can't seem to find it in me to love anything about myself enough to think I have what it takes to have a good life. The person I always thought would be there to help me figure things out is gone. I have to work so hard to keep my emotional state hidden from my mom because all it does is make her feel upset or scared. I'm so tired.
I'm trying really, really hard to prove I'm useful to my dad, because you guessed it, living at home and not having life figured out is a huge self-esteem downer. I do as many errands as my dad throws at me, and will do them at the expense of my time, my gas, and plans I previously had. I handle all of the grocery shopping, I take my mom to appointments if he can't, I am the primary caretaker for our four animals, two cats and two dogs. While I cannot afford to pay for any of them, I schedule their vet appointments, I take them in, I medicate them for fleas and anything else that pops up. I make sure they have food and water, I clean up the litterbox and any messes. I keep my dad apprised of anything going on with them. I make sure my mom eats something. I let him know when we're low on things like dish soap, toilet paper, and paper towels. I cook cold dishes that can last for a few days at a time, most often something like a pasta salad. I try and keep track of what my mom is eating and what she isn't (anyone else have dementia family members who have new cravings every few months?) I notify him of anything out of the norm with my mom. I have worked really, really hard to avoid getting upset with my mom or losing my temper. I'm much better than I used to be, but of course could always use improvement.
None of it feels like it's ever enough. I'm still stuck at home. Despite the few moments where I feel like I'm doing enough to prove it's okay for me to be home still and figuring things out, there are always the long patches of me telling myself no, you're doing it wrong, you're useless. I live in a very expensive state, so moving out by myself is really not an option. Some days I struggle to get myself out of bed, let alone to look for a job. It induces such panic and anxiety in me to even think about going back to the dead-end jobs I used to work, but what else is there when you just have a high school diploma still? I just wish I could feel like what I'm doing is enough, but I don't. 
TLDR: My life is a mess. Triangle of take care of mom, get a job and work to save and live, and go to school are constantly at odds with each other and out of balance and I honestly just feel like I'll never be able to feel like I'm doing anything enough. My dad insists he never wanted my sister nor I to be responsible for my mom, and yet when we go over the list of everything that wouldn't get done if we stopped being involved... it goes on. We're afraid he'll wake up one day and lose his mind.
Is there anyone out there who has anything remotely similar to this situation? Thanks for reading up until now. This has all been coming on for months, and it just kind of boiled over last night with me feeling really, really awful about not having a job and my own income. I feel like such a failure, and my mom is gone and not here to help me figure out life. She walks around like a ghost with greasy hair, unkempt clothes. I can't force her to shower. I can't force her to wash her hands. I don't think she's even on a single medication related to dementia, like anti-psychotics and mood stabilizers. I can't force my dad to get a caretaker. And when we finally get one, the relief I'll feel will quickly be replaced with the realization that I no longer have a purpose in this house, and that I'm just wasting space.
Thanks.","comment 1: >there are always the long patches of me telling myself no, you're doing it wrong, you're useless.
Nope. you're doing everything right.
I'm in a different situation than you, because it's my wife who has Alzheimer's, not my mother. Your dad's not coping, but you are. Second-guessing ourselves is natural, and at times, can be helpful. Sounds like it's only causing you misery. You're earning your keep, and coping with things that no 26 year old should have to be coping with. Yet you are.
If a paid helper comes along, then you'll have decisions to make on your own behalf. But you're fighting the good fight, and I'm happy to hear all the things you're doing right. I do plenty of things wrong myself, but the only thing I can do is to try to put them behind me and do the best I can for my wife. Just as you're doing for your mom and dad. They may not be able to express their appreciation, but I bet they do appreciate what you're doing.
comment 2: I feel for you!! This is so similar to how my little sister feels. She’s 50, has no income, cares for our Mom (85, dementia) and Dad (85, bedridden, end-stage dementia). 
It’s a severely depressing lifestyle. Can you get an antidepressant for yourself? I have tried to get my sister to do this, but she doesn’t want any medical care for herself. 
It’s also chaotic, and lonely, and never-ending. No improvement. Only constant caretaking. Bleak. Dementia is a scourge. 
Your long-term plan to have a career is good. Carve out time for yourself, everyday. I know it’s difficult, and some days it’ll be impossible. Keep at it anyway. 
Fill your mind with positive thinking. Read books on it, google it, write out quotes that make you feel hopeful and tape them up all over. ‘Desiderata’ is one I recommend. 
Get out of the house. My sister has a little sanctuary for herself set up in the carport. Go for short walks. Listen to music. 
Can you imagine where your parents would be without you? You’re far from useless!! Even if a caretaker comes in, that person could never give them the love that you do. 
There’s a great resource for caregivers on YouTube. Her name is Peeta Snow and she’s awesome. Look her up. 
Take care of yourself, physically and mentally. You are so valuable. 
comment 3: Trying to find your own way in life has been greatly detoured by your mother's illness, You are of the age where what you want for yourself is perfectly normal; to be independent, working and still be a responsible family member. The fact that you have come to realize this (a bit later than you might have liked) does not mean you cannot still attain it.
You are in a very difficult and challenging situation. Dealing with a loved one's dementia is a draining, exhausting and ultimately tragic experience. There is help available and I would strongly advise you to insist to your father that it be utilized. He cannot realistically expect you to continue maintaining the home and caring for your mother to the exclusion of your own future. I would make every effort to assure him that you are not deserting him but rather you are hoping to make life easier and safer for everyone concerned. You are not abdicating responsibility. Rather, you are trying to prove yourself as an adult. As your mother's condition worsens, being better prepared to deal with it will in itself offer some peace of mind. 
There are many services available for families dealing with dementia. Some is dependent on where you live and your family's (your parents) financial situation. This can have a large bearing on what help they may qualify for. Not knowing these things, I can offer suggestions of help available where I live (US, state PA) but I am not sure if it will be applicable to your area. A few include:
The Dept. of Aging (by county) offers caregiver support, Alzheimer's Association includes care consultations, support groups, educational materials, etc., and mental health counseling for help in dealing with the stress and anxiety you are experiencing.
You indicate you have made some headway towards attaining a college degree. If so, you have accrued valuable credits. Talk to the school counselors and explain your situation. They may be able to offer resources and advice that can help you move forward.
I don't know your family dynamics but the situation you face will surely strain them even further and likely cause a further breakdown. Someone has to be in charge and that may willingly or not be you. Doing your research and being knowledgeable and dependable will better position you within your family and earn their respect. Organize your life to best reflect your position as a caregiver as well as valuing your own hopes and dreams for your future. Believe me, you will be needed for a long time, even if you bring in outside help. But don't make that your entire identity. It is only part of who you are. I hope I have helped even a little and good luck to you. I wish you the very best.

"Gps tracker I am just wondering if anyone here could recommend a reliable non bank breaking gps locator?  
My mom and sister are heading away for a holiday at the end of the summer and we are looking for something to be able to locate my mom for peace of mind. 
My mom doesn't use a smart phone but does use a standard one, so tracking apps installed on the phone are a no go.","comment 1: We use MasTrack. It has given us a piece of mind. I highly recommend checking them out. It plugs right into their car and you use the app on your phone. It’s perfect to make sure they are safe and sound. Good luck. 
https://www.mastrack.com/
comment 2: When you say 'standard' phone - do you mean a flip phone?  Because you can track a flip phone.
comment 3: [deleted]
comment 4: Well, I have my parents on my Sprint phone plan and I can track their flip phones using the Sprint family locator app on my smart phone - for you to do that you may have to add her phone to your phone account, I don't know if you can track just anyones' phone otherwise.  Check with your phone company to see what kind of deals you can get for adding a flip phone and if there are extra charges for using the locator app.   Because the phones are on my account, I could see when my father called 911 and check in on him (he forgot to pay his electric bill and the power was off - I took over paying that account as a result). When they are living some distance away this can be a good thing.
comment 5: remindMe! 1 week
comment 6: Would tile work?
comment 7: Tile doesn't work as a GPS locator. It connects to a phone via Bluetooth and uses the phones gps to see the last location of the tile.
I would recommend that you buy the cheapest Android phone possible that uses gps. Then try life 360. Probably would be cheaper than buying a standalone GPS tracking system. You would just need to make sure the phone was on her at all times. If you find something better I would like to know as well! 
comment 8: I've used it for my suitcase. The distance is very short where it works. Other people can ping her location, but the volume of people that have it differs significantly internationally.

"When did you know it was that time? My sister and I are our mother's primary caregivers and we have been for about a year at this point. We are both in our early 20s and we have no other family nearby. She has declined fairly rapidly. The other night we woke up to my mom yelling for help because she had pooped all over the floor and herself and tracked it all over the place because it was on her feet. I feel like my life is on hold. I haven't been able to pursue the dreams I had of traveling in my 20s or going to grad school. I finally think its time for her to be placed in a home so my sister and I can start living again.
When did you know it was that time?","comment 1: I'm in a similar situation as you! My sister and I are in our mid 20s and my mom has VERY rapidly declined in the last 6 months. We're trying to get finances together and we're still figuring out how  to handle things because it all happened so suddenly. She lives alone in an apartment high rise and my sister and I live 7 hours away. My mom has siblings in her city but they don't visit/aren't very involved. My mom still wants to live alone but something happened on mother's day that made me decide that she needs to move into some type of assisted or independent living. She had a UTI (the symptoms of UTIs in dementia patients is downright SCARY, which I learned on mother's day) but no one knew she had one because she's alone, and my mom was so out of it that she didn't know to ask for help  I called her to wish a happy mother's day and I didn't know what was wrong with her at the time, but she was incoherent and unable to speak. I had to call an ambulance because I have no idea what else I could do living 7 hours away. I was so scared because she also has seizures and is at risk for strokes. That's when I decided that it doesn't matter that she wants to stay living where she is in that city. She isn't safe. So I told my sister that I want my mom living in our city in a home (we're still looking at options). Hopefully that will happen within the next year.
comment 2: I went through a very similar situation with my mom as well. I was living in a different state and we didn't know she had dementia. She was getting worse and worse to the point where I knew SOMETHING was wrong. She continued to live on her own for a while, but I was on the phone with her everyday trying to coach her through daily tasks like putting her bicycle helmet on or changing a light bulb. Eventually I knew I had to move back home to help her. 
While you are in the process of getting her in a home, you should look into in-home caregiving options. If she really is declining quickly and having trouble taking care of herself, it might not be safe for her to live by herself for another year. If finances are a problem, you might want to look into medicaid. I know it differs by state, but we were able to get my mom on medicaid and they pay for the in-home caregiving we currently have.
comment 3: Yes.  this.  In-home care is less expensive and more effective, but it takes f o r e v e r to get the state to come evaluate.  Start now, before something bad happens!
comment 4: Thanks for that info. Having covered in-home caregiving would be such a godsend. I need to just suck it up and do those tasks of applying for more benefits.   I feel so guilty because I wish I could do more like move up to where she lives but Im going to school and have so many commitments that it would be hurting myself if I leave. 
comment 5: > she had pooped all over the floor and herself and tracked it all over the place because it was on her feet
That's a good sign it's time.
When we moved MIL to long term memory care unit she had a 6 second memory. She'd be in the middle of pooping and get up forgetting what she was doing. 
Obviously diapers are now warranted so maybe you can buy some time there. But MIL was wandering around the house all night, frightened, getting into trouble... like a grown adult toddler. Needing constant supervision and 
> I feel like my life is on hold
We had to sleep.
There were four grown adults at the time trying to care for her, we tried taking shifts. It just became impossible.
comment 6: Yeah we have been trying to make sure she wears diapers but she can be very stubborn and she makes a big fit about it every time. Damn it sounds like the situation you were in was worse than my Mom right now. She sleeps through the night 99% of the time. But she's definitely getting worse and worse...
Now when she goes to the bathroom, she just sits down on the toilet with her diaper still on, and just pees into the diaper.... I keep telling her she can just take the diaper off to pee and that the diaper is just in case she has an accident... but she doesn't seem to get it. UGHHHHH

"Son living away from father with congestive heart failure Can you recommend a good app/tool/system for  helping a person with congestive heart failure monitor their symptoms on an ongoing basis and for a caregiver to monitor their progress?
For context: my father, 67, recently experienced heart failure that doctors say was brought on by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (read: no blockages or cholesterol problems). 
His cardiologist instructed him to monitor his weight, fluid and sodium intake daily. He's done a great job of tracking so far, but he's using pen and paper which I fear he could lose. Using pen and paper also makes it difficult for his doctors, my family and I to monitor and support him in his efforts from afar.
This Sunday, I'll be leaving my dad (he lives on the East Coast, U.S.) to return to the West Coast (U.S.), where I  live . Before then, I to make sure we have a dependable system in place and figure someone here might have gone through something similar and has advice to offer.
Some more details about everything below, but if any more information would be helpful please please ask Sorry this got so long...
I am looking for something that will:
1) Help the **patient** (my dad) easily log their weight, sodium intake and fluid intake, daily
2) Allow the **caregiver** (me) to monitor the patient's logs in real-time
3) Prominently display the **patient's** weight, fluid and sodium intakes in the app
Thus far, it seems diet and weight tracking apps are best suited to accommodate the workflows we're after. And of the  apps we've looked at, MyFitnessPal and LoseIt! are top for they both allow for weight, fluid and sodium intake logging. However, they  feel quite bloated and neither allow you to include fluids in your primary goal tracking dashboard among other things.","comment 1: What about just setting up a shared Google spreadsheet? You can put a shortcut to it right on the screen of his phone (at least in Android - not sure about Apple?). You can do stuff with autoformatting to highlight cells where any particular figure is way high (or low) that would let you see in a glance if there's a problem.
Something else I'm really a fan of is Alexa devices - get a pair of Amazon Echo Spots, one for each of you. That allows you to ""drop in"" on him any time you want to check in on him. A lot of people are stressing about privacy and all that, and I get that - but for a caregiver that's not on-site, they are a godsend. Your dad doesn't have to do anything - you tell your Spot to drop in on him, and it automatically connects and you get a view of wherever you've got it set up. If you put it someplace central, he/you can even hear from pretty much anywhere nearby.
Hope that helps - good luck to you both!
comment 2: Woah. This is the first I've heard of the ""drop in"" feature...super neat.
As for Google Sheets, auto-formatting is a wonderful idea. And in case you were curious, you can set a shortcut on iOS :)
For now, we've been using Apple's Notes app for sodium and fluid tracking. It's worked well in so far as he's  comfortable with the app and it does collaboration relatively well. IMO, there are obvious shortcomings, but as I'm coming to learn, whatever helps keep up his habit works for me.
We did however order a wifi scale , so we'll see how that works.  Thank you for your thought :)

comment 4: That sounds useful, I hadn't heard of that before, thanks for sharing!
comment 5: It's not exactly high-tech but I recently bought some motion-sensor lamps on amazon, they were really inexpensive..less than £10 each. I put a few around the house (bathroom, bedroom, upstairs landing) so if my mom wakes up in the night and wanders around they'll come on and prevent her falling over anything etc. It also prevents her turning on every light in her path and then leaving them all on as she returns to bed at 3am.. It's also a good indicator for me if I see a dim light come on in the hallway I know that she's up and about. Very very helpful. Would be really keen to get other ideas too!

"OVERWHELMED ON MOTHER’S DAY! I need to vent!  I initially wrote this to ask Crohn’s sufferers how to handle issues with my newly diagnosed son of 22 yrs old... but I have MS and am caught in a family drama with my son & husband.  I am new to Reddit & didn’t know where I should seek support... I decided to post in here instead of directly on the Crohn’s forum.  Here are my issues, and I am shaking with so many emotions.  I don’t know if I’m angry with my husband, my son, MYSELF, or just plain confused and hurt.  I am desperately seeking advice:
Dear Crohn sufferers.
I first want to say how helpless, horrible & guilty I feel about passing on this crappy set of genes to my (almost) 22 year-old son... his father’s family may have had something to do with it, too, because there have been some similar symptoms on that side of the family, as well.  But who knows?!   Regardless of who, how, why:  It is what it is, and nobody deserves this insidious disease.  
I feel so terrible that anyone suffers with this disease or ANY disease for that matter.  It’s NOT fair.  It’s difficult.   It’s scary.  And it’s definitely NOT fun, either... My son has explained quite a lot to me about this life-long, chronic disease.  He was recently dxd with it about a year ago, and we are all trying to learn about the do’s and don’ts... we are all TRYING to educate ourselves, too... as well as TRYING to comfort & console him.  He helps me, too, while trying to deal with his Crohn’s.  I love, appreciate and admire him... But his bad days are so difficult to handle.  Heck, it’s over my pay grade, so to speak.  I’m a mother.  I’m not a doctor, scientist or a specialist.
Secondly, I’d like to add that as a mother who was dxd with Multiple Sclerosis ~eleven years ago... I’m fighting my own battle, along with his battle.  I’m managing my symptoms and I’m doing my best to help him.  Our diseases are VERY different, I’m learning, but a few things are the same or at least similar:  We BOTH need support systems, and both diseases encounter fatigue and have horrible reactions to stress.  We both need to make choices about how to spend our limited energy during the course of a day; And we both deal with the frustration of having to educate & re-educate even the closest of family members & friends, over and over again.  It was one thing when it was just me with a chronic illness, but it’s downright overwhelming for me worrying about my son’s pain, too.  Any mother understands that you’re only as happy as your saddest child.  Therefore, I can’t imagine how my son feels at this young of an age... my heart aches for him... I was 40 when I was dxd.
Getting to the point...  I am the mom, and I need to know how to balance both of our diseases without arguing and defending myself constantly as he plays the blame-game with me.  And yes, he HAS come right out and blamed me for his “bad genes.”  
Can any of you give me advice as to how I should speak to my son without offending him?  From my point of view, I’m listening and trying to comprehend everything he’s explaining to me — with his precise & medically technical approach — to the best of my ability... and often late at night he decides that he wants to talk about it... I have no problem listening, talking & answering his questions... if he didn’t have such a hair-trigger temper as I’m trying to comprehend the barrage of information, discussions and questions he’s throwing at me at 1, 2, 3, 4am, etc.  This last episode, I kept telling him that I didn’t know the answer to his specific questions over & over the other night.  He kept badgering me about it & I felt trapped in my own kitchen with him when he wouldn’t let the topic go.  My feet were swollen and I just needed to sit down.  I found out later that I didn’t know the answer, because I was in the hospital during the time in question with a broken back and wasn’t even involved in this particular fixation he had that night.  But he kept on and on and on all night long.  I finally had to yell at him to go to bed & stop being mean to me.
I TRY VERY HARD to be extremely supportive of whatever he needs... emotionally, food-wise, medicine-wise, etc.  But like him... I’m trying to handle my own disease as well as trying to be supportive with his disease... and also convince other family members of both of our special needs... why he needs certain foods, etc., and why I need the air conditioner set at a certain temperature so that the messages can be sent from my brain to my limbs in order for them to work.    They’re both invisible diseases that most people don’t completely understand..  
He perceives everything I say in response to his explanations as me being a know-it-all; argumentative; and he goes off on me all the time... zero-60... (he says I do the same to him).  I am willing and WANTING to talk with him, listen to him, learn with him... most times.  However, since he calls me names and says I’m “lazy” & that “life is better without me,” etc., WHILE I’m listening or responding to him and trying to understand his questions, fears and frustrations... I’m feeling so physically & mentally drained... and frankly, verbally abused, that it’s not easy to be there for him.  It’s hard to hug a porcupine, so to speak, and want to come back for more.  Yet I do come back and keep trying... as does he... but we wind up escalating each time.  He judges the medication I take when I don’t answer him in the way he wishes me to do, but expects me to tolerate his own method of pain relief (which I do)... and then his dad walks in during the worst of times... always... and then he’s involved.  His dad then pours his nightcap... and then takes his side and walks out angry for the night, leaving me thinking, what the hell just happened?  How does my listening and attempting to answer his questions when he engages the discussion, turn into ME being the sole, causative factor for everyone’s upset?  My husband/his dad wasn’t even around for the FIVE OR MORE CALM RESPONSES before I’d had enough and rose my voice to match his.  (Which I’m accountable for my piece, but don’t feel that I should be talked to so disrespectfully from anyone I’m trying to help, let alone my own son in my own house.)
So, is this how everyone is treating their well-meaning loved ones?  I’m not asking in a snappy way, I promise... I know with MS, for me, I had a LOT of misfirings, feelings that I can only describe as electrical shock, pain and confusion during my flares... especially during my initial diagnoses... I spoke backwards & was temporarily paralyzed on my entire right side & wasn’t exactly jumping for joy about my disease.  I’ve had plenty of broken bones and absolutely had my cranky days.  But I was very positive and appreciative of anyone helping me on most days... and I’d have NEVER even thought to blame my parents for bad genes or tell them they were useless & lazy... and that nobody wants them in the house.  I think my dad might have thrown me across the room or out of the house, had I talked to my mom that way under ANY circumstance... disease or no disease!  So, I’m genuinely wondering if this is a Crohn’s symptom or just plain frustration on his part?  I do not have Crohn’s, and I don’t ever claim to know exactly what he is going through.  He says that I never help him one day... and the next day, I’m his best friend and the ONLY ONE who bothers to understand and talk to him.  He says he needs me to talk with him, then during the same conversation, he says he hates talking to me and says how worthless I am to the family.  He is sending out so many mixed messages... loves me, hates me.  Talk, don’t talk.  Best friend, worthless.  It’s exhausting.
Sorry so long... I know you are all suffering from Crohn’s and seeking support.  As a parent and a fellow member of the “silent disease” club... I WANT to know what I can actually do differently or better to help my son without always setting him off.  I feel like I’m walking on eggshells or glass, and we are both getting so upset, stressed and fatigued as a result of our encounters.  And frankly, I’m not going to accept being continually demeaned anymore by someone I’m trying to help, unless this is a symptom that will pass once the meds start to work.  Having a disease does not give a person a license to be an asshole indefinitely to others.  It will take me two days to recover my own emotions from being verbally hammered all night long.  After the long night & zero sleep, I tried to find my husband to talk to and found instead, four bedrooms that someone had left like a hurricane hit.  Then I get wound up again because I have zero energy left to figure out what happened, by whom and why.  I see broken items of sentimental value and broken items all over the place and can’t figure out why everything is spinning out of control.  With my lack of sleep, I’m not able to think straight anymore, which in turn, makes everyone angry at me again.  My husband and son literally left me and have been gone two days now...   Happy Mother’s Day!   Such a low blow, I believe.  
How do other families handle these issues?  Does one person run the show?  Does the newest sick person get to say how much more their disease is debilitating than yours, like it’s a contest?
Being a family member with a chronic illness IS tough, someone said in this forum.  It’s especially tough if two of the three family members in the household have these chronic issues, and the healthiest of the three won’t help de-escalate a situation... in fact, it makes it worse for the family... we should all be helping each other as a team, right?  Two in distress... one gives an assist, knowing that you’ll get the assist when you need it, too?  Be the hero of the family team to get the family team back on track?  I don’t like this whole take this side or that side... we are ALL escalating issues and not solving a darn thing, so there’s always one family member on the out.  Nobody is working as a team over here... but in my opinion, if it comes down to utter disrespect... my husband ought to sit my son down and tell him not to talk to his mother like that under any circumstances.  Right?  Wrong?  It’s like the tail is wagging the dog over here.  Am I being too self-righteous?  I just don’t know anymore.
Any suggestions as to what I can do to make things better for him, short of having to endure being verbally demeaned?  Or advice for my husband as to how he can help in an effective way for the benefit of every member of the family when there is discord in the house?  And are my son’s responses to me typical of a Crohn’s patient in a flare?  I’m the go-to person for so many friends & family members, but I can’t seem to get it right in my own household with the people I love the most.
Thank you for reading.  I apologize if this is not the appropriate place for a family member to purge frustrations or seek advice/answers.  I’m hoping that the best people to ask are those who have the same disease.","comment 1: Disclaimer: I don’t have your disease or your son’s and this may sound simplistic but —Family Counseling! Someone to help defuse the high emotions and help with communication skills? You sound so overloaded and I am sorry you are having such a difficult day. I am primary caregiver for a son with leukemia and it’s hard work to love someone so much and see them suffer. Absolutely in that boat with you. I hope things improve for you. Perhaps your son would be supported by being in communication with others with his disease. I didn’t know there was a subreddit for individual diseases. Hang tough. I wish I could say it gets better but I do think that handling it gets better with time. Take care of you. 
comment 2: I second the suggestion for family counseling. It sounds like it might be difficult to figure out what parts of the emotions from everyone are the medical issues; and what parts are genuine, real, valid responses to being dealt a tough hand in life--emotions which have not yet found a proper ""home,"" if that makes sense. Sending virtual hugs to all.

"i just need to get this out of my system the word dementia has been something that i've always grown up hearing. about half of the people on my dad's side of the family has/or is going to have dementia. My great uncle and aunt both were had and died of it, my aunt has it, my great grandma had and died of it, my grandma has it and so on and so forth. my dad grew up in a family of denial, nobody accepts what illness they have because basically illness is equal to weakness in their eyes. over the past 2 years i've noticed a change in my father's (currently 61) behavior, he asks questions frequently, is quick to anger and has lost the little amount of patience he had to begin with. my dad was diagnosed with REM sleep disorder 9 months back, he takes over 12mg of melatonin each night but still screams and thrashes in his sleep every night. my mom took him down to mayo for a checkup on the sleep disorder and the doctors had bad news. because the episodes still happen each night they think he's on track to developing a brain degenerative disorder (parkinsons or dementia with lewy body). he has a 30% chance of developing one now, a 75% chance of it happening within the next 5 years and a 90% chance of developing one in 10 years. i honestly just dont know what to do or say at this point. my mom is making us set routine around the house and making us set up structure and boundaries so he can be comfortable. i'm 16, i've had the hardest year of my life so far recently and this has just put the icing on the cake for me. the fact that he most likely either wont be able to walk me down the aisle at my wedding or even recognize me in a few years is eating me alive. every time it crosses my mind that he's sick everything around me turns black and i get lightheaded. the worst thing about this is that he's super embarrassed about it and has the mentality that he's weak so he doesn't want anyone to know, except my siblings and my mom, so i cant talk to about it to any of my friends until it gets bad and i can no longer hide it. I've had boyfriends pick up on his behavior before, they've asked me why he asks so many questions. im not super close with my dad since his personality changed but because i was his only daughter i would spend the most time with him, bikerides, walks, football games, church, you name it. i'm just sick of this and i really just need some advice on how to cope with it because the future i had planned for myself has disappeared. my grandparents have dementia and it's put a bunch of stress on my dad to help care for them because my grandpa hates his care facility and all the staff in it. i havent visited them in months because their room smells of urine and my grandma always confuses me as her daughter who died at around the age i am. i just want him to go back to the way he was 5 years ago. sorry if this is disturbing to anyone who has dementia but i feel really lost and because i cant counsel myself in a friend i just needed to vent and get this out of my system. and for those who were in the same place at one point, what do you do?","comment 1: First let me say I'm so sorry that you're dealing with all of this at your age. Dementia is so hard. I have a story similar to yours and can empathize with how overwhelmed and sad you must be right now. You mentioned that you have a church. That's an important part of my life too. I would really encourage you to seek support from your community of faith. Do you have a youth minister or pastor you can talk to about what is going on and how you're feeling?  Advice I can give you from my experience - do what you can to take care of your own emotional and spiritual wellbeing (listen to music you love, journal, yoga, go for walks, etc.). But the most import thing piece of advice I can give you is this - if indeed your dad does have some form of dementia, you need to understand now that his personality may change or certain personality characteristics may become more exaggerated (this has been my experience). IF this happens be quick to forgive and liberal with your grace and patience. 
comment 2: You have my complete sympathies and wishes to make it through this. Dementia is also strong in my family, so when my mother first started going downhill I was beside myself in grief. So sad to be losing someone I loved so much. Afraid of the changes to come. I then found out that though she was a different person, I loved her just as much. As she goes through the stages she always loves me as much as she's able to. I hope you are able to put up with the anger and nastiness that your father is going through long enough to be able to see that. Also don't give up hope about his attitude. When my uncle who I was also caregiver of first started going downhill he was extremely difficult, became quite an asshole in fact! As the dementia went on he actually became a really friendly, peaceful guy 4 a while. You never know what past the future holds. Keep your fingers crossed and look for each little bit of good things to keep yourself from depression over this. You are awfully young to go through this, what the hottest fire makes the strongest Steel.
comment 3: This is really awful. 
You need to find a local support group that can help you find good local solutions and people to talk with.  Call it as a study group when you tell your folks you're going out, because it is.  Be anonymous there so nobody connects it with your family.  The right kind of support may be the difference in whether you get through this whole or broken. 
When my gramma got dementia I decided I'd end my own life with dignity instead of ending up in a piss-smelling room staring at walls if it ever happened to me.  Third-to-last good day is when I'll do it, before I don't have the capabaility any more.  Is your family talking about death with dignity?  Feel free to yell at me or gasp or just ignore this if it's too much to deal with.  It's a rough idea, but there's not much use in hiding from reality when you live with it like you do.  
Please take care of yourself.  
comment 4: Look at alz.org - you might be able to find a local support group that could help.   
comment 5: Hi.  
I completely understand and resonate with the things you're going through because of the dementia in your family.  I have gone through a similar ordeal, and it took me a great while to find peace with myself and how to handle the dementia with my father, which has torn apart his life and much of our family.
The most important discovery for me was understanding that none of this is my father's fault and most of the fears, aggravation, embarrassment, frustrations, disappointments, and so-forth are directly under my control.  Moreover, I realized that I was letting the issues this generated within myself and our family negatively affect my relationship with and how I treated my father.
I could write about this much more at length, but I just want to point out a few things, even though they may be trite by some standards (it's hard to know where anyone is when it comes to how we view dementia, especially when it is within our close family) and sorry if I am too abrupt or frank:
1. Don't care what your boyfriends think.  Why should what someone else thinks about your father having dementia affect you in any way?  As it is, most people don't understand and make light of dementia as much as people do the same with, say, misunderstood mental illness.  People can think of those with Dementia (as well as the family for the changes they make to accommodate it) as just plain weird.

That's just people reacting to anything different in a negative manner, and there is a lot of people that will tell you what you ""should"" do.  
A true friend (to you, your family, and your Dad) would jump right in with a positive attitude even if it is a little awkward at first.  Sometimes people reflect off of our attitudes as well -- in other words, my advice is to not worry about what people think and they will get strength from you to be your friend.  If not, then forget them anyway.
2. Not visiting your grandparents because the place smells like urine.  I don't want to be too forward here, but this does hit me at home a little bit, with my father being in a nursing home where I constantly have to smell many similar things, if not worse, on a regular basis.

Why not visit your grandparents because you're uncomfortable?  Think of how they feel being in a place like that.  Nursing homes can be awful places, especially for those that cannot help with their own personal grooming and other habits, as they also lose their voice to make changes.    
I don't know what your grandparent's situation is in terms of possibly taking them outside, or opening a window for a while, etc.  Whatever their status is, visiting would make their lives better, which makes it more about them -- which, in turn, does come back to make it about you and feeling good for helping someone else out.
3. Enjoy what you have now.  My father is not the same person he was a few years ago.  It took me a long time to figure out that the real person is still in there, with the same feelings, plus a whole lot more -- he is much more like a child and needs to be taken care of as such.  However, that has allowed me to form a new relationship.  In many ways, our roles have reversed and I act like his parent -- he calls me his father every once in a while.  Sometimes he thinks I'm his brother, or my brother.  However, even when he does mistake me for someone else, it is clear the feeling of family and that a ""I like this person being here"" mentality is still there.  Just because he may forget who I am doesn't diminish the value of our relationship, or my desire to help him have a higher quality of life.

4. Constantly look for new avenues.  We often hear a lot of stories about people with dementia -- screaming, agitation, blank stares, etc.  This does happen and, in many cases, there is not much you can do about it as it is a genuine cognitive breakdown.  However, it's amazing what little changes can do.  For example, there is one case where a women was completely upset and agitated when her family changed her clothes.  Well, you have to change someone's clothes, so what could they do?  it took a while, but they realized it was because it was different clothes.   As soon as they realized that they just needed a few separate sets of the same exact clothes, everything was fine.   In my Dad's case, he was getting very upset at staff in the nursing home.  I like the staff in this nursing home, but they do need much better training.  I finally realized it was because they were pulling a curtain behind him unannounced, which triggered him (this is classic Dementia behavior, by the way).    Once I was able to convince the staff to not walk behind my father without announcing themselves, things were much better.

5. Listen. The issue with the people walking behind my father was one of 50+ things we discovered over time (like making sure the tv stayed on CNN at all times, or leaving the light on, or closing the curtains, etc. etc.).  This is the way it is with Dementia, and the smallest thing (like a stuffed animal, for some) can make a night-and-day difference in how they feel and how they relate to others.  Some of it is obvious (look up triggers for dementia, for example), while others take a lot of listening.

6. It's their universe; learn how to listen.  This was probably the hardest part of understanding that I was placing my view of the way things should be on my father, which was simultaneously not helping him and causing me to be upset and frustrated.  Things that seemed painfully obvious wouldn't work.  I needed to learn to listen and understand how he relates to his world (a subject that needs a lot more writing space).  Once I did that, things became much easier.  I've been much more at peace with things, and my father has a much better quality of life.

Don't get me wrong -- his life is still awful and Dementia is such a scourge.  However, is life is 10 times better with the efforts in understanding what works for him and letting go of any expectations on who and what he should be that we once had.
Anyway, I just thought I'd throw some thoughts out there.  I guess my basic message is that, while Dementia is horrible and a strain on the family, there are ways to deal with it that can make it so much better for many with Dementia, and much easier on the family taking care of them.
I think the idea (from other people) of a support group is great!  Being able to talk to others with the same situation makes our seem so much easier to handle -- and definitely a little less lost.

"Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation My mother-in-law has been declining with worsening memory loss, confabulation, cognitive function loss, and worsening self care in a dramatic way for 2-3 years. She has three sons. One of them has been aware of the situation and trying to help for a long time. He recently said she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's more than ten years ago, before her husband died. At that time, they set up a living trust and POA papers, but the rest of the family were not told about the diagnosis. My fil passed away, and mil has been on her own for seven years. She has steadfastly denied anything was wrong with her and refused any and all help, even minor, common sense measures. She has poisoned family relationships through paranoid/confabulated stories of abuse. She speaks negatively of all family members behind their backs, and this has poisoned family relationships because people have believed her stories rather than talking to each other.
She hasn't been able to manage her own medications consistently for several years. Last year, I took initiative and with her permission and cooperation, I found her an automated medication dispenser. She paid for it with her own credit card and agreed to use it. I also went with her to a doctor's appointment, with her permission, after I talked to her about concerns about her memory and she agreed she shared the same concerns. At the appointment, we saw a PA who confronted me about why I was there, told my mil she ""didn't need anyone to go to appointments with her"" and gave a mini-mental status exam that I'm pretty sure she assisted mil to pass. Then declared her as having ""only normal age-related memory loss."" At this time, I didn't know about the longstanding Alzheimer's diagnosis and neither did that medical practice. She ended up putting the medication dispenser somewhere and forgetting it existed. A couple months later, my husband pulled it out from under a desk and she was shocked. Didn't recognize it. Had never seen such a thing.
Each time a family member has tried to get involved in her care, mil has initially been receptive, and then refused to share information about her appointments and removed any information releases she had previously signed so we could not know anything about her health care. She had breast cancer and was going to all of her appointments alone, refusing help, unable and/or unwilling to tell us what treatments she was receiving, what her prognosis was, or anything. She could not tell us anything about her many health problems. She has insisted some of her doctors came into the exam room and sat silently staring at her before leaving without a word. 
She has not been compliant with her meds. She is prescribed many medications. She does not take them on schedule and sometimes takes too many. Until last fall she was still driving. She only lost her license because I called and reported her to the DMV. She failed the road test abysmally, but thinks she was done wrong and had her license revoked unfairly. 
Now she has had an incident where she locked herself out of the house and spent 24-hours outdoors before anyone missed her. She lives way out in the country on her own and has repeatedly said she would rather die than move OR have any professionals come into the home to help her. Her doctor ordered a visiting nurse and she refused the service.
We are the long distance family. The two local sons are not dealing well with the situation. One knew about the dementia and has been trying to help for years. His reward for all of his effort was for mil to tell everyone that he's been trying to put her in a nursing home and steal her property. The other son has been in total denial and has avoided the situation until recently. Now he's jumped in and is taking her to doctor's appointments, which is great, but is also actively getting in the way and raging out regularly. He is still in denial about the dementia and thinks she ought to be living on her own and STILL DRIVING. He recently threw a fit because his wife told him I was the one who reported her to the DMV. He confronted my husband about it and ended up punching a wall. He also got in an argument with his mother and pulled back a fist to punch her. My husband had to jump in between them, and he put down his hand, but it's really got us shook up. I have no regrets about reporting her to the DMV. The idea of her behind the wheel of a vehicle is terrifying. 
We finally found the living trust and DPOA paperwork after searching the house for over a year. (Her paperwork is a mess--she hasn't paid her taxes yet and we have no idea what's happening with her bills). But these documents require all the brothers to cooperate and that is not happening. The ragey brother goes to her doctor's appointments with her, he is making medical decisions for her via bullying--not the DPOA that she and her husband prepared when she was still competent--and he is making financial decisions for her. He is refusing care on her behalf as doctors and social workers are increasingly attempting to intervene. The burned out apathetic brother is not participating because he is stressed out and thinks his dead father meant for him to be in charge of everything, even though the paperwork has all three names on it.
We have consulted our own lawyer and are trying to find our way through this mess. It's beyond frustrating and heartbreaking. We know now that the years of conflict in the family have been created by the mother's paranoia and confabulations--every time something happened that upset her, she would blame somebody and make up a wild story about why they were at fault. Until recently, her stories were mostly plausible. It's very difficult to navigate all of the hurt feelings and damaged relationships. Most of us understand now that it was never personal, but ragey brother is causing a lot of problems with his behaviors. He also packs a pistol everywhere he goes and has bragged about brandishing it in order to intimidate others. He's never pulled his gun on us yet, but obviously the fact that he's showing up armed to family discussions and raging out is making it difficult to advocate for his mother in the face of his bad decisions, gatekeeping, and poor understanding of her limitations. Rage bro is also lecturing her and trying to train her to stop her dementia behaviors.
She's not safe in the house. There's nothing keeping her from getting locked out again. She has free access to a stove, many appliances, stairs, bathrooms, etc. where she could get hurt. And she's making a mess of her medications. She is due to finally get a neuropsych eval in May, but her condition is obvious and every doctor she's seen lately has acknowledged she obviously has dementia. Rage bro and his wife are still hanging on that evaluation, though, and are holding up addressing her safety needs until they get their ""proof.""
I think we're doing everything we can. It's a nightmare. We spent last weekend with her after she had some teeth pulled, and then we had to just leave her home alone, where she is clearly not safe, because the local brothers think that's ok. Rage bro bought her a medical alert device from Walmart, but we're expecting about the same success with that as the medication dispenser. She's insulted by the idea of it, and it needs daily charging, as well as her to cooperate with wearing it and remember to wear it.
Has anyone else been through this? Any thoughts?","comment 1: Well, that sounds like hell. Sorry you're going through this! It sounds like you are doing all you can.
Are there neighbors you can ask to keep an eye out? We asked the longtime neighbors of my grandma to keep an eye on her and let us know if something seemed wrong. This was when we started getting nervous about her being by herself and she of course was refusing help. She was in early stages at this point, and we had no idea. One would run the car which she no longer used and chatted with her once in a while. The other would drop by for a chat, cup of tea, or to retrieve a ball one of the kids had thrown over the fence. If she's really rural, that might not work. Is she religious? Ask a pastor or priest to drop by.
You can try calling APS to see if they can help start a fire under peoples butts. 
Can you get your lawyer to explain to Ragey about liability from grandma? Or can you call a doctor and ask him to lecture Ragey about it next time they go for a visit.
Call the cops and let them know that grandma is having issues. At my local dept families could send in a picture and info about vulnerable adults. Anytime a call came in from that address the cops could pull it up and see what was going on. Cops could call family members about what was going on with the vulnerable adult. My dept also has the RUOK program which is an auto call system that calls seniors every morning and sends out an officer if there is no response. Limited use in keeping her safe, but at least someone would come in the morning.
Can you have someone install an auto shutoff for the stove?
comment 2: She doesn't have very many neighbors and the situation is beyond what an occasional check in would solve. She needs someone to dispense meds three times a day, for example. I'm not sure any kind of reasoning would help with Ragey. At this point I feel like he's going to either come to acceptance in his time or not. He got a 45 minute lecture from a social worker, and that hasn't changed anything that I can see. Our hands are tied right now from speaking with her doctors because there's no information release or medical DPOA on file. My husband has one, but it needs to be signed by all three brothers to execute, we think. We're asking our lawyer if only one brother can sign and use it. People are calling her every day, so that's covered. I'm not sure what an auto shutoff for the stove is, but we could look into that. Thank you!
comment 3: Your story and my story have some similar elements. My MIL has an undiagnosed mental illness that she’s had her whole life (probably a personality disorder.) She was diagnosed with “mild dementia” about 5 years ago, but to us it was just a continuation of what has been going on her whole life, just with more confusion. 
She also talks badly about whoever just left the room. She has played my husband and his two sisters against each other their whole lives. His youngest sister has always been their mother’s enabler, and helped her hide her obvious mental illness and villified anyone who dared point it out, no matter how kind the approach and intention.
We are also the long distance family members, with my husband’s two sisters nearby their mom. We had financial POA for years, and I managed to get things straightened out and even got her approved for Medicaid which got her some home care and eventually covered her nursing home costs. Her condition has definitely worsened over the years, mostly because my husband’s enabling sister has Medical Proxy, and won’t let them give her any neuro-psych meds or be seen by that doctor. She’s showing signs of increasing frontotemporal dementia: getting aggressive and being sexually inappropriate. She also wets her bed every night and refuses to let them change the sheets until the next day. Still, my husband’s sister swears it’s not the dementia and that she’s just unhappy in the nursing home. 
So, out of the blue, his sister has a lawyer draw up a new POA that put her in charge, and their mom told us (after whispering that she’s not supposed to tell us) that his sister is working on getting an apartment for the two of them to live in together. Oh...did I mention that his sister has MS and is disabled and needs daily care herself?
Yeah, so basically it’s a shit show, and we have no power to do anything anymore, and now his mother tells us to f-ck off when we talk to her on the phone and tells my husband I’m a b-tch and he never should have married me. We had a very good relationship for many years (I’ve been with my husband 18 years.) Now she blames me for everything that goes wrong.
The only advice I have for you, is to think about getting guardianship of your MIL. Bring whatever evidence you have to court that your husband’s brothers are neglecting her needs. Or, you can do what we have done, which is to let them have their dysfunctional mess, and get your own therapy to deal with the pain of watching it all happen. If your husband’s family is anything like my husband’s family, they will find a way to ruin you if you try to take control. For us, it was too big of a chance to take. It is extremely painful, though, for my husband and I to watch, and we try to offer whatever comfort we can to her that she will accept. 
You could also call adult protective services anonymously, but you’ll have to weigh that with the possibility that they might know it was you because of your previous action with her driver’s license.
Whatever you choose, know that I am with you in spirit, and wishing for the peace and safety of all of the family members involved.
comment 4: Oh that sounds miserable and pretty similar. MIL does not have a personality disorder, but has had untreated depression her whole life. Before the dementia, she was kind and generous and if she gossiped some, she also tried to speak well of others and build relationships. Looking back, we can kind of see where the paranoia kicked in with various conflicts with extended family, communication breaking down, etc. 
We have been going back and forth between calling APS and petitioning for guardianship. Guardianship is hard for us because we'd have to move her to a facility in our town, and that would effectively cut her off from the rest of her family, friends, and everyone she ever knew. That's not something we want to do to her. APS is a hard choice for us because we feel responsible for her, so it's like we're calling APS on ourselves, you know? Like, if we feel so concerned about her wellbeing, then we should go to court and do what is needed to take care of her. But then we come full circle to the problem of moving her away from the rest of the family. I'm also not sure APS would be at all helpful. In the past few years, I've tried getting help from child protective services twice for children I know that are being neglected, and CPS did nothing. Thank you for the support.
comment 5: APS is limited in what it can do. If your MIL basically tells them she’s fine and to bug off, there’s not much they can do (without a court order.) I’m not sure what it would take to raise things to that level. If rage brother is the caretaker, you’d be calling them to investigate whether he is being abusive, not on yourselves. It’s different than CPS.
We had the same concern about moving my MIL closer to us (and also my FIL who is mostly recovered from a stroke but lives in a different nursing home.) It’s a difficult decision to weigh the pros against the cons. Just make sure you’re not opening yourself up to the threat of violence against you from other family members. 
Are there some kind of assets/inheritance that are involved, that is making the rage brother be so protective? 
comment 6: The very ironic thing is that there are assets, but rage brother doesn't seem to know about them. He's been preoccupied with ownership of minor, nearly worthless belongings on the property, like an old fishing boat that's probably not even worth $1000. But when she passes he's likely to inherit several hundred thousand dollars. There's lots of odd concern by both of the local brothers about her not being able to afford care, etc., as if she is poor, or as if her only asset is the house. She is quite well off, though. I think for some reason they trusted us to talk about finances, but did not discuss it with the others. Possibly because we have done well for ourselves and never asked them for financial help.

"Looking for input for School Project Hi everyone,
I am currently an engineering student in University and would like to seek the inputs of everyone regarding a project I am working on. I am currently in the midst of developing a tracking device that could be attached to the shoe in an inconspicuous way, and one of key features I am trying to go for is to make it require as little charging as possible.
Would such a product be of interest for your love ones that are still active but risk getting lost outside?
Any feedbacks would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!","comment 1: Yes absolutely. This kind of item is exactly what I wish we had. Something that is small and goes in/on the shoe and requires little charging time. My mother is in a care home and I doubt the workers would remember to charge a device, and my mother has trouble learning new routines so it might depend on my occasional visits for charging a device.

"What gadgets do you recommend to help someone with dementia? I've read about using an Echo or Alexa to help my mom with dementia, but her english is poor and she won't remember what it does in order to use it. I'm looking for something similar to an iPad, something with a screen, that displays the day, time, photos, and perhaps notes about the day. Something that can remain on her nightstand and she can see first thing in the morning.
Anybody know of any gadgets similar to this? Or any recommendations of your own? ","comment 1: iPad has a feature (kindle fire does too) that allows you to lock the device to a single app. I use one with Netflix for my partner who has Alzheimer’s . Tv remotes are too much for him but touching what he wants to watch is easy.  He often can’t figure out how to change it once the show is on, but it’s better than nothing. 
comment 2: I originally didn't want an iPad as she's had trouble with them before and they become frustrating, but I may have to look into that. It's not really meant to be played with, just something that can be glanced at and has small details (date/time/maybe changes into photos occasionally) on it. Thanks for the tip!
comment 3: In that case a digital picture frame would be better. The iPad will require a lot of minding from you/caregivers, especially if your loved one can’t process things like battery alerts. 
comment 4: I have a call blocker on my mom's line.  It syncs with my phone.  She only gets calls that I have contacts for.  I will get its name when I get home. It's software for your phone is a pain.  But so nice 
comment 5: It says iOS only since the software has to be on a IPhone and not ipad.  The software task over your phone.  I use andriod.   The app has like 20 icon in it, but one hooks to this device via blue tooth.  I have it set to just not ring the phone so they go to voice mail.

comment 6: There are digital calendars/clocks which show the day (in numbers and spelled out), the month, and the time. Most are available in various languages. I use one for my grandma. 
I'm not sure we're allowed to post link but if not, a mod can remove it? Here's an example of such a gadget (from Amazon).
I don't know if you can find a tool with all those characteristic, but my guess is that it'd be way easier to get the clock and a digital photo frame. 
comment 7: I would “keep it simple, stupid.” Digital picture frame, simple clock, “life alert” style necklace, maybe an iPad. Introducing new technology when someone is experiencing dementia may just be frustrating or upsetting for them. 
comment 8: We gave my MiL a digital photo frame and she loved it when we gave it to her, seemed so excited to see all the family photos we'd put in it. We've never seen it again, and have no idea where she's hidden it.
We've given her colouring books and other 'things' to do, including knitting and crochet - which she was so good at. We've tried all sorts of things to get her to interact with her surroundings or to just 'do something', but not one thing has ever stayed in sight and/or been used. Nothing.
She hides everything, probably as soon as we're out of the door, and then tells us it's 'disappeared'.
We've tried putting notes on her fridge, tried giving her a new and updated address book so she can find family phone numbers more easily - she claims her phone is broken and that it's a conspiracy to stop her using it. We bought her a clock that showed the days of the week in big letters, and attached it to the wall. It vanished and not even her carers will admit to taking it down.
We think that all she does when she's on her own is either sleep, eat biscuits, or sit and stare at the television with the sound down so low that it's almost inaudible. She can't follow the plot of anything more complex than a game show so I suppose that each moment is a new moment and we should be happy that, for now, she's vaguely content.
comment 9: Did you try puzzles? My mom really loves those and it’s one of the few things that “sticks”. She also thinks that her tv doesn’t work because we don’t want her to watch it (she can’t figure out how to turn it on sometimes, the remote is actually really confusing). When she loses something she almost goes frantic trying to find it and often makes up a story about how my sister let a homeless person sleep in her bed for a night, and that person stole some of her clothes. My mom hides a lot of things as well. She unrolls toilet paper or paper towels and stashes bunches in her drawers and purses, so we no longer let her know where we keep the spare toilet paper. She’ll keep anything from a paper clip to a restaurant brochure to a wire that was used to secure a bag of bread, to plastic grocery bags. I will give her one of the frames and see what happens... I don’t think she’ll remove it from the wall. I wish I understood where the urge to hide things comes from... and so many other things.  :(
comment 10: She never was one for puzzles of any sort, so no.
We used to buy her magazines. Every week when she was still going to the supermarket and then the same when we started doing her shopping for her. Then we realised they weren't even being opened so stopped buying them. She's never asked why she doesn't get a new magazine.
The first thing she started hiding was fairly logical - her cheque book. She didn't want me to steal it! Trouble was that she didn't know where she'd put it. When the fourth replacement was ordered my husband decided it would be the last, so there are several of those squirrelled away somewhere. She no longer knows her PIN, so can't use her debit card even if she wanted to.
Because she refuses to go out she doesn't get much chance to pick up odds and ends, but she does wrap food in kitchen towel and put it in various places in the kitchen. She isn't short of food - has two meals delivered each day, has well-stocked cupboards and fridge/freezer, also emergency supplies (snack bars, protein bars, drinks cartons) within reach of her recliner.
She hides letters she doesn't want us to see, including doctors appointments. Then we get an irate call from the clinic/hospital because she's missed an appointment.
It's all logical and reasonable to her, and we just live with it.

comment 2: And if he insists on taking diapers off, as my mom did, the next step could be onsie pajamas put on backwards so he can't unbutton or unzip them (tho you'd have to redo the neckline so it's comfortable for him). 
You'll know better than I though, whether the time has come to use onsies or not :)
comment 3: There are things called “condom catheters” that could be of help.  They are not a true catheter as they do not insert into the urethra.  Instead they have a thick condom with a tube coming out of it.  This tube leads to a catheter bag. He will need to see a urologist to see if these are appropriate for him.  Many people don’t know because it’s not often talked about, but the majority of men will have a prostate problem at some point.  This can be very dangerous.  The prostate grows due to several possible causes including cancer.  As the urethra passes through the prostate it restricts the flow of urine.  This isn’t always noticed as well as it happens slowly over time.  You might notice if your stream changed overnight, but over years it just seems normal.  The bladder gets used to not being emptied and begins to stop reporting its fullness properly.  This all adds up to nighttime bathroom visits, accidents etc.  it’s possible that his urologist might prescribe a traditional catheter to be used before bed or a minimally invasive procedure to remove some of the obstruction.  These may seem unnecessary, but they could drastically improve his life.  Between these options, depends, disposable and washable chucks you should be able to find something that will help.

"Ideas for Caregiving 'Life Hacks'? Hi everyone, my wife has Huntington's Disease and I've been her caregiver for the past 10 years.  I'm giving a talk at this year's national HD conference on using technology to make caregiving a little bit easier.  
I'm planning on covering a bunch of things already and am curious if anyone has topics to share?  The talk is in June and will be recorded.  I'll share a link here when it's live!
Some of the things I'm talking about already

Personal Wellbeing
Journaling / Meditation 
Documentation / Finances
Smart Home Tech
tracking with cameras and sensors
hands free tools (lights, doors, etc)
Media
Virtual Assitants (Alexa, etc)
Apps and Things
GPS Tracking
Working with Health Aids / Nurses
Video Chat
","comment 1: Not directly related to caregiving, but there are a lot of startups that are focusing on bringing care directly to the home in a technology connected way. It can be a huge help to get someone to come to you, rather than having to take someone you are caring for to an office.
Some examples:

https://pager.com/
https://www.joinhonor.com/
https://www.carolhealth.com/

comment 2: This is a great insight. With later stages of HD, it is such a project to leave the house. 
comment 3: Yea, we're seeing a huge market emerge for this type of care. Telemedicine is reducing costs, but nothing beats actual, hands-on care from a real nurse. On top of it, you have a huge gig economy that's slowly expanding to healthcare.
Suddenly, the burden of taking someone to the doctor's can be replaced with a visit from a nurse. If it's out of the nurse's scope, they can facilitate a call with the doctor and provide in person examinations.
comment 4: This sounds amazing! I'll be really interested to see the talk once you post it.
I'm coming at this from the other side - I'm someone who's sick and employs a team of caregivers that are in my house all day every day. Scheduling is a HUGE issue for us, especially if someone is sick and I'm not well enough to find subs, or if people are having trouble remembering their work schedule. We use ~~and~~ an app called When I Work for that but there are many comparable apps out there. We also rely heavily on checklists for regular daily tasks and even though we use paper ones, I could see that being easily done on a tablet as well.
Will you talk about any adaptive technology that enables communication from the person who's being cared for? I'm a very active part in dictating the care that I need and the way that I want to live my life and I think that it's so stressful to be a caregiver that sometimes it's hard for people to remember the wants of the person being cared for - we all get so wrapped up in the needs.
Here's a very small and simple example: I can't type on a phone very easily so being able to text doctors, email insurance companies and coordinate caregivers from my computer is key. If I'm not feeling well enough to talk I can type and show it to someone. There's a whole rabbit hole of adaptive technology as well that I'm not sure you want to go down, but I wonder if you might just bring into your talk ways that technology can be used to welcome the person being cared for into the process of caregiving
comment 5: Thanks for the feeedback!  For the HD audience, I plan on discussing visual communication tools. “click the picture of the snack you want”.  I will work on adding more assistive technology, if not to the presentation, then to the website I plan on starting with the expanded content. 
The scheduling issues are real. My  mother in law hires through an agency so it’s all phone based. It sounds like you are working with freelancers,  I’ll check out that site / app for sure. 
comment 6: Hey, good for you! I'll think on it. 
Please do share the link and beat wishes.

"What's Coming Not a caregiver, but I could really use some advice on how my family can deal with the issues caused by my great aunt and uncle right now (both in their mid-80s).
Just a quick background: my parents, sisters, and I are the only family my aunt and uncle have, we all live 1+ hour driving time (one way) from their house, and obviously we love both of them very dearly.
My aunt and uncle have each had their health problems over the years, but we are now at the point of no return. My uncle can no longer take care of himself, and even though he knows it, he refuses all help unless it's coming from my aunt. That last part might sound like a good thing, but it's not. My aunt is not capable of taking care of him for a variety of reasons, with the most difficult being that she refuses to see the reality of the situation. I cannot imagine the pain she has endured watching my uncle deteriorate the way that he has, and I understand that she is being faced with some unbearably hard truths, but that does not change the fact that she is allowing (and a lot of times forcing) my uncle to put himself in dangerous positions. She will still send him to get something from their basement even though he's had trouble keeping his balance lately. She asks him to fix stuff around the house even though he loses track of what he's doing and makes things worse. The most extreme example I have, which I only mention to show the gravity of this situation, is her letting my uncle lie face down on the floor for hours after having a stroke because she ""thought he was sleeping"".
I feel like normally my family would be in a good position because my aunt and uncle are very well off financially and could afford any type of help they needed, but both of them refuse to acknowledge that it's necessary. We have tried everything we could think of at this point, but it wasn't much. My parents have more or less given up because they've tried things over the years (begged my aunt and uncle to move closer to us, spoke with them about independent living and assisted living facilities, etc.) and nothing has worked. They also say that we cannot force them to do anything they don't want to do, and that they don't want to anger them and ruin the time we all have left together. I went over to their house recently and had a heart-to-heart with my aunt (told her how sorry I was for what she is going through, told her my perspective, offered my help) but that didn't lead anywhere either. 
If I was able, I would be their live-in caregiver in a heartbeat.  Anyone in my family would do that. Unfortunately, we all have full-time jobs or are full-time students, and it wouldn't matter anyway because my aunt and uncle wouldn't want that. I just don't know what to do about what's coming...my uncle isn't going to get better, and I'm afraid he will die in terrible accident around the house, which my aunt will have to witness, if my family doesn't do something. But what can we do? 
Edit: In my rant I forgot to mention that my uncle has recently been diagnosed with dementia (though we've suspected it for years)","comment 1: In my experience, it has to be their idea to get help.  They fear losing control and so hold onto it fiercely.   All you can do is to keep gently nudging them to accept help.  Usually the elderly don't want to accept help because they don't want to be a burden on others.  What they don't understand is that by refusing help they are a bigger burden.  There are lots of in home services like Home Instead, Visiting Angels, etc.  There is also a referral service called ""A Place for Mom"", you tell them what you are looking for and they'll have the right people get in touch with you.  Also check into your Area Wide Aging Agency.  They also have loads of information.
comment 2: Thank you very much for your reply, color_me_curious.  Over the weekend, my aunt told us that she bought Life Alert for my uncle.  I don't think it will do much good, but it's something.  I will look into the services you mentioned and see what I can find.

"Advice on managing my parents mobile Devices Managing my parents Tablets and Phones has always been tough from a settings/wifi/password perspective. However, my dad's dementia is getting worse and he's in a position where he cannot remember his passwords, or even where to look them up. 
For better or worse, netflix, youtube, facebook, & kindle are some of the Big Things for him to look forward to in his life. When he is locked out it is incredibly heartbreaking and I want to help him.
I'm several states away, and my Luddite mom isn't able to help. Has anyone found a way to manage their parents devices? I'm open to anything from a corporate-style mobile device management suite, to apps, to post it notes on walls. 
What's worked for you? ","comment 1: I hooked my father up to Netflix. I live with my parents so it's a little easier than if you don't live with them. What I did for both my mother and father was made the WIFI connection open. I know and understand this is dangerous and vulnerable; but when your dealing with Dementia and the Elderly it becomes a hard spot. They have no password, it is unsecured; and I am well aware my neighbors are stealing their WiFI. My father knows the name to logon, my mother can check her Facebook and talk with her sister. By not securing the WiFi and telling them the name to click when they log in, I have saved so much hassle and undue stress. I pay for the Internet Access, so it was my decision to not lock it down. My father can watch his old westerns without any hassle on Netflix, and my mother can relax with her ""friends"" on social media. I just have to pay. I hope my neighbors aren't looking at kiddy porn though, lol.
comment 2: My partner uses two apps on his tablet.  Netflix and plex (media streaming) first we used his iPad.  He would get confused and hit the home button and then get more confused.  You can use a feature called guided access.  It’s a funny term for locking an iPad into a single app like Netflix.  When I wanted to allow him access to a few apps I bought a 50.00 kindle from amazon and used their version called “freetime” to set up which apps are on his “home screen”.  If the iPad allowed for more than one app I would have kept it but the kindle seems to work just fine. 
comment 3: Do their phones or tablet have fingerprint recognition? What about a password manager with fingerprint capabilities?
comment 4: They do, but they tend to forget the master password, their Apple ID, etc. 
comment 5: I would make all passwords the same, stick all devices in cases, and put the password on the case. Hopefully the lip around the front is wide enough to write on, otherwise on the back. 
I wouldn't change any bank passwords or anything, but i am really much less concerned about netflix or youtube security concerns.

App or device for dementia caregivers Attention dementia caregivers! I’m participating in a Brain Health Hackathon where students design technology to assist people with dementia. My team is currently brainstorming ideas and would love your input. What problems do you have in caregiving that an app or device could address? ,"comment 1: My mother was placed in a care home last year and it was a difficult transition for everybody.
In order to help curb her agitation episodes I bought an Amazon Fire tablet and created a kids profile (look up 'FreeTime Unlimited') and made it so the only 3 buttons on the home page are for a Photo Viewer, Video Viewer and Facebook Messenger Kids (a facetime app that only allows calls / chats to be made with approved contacts).
My mother can't always use the tablet, as simple as it is, due to the disease, but her caregivers can help her with it whenever she wants to watch an old home movie that I uploaded of me and my brothers as kids, or her 9 year old son, or old photos, or even to facetime with us whenever she wants to talk to us. 
So far it's great! I wish it was more simplified so she can use it without help but I don't think that's ever going to happen.  I was considering trying to spread awareness that something like this would help, or try to patent something, but I'm not really an inventor or developer, just a tinkerer.
I call it the 'Happy Tablet'.  So basically old photos, videos and the ability to facetime people makes her happy, and if she's happy then I'm happy!
comment 2: That's a great idea!
I myself have collected her favourite songs/videos from YouTube (downloaded using the command-line program 'youtube-dl'), and either play them on my Mac, or stream them to our Apple TV, or on an iPad. My wife squeals with delight whenever I start playing her songs.
Unfortunately, the GUIs for all of the above are too complicated both for her, and for our part-time caretaker.
An app that would help with self-sufficiency for the sufferer or the caretaker would be great!
comment 3: One challenge we noticed was how difficult it is to coordinate wellbeing activities in a residential care facility, to ensure all residents have a healthy activity level. We have worked over the past two years to build a shared activity logbook and visualization tool. Our project is fully open source, and has a growing backlog of tasks/features. We would be very grateful for any help your students might offer. It would be a win-win as the students would get real-world experience improving a production web application to improve the lives of people with dementia spectrum disorders living in residential care homes.
https://github.com/GeriLife/wellbeing
comment 4: Some type of medication reminder/log, I'm sure there are apps out there I just haven't looked. Something to keep all medication taken and needed in a logbook, along with food and insulin reminders too. An alarm that goes off when something is needed at a certain time(lunch, pm meds, insulin, etc..)
comment 5: One topic that comes up over and over is a tracker for a loved one.
They want it to be small. Be able to put it on their wrist, or on a lanyard. 
It should have a geo fence. An alert would go off if the tracker was out of the geo fence. 
Another topic that has come up over and over is a simple phone with a few contacts. It needs to have a large font size, and a photo of the person they are calling.

App or device for dementia caregivers Attention dementia caregivers! I’m participating in a Brain Health Hackathon where students design technology to assist people with dementia. My team is currently brainstorming ideas and would love your input. What problems do you have in caregiving that an app or device could address? ,"comment 1: As a caregiver, I'm coming from a point of view where my loved one can no longer use a device. With that being said:
• For those caregivers who worry about their loved one who wanders -- an app sorta like ""Find My Phone"". Launch the app, drop it into the pockets of their loved one, and from a second device, know where they currently are.
• When my wife's diagnosis was confirmed, I began to keep a semi-daily journal of things I'd noticed that didn't quite seem right. I had stopped doing that, but I wish I'd continued. A simple app to quickly jot down personality changes or whatever might have made the difference for me.
• A checklist of medical and legal things caregivers need to keep track of (medical tests, suggested legal things that are recommended over at alz.org).
Good luck at your hackathon, and come back and tell us what you ended up doing!
comment 2: I’m not a care giver any longer, but when I was, the the biggest problem for us was keeping track of mom. We had to deadbolt with a key the locks so she wouldn’t wander. We also had to child proof the kitchen and bathrooms so that she wouldn’t get into non-food items and ingest. 
Currently I have the SmartThings hub to monitor my house for security, and I could see that it would have been a godsend for dealing with my mother. However, I think that current caregivers are older, and typically not as tech savvy to use this type of product and fully utilize to their benefit. (My mother had ‘early onset’ and I’m not convinced my dad in his 60s would have set it up.). I think an ‘out of the box’ hub, specifically designed for dementia patient caregivers would be a real benefit. For monitoring doors, location, and even vital signs and medication dosage. The whole works!
comment 3: I will also add that the animoji feature of my iPhone X for some reason is a hit with my mom. It's the only thing that's able to engage her, besides humans, on her good days. I think there's something there worth researching and developing. 
comment 4: Exactly what the person below said. A tracking device would be so helpful, something that had a long charge. Also the ability to have checklists to take the best care of them. It can be overwhelming to the caretaker to keep track of everything. 
comment 5: A discreet looking RFID system of iron on tags for clothes or something that would send traps/notices to a human monitored device like a smart watch the caregiver wore and/or a phone, when the RFID tags approach a movable detector. 
comment 6: The majority of helpful devices for caregivers are surprisingly not internet/WiFi connected.  
A simple button to be pushed to ask for help.  Most connect to call center that can only call an ambulance and cost a fortune.  I found one that will call on my phone through a landline connection so it can be used for more than just emergencies.  Anything from I’ve fallen to I need to go to the bathroom/need a drink/am confused etc.  
Bed alarms, door alarms chair alarms and incontinence alarms all do nothing other than screech which is helpful but sometimes counterproductive.  My SO can no longer walk well on his own, but his dementia makes it hard for him to realize this.  With our current bed alarm it makes a noise when his weight lifts off the bed.  At this point the alarm scares him and almost ensures a fall.  It could alert me in the next room and I would be aware he is trying to walk and not scare him.   The same with incontinence alarms.  It beeps and wakes him, he is then scared disoriented and wet.  If it would alert me I can change him without waking him most of the time and if I do wake him it is in a less jarring way.  Trackers and cameras are always helpful but so are simple door alarms.  If I got an alert when the door was opened I could stop wander before he needs to be located.

"How to handle mistaken ""happy birthdays"" My father has Alzheimer's disese and has wished me happy birthday several times today through a variety of mediums. Today is not my birthday. I haven't been able to speak with him directly yet though. How do you all handle such things? My instinct is to not correct him, I mean losing track of my birthday is harmless enough and I don't want to embarrass him or make him feel the pain of losing his cognitive ability. Curious what other people  do.","comment 1: Thank him for thinking of you!  My rule of thumb is happiness is more important than correctness.  Correcting him probably won’t work for long and will make him embarrassed/concerned.  Just be happy he is thinking of you.   
comment 2: That was my instinct, thank you the advice!
comment 3: I totally agree, thank him and say ""Where is my birthday hug??"".  Chances are you will get lots of hugs today lol.
comment 4: As long as there wasn't a safety issue, I always went along with whatever my dad said, as much as I could.  No need to make him feel bad for getting something wrong, or make him angry thinking I was being difficult!
comment 5: Makes perfect sense to me, thank you for the advice!
comment 6: My father suffers from dementia and often does things like this. My reaction is to play along. If he thinks it's my birthday or it's Christmas Day in June I just say thank you. I tell him what a great day it is. It makes him happy, and I've noticed he forgets it soon after. If I tell him it's not ""whatever day"" he tends to continue and persist, which may agitate him. Sometimes it's about humoring them rather than correcting.
comment 7: I hate it when people play ""don't you remember?"" games with my dad who has alzheimers. Jump in your dad's ""game"" and thank him for his thoughtfulness☺. Thank you for being compassionate and for caring.
comment 8: As the others have said, correcting him will make him unhappy and he'll remember the being unhappy but not the reason.
If he says it's Monday, then it's Monday. If he says it's your birthday, then it's your birthday. Go along with it, because it makes everything so much easier.

"Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker) I’m here looking for some advice.
My family is currently facing a stressful situation, as my 93-year-old maternal Grandmother has been suffering from Dementia. The dementia is the result of her having thrown a few PEs in the past, rather than her age. This means, her loss of memory/filters has been a relatively gradual process. In many ways this has been a blessing – my Grandmother lives alone, in another state. She is a very independent, and a very, very stubborn individual, who is adamant that she will never accept help from a caregiver (outside the family) and will certainly never leave her house.
As her memory loss has been a slow process, she has been able to stay in her home by herself. My mother calls to check on her multiple times a day and flies out to check up on her every few months, and remotely handles her medical/financial needs. In addition, she is driven to appointments/stores by a neighbor, who also helps her out physically (taking her trash out, and the like), and she is in relatively close proximity to her sisters and a niece. 
Though she is on medication to slow the progression of the disease, there are many times she forgets to take her pills, which as a result negates any help they may have otherwise supplied. In the past few months, we are seeing more and more signs of decline. Names and dates have begun to slip, and her short-term memory too is declining. 
At the moment, she is still able to more or less take care of her daily basic needs – food, chores, bathing. But, she is not able to rationalize things – for instance, she hordes things, keeps expired food, will sit in the dark on occasion (though this is clearly a tripping hazard). 
My mother has been working with Adult Services, who has been keeping track of my Grandmother’s decline. The last contact they had with my mother, was a call to inform her that they had done a home check on my Grandmother and found there to be no issue (as in she did not yet pose a danger to herself). They ended up closing her case file.
So where does that leave my Mother/us? It leaves us in a holding pattern – a very stressful one. Though my Grandmother’s disease is heavily documented, there is not yet any legal recourse for us to transfer her to assisted living. Basically, we have to leave her to decline some more, before such action can be taken. 
In the meantime, my Grandmother’s personality has become more and more volatile. Her personality from her childhood onward, has one of stubbornness. I’m not sure if this was the result of various familial tragedies she’s had to endure, or if this is simply her natural personality. Despite the helpful neighbor and the various family member who will occasionally call her, my Mother is really her sole caretaker (her father and only sibling are both long since deceased). As such, the relationship between my Mother and Grandmother has declined to a point where my Mother can no longer remember a time when her Mother behaved as such. She has begun to question whether my Grandmother ever even loved her.
The pinnacle of this came tonight – my parents are currently at my Grandmother’s house checking up on her. My mother was in the process of throwing out expired food in a basement pantry, when she stumbled upon decades old food. Not only had the food and surrounding shelving begun to blacken and dissolve, but my Mother had cause for concern that she was exposed to some very harmful mold.
Shaken by this, she relayed her worry and finding to my Grandmother, and was met with only anger and denial – no sympathy/empathy was given despite my mother’s proffered fears (that she had been exposed to a toxin). 
My mother has been attending some group therapy sessions in regard to caring for someone with Dementia and is aware that the disease takes a way a person’s ability to rationalize and perhaps even empathize. Though she is aware of this logic, I see her having trouble internalizing it. The decline in the relationship between mother and daughter is taking a very large toll on my mother emotionally.
I know this post is a long ramble, and I'm not sure if any one will even read it in its entirety, but I guess my purpose here is to figure out a way to help my mother. 
I can’t (nor can my siblings) be there physically to help (at least at the moment). I try to offer assistance emotionally, reassuring her about things, letting her know that we know she is doing all she can, etc. However, there are times when I find myself at a loss for words (on how she may be able to make suggestions or have positive interactions with my Grandmother). What can you tell someone who is going through such a difficult thing that will make them feel better or will be useful to them?
Though we are all here to support her in any way we can, I know there are many times when she feels as if she is carrying the burden alone. 
Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.","comment 1: I’m sorry you’re going through this.  I struggle with this too as I’m long distance while my mom and sister bear the brunt of caring for my dad.
I asked my sister and mom how best I could help and they’ve told me this: be there as much as you can physically, but if that’s not possible then keep doing what you’re doing.  Call as often as you can, be there to vent to, and if you don’t know what to say, you can be honest about that.  Just keep reminding your mom that she’s doing a great job.  I don’t know how internet savvy your mom is (mine isn’t), so you can also help by doing online research for her, especially on the tech front if there are any gadgets that can help your mom keep a better eye on your grandma.  Every little thing helps.
comment 2: Thank you very much for the reply/advice. I am sorry you are going through this with your dad.
On the tech front, there are many options we would love to employ (like security cameras), unfortunately my grandmother does not have any internet at her house. 
comment 3: It sounds like your grandmother is no longer capable of making decisions for herself. Does your mom have power of attorney? If not, I would suggest consulting with an elder care lawyer, and getting that sorted. It will involve getting your grandmother's doctor to certify that she is incompetent to handle her own affairs. If she forgets to take her meds, then that is proven.
Once your mom has that, she can use your grandmother's resources (or her own) to set up security cameras, hire in-home caregivers, etc.
The Alzheimer's Association has a helpline, anyone can call for advice: 800-272-3900.
From my personal experience caring for my gradually-declining dad since 2010, the drug seroquel has helped with paranoia and aggression, and I've learned reason and arguing don't work. But there are other ways of handling the issues.
It's the worst disease. I know your mom is glad she has you in her life.
comment 4: Thank you very much for your reply! Perhaps, the hotline might be a good resource. I'm not sure if my mother is aware of it or not, but I will pass the info along to her.
Both my parents of recently taken charge of her bank accounts so that they can pay all her bills online (there was some worry that she would begin to overpay them). 
My mother has attended all neuro appointments that my Grandmother has been dragged to (not literally of course, but close enough). Her mental decline is well documented, however, as I said the progression of her Dementia has been very gradual. 
We did manage to take steps like getting her driver's license revoked - lots of hoops to jump through for that, amazingly, given her age and disease. 
My parent's are both recently retired (my Mother worked for decades as a ARNP, caring for others, and now when she is trying to enjoy life she has been left to care for her mother - who is by far the worst ""patient"" she has ever encountered). Since they are now on a fixed budget themselves they are hesitant to spend any of their own money on my Grandmother's expense. My grandmother has more than enough money to take care of things, however, her personality is such that she does not wish to spend money on anything but expensive luxuries.
Hopefully, the fact that my parent's have taken control of her accounts, will help this issue. However, the current worry is that if money is spent on assisted care (like a nurse/health worker doing in house visits), or assistance based tech (security cams, WiFi, emergency alert devices), not only will she not use them, but she will find a way to retaliate (as in she won't answer the phone, etc.). 
As her last neuro appointment (December) actually showed some improvement (at that point she was correctly taking Exelon), we didn't have enough to show she was not capable of living on her own. Again, there is some concern that if we don't have the proper amount of evidence and we take her to court (to gain full control over her), then she will find a way to cut us off (communication, financially, etc.), which will undoubtedly make the situation a 100 times worse. Though her ability to rationalize things is mostly gone, she has still found ways to manipulate things when she wants something - in a way it is fascinating how this disease targets certain parts of the brain before others.
The best way to describe the situation is that we are in a game of Capture the Flag, currently sitting in No Man's Land, inching toward the line at which we will need to make a play for the opposition's flag (taking her to court). 
I'm sorry to hear about your Dad - this disease certainly sucks!!
comment 5: Eventually she will set something on fire, or wreck the car and then you have your case. Unfortunately, that can lead to a funeral (or funerals, depending on who she hits) instead of guardianship. If only doctors and the DMV were more proactive.
comment 6: She does not drive - we worked hard to get her driver's license revoked. So, at the very least there is no threat of her harming someone else with her car.
comment 7: Thank you for being responsible dementia caretakers. My uncle ran into the back of a school bus before he could be stopped.
comment 8: Oh my gosh, that's awful, I've very sorry!
comment 9: Try adult protective services
Maybe literal piles of mold is enough to have them take action 
comment 10: Thankfully, it turned out to not be mold. 
We have gone through adult services, not to sound like a jerk, but they are pretty useless (at least in this case). They had opened a case on her and were working with my mother. They stopped by my Grandmother's house a total of 2 times. 
The first time they only went as far as the doorway - asked my Grandmother a few question, but didn't conduct any type of house/safety survey. Since they only asked my Grandmother the sort of questions they would not know the actual answers to (basically she could have made things up or got things confused, and they would have taken her word on it), all they achieved was to incense my grandmother. She got angry with my mother over that and threatened to cut off communication, which would have ultimately made things much, much worse.
The second visit they did go into her house briefly (amazingly my Grandmother let them in), but they didn't find anything that overly concerned them. As a result of that they closed her case, and deemed her fine to be on her own.
Oh yeah, they were real helpful. /s

"Recommendations on GPS Tracker? Hi,
My grandfather is in the early stages of Alzheimers, and my family is looking to get him a GPS tracker in case he ever gets confused and wanders off unsupervised. I've found several products online, but genuine reviews seem few and far between. If any of you have personal experience with any of these products, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks in advance!","comment 1: I installed Life360 on my moms phone but it requires her to have it on her with location on.  Notifies me when she reaches selected places, tracks her driving speed, notifies me of any incidents along the way and when her phone battery is low.
comment 2: Thank you!
comment 3: I also use Life360- it’s been great. Now if only my mom would always take her phone. 
comment 4: Hahaha yeah that’s the trouble with that one.
comment 5: I've been thinking about getting something like this too but my mom doesn't have a smart phone, any other reccomendations?
comment 6: Here's a list of other contenders I've been looking at. Reviews seem few and far between, so my family is weighing our options carefully. PAL seems to be the most acclaimed, but PocketFinder seems to be the best for the money. SmartSole seems cool too, if a bit of a hassle. There was another one we were looking at called iTraq, but I took it off the list because reviews seemed largely negative. Let me know if you find anything interesting!

comment 7: Thanks! This is pretty great. The pocket finder seems like it'd be best for our purposes. I had some sort of vague fantasy that'd I'd be able to find a pretty cute necklace type thing that I wouldn't have to remind her to wear or take with her everyday cause she'd really like it and want to wear it but I guess no one cares if old people feel cute. 😕
comment 8: We've done the Tiles in his shoes.  He always wears his shoes, so we have one for each pair.  The lifetime of the tile is not forever, but works for us in case he wanders off.
comment 9: That's smart! I'm looking for something that will work without bluetooth and other tiles, but that's still a great solution on a budget! Thanks!
comment 10: yes, Tile is a good solution for some things - attaching one to their coat or shoes, maybe wearing it like a dog tag, keys, purse, wallet, all the other things they tend to misplace...I just wish it could be traced from a desktop.

comment 14: Good to know! Thanks again!
comment 15: My mother has a small dog she got before she started going down hill and needing help. We tried Life360 on her phone and it worked for a while, but she started leaving it behind when she'd go on walks. She'd since moved in with us and was gone for 3-4 hours for walks. 
We mentioned it to our pest control guy that takes care of our house and he recommended getting a tracker for the dog. It's been a life saver. We got Whistle tracker designed for dogs but it has cellular capability, long battery life, and weekly/daily reports on trips. I highly recommend it.

"Update: I created a device that may help some caretakers of dementia patients. It's a wifi connected device that has a pressure+moisture sensor you put under the bed. You can set it to send notifications to your phone if this person wets the bed or wanders at night. Does this seem useful to anyone? I was speaking to someone a while back and they suggested a device like this could help them take care of their partner. You can find the original thread here.
I spent some of my free time looking into this and building out the initial prototype hardware and software for this. I'm still a bit off from where I can produce this even at a small scale, but I figured I'm close enough to start asking people if this is something that could be valuable to them. 
I was thinking of just either giving it away for free or selling it at costs, and hopefully just asking for some feedback in return, so if this is something that might help you, please feel free to send me a private message!","comment 1: That's wonderful! My great-grandparents both had dementia, and Papa was very prone to both wandering at night and bed wetting. Often, the reason for his night wanderings was that he had wet the bed. I used a baby monitor to hear when he got up at night. This was not ideal, but it was the best we could do. Your device sounds like a great solution. My Papa has since passed, but I am sure other people would find this helpful.
comment 2: It’s me from the original thread, still think it’s a wonderful idea! 
comment 3: This would be really helpful!  My dad has days when he sleeps all the time but he gets up and then falls often happen or other shenanegans.  It would be helpful. The bed alarms don't seem great.  And the moisture sensor would be awesome.
comment 4: Great idea. 
The bed wetting aspect of dementia, is they never think they are wet or have soiled themselves.  This may help that battle if an alarm went off and let you know.  I fight with my Mom to change her, she is incontinent and has dementia and alzheimer's and rarely thinks she has gone on herself.  
comment 5: From what I understand, sometimes having an alarm with the person can actually be very confusing and disorientating. Which was why rather than an alarm, the device gives the caretaker a push notification so it would be less startling. Thoughts?
comment 6: Had not thought of this, and your understanding is correct.  The push notification obviously is smarter.  
comment 7: [deleted]
comment 8: Right now, there's a single long wire running to the device which you can keep tucked underneath the bed or in a night stand. On the other end are the sensors. Those are small, the size of a quarter that need to be placed under the bed. The cleaning is a very good point.
comment 9: I like where your head is at. I appreciate that you are dedicating brain power and energy towards bettering the lives of caregivers and the ill. The pressure sensor sounds good as long as there is waterproof material between it and soiled pads and  bedsheets. I am interested in the cost of a moisture sensor and how/if it could be made reusable.
comment 10: Sounds like a cool project! Have you considered sharing it as open source?
Relatedly, I maintain an open source project designed to support caregivers in elder care communities to coordinate wellbeing activities:

"update and a message to y'all tl;dr at the bottom! also, warning for some mentions of death and stuff. just in case anyone can't handle it.
hi everyone!! it's been a while, and a lot has been going on. honestly, i don't recall a time in my life where things were nearly this busy.
so first thing's first, i'm doing well in university despite worrying about my grandma. i called and texted regularly, asking how she was doing. my brother would text me when she got rowdy and i helped him deal with it. i don't know if i mentioned it before, but he and i are both mentally ill so it was very important for me to be accessible to him as much as i could be. despite all of that, i'm on track to graduate this year with an undergraduate thesis under my belt.
so about my grandma. winter break came up and it was obvious that she was declining very quickly. we've had this happen before; she'd have periods of time where it seemed like she would get significantly worse before plateauing, so i didn't think much of it at the time. on christmas day she became sick. nothing intense, just a bit of a cough and runny nose, so we still went to the family gathering and had a great time. she was very tired by the end and had a hard time getting in the car but we managed alright.
the next day, my mom and dad decided to take her to urgent care since she is very old and we take our health very seriously in this household. i was responsible for the dog and feeding myself and my brother, so i didn't hear much that day. it was apparently crazy busy to the point where people would cheer every time someone would leave, according to my dad. well, after eight hours grandma was finally checked out. i'm not sure what the details were, but she was admitted to the hospital for getting the flu that's been heckin everyone up this year. thankfully she had her flu shot so it wasn't too bad, but the doctor was very very concerned about something else.
my mom mentioned to him at some point that my grandma had been falling more, hence the use of the walker and the wheelchair my mom's cousin gave to us from my great aunt before she passed. they talked, and he said that she wouldn't be going back with them. my mom was in shock but my dad was on it, and discussed how he wasn't able to find a home for her that was willing to accept her insurance that was also accessible to the family. the doctor said ""you'll get a call tomorrow""
grandma stayed overnight, and lo and behold we got a call. while both of my parents were staying with her, i answered the phone and a lovely woman let me know that there was someone on the way to talk to my parents and that my grandma was to go to a hospice at 6pm that night. it was honestly both the most relief and the most sad i've ever felt at the same time. i was so glad she as going to get the care she needed, but the doctor also confirmed that he didn't expect my grandma to live beyond 6 months to a year longer. i know that she's gone, but it's going to be very hard to deal with her being gone gone. 
my mom's taken this super well. we've been kind of expecting this to happen for a while. honestly, there were some nights i'd go to bed and watch grandma in her room to make sure she was still alive, and my mom and dad were already discussing funeral plans. those got finalized in the last few weeks since she's gone to the home, so all they need to do is make one call once grandma passes and everything will be taken care of. they've also talked to my dad's regular therapist, and my mom has finally confided in me that she was indeed feeling overwhelmed and burned out, and that now it was strange but lifted a huge weight off her shoulders to have other people deal with day to day issues.
speaking of which, we've been visiting her at the home. mom's visited every day after work since the home is right on her route home anyway, which has been fantastic. it's not only convenient, but crazy nice. they have their own salon where residents can get their hair cut and nails done, and they have large calendars with activities for the day written everywhere. grandma gets a ""newspaper"" every day (selectively chosen news in spanish, from what i've seen it's mostly stuff about sports or culture or generally happy things) and has the ability to go wherever she wants. it's a super diverse group of people that live there, too, so she's been making friends (as dark as it is, it is kind of funny that she gets to make ""new"" friends with the same people every day) and listening to spanish radio with them. best of all, it's right next to a beautiful homestead museum, so every day she goes outside she can see the building and the gardens around it. the best part? because the doctor deemed this a necessary thing, it's 100% covered by insurance. all we have to pay for is whatever miscellaneous things she wants, like new shoes and clothes or something for solo entertainment. 
i didn't really intend for this to be so long lol. i intended to write this as i waited for my hair to dry (dyed it blueblack!!), and it's been dry for fifteen minutes. i really wanted to get this all out there, though, because it can be so easy to give up and feel like the world is working against you and your loved ones. good things can happen, though, even unexpectedly. the world is moving on whether you can feel it or not, and things are not permanently how they are right now. now i can enjoy the memory of my grandma teaching me how to peel an apple or helping me sew a scarf as a friend's birthday gift without worrying about her falling down the stairs every single night.
tl;dr: grandma was moved to a hospice under doctor's orders. i'm doing good, mom and dad are doing good, brother's doing good and, most importantly, grandma's doing good. moving her into a home was a hard decision, but absolutely the right one.","comment 1: I am very glad you have found her a nice place.

"Portable Personal Home Intercom System I'm looking for something like a walkie talkie that will be easy for my dad to carry around the house/yard with him that will connect to a device I keep with me that will allow for immediate communication between the two.  I want to find something that is not limited like CB or Walkie Talkie push-button-to-talk and then listen to the reply.  I want to find something that allows for real time conversation for as long as the connection is open.
I bought a wireless phone system where we have handhelds around the house, but it's too cumbersome for him to activate the ""intercom"" mode and remember which code number my phone is so he can call it when I'm in the basement or something.
Does anyone know of something that can help?","comment 1: So, this is not exactly what youre looking for, and it's expensive, but it's been 5 days with no response, so at least it's something. 
Amazon echo (or echo dot, which is what I have), has a ""drop in"" feature. Once it's enabled, all you have to do is say ""Alexa, drop in on (whoever)"" and you have a real time conversation with whoever is by the Amazon device you just dropped in on. 
You can set up devices in different rooms, or you can drop in long distance. 
My cousin uses hers to call her kids downstairs to dinner, and I use mine to chat with my parents who live an hour away. 
I think the video amazon devices let you use the camera too for the drop ins. 
Also, I hope it's not needed, but im pretty sure Alexa will call 911 if you say ""Alexa, call 911"". 
This post sounds awfully ""hail corporate-y"", so sorry about that. My Grandfather had an echo dot for awhile, and he has mobility issues, while my Grandmother has Alzheimer's, and Alexa has made their house a bit more accessible. So I've just had a lot of experience using an echo dot as a convince toy for me, and an accessibility tool for my grandparents.
comment 2: Thanks for the reply, and your suggestion.  I appreciate it.  I have been thinking of the ""smart home"" voice activated device type thing you described.  I'm hesitant.  It would be perfect for what I want to use it for, but the back of my mind just keeps ""thinking"" and I end up thinking no.  I haven't ruled it out yet.

"Help the staring is making me irrationally angry; I KNOW SHE CAN NOT HELP IT. I KNOW IT'S A ""ME"" PROBLEM, because she does this with everyone in our house, I'm just the only one who has such a problem with it. I'm so unnerved that when we're in the same room, I try to sit outside of her peripheral vision, or I sit with my back to her, because I know if I look up anywhere in her general direction, I know she'll be staring. If I move, she tracks me like those pictures with the moving eyes you see in movies. But there's gotta be a better way of handling this. ","comment 1: I’m in the same early stages boat and am just starting to learn how to reduce my frustration and anger. I think for me I’m dealing with the grief of what is a terminal diagnosis for my partner, as well as the fact that she only showing early symptoms at this stage is what leads to my irrational anger. Life has robbed my partner of a chance to grow old (early onset) and me of my lifelong sweetheart. As this is new to me, the only thing I can suggest is to seek as much counselling and support as possible. It also helps to try to remind myself daily that her behaviour is caused by a degenerative brain disorder and these things are out of her or my control. 
comment 2: It could be different for you, but when something like this effects me the way this seems to be effecting you it’s because I need a brake.  It never goes away, but it’s easier to set it aside.  Take some time for you, as much as you can. 
comment 3: Give her something else to look at? Soft toys with big eyes and friendly expressions, blinky things, and big piece puzzles. Anything safe to distract the attention.
comment 4: That [real people, in her surroundings] is literally the only thing that holds her attention so ""well""; anything you give her only interests her for maybe 5 seconds at a time then she puts it down or pushes it away. Even while eating, she will let her food go cold in favor of staring/tracking.

"Has anyone put a Tile or Trackr location tracker on their parent's keys? To be clear, trying to lojack Mom, not her keys.  She loses her phone sometimes, and has gotten bad about returning calls. I'd like to be able to check her location from time to time.","comment 1: [deleted]
comment 2: Same. I did buy a Tile - you have to be VERY close to them in order to locate. (left my wallet with Tile in a grocery store and was parked in the closest spot before it dinged that they were in the customer service desk at the front of the store - this would not be useful for searching for your parents if you needed to). There may be a better product, but ideally it would work just like iphone find friends and be something she would not lose. The Tile is barely better than nothing. 
comment 3: This is what my grandmother has. 
It goes in your wallet like a credit card and is Bluetooth powered. You can track its location with GPS, make it ring if you’ve lost your wallet, and even call your phone and it will ring (even if the phone is on silent). 
comment 4: I see the battery life is ""Up to 3 months"". What's your experience with battery life, and does it have other features you use that affects battery life?
I'm close to trying this kind of tracking technology with my dad.  Not that he NEEDS it now, but every day it's like I see micro changes in him.  Time is a beast.  
comment 5: On Android phone or tablet there is a share real-time app.. 
My husband and I use it because he takes 20-50 mile bike rides and if he needs help, I can find him. We also use it because I'm constantly helping my elderly mom and disabled sister and it helps him know where I am. 
Good luck with this.

What's the best medical alert device? What's most important? Suggestions? ,"comment 1: Hi Christine,
I saw that this subreddit isn't active much, and I have some of my own questions to ask, so I figured I'd answer this. My mother used Medical Guardian, which we thought was great. Pretty affordable, neck pendant, and a good receiver that could hear my mom's voice from across the hall. Hope this helps.

Mobile Help is FDA monitored and registered. I would suggest them over all other companies.

"Roku/Chromecast for Somebody With Dementia? (x-post from /r/Cordcutters...they were helpful, but I figured this subreddit might have some insights they don't know about.)
My friend's dad has dementia, and he gets frustrated with electronics easily.
The family is paying a small fortune for cable, and they want to cut the cord, but they're worried that Dad won't be able to handle the menus on a Roku.
Is there a device/system/app that would make it dead-simple for a guy like him to access his (few) preferred channels? Ideally in a manner similar to the ""channel flipping"" he already uses?","comment 1: There isn’t a nice way to say this but it’s not really going to matter depending on his stage. Maybe he can work it fine now but at some point in the future he won’t be able to and learning a new system will not help that. 
What I can say is if he prefers a certain genre or TV show to just record those and make it easily accessible. My mother likes old Westerns so we fill the DVR with them so anyone that is with her can put them on since she can’t. 
comment 2: When I moved my dad in with me he was on his own for four hours a day. We also only have a roku. I made step by step instructions with pictures on how to use and operate it. Sadly he only watched star trek boys get as actually deciding on something to watch sent him into a tizzy. 
Personally I woukd suck it up for right now and find a cheaper package as the flipping through to stop on something is much easier than trying to pick. 
Maybe look into an antenna too for the broadcast channels. 
comment 3: Honestly, just get bare-bones dishnetwork or something. There's no chance he can work a streaming device by himself, but you could still have it there for when someone who can work it is around.
comment 4: There is a relatively new Roku channel called ""Pluto"" that is essentially several dozen live streaming cable-like channels. If it's possible to make a device autoplay a single channel, and you could get to that one, it might be a nice compromise.
With that said, we replaced my parent's TV with a Roku 'smart' TV a couple of days ago. My dad really struggled with the Roku remote. The Roku remote we had places the volume controls on the side, and when my day would grab it to try to get his finger on the power button, he'd mash the volume buttons on the side.
I'm very thankful that their cable box universal remote had a setting that worked with the new TV. Once I set that up, everything works from the one control the way it has for years. If the remote hadn't supported this TV, I think my siblings and I would be getting daily updates about how this new TV just doesn't work for months.

"GPS Bracelet for Grandfather w/ Dementia Hello,
My grandfather is in his 90s and recently had a stroke.  His memory has taken a turn for the worst and everyone is worried he may wander off.  Can any recommend a reliable and easy to use GPS tracking bracelet?  Ideally, the bracelet could also show is name and a phone number if someone finds him.

"Society has no idea what to do for a 43 year old with LBD I'm in legal limbo...
I'm a 43 year old male with Lewy Body Dementia. I was diagnosed about a year ago. 
In Washington state, to qualify for the majority of the programs you must be:

At least 60 years of age
or
Under the care of a professional 

This means for me at 43, I can get almost no help. I've been out of work over a year and have no income so there is no way to pay a professional. It seems like yet another thing one can buy their way in while the rest of us get screwed. 
Social Security made a tiny error in my claim and has denied me twice. I was just told I must wait 12-18 months for a hearing. My prognosis is I'll most likely die before then. 
It is especially screwed up because this is a fast-track disease on the SSDI list of 400 quick-acting diseases. Some get approved in 15 days. I've been waiting for ~380 days so far. 
This next part is shocking... 
My spouse falls under 'abuse of a vulnerable adult' however because I'm not 60, I cannot get protection. She has assaulted me three times and is verbally/emotionally/mentally abusive. Legally I'm too young to be taken advantage of. No bullshit. 
One cannot be considered a vulnerable adult when under 60 regardless of their stage of Dementia. I had the police out and they confirmed it. They say because we're married, it makes it civil instead of criminal. 
Three weeks ago I decided that I would kill myself right now or get out of the abusive situation. I think I know how Mr. Williams felt in his moment (not that there was abuse - I'm talking about the noose).
So I left but had nowhere to go. Having Dementia and leaving with no set destination or money is the most terrifying thing I have experienced. 
She's kept all the money we had as well as our food stamps. I've dropped 30lbs but I was only 170 before :(
My mother died last year and I got her house sold. I have the proceeds from that sale first week of November. It's enough to get me by for a couple of years. 
So, in 20 days, I can get somewhere to live. Until then it's homeless shelters, free church dinners, and borrowing gas money. 
The dichotomy of this situation is wrecking the logical side of my brain. I have literally $0 today. In 20 days I'll be set for years. 
This wait is brutal - and all the more frustrating as I put a deposit down on a place but can't buy it until November when the trust releases. 
I keep asking myself - why the hell is the guy with Dementia on the street? 
Edit: $25k will get me a place to live, groceries for the fridge, and very importantly - I can get the meds I NEED (Medicaid only covers some) - the trust is worth many times that. Anyone want to make a generous return? Funds disperse on Nov 3. The trust attorney will send out checks before anything comes to me. I'm mostly kidding here of course - that's a lot of dough! ","comment 1: We are going through a similar battle with my fathers early onset Alzheimer's. He won't get hardly any assistance until he is 65, which is ten years away. And we had to move him into an assisted living facility last month. We are paying out of pocket and will burn through his IRA in a couple of years. We don't know what we will do after that. We want to put him in a memory care center that will provide him with some stimulation but it's just completely out of reach. We don't know how to pay for his long term care. It's completely fucked. 
comment 2: Fucking absurd.
I'm a logical dude and I would far prefer if society or they or whatever would just be truthful...you aren't worth the resources - get dead. That at least has a good bit of logic (flawed or not) to it.  This pretending to care but really not giving a shit is really...shitty.
comment 3: I am so very sorry for your diagnosis and living situation.
You should be able to use your trust payment as a collateral for a short term loan. I would start by speaking to a trust officer at the bank who holds your trust. 
There are other types of financial institutions that loan money to people who are getting a lottery payout, etc. They are less highly regulated and will try to give you as little as possible, I don't know if you feel up to negotiating. There's an episode of This American Life that talks to a salesperson for one of these places:
https://m.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/329/nice-work-if-you-can-get-it?act=2#act-2
comment 4: Whoa - I never thought of a secured loan.  So obvious but...because dementia ;)
I'll make some calls on Monday.  Thank you
comment 5: I should clarify that the trust is not a lot of money - high 5 figures.  Enough for a couple of years if I try to have a little fun (until I can't)...
comment 6: I hope you are finding some good answers with this idea. Please update us. Sending you support and internet hugs! 
comment 7: Thank you! I can stay in the spot I'm in until 11, so I'll be making phone calls all the way up until then . Hopefully I'll be able to report some good news.
comment 8: Goddamnit. It’s like a fucking crime just to be alive anymore. I’m so sorry this is happening. Being poor is fucking painful. Especially if you’re also stuck with LBD. If you were in Kentucky I would give you a place to sleep and food to eat. I will send you good positive energy which can only do so much. But know there’s someone thinking of you and hoping you can get through this shit time. Internet hugs. 
comment 9: Thanks for the comment.  I'm starting to cement my thoughts about moving out of this area.  It's gorgeous but expensive.  I have to wait 1 year between neurologist appointments so that isn't a terribly good situation.
For the entirety of this disease, I've seen my neurologist for a total of ~20 minutes.  That's pretty fucked up right there.
comment 10: Yeah that’s absolute insanity. What kills me most about this is that the resources are there. Food. Shelter. Medical. It’s all right there and you just can’t access it. Such bullshit! PM me if you ever need to vent or just want to chat. 
comment 11: Indeed! There are even dementia support groups that I'm a not allowed to attend because I'm male. Once again, I shit you not.
comment 12: This is a dreadful situation, and it sucks. These are both long-term.  I got nothing for the short term.
Your Senators and your Representative, maybe both, have somebody on staff to deal with people with Social Security issues.  Call and see if there's anything that can be done to accelerate your appeal.
Spousal abuse is still abuse and is still a crime.  Your police people are not doing their job.  It is possible that getting to the station might help you find somebody who will actually take you seriously.  (No guarantees, damn it.)
comment 13: Thank you for mentioning this, last week I did contact two House Representatives for this state and actually both their aides got back to me with quick answers and we're super awesome to deal with. 
Unfortunately, they found that because Social Security is a Fed program, they aren't able to do anything legally to help. They did, however send my information over to a congressman and his staff is looking at it this morning. 
comment 14: Best of luck.  The SS system is vile.
comment 15: >homeless shelters, free church dinners,
I'm not in the States so don't know how those things work over there, but in homeless shelters in this country there's always somebody on hand who's employed and should know a way of getting specialist support for those who are living on the streets due to abuse or a medical condition.
This website https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/help-for-battered-men#1 says there is a helpline for men who are victims of domestic abuse.
>""The Domestic Abuse Helpline for Men is the only one in the nation that offers support and help in finding resources specifically for men,"" says Brown, of the not-for-profit helpline. ""We'll provide options and support and help a man understand that the abuse is not his fault and it is not acceptable."" The Domestic Abuse Helpline can be reached from anywhere in the US and Canada, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by calling 1-888-7HELPLINE (1-888-743-5754).
and another one
>National Domestic Violence Hotline. ""We urge anyone whose relationship scares them to call the National Domestic Violence Hotline (NDVH) at (800) 799-SAFE (7233) or the TTY line for the deaf: (800) 787-3224.

"Anyone using a monitoring/communication device in case their loved one has a fall or any sort of emergency that leaves them unable to ask for help? I've only seen one other post on here that came close, and it ended with one response.  I'm blessed to have a mother who is super fit and amazingly tech-savvy for 93, but her hearing is really bad, and she often gets ""locked out"" of her smartphone (quotes because that's not the issue, but sometimes can't use her phone regardless).  We have decided that a wearable device with a panic button is what we need for that unlikely but really dire scenario. Here are some examples of what I'm looking for, I'm wondering if anyone has had any experience with them or similar/recommendations/criticisms (there are many others, but these are the only 2 that mention a price):
https://www.medicalguardian.com
https://www.bayalarmmedical.com
I would also appreciate suggestions of any other subreddits (already saw r/eldercare) or discussion boards.","comment 1: Just happen to see your post, I searched for a long time and decided on https://wearsafe.com/ , it is a fraction of the cost of the outdated life alerts systems. Hope it works out for you. 
comment 2: we had life alert for my grandmother, but for my mom we found it more cost effective to just add a wearable panic button to her current home alarm system.  another benefit of the home alarm... i have my cell phone tied to the alarm notifications so i get a text every morning to tell me when the alarm is disarmed.  you can customize the notifications to keep a eye on them from a distance.
comment 3: thanks.  What is your service called, what do they charge, and which part of the world are you in?
comment 4: im in Pennsylvania (USA). i use a service called vivant for $50/month. 
comment 5: I'm a computer geek. I found a webcam from ebay that allows me to look in on mom from my phone or pc/mac. The camera I choose has digital io lines, which I attached to a receiver for a garage door opener, which used a wireless remote key-fob which mom wears around her neck. When she pushes the button, the camera send an email, which can be a phone text message.
Total cost about $100 one time cost, without any monthly fee. 
They also make motion detectors, door open and other transmitters besides the push button.
We keep a tablet watching the camera feed, so when we walk to the kitchen, we can look in. 
comment 6: Wow- very impressive! I wish I had those skills, this would be perfect.
comment 7: It's not all that complicated. this is the camera(s) I use. If you look at the photo of the back, there is a little green connector that if the 2 in wires are connected it sets off an alarm. Inside the software of the camera, you can setup an email to be sent. Most cell phones have an email address to send a text to, For example, 5551234567@txt.att.net. 
Then I use a dxr-701 & remote, which you push the button on the DXR, then the button on the remote to program.
two wired need to go from the DXR to the green connector on the camera. Old phone wire or ethernet cable is a single stand of copper and is easiest to use.
the dxr also needs a 12 volt power supply. It doesn't matter what end it has, because it will get cut off and screwed down on the dxr.
The camera can also be fitted with a motion detector and the camera programmed for hours the alarm is active, so sleepwalking can be detected and notified.
Figuring out what to buy was the hard part, anyone who can strip a wire and setup email can do it. 
I'll be glad to help all i can.

"Looking for a group home or assisted living community in Dallas area. I am currently the sole caregiver to my schizophrenic brother of 36. Caring for him has been taking a huge emotional toll on me, especially since my younger brother passed away. I am seeking an alternative living arrangement for him where he can receive minimal care with supervision. He is pretty independent in basic needs, like showering, eating, laundry and dishes.  He needs more help with cooking, deeper cleaning, money management, and keeping track of/getting to appointments. If anyone can recommend a facility or group home in the Dallas area it would be greatly appreciated. ","comment 1: I want to give you a hug, ledaleda.

"Desperate need of advice on how to help my father. I'm in college and I still live with my dad and stepmom, my stepmom can't drive but does work at a hospital about an hour out. My dad works at home making t-shirts and selling toys (He has been able to make a living off this for the last 15 years)
He is in some financial difficulty as well but I'll save that for another subreddit. He fell and hit his head on concrete last winter. Got a concussion and some new medical issues that it's becoming harder and harder to deal with. He will randomly (normally right after getting up) lose all strength in his legs and collapse. On the same not he will sometimes lose balance and start walking backward or forwards unable to stop. He has fallen in the bathroom quite a few times now, and once halfway down the stares. I work every day and go to college so I'm not always here and he often has to drive my stepmom to work or pick her up or other such errands. 
Today at around 9-10am he fell in the bathroom getting reading to drive my stepmom. they spent an hour trying unsuccessful and eventually, she grabbed me and I drove her to work. When I got home he was too exhausted to talk let alone try to get up. I got him water and his phone. Eventually, I had no choice to go to class, so I checked with him and headed out. I came back around 8pm and he was still on the floor. I spent the last hour helping him crawl, pull himself, and finally get into bed again. 
He is 300 pounds and has lost over 75% of strength to be able to move, especially in his legs. He is in physical therapy (which he has missed due to falling and being unable to get up) and working with doctors but I don't if he is going to get better.
To the crux of my issue, he is plenty self-reliant and can work and in full control of his mental state. But being a 300 plus man he is just unable to get up without help if he falls. We are in a pretty financial tough spot and I don't see it getting any better in the foreseeable future. Are there any cheap devices or methods to help him be able to get up off the floor? He is on the state low-income insurance so I don't think they're going to cover any medical grade items. No retirement or any other accounts either, just what I and my stepmom work for. He is firmly against moving into any type of assisted living, but I don't think we could afford to even if I do convince him. 
TL;DR My dad randomly loosing almost all strength in his legs and a lot in his arms. He is around 350 pounds and often is alone for long stretches of time. Is there any cost-effective aid for someone in his position?","comment 1: You mention that he's on state low-income insurance, and that means he could potentially be eligible for some local programs that might be able to help him.  How old is he?  I'd recommend contacting your local ""Office on Aging.""  You can typically find that by Googling your county/municipality name and ""office on aging.""  That office will likely be able to make some recommendations, whether it be transportation, in-home physical therapy or supervision, or other things that can help your dad or your stepmom. Does he happen to be a veteran?  If so, there are programs that can be of assistance using that avenue as well.  Good luck! 
Edited to add some additional thoughts: It is crucial that he makes it to his physical therapy appointments.  I know you mention that he's missed them, but he's got to get there.  For my dad, who has limited mobility, we set up Uber and Lyft on his phone for him to request rides to his appointments.  The prices to transport him are extremely reasonable (about $6 for a 2.5 mile drive).  Also, next time, do not hesitate to call EMS to help him off the floor.  They are trained to do those types of things.  If it makes you feel uncomfortable to call 911, just call the local non-emergency number.  For someone on state insurance, they might even be able to write-off the EMS visit.
comment 2: One of those straps they use at physical therapy might help depending on how strong you are. It's basically a big canvas belt you loop around (under armpits) and they use that as an option in PT in case the patient falls. It helps you not injure the person as you help them get up and allows you to use better motion/force to get them up with less strength. I watched a 90 lb woman pick up my 250lb father off the floor with one (granted.. this lady was a badass :))

"Conservatorship question for my recently diagnosed mother My apologies in advance for the lengthy post.
I posted a question about her safety in a different thread, but I am providing the same first paragraph here just for context. For the moment her husband is acting as her caretaker, and I don’t know if he has been appointed a conservatorship for her (I doubt it). This question is related to a conservatorship for her estate assuming he has not been appointed.
My mother (age 64) was recently diagnosed with possible Alzheimer's and is taking medication which seems to be helping. She is married to my step father (age 75) and on several occasions has complained that he has anger issues and described him as an angerholic. This is completely backed up by my experience with him, because he was abusive to me as well as to his own kids. My relationship with him had a very negative impact on my life which she knows about and is very regretful she did not do anything about it. She said she has wanted to walk out on him several times in their marriage. He is a bully, but can be very charming and hides it well. If he is pushed too far however he will become explosive. She is now fully dependent on him because of her condition and he is taking care of her full time. Her condition is declining, but she is still very much herself and can tell stories, stays on track in conversation fairly well, and has access to her memories. She definitely knows me, but had a hard time remembering my birthday when I asked her this morning.
Here is our history: I am her only son. My father, her first husband, was killed in a tragic accident in 1986 when I was 3 years old. Both my mother and I were present when it happened and it was incredibly traumatic. He was a brilliant scientist who had just obtained a position with a major tech company (in the 1980s). As part of a wrongful death settlement, she received his lifetime salary, no small amount. This is now her estate. We loved him a lot and are both very fond and protective of his memory. Then, when she remarried to my step-father, around 2001 she put his name down as a trustee for her account (her financial advisor informed me). Now, 16 years later a lot has changed and when I informed her that he was named as co-trustee she indicated that she would like him to be removed and my name to be added and for me to look after things. She was also emphatic that the assets, which represent our family and my father's life work, were to be mine when she no longer needed them (which relieved me because I do not want my father's life work and financial legacy to support my abusive step-father or his family). She is dependent on him now. For a long time I was estranged because she did not really do anything to stop her husband’s abuse towards me when I was younger. Now that she is declining I am spending a lot more time with her. I never knew my father and I want her to tell me about him as much as possible and I am also learning a lot about her and her experiences which I never knew. Her husband really came in between us. 
Regarding her estate, I hope to achieve the following: 1) Make sure that my mother's finances are secure and protected for her to be able to afford the care she needs, and 2) I would like them to stay in our family and NOT go to my step-father in the event he outlives her. I have disclosed these desires to her and to my father’s family, but not to her husband. She and I are in agreement about this, and have had this discussion more than once. However, because of her condition she is considered vulnerable. I do not have much experience with anything legal, and I need to find an attorney to begin the process. Where do I start and how do I prepare?
I understand I may need to apply for a conservatorship, in particular of her estate. Is this as simple as visiting an attorney who specializes in elder law? We live in CA.","comment 1: I live in CA too, but my issues with my Dad, who has AD, haven't been so complicated.
I would suggest you see an attorney, yes. Since she is still ""in compos mentis"", as they say, more or less, maybe she can sign a document favoring you, rather than her husband... although I think that might be a long shot. The law favors spouses.
In any case, a lawyer would be able to clarify your options.
Good luck to you. I hope this brings you and your mom closer.
comment 2: Since she's already been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, you may run into problems for her executing legal documents. Some lawyers won't touch it. We ran into this problem with my mother who had to sign some stuff. In order to do it properly we needed to have her doctors say she knew what she was doing, and the lawyer involved needed to interview her also to make sure she understood. However since everybody was in a cord we just had her sign the papers with a notary instead without mentioning to him the issue. This only worked because no one in the family was disagreeing with the action. Be very careful when you're finding a lawyer what you tell them about her mental status. My mother was Compass enough to do something legally but it made the first lawyer not want to do the paperwork.
comment 3: Those were my concerns as well that there will be problems executing legal documents because of her status. In what form should the the doctor's statement take, will a letter from them suffice? Because she does know what she is doing, there is no doubt. I think she wants to avoid upsetting her husband who is unpredictable. I've seen that he won't let her speak for herself when they visit the doctor but I speak to her all the time and her decision making capacity is fine. Her memory and coordination are what are failing. 
If I have a prepared doctor's statement that she is competent enough to execute legal decisions for herself, this could facilitate interactions with attorneys in the matter, if I understand correctly? We are going to review and amend the designated trustees and beneficiaries in the document to reflect her wishes, so we have to work with an attorney for this I imagine, a notary probably wouldn't work. Thank you!
comment 4: I found out the some doctors will write a letter about their assessment, our specialists preferred to have the lawyer speak to them over the phone. I'm sure they're just afraid of getting in trouble. The lawyer than said that in addition to speaking to the doctors she needed to interview my mom by herself without others so she could ascertain that she was not being influenced by anyone. That is a good thing in your case. Insist that the lawyer do this if you are worried about your mom not being able to speak up. And do this as soon as possible before circumstances change. One other thing that can be done is stipulate that additional bequests can be left in an envelope with the will for the executor to follow as he sees fit.
comment 5: Another thing I forgot to say was that a guardianship can have more than one person on it and the person that is named first can overrule the ones that are second Etc. So if you can get him into having a younger person i.e. you, on it as the first so they don't have to change it later, that might solve some of the problem. When my mother was first diagnosed my dad did put me first on his legal guardianship documents in front of moms. Just in case there was an emergency. We are both still on it, but if we have a disagreement it'll work out fine because she and I are on the same page.

"Father with FTD is starting to wander off, GPS tracker? My fathers dementia is getting worse and he is starting to wander off more frequently.  My mother lives with him and I live just a few houses down but he is sneaky.  Although we have lived in the same neighborhood for our whole lives he is getting lost and scared.
Although it seems like a creepy ""big brother"" move, It crossed my mind that a small tracking device might be one option.
Possibly looking for a GPS tracker that I can put in his pocket that would allow me to quickly locate him in the event he takes off and gets lost.
Any advice on this or any other options I might have would be appreciated.","comment 1: You should look into Tile (I discovered them a couple days ago - the reviews seem good, I'm likely to order them soon myself).... you get four thin Tile Slim gps tracking devices for $100 (or four Tile Mate devices for $70) and can track them with your phone. 
Here is their website: 
(You can search their app in the App Store) 
https://support.thetileapp.com/hc/en-us
comment 2: I had a tag made for my mother, at the Petsmart dog tag station.  It has her address and my phone number, and I'm going to put it on her keys, which she remembers to put in her purse out of habit.  That way at least she will know where she lives, or someone can call me to go get her.  She's not a wanderer, though.  I don't see any problem with GPS.  Have you looked at the cellphone tracking apps?  They're made for parents trying to keep track of their kids, but if you can get him to remember a cell phone, that might work.  We can't chip them yet.
comment 3: Take a couple of pictures of him each week so you have current ones in case you need them when he wanders too far.  I've been locking exterior doors and putting the keys away to help prevent wandering issues.
comment 4: I have a small device called ""stick n find"" that I keep on my cat that works with my phones Bluetooth so it's only good for about a hundred yards or so. It  lets me find her  by showing a radar like  screen  that points me in her Direction and also it beeps  and make some lights  so I can track her by sound . There are trackers that are used 4 Hawks by falconers which actually allow you to track them down with another device. They cost a couple hundred dollars at least. The problem with most GPS devices is they are not exact. The advantages of both these kinds of devices is they are small and can be attached easily as a piece of jewelry or in a pocket. I am sure there's also GPS devices but I haven't used them yet
comment 5: Have you considered a clock that shows the time of day and his schedule and putting it next to the door? That way he knows that he is not supposed to be on the way out. 
comment 6: FTD = his decision making and ability to synthesis disparate informations and contextual clues are probably not very good. Clock and schedule posted might be nice to help with re-orienting, but near the door probably wouldn't do much... though might attract more attention to the door and idea of leaving. 
comment 7: Companies like medicAlert or lifeline have medical bracelet service that also will ensure contacting back to family. GPS tracker , cell phone apps, in addition not a bad idea I think, of course the ethical concerns because he is not giving consent or assent to the plan. Store car keys, coat etc out of view. Put something on the door to notify you when opened (there are different products). ensure you have at hand noted in one place info like height weight identifying features so you wouldn't have to think about it, with up to date photo. Try to find out places he goes or tries to go and routes he usually takes to keep in mind where he might get lost if that ever happens. 
Edit to add:speak to his case worker or whoever is implicated clinician for further advice
comment 8: My father and I installed ""reserve locks"" on all the doors.  This did the trick until we had to admit her into a memory care facility. 
"
"Venting: memory care move in We moved my folks into memory care. Dad's forgetfulness is on the order of 1-2 hours, he is literally the ""where is my wife, my wife is lost"" guy now, when she is away too long.
We're suspending their cell service because they keep calling local kids like me and asking for otc drugs they can't manage, food they can't keep track of, and to be moved back to where they didn't have enough 24 hour support.
Some of us kids are dead burned out and swearing. Some have been away too far and are still processing that our parents are not whole anymore. The greater family has either given up or will be some version of 'doesn't get it'.
I'm taking a one month break from contacting them because I think they'll need months to fully connect with the staff. I am preparing mentally for nothing to change and that they continue making unreasonable unsafe requests of us when we do connect. They act happy and connected when with staff and fellow residents, but give seemingly unreal angry and sad and desperate comments only to family.
Meanwhile, heart rending voicemails (both with a message, sometimes just labored breathing for three minutes) continue coming in. Although I think there cell service was suspended just now so my phone should stop ringing every hour.","comment 1: Hang in there. It took my mum 3 weeks to stop crying & leave her room. During that time I checked in with her once or twice a day... on my schedule.  It's so frustrating & yes, I have gotten totally burned out again & again. But, given time they will settle in & get a routine. 
comment 2: They'll be fine. I think the month thing is really a myth. There's nothing to say you can't stop by for 15 minutes to check in on them, short frequent visits generally work better and cutting off all contact so quickly can be very disorienting for them. But, don't forget, either way. So whatever works. If the presence of family isn't comforting to them, and it isn't for everyone, it's OK to cut back on visits.
And, honestly, they will either settle in or they won't. They're safe. Safety is king when happiness isn't on the table. 
comment 3: I'm sorry for the hardship you are experience. It's true that you need to take care of yourself, so if contact with your parents is too much for you right now it's a good idea to take a break. It was recommended to us by the first care home my mom moved into to cease all contact for 3-4 weeks. The recommendation was based on nothing they could articulate, and from their feeble explanations I sensed that it was more for their benefit than my mom's to have her family out of their way. We were ultimately not comfortable with not supervising her care in those early days and in a place she was unfamiliar with. Mom called us incessantly for the first few weeks as well, which was heartbreaking. It made me realize how often she was thinking of us (all day, sometimes in the middle of the night). I felt as though the only times she could have some peace was when we were there for her in person or answering those calls to reassure her. It's all in the moment now, your visits won't have an impact before or after, only in the moment.

"Tech for lonely parents when away! I was wondering if this community could help,
My dad is a 75 year old widower and I'm now moving abroad, with him following next year. 
So I thought I could find some kind of wearable button (bracelet, clip on belt pad, whatever) where if he's in trouble, he can press it and it'll instantly call me or the emergency services.
This would put my mind at rest a lot, as he has no friends or family here and will essentially be totally on his own, until he moves abroad to join me next year.
But so far, the only thing I've managed to find, here in the UK, are 24/7 monitored services, with a monthly subscription ... or wearable tech that costs over £100..! It seems as though the simplest solution is hardest to find! 
Anyone have any ideas?
As I say .. just a button, connected via bluetooth to an app, that when pressed calls a contact or emergency services.
Thanks for reading. ","comment 1: Hi, GreatCall has a little thing called Lively wearable (wristwatch) or Lively mobile (can wear on belt or as pendant around neck). They are emergency alert jewelry that enable the user to push a button and talk to the operator who can help them with emergency needs or with other senior needs like contacting you - tho not sure about the overseas part. Price varies from about $25 - $50 depending on if you want one that will send an auto alert to 911 if it senses the wearer has fallen. Not perfect, but overall works well - as long as they keep it on. :)

"seeking tips for upcoming trip with grandma hi there, 
there is a trip to a camp that our family has made every year for 50 years. it's a regional conference for churches which my grandparents have always loved. 
however, many people in their generation have passed on or are not able to travel. also... grandpa passed away a few months ago from a very brief bout of cancer.
most of the time grandma does not seem to be aware that grandpa has passed away, she is calm when we don't mention him outright and can get very very upset sometimes when his illness and death are recalled. it's like she's experiencing it all over again, with the added pain that she can't go visit him or see him again. 
they were married 65 years.
this will be the first year without grandpa. she is 88. she can walk around and is very familiar with this camp in one sense, but in another sense she doesn't even remember that she still lives in her own home. she is aware that she has a relationship with her daughters and me, but does not recall the type of relationship (mother/daughter, granddaughter) or our names or how long we all know each other or, again, where she even is at the time (one of our homes which she should know)... 
so any tips please?! how to keep track of her while retaining her dignity and self respect. we have a room in the lodge right across from the bathroom and i want to hang a sign on the door with her name or our family name so she will think to herself ""well, this must be my room.""
is it realistic to ask friends from the camp to keep from talking about grandpa's illness and death too much? i would rather have her recall happy memories/her emotions about being near him and connected to him. ","comment 1: Everyone is different, but in my experience dementia and travel do not mix well.  Something about the unfamiliar surrounds along with the change of schedule just makes for a bad time for all.  It's possible this will not be your experience.  If you do decide to take her I would try to stick to her home schedule and routine as much as possible.  Take familiar items from home such as a bedspread, maybe a picture or artwork as well.  Make sure meds and meals are at the same times as home and schedule some quiet time every day.  Think about how much time she spends at home without specific activities to do and then think about the schedule of events that this function has and compare the two.  
comment 2: That's good advice.  Also, make sure she stays hydrated with her preferred drink like water or ice tea or anything she'll drink. They can get distracted and forget to drink which can cause problems.
comment 3: If I were in this position I would absolutely not take her on this trip. How many times she's been previously is of no consequence. This will disrupt her routine which is one of the most important things to be consistent with when dealing with dementia. Signs on doors will likely not help, and the whole thing is apt to remind her of her deceased husband. The risk of wandering is high considering she has to leave her room to make it to the restroom.  She also probably won't get what she used to out of this trip, her mental landscape is different now. If this is something you must do with her she will need round the clock supervision. 
comment 4: I agree with you. I think she should be in a memory care facility. But... none of it is up to me. My aunt is the POA. I have pushed for us to do much more... and my mom wants me to be quiet. I have fought this battle countless times.. 
comment 5: Watching my parents deal with their parents, is tough. I don't really think kids fully understand their parents relationship with their parents. A lot of that relationship solidified before we were born. 
In my family, my mom has three brothers. They decide as a group. Everyone else funnels their opinions through the 4 siblings. That's all I get to say. I talk to Mom before and after family meetings, I suggest during the meetings, but it's not my decision. There are a ton of family Dynamics and emotional power Dynamics that I really don't fully understand and TBH, I'm not sure they can even rationally describe them. I guess I'm just watching, taking notes and preparing for when I have to do the same for my parents.
comment 6: i respect that system. family is family and we all have our own thoughts about things. 
in the end I know that my grandpa arranged for my grandma to always be cared for and her every need satisfied. my aunt (POA) really does make sure that grandma has all fresh clothing and is always bathed and fed and hydrated and taking medicine. there is always someone with grandma, she is never alone. 
it is hard for me because i have worked in an AL and memory care facility and i know why grandma says and does things while my aunt is somewhat blissfully ignorant. 
i am the person my grandma is happiest around. it breaks my heart and relieves me that i am that person for her. 
comment 7: Is she at risk for wandering away? Outside her habitual environment and disoriented , this could be an important safety risk.

Any recommendations on GPS trackers for loved ones with alzheimers? I was looking at a few online but they all seem to require smartphones. My mother-in-law is the primary care giver and she does not have a smartphone. She would need to track him via the web.,"comment 1: What range is she needing to track him? Just in the house or in case he leaves the house?
comment 2: If he leaves the house
comment 3: Try the Alzhemer's Store.
comment 4: Is not exactly what you are asking for but I suggest you look into LoJack's SafetyNet. 
comment 5: Thanks! And I like your name!
comment 6: We use a specifically created ALZ phone for grandma, which has a GPS in it. It also only permits four numbers to be called at all times, and on the back there is a distress signal which automatically calls the numbers on the list and sends them an immediate text with coordinates. 
It's called the Doro 580 Secure and looks like this 
comment 7: My uncle has the Lively GPS device. The location is shared through a web dashboard, so no smartphone is needed. It also comes with a button that he can press to talk to a customer support person who can assist with directions and other matters eg. call my aunt on his behalf. It works well, but the downside is that it costs close to $30 a month. We've been looking at getting it for my dad.

"Something different... Apologizes if I broke any or all of the subreddit rules I'm on mobile and it's 1am. So I'm a student tasked with an assignment about creating a PSA. I've chosen to focus on the eaely signs of Alzheimer's and more specifically this four parts:
-Forgetfulness
-Losing track of time 
-Losing motor skills
-Familiar places becoming unfamiliar 
The whole video will be 30 seconds exact and I plan to incorporate real life examples of this happening without showing any faces. I was wondering if you guys have situations you've encountered before where this happens and that you feel can strike an emotional chord with the viewers.
For example, for the part about losing motor skills, I intend to show someone having difficulty tying his or her shoelaces. 
For the part about familiar places become unfamiliar, I have an idea about a hand stretching out towards a door (home), freezing for a second before turning away (forgetting where you are). While this may be simple, I hope it will stir the emotions of some of the viewers.
Like I said above, this may be the entirely wrong place to post this but I will try anyways. Any ideas are welcomed though preferably able to be shot within a students budget(aka no budget at all). 
Thank you! ","comment 1: Sounds like an interesting project!
The ones I come to think of:


Ability to handle instructions, especially processes. For example ""pull the switch and then turn the handle"" or ""add the eggs into the milk and the whisk in the flour"". Multiple sequential steps often become completely impossible to handle. 


Looking to others for answers, if I ask someone with dementia when their sister is coming over or what they had for lunch then will sometimes look around and search for a safe person to answer 


And on th ebrighter side

Songs! Early stage alzheimer patiens who have lost a lot of awareness, are still often able to sing the lyrics of old favorite songs. And late stage alzheimer patients often react positively to music with smiles and non-verbal singing. 

comment 2: That sounds like a great Idea.  Feel free to post the result! One moment that sticks with me re: familiar places is when my partner asked me one day how to get to the post office.  He had not been diagnosed yet.  It was only a few blocks away to the post office and he walked there twice a week.  I told him how to get there and he grabbed his car keys.   At this point he never really drove as I did all the driving so I walked to the post office with him.   Another sign that hit home was changes in emotions.  He started getting frustrated easily.  He went from a happy go lucky guy that never really got upset to scared and confused easily.  That would be much harder to show in the PSA however.  
comment 3: My father gets confused about what cutlery to use to eat. He tried to use a straw to eat his pancakes when we went out for breakfast one time. 
comment 4: I have seen that to, the know that they need a utensil but which one is less important, like spoon and fork. My experience is that it can in early stages be avoided by only placing the correct options in front of the caretaker. 
comment 5: Losing track of time - going outside in the summer in a heavy coat (or vice versa, going outside in a sleeveless dress in winter)

"Is there a frugal way to keep track of dad with a gps/wifi watch? Hey everyone, just subscribed here and on r/Alzheimers, both tremendous subs! I did some searching and was wondering if anyone has found a better way to keep track of a wandering parent.
My dad use to be able to walk the dog by himself, the dog would actually help bring my dad home. But my dad has been letting go of the leash and recently just got lost down the street.
I was wondering if anyone knew of a decent gps or wifi tracker watch that would alarm me when he leaves the perimeter around the house.  It seems odd to me that some of the alzeimer watches have monthly and annual fees!  I don't need it to have a SIM card, I just want to be notified when he is about 100ft away from his living room.  Seems to me that someone could hack a fit bit or other common wearable tech.  The watch wouldn't even need gps, if I just got notified if he left his wifi perimeter I would be happy.  I live across the street, so a quick notification is all I need.
If anyone finds anything please Post.  Thank you!","comment 1: http://www.ebay.com/itm/322043117831

comment 2: Try sticknfind. https://www.sticknfind.com/sticknfind.aspx . This is a location tag  that is Bluetooth oriented to your phone. I put this tag on my cat when I go camping . I can set it so that it notifies me if she goes out of range . we have also used it on my grandchild at the playground just in case. It also can be set to make a different sound when the object, AKA darling naughty little kitty cat, comes back in range. It also helps you track and find the person or object. It even makes a beeping noise when you push the call button. It has  worked very well for my family and I anticipate using something similar on my mother eventually. There are more expensive things like this that have a greater range. The important part is it is free to use and you can install the app on as many phones of the family as you need. Battery life has averaged about six months for me.

"Is anyone using Windows and/or Android Parental Controls to limit (this is ironic) their parent's ability to mess up their devices? My Mom sent each of the kids, and her ex- a query about protecting herself from attacks such as the recent ransomware.
Unfortunately, she does not understand that she needs to do things on an ongoing basis (pay attention, take updates etc.) and she pretty much refuses to learn how to do much with her devices.
I am thinking maybe some of the controls intended for children would b a good idea, but don't really know much about them. If it's just a matter of keeping porn away, that's pointless.

"My father is acting paranoid. My dad is 65. He spent his entire work life as an engineer and he has always been the center of everything rational and logical. 
Last fall, he began to accuse our mother of infidelity. They were purchasing a retirement property, and things went crazy. At first she thought he was joking, and soon realized he was serious. He began placing listening devices in their home, and cameras on the outside. He began leaving work early, at odd times, trying to ""catch"" her.  They went to counselling and things appeared to improve. 
Then I got the email.
My dad is asking me to listen to the tapes. He is insistent that my mom is having an affair but everything he presents as ""evidence"" is really illogical and are major over reaches. He says what started it was a note he found in her purse. It's a quote, (every love story is beautiful but ours is my favorite. Its literally all over etsy and facebook) written on an IHOP receipt in her own handwriting. People don't write their lovers love notes and keep them. I feel like he has gone down a slope of extreme confirmation bias. 
They just went on a cruise and my sister said he acted super weird the whole time...freaking out that mom went to take a shower, playing bingo with her and my aunt instead of hanging out with his brother...just a general paranoia. Even questioning my brother in law about a man that is the chairman of a committee that they are all on.
To  be clear, not a single one of the four adult children believe our mom is having an affair. She has been a faithful and loving wife, even through his dabbles in infidelity 10 years ago. 
I told him i would listen to the tapes, but mostly because I feel this is my only opportunity to possibly get him help. I almost wish she really was cheating because I feel ot would be easier to deal with that than the other possibilities. 
So my question....could these things be early signs of dementia? And if so, how do I go about getting help for a man who truly believes he is right???
Thanks for taking the time to read.","comment 1: It very well could be a sign. My mother got extremely paranoid at a certain stage in the illness, however that stage arrived after we already knew she had early onset dementia, as she had shown confusion and forgetfulness before paranoia. Has he shown any signs of that?
comment 2: It's hard to say. My dad has always been somewhat forgetful. If you tell him something when he is preoccupied, he's not going to remember that. Plus I live about 4 hours away, and if there is anything, my mom is probably chalking it up to it just being dad. 
All I know for sure is this is a major personality shift and I`my really concerned. 
comment 3: From my understanding, a major personality shift can be a pretty big sign.
Leading into my mum's formal diagnosis, before the forgetfulness and confusion, she started being extremely angry, which was completely unlike her.
I wish you the best, and hope it isn't the worst.
comment 4: Goodness me, this rings a bell and reminds me of nonsense we got from my MiL a good few years ago but it was after my FiL had died and long before we noticed anything else.
My MiL has always been quite hard to relate to, mainly because she's never liked any of her childrens spouses. My FiL died quite suddenly so it was natural that she found things tough, we thought it was just a bit of attention-seeking and ignored it all. She did, though, claim he had been 'after' some young women he had been working with and kept staying late at work so he could be with them. This would have been totally out of character for him and, anyway, he wasn't much of a catch; certainly not one to have caught any young womens eyes!
Her paranoia continues unabated as her Alzheimer's progresses, with thieves taking things from her home when, in reality, stuff has fallen down beneath her bed or she's put it somewhere strange and then forgotten where it is.
I'd like to say that, with your Dad, it's a sort of mid-life crisis. I hope it is, and maybe more counselling would help?
comment 5: Let's hope it is midlife crisis. They did do counselling, but he ended up convincing the therapist they didn't need her any more. A couple months passed, and crazy email. 
comment 6: [removed]
comment 7: He has access to her digital life. He's been through her phone a million times, and the phone bill. My point is this is not based in reality and he's hanging onto a few circumstantial items like they're nuggets of fact and they just aren't. It's very out of character.

"How to Stop Thinking About Parents Aging Hello y'all.
I am currently a first year university student, but I can't help but think about my parents' health all the time. The reason I'm going to university is because I want to provide for them in the future.
They're both nearing their 60's and are in perfect health. However, I can't help but feel something awful will happen and I won't be there. Along with that, I want to provide them a peaceful and stimulating retirement but since I'm on the doctor track, that won't be for another 10+ years.
How do y'all deal with this stress and anxiety?","comment 1: Jeez. I wish I could tell you how to avoid that stress but it's pretty unavoidable. Just cherish them as much as you can for as long as you still have them – which could very well be another 30 years! Life is just so damn unpredictable. 
comment 2: I know exactly what you mean.  I'm older than you are, but I remember thinking about that exact same problem since when I was a teenage years.  I'm also the only child.  I was also pre med once because there is such a perception of stability in income.  If I can give you one piece of advice is to use all your worrying as motivation to work really hard on something you really love.  You are so young.  You need to take risks now and the rest will fall into place.  It is easier said than done, I know.  I am also working on it now too.  I also find it helpful to get them involved.  For example, do you know what their financial situation is?  If not, maybe you should talk about it with them.  I'm working on creating a course to help people do this.  If you're interested at all I'm happy to share it with you.

"I don't know what to do.. Life is crazy People are stealing $ and i can’t do anything. It has been like that since I moved in 5 years ago. I feel so powerless to do anything. Any time I want to do anything my dad fights with me and belittles me. Saying I’m not capable of doing it. He has apartments that people are stealing 15k a month from. 
I’m now 26 and he is 86. When i talk to him about my feelings and the way the things he says affect me, he just insults me further calling me a pussy, bitch, piece of shit, etc. (every name in the book). He has this same story he always tells me about my history. How my mother is a whore and my sister isn’t my real sister etc. If I talk about my feelings, he’ll turn it around and talk about himself. He always makes himself a victim when I’m telling him how I’m suffering and unhappy. I feel like a dog. I don't really have a life. I’ve been depressed for years. And when I talk to my dad about it he just says I’m crazy and have a mental condition.. I’m just depressed.. Then he acts like a victim and that I’m there attacking him just because I’m telling him how I feel and that I want change.. I don’t know why he is so mean to me and I can’t reason with him. He always twists things and blames me for everything, makes things up that really hurt me. Every problem is my fault. He blames me for his arthritis flaring up even though it was caused with him getting furious with his horse trainer; I was there taking care of him every day all by myself and he was blaming me all the time... I died and stopped sleeping…  I’ve been doing this for almost 6 years all by myself. My dad is racing horses all over the country. He mindlessly spends 100k+ a year on horses and doesn’t even make 15% of it back. You’d think he’d help me out a little bit with some necessities? I’m driving a 97 Honda with no airbags and in bad condition (I’m dead if I get in a wreck on the freeway, he doesn’t even care.), I don’t have nice things, no life and I’ve given up on it. He doesn’t want me to have nice things. I’m doing anything just to keep him happy so he doesn’t blow up on me. I’m lacking courage and knowledge on what to do. My life has slipped away from me. I’m now 26 and have been here alone since 21. I haven’t done anything for my life in that whole time, I dropped out of college when he got sick with a bowel obstruction and that was it. I haven’t had a life since then. I’ve been so depressed that I don’t even go out; I feel so much anxiety all the time. I have/get social anxiety and this is part of the reason that has stopped me from really finding proper help. I feel like a freak.
When I tell him I need help and I need to talk to someone. He tells me that if I do then I’m out of here! That I won’t get a penny from him. That he’ll just replace me with my brother because he is easier to control. My brother tried taking care of him before, my dad ended up calling the police and getting him kicked out when he threatened he’d shoot him, he lasted a year. I think my dad needs professional help, someone that can actually talk to him. Because the way my dad is he doesn’t listen to anyone. He doesn’t have a problem cursing at people anywhere when he’s upset, even in public. He insults me in public in front of other people.. The memory of him telling me how worthless I am and how he wishes his daughter was still alive taking care of him when we were at the bank has scarred me… I was just trying to help him… He was destroying me in front of the whole bank (echoing all over) just yelling at me how I’m a pussy and I need to be made into a man all because the teller said we had to pay $6 for some copies of checks and I didn’t want to fight with her to get it for free because it is irrational (it feels like fighting for free food from a restaurant..) He thinks only he knows. He is a control freak..  Even if he can’t do things he has to be the one that is in control. I don’t want to stop being around my dad and I do care a whole lot about him. He can be a nice person too. But I just don’t know what to do.. The years are multiplying and my life has slipped from me.  
This is my dad’s life; getting up, watching fox news or going on pc, eating his oatmeal with raisins, blueberries. Talking to his workers, the only people that talk to him are people that work for him.. And my dad doesn’t really treat them too well which is why there is always problems with his horse racing.. He never wins and his trainers usually don’t even care because in my opinion they are upset about the way they are talked to. My dad will hire anyone that will talk to him on the phone and answer it. He doesn’t care for my opinions, I can tell right away when a trainer won’t work out and he doesn’t listen. I’ve been right every time.. He is always having conflict at the race track, complaints and conflicts about every season. I’m not trying to make him stop because I know it makes him happy but I know there are better ways to do things and he doesn’t care for it. Even though he is just throwing everything away.. 0% chance to make anything back and I’m there helping him along the whole way, doing what he orders.. So my dad spends his days watching fox news, on the phone, or on the pc(writing letters, reading articles, watching videos.) He can walk around. But he will hardly do anything important for himself no matter if I remind him every day. He will never fix himself something to eat even though the fridge is full of food. He would rather just eat an apple for the day or a can of sardines so I'm forced to feed him every day because he refuses to feed himself. It feels like the only thing he cares about are politics and his horses. I wrote more than I thought and if you made it this far thank you for taking the time.","comment 1: Do you have any ability to support yourself? Do you work outside the home?
There is a really good caregiver's website at https://www.agingcare.com/caregiver-forum/caregiver-burnout
I would suggest that you go there are repost your story while carefully covering some of the language. (Use p****y instead). You need help and you need it now from people who've been there. Take extremely good care of yourself in the meantime. Go out more. Go for a walk. Grab a coffee. Find a park to sit in where you can catch your breath. Use caregiver forum for mental support. Do anything and everything to protect your mind. 
You might also seriously consider taking a class locally that you'd enjoy. You need a distraction and mental break. It would benefit you greatly to interact with others who aren't mentally unstable. It would help you regain perspective about yourself.
You should also make an appointment with a doctor to seek treatment for depression. An antidepressant could help your whole situation more bearable and feel less oppressive. Don't inform him of any medication or treatment at all. You are over 18 years of age and it's none of his business. You do what you need to do for you.

"Early signs? Should I keep track? Worried Daughter-in-law. I've thought about getting a planner to keep up with my mother in laws odd behaviors, and forgetfulness to see if she is showing early signs since her father had one & her mother had the other.

comment 3: You're pretty on point with your knowledge of what to do as far as planning goes. Kudos! 
As a note to OP, and to add to above comment, what symptoms is she showing precisely? The immediate course of action would to be what plus_dun_nombre suggested and to get the future plans in order and in writing. Depending on her symptoms, it might be too early to give a real diagnosis of dementia, but the testing can't hurt nonetheless. If both her parents had it then she's a very viable candidate for the disease but it can develop in anyone.

"What's the best way to approach the subject of dementia? For the past few years now my mother's cognitive ability appears to be declining. She is forgetful, she seems to have difficulty completing simple tasks (for example, she takes a very long time making a couple sandwiches because she will forget what she is doing and get side tracked with something else). She will get dates and times mixed up frequently even if I have reminded her multiple times (and this will be for something that is happening later the same day or the next day). She has hearing loss which does not help the situation. Sometimes I wonder how much can be attributed to hearing loss but I'm not sure. It's just sad because I feel like I can't connect with her anymore. It is really difficult to have a conversation because it is necessary to repeat things many times and I'm still not sure if she has understood me because she will just pretend that she has. 
I'm just wondering how to broach the subject of dementia with her or if I should?  I know there's some online screening tests you can do but I'm not even sure it's dementia. The cognitive decline is noticeable though. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. Thanks. ","comment 1: It depends on your relationship. I told my mom I was concerned about her cognitive abilities, was very matter of fact and ""memory getting fuzzy, getting older, amiright? let's check with Dr Larsen next time you see her! I'm sure is nothing, but hey, if it is, let's tackle that."" Then I made an appt with the GP, told them why I was bringing her in over the phone, and let the doctor give her the cognitive test. (BTW it took 2 tests over 3 years for it to be evident.)
My mom is mid stage Alz and experiencing anosognosia, so I do not use words like ""dementia"" - which she would be upset about and insist she doesn't have - I use words like ""memory issues"" or ""aging cognition"" or just nothing at all. 
Good luck. If you haven't yet, get a will and POA handled ASAP.  
comment 2: Thank you! This is really great advice - makes a lot of sense. I'm going to practice having the conversation a bit with a friend. The challenge is my mom is really sensitive. Probably the most sensitive person I know, so I will have to be super careful on how I have the discussion. Again, thanks. 
comment 3: My mom is in long term care with Alzheimer's. It took a long time for my dad to convince her to be assessed and a 2nd geriatrician 2 years later to get the diagnosis right.
She has never acknowledged (or realized) that she has Alzheimer's. 
I echo the previous comment. Get power of attorney asap. If your mom won't agree to see her doctor, maybe you can enlist one of her friends to help. 
Good luck!
comment 4: Thank you for this. It's really scary to think about the progression of things, and I think perhaps talking about what my dad has observed would also be helpful. I'm going to find some time to talk to him as well. Thanks again. 
comment 5: I can't speak in terms that I have a loved one showing signs of a cognitive decline or with dementia, but I am a CNA who has the pleasure to work in a specially designed lock down building dedicated to dementia only residents. 
The best thing you can do is get the required tests done to produce a proper diagnosis. The underlying problem is pinning where your mother is at in the progression of her possible dementia. Based on the information you provided, she is already displaying some very obvious signs of some type of dementia, but until she is tested, it's hard to pinpoint exactly how well her cognitive functions are still performing. If she's at the point where she's forgetting things on a daily basis your first course of action is to find a specialized doctor who can help with diagnosing her. Then if she gets to the point where she is no longer able to provide her own simple care, you need to see what you can do about either becoming her durable power of attorney, or finding/appointing someone who can take that position. That way, you can be the one to decide what precautions are to be taken for her wellbeing since she is no longer able to do so herself. For example, my resident's durable power of attorney is their son and/or daughter. They can decide a number of things including whether or not to recessutate them in the event that they go into heart faliure, etc. 
You always want to keep an open mind and be as patient as you can with her. Most people don't understand that dementia isn't simply just dementia. It is a broad spectrum that has numerous different types that all cause different behaviors and affect the brain/body differently. 
  If she is still at the point where you can have a conversation with her about getting tested, and she can remember the conversation 2-3 days later, you have different options. 
  If she is at the point where she can not tell you whether or not she agrees to get the testing done, you'll have to explore other options in getting her tested and getting a proper diagnosis. 
I can't stress this enough, but, for future reference: If she progresses to the point where she has been diagnosed with some form of dementia, had known it in the past, but no longer can remember or do the the simplest of cognitive functions, she more than likely needs to be in the professional care of someone like me either at a nursing home or have a home health care worker who can help her with those things. I honestly believe that her being in a nursing home would be the better decision because she is way more at risk of endangering herself or others in her own home because of all the things that become hazards, stairs and the kitchen area to name a few. 
If it ever gets to that point, the cruelest thing you can do is to constantly remind her that she has dementia. That also means constantly reminding her of deceased relatives, parents, etc. They have to relive that pain every time they're reminded.
  If she gets to the point where her mind is very far gone, let her live in her world as she sees it. I've always said that it's our job to live in their world, not the other way around. 
  If it comes to that point and she lives in a nursing facility, make sure she gets the care she needs and deserves, you both have that right. 
  And if she every asks her why she's there and you've exhausted every other redirection that you can, don't tell her that it's dementia. Tell her that she lives in a retirement community with other people like her where they're well taken care of. 
  If she remembers the dementia, never call it that unless she does so herself. Adress it as a ""problem with memory"" and remind her that it's common among the elderly. I have always found that this helps. 
  I have a resident who we count as highly independent in the sense that she remembers how to eat, she can carry out a full conversation even though she forgets the majority of what you tell her in an average of 3-5 minutes. It takes a lot of patience and you really have to be a special fit to work in that environment but I honestly can't think of anything I'd enjoy more. She frequently asks why she's with us and she's one of our residents who you can be pretty forward with. I tell her that she has a problem with often forgetting things. She asks if she's crazy and I constantly remind her that she's no more crazy than me. 
I hope this answer helps you and your mother. Always be patient with her, that's one of the best things you can do.
comment 6: Thank you for taking the time to provide me with such a helpful and thoughtful answer. I will remember all of these great points going forward.

Our facility is large with anywhere between 25-40 children in attendance daily. We have a pool, gymnasium, track, trampoline room, and a huge outdoor area, their favorite place to play. This area backs up to an assisted living facility.
The assisted living facility has one rogue occupant (~80ish) in the advanced stages of dementia who likes to sneak out, wander around, and oftentimes gets lost. She can walk fairly well but is otherwise non verbal and cognitively checked out.
When she sees us bring the group of children outside, she wanders over because she wants to play with them, which makes the children extremely uncomfortable because she will proceed to try to grab them, tug their hair, poke their faces, get at their jewelry (necklaces, bracelets, etc), pull at their clothes, hug them and not let go/block them from leaving, grab their backpacks, chase them as they run away, and more. Yesterday she tried to lead them back to her house up the hill and give them plastic bags to eat. Sometimes she will stand off to the side staring at them and suddenly rush forward babbling and flailing her arms. She chased me and some of the girls around the entire walking trail yesterday, stomping angrily because we wouldn't stop.
None of this is malevolent. She is simply very mentally far gone and I don't think she even understands what's going on or what she's doing. When she finally leaves, it's usually to wander around elsewhere and we're always having to call assistance to one of the subdivisions in the area that she frequently gets lost in.
We have had a talk with the children and they know to try and avoid her while playing, but it hasn't helped because she just chases/corners them if they ignore her. Usually we get several in a day complaining about how she scares them/makes them uncomfortable and a few parents have complained, as well.
As one of their supervisors, how can I go about addressing this situation? I've done everything in my power that I know to do. Talked extensively about courses of action with the children, lead them to another area if she gets too handsy, try to distract the lady away from the kids. I don't have the authority to talk to her facility or otherwise take extreme action. My boss knows of this issue but I don't think she understands just how uncomfortable it's making the kids because it's 'just an old lady who doesn't mean any harm'. I know she doesn't mean any harm but she's wandering around unsupervised and now the kids have taken to hiding behind my chair whenever she comes around.
I want to be as respectful and gentle as possible handling this. Is there anything I can do? I know she's lonely, etc. but I can't keep letting her grab onto and harass the kids like she does. It's just getting worse. Any advice? Thank you.","comment 1: She needs to be in memory care or a skilled nursing facility.  Contact the director of the Assisted Living facility and inform them that you have no choice but to contact the police the next time.  That ought to light a fire under their butts to work with the family and social services about a more appropriate placement for her. 
comment 2: Call the police if the Director of the AL doesn't handle it IMMEDIATELY next time. I have a loved one with dementia, and I absolutely understand the challenges that come with it. It's one thing to help children understand and learn compassion. It's another for their physical safety and emotional well being to be in jeopardy. This is not only a huge liability for you, but it's hugely unfair to the children. That honestly sounds traumatizing.
comment 3: Call the nursing home or the police to come and get her. She can unintentionally hurt the children (or herself on your property) and that would be a shit show. 
comment 4: This should be taken up with the facility she lives in.  Is she not supposed to be at her home and not wandering around? I can't imagine they just let random patients leave the facility unattended.
comment 5: Residents in assisted living facilities can come and go as they please.  
comment 6: I agree with everyone about either talking to the facility or notifying the authorities.
You do have the right to talk to the facility. I work with Dementia residents. This behavior 1. is dangerous for the individual with Dementia and 2. dangerous for the children. She is mostly ""harmless"" but any unwanted touching- let alone of children- is sexual abuse. It is not as if these are grown adults who work for a nursing care facility. These are bystanders who are children. There is a lot of legal action that can be taken out on both your work place and the facility this lady lives in. If you are still worried, a possibility could be an anonymous tip.
Either way, both this lady and the children you work with need protection. This type of behavior would not be allowed if she was at a skilled nursing facility. Because she is displaying these dangerous behaviors, she needs a more appropriate placement at a facility that can address these behaviors. It is not the lady doing these things, it is the disease..So please dont feel guilty, it would be for the best of her and the children.  
comment 7: u/nbx909 has it right.
comment 8: As others have commented, she needs to be in a skilled nursing facility or a lock down memory care unit where the workers have been properly and professionally trained to take care of people like this woman. I have had a few residents in my experience with the same symptoms and behaviors that you describe and they can be very alarming and off putting to people who don't have the proper background knowledge of dementia. Said people will not be able to tell that she is harmless. 
First thing's first, report the assisted living facility to the state and tell them everything that you told us. Proper precautions should have been taken to keep this woman within the confines of the facility. Every time she is ""out and about"" without supervision it is considered an elopement. Try to recall how many times you've seen this woman outside without a worker from the facility. They obviously need to have a fire lit up from under their asses because it is one thing if she had gotten out once. From what you described there have been many numerous occasions where this has happened. As a CNA who works in a memory care building, I am absolutely appalled and disgusted that this amount of negligence has gone unreported and unpunished. It sounds as if they may let her out willingly or they are too incompetent to take care of this woman. Her behaviors are her own. She cannot control what she is doing and I'm glad to see you can understand that. 
So call the state and report the facility. This patient's wellbeing and life are at risk if she has escaped so many times and it is pure negligence. As a compassionate person, I love all my residents and can't imagine being a family member of this woman and finding out the information you have given us. It literally has me feeling sick because of how negligent this facility must be. I beg you. 
After you've called and reported the facility to the state, they will come and investigate the facility. If they contact you to ask questions please help them in any way you can. 
In the meantime, you need to call the facility and let them know that if you see this woman outside the facility unsupervised again, you will be calling the police for the sake of your children (not that she would/could purposefully harm them) and for the wellbeing of this woman. Do not tell them that you contacted the state.

"Bluetooth Necklace Device for Elderly Neighbor My elderly neighbor asked me for help finding a product and I am struggling to find it. Currently, she has a device that she wears around her neck that has Bluetooth and connects to her cell phone and has some basic emergency functionality (I believe it's hooked up to 911). 
She recently purchased a home phone system that also has Bluetooth and she was hoping to buy a new neck unit that would allow her to connect to both. 
I don't know the typical name for this device nor can I find one that allows you to connect two different Bluetooth devices. Do you know of any devices that fit the bill?

"Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia. Hi,
I'm looking for some advice on my Grandfather / Dad (There is two of us here, however the grandson is typing so I'll be typing from my point of view), this is a big post so I'm sorry but if anyone could have a read and provide me with some advice I would greatly appreciate it!
--
Noticeable Onset
In 2015 we started to notice that my Granddad had the start of dementia/Alzheimer's and we spoke to his doctor (with his wife/my Nan) to make them aware and see if they could do anything but for some reason they said that they are unable to do anything or say anything to him until he asks/mentions it...
6 Months Later
About 6 months later he had a TIA (transient ischemic attack) and was taken to hospital, they released him the next morning but started him on some tablets.
6 to 12 Months Later
Within the next 6 months several people like his neighbors mentioned that he is forgetting things and repeats himself lots.
Other attacks & hospital visits.
Since then, he's had a few more smaller TIA's and we notice his memory is getting worse and worse, he can't remember going to the hospital in the last 5 years (even though he's been 5 or so times, twice by ambulance).
Confusion
He repeats himself a crazy amount of times, even sometimes in very quick succession. He misplaces things like his keys, phone, hat, chargers... etc and gets confused with even the simplest of things that 10 years ago he would have been able to do just fine, he's broken several things lately from trying to ""fix"" them himself because he would have normally been able to fix them but now he just does things wrong.
We recently installed new taps in the kitchen and bathroom and within a month he had broken the taps in the bathroom because he tried to undo them because ""they felt broken"" which is just because they are different and could be turned easily where as his old taps had broken and were pretty fused up.
He purchased a new door bell recently and he brought it over unable to get it to work so he wanted me to have a look at it, he had tried to open the doorbell to fix it and had damaged all of the plastic where he was trying to push a screwdriver into it to open it up when all he had to do was pull the plastic tab (it said ""Pull me out"" on it) to get the battery to connect. I let him take it home and we said we'd come and put it up on the weekend (2 days away), when we turned up he had been trying to open it up again because it ""wasn't working"", he had forgotten that he had brought it over and the only thing required was to put it up on the wall.
Violence/Anger
He get's quite angry when he gets confused and he's also been a little violent towards my Nan by punching her on the arm on multiple occasions, we've spoken to him about this and told him that he can not do this, we've also spoken to my Nan and told her not to wind him up. It starts of by him forgetting something and then my Nan goes on at him over whatever it was and he gets angry and ends up being aggressive. Since we spoke to her about it he has been fine as she has been doing what we told her of not making a fuss over it, just let it go even if it's very annoying.
Repeating himself
Speaking to him a few days ago, he repeated the same story to us about 5 times within the space of 10 minutes. We don't bother saying anything instead we listen to the same story 5 times. He however isn't aware that he's told us.
Recent Scans
Over the past month he's also been having a few MRI scans and memory tests to check for any changes with his brain, however he still doesn't really tell any of the family (or his wife) the results and probably forgets the results by the time he gets home.
My Granddad was spoken to on a 1 to 1 basis with my Dad in the car when they were coming back from his MRI scan and my Granddad said that he didn't think he had anything wrong with his memory, my Dad thought this was the perfect opportunity to talk to him and he told him straight up that he did believe that he though there ""was something going on with his memory"" but that there isn't anything to worry about and that he should just get on with life and enjoy himself. After he got home and my Dad had left, he apparently broke down in tears and got upset over it all. We actually went down the next morning and already he had forgotten most of the previous day and didn't mention Dad thinking he has something going on. I could tell him the upcoming winning lottery numbers though (he asks all the time if I can get him the winning lottery numbers as I am always able to help fix things for him) and within an hour he would have more than likely forgotten them.
Getting Lost...
The biggest worry with him for us is him getting lost, he goes out in the car (doesn't tell anyone where he's going) and goes off at hours at a time, we don't know if he gets lost or what is going on.
What we really kind of need is to get a tracker on his car/on his keys but we don't want to appear or be invasive for his privacy, the main reason we want a tracker is to make sure he's safe and ok, there's been many occasions over the last two years where it's 11 at night and he's not home after going down to the pub, he's not told his wife where he is and she obviously gets very worried, upset and scared. We have to go out and try and find him. He just doesn't understand and laughs at it every time.
We noticed a note in the Kitchen about a ""loan"" and we're not sure what that is about, he says he doesn't know what it was about either and we're obviously a little worried that he might be in trouble with money and also a bit worried that he seeing someone on the side (I wouldn't be surprised, likewise our Nan wouldn't be surprised) and maybe giving her money (even though the money he has is equally shared between him and his wife)
Taking control...
We've already kind of taken some form of control by speaking to the pharmacy (with him being there) and getting agreeing that no changes to his tablets or how they are delivered can be made by him without one of us being there because he gets confused and has changed delivery of his tablets several times causing himself lots of stress, the staff at the pharmacy stress and causing himself to have to wait a few days without any tablets.
Forgetting to do things like eating, brushing his teeth, wearing a coat... etc
He forgets to eat and has to be reminded by his wife constantly, if she was to pass away he would quickly get into a state and either not eat enough and become unwell or just get dirty because he forgets to brush his teeth (his wife reminds him every day), he forgets to put underwear on (his wife reminds him every day) and he forgets to go out with a coat on even though it's supposed to rain later on.
What next?
This is all of our first experience with someone with Dementia/Alzheimer (we're pretty sure it's vascular dementia) and really don't know what to do so any help and advise would be very much welcome and appreciated. ","comment 1: The first thing you need to do is get him a thorough check up to make sure that these symptoms aren't being caused by anything treatable.  After that, find a neurologist who specializes in dementia.  Honestly, the meds that are currently available show little efficacy in most patients, but you can try them.  A clinical trial could offer some home.  Finally, dementia patients don't know they are doing anything wrong with their outbursts and they can't learn, so scolding them is meaningless.  Even if you sit them down and they agree to everything half an hour later it will be as if the conversation never happened; to them, it didn't.  This is why so many dementia patients end up in a care facility.  Most homes are utterly unequipped to deal with them.  If possible, get him to designate a POA so you have the legal ability to make decisions for him.  Bring in a caregiver to give your grandmother/mother a break in her duties.  It is unbelievably exhausting to care for even the most compliant dementia patient.  It is, in effect, caring for a toddler with the body and legal rights of an adult.  
comment 2: Hi Lordica,
He's been having checks including MRI's over the last month in relation to his past TIA's and they've been testing his memory at the same time.
He's mostly all there just he gets very forgetful, frustrated and he's very very stubborn just like both of us, he genuinely doesn't think anything is wrong and as such it's hard.
He still lives at his own home with his wife, they go shopping (to a degree), they take care of themselves (to a degree).
They both have their own problems my Granddad is actually the listed carer for my Grandmother because she lacks a lot of physical capabilities due to weak muscles, arthritis, bad hips/knees... (even though she's had operations/replacements) and he is able to help her with all of that. He certainly does take on the role of having to take care of her, a lot more than most couples.
We've tried to encourage her to age concern ""events?"" but she just like him is very stubborn and she feels that it's for really old people and doesn't want to ""be one of them"" but we're all confident that she'd enjoy it and it would do her good, part of the reason we want her to go is so he can have a break... but saying that she also cares for him by getting him to eat, reminding him of everything, in her case she is all there mentally but not there physically, where as for him it's the opposite way round.
If we said to him that we're going to take him to the hospital or have a discussion with him over it he would get frustrated, angry and upset; let alone mention power of attorney. We feel that he's right on the edge between being able to remember and not being able to remember going to see someone about POA.
Hopefully that all makes sense.
comment 3: Disclaimer: I'm not a pro. I just have a grandma with moderate-severe stage Alzheimer's Disease and so, I'll be speaking from my experience.
First, you need a proper diagnosis. Certain types of dementias are treatable, others are not - the only way to know is to get a diagnosis, preferably by consulting several neurologists and psychiatrists. [Here's] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1307463/pdf/westjmed00154-0073.pdf) a list of reversible and irreversible dementias. The document is a bit old, but it'll help you understand (just like it helped me) that dementia is a symptom of a disease, and you need to know what you're dealing with in the case of your dad/grandpa.
Second, form what I have seen in my grandma, your grandpa's symptoms sound quite similar to hers: see them here She hasn't been aggressive, though, but this could be due to her personal character. She has always been a bit stubborn, for example, and has gotten even more so in the past 2-3 years.
Usually, with Alzheimer's you can see a physical shrinkage of the patient's brain over time. I don't have my grandma's MRI scans handy, but there was clearly more water in her most recent brain scan compared to one take 2 years ago; the density of some of her brain parts has diminished too. So, archive his scans and make sure to bring them to your physician/s for progression checkup.
Keep in mind that if your grandpa has irreversible dementia he will be unlearning things day-by-day, from more complicated tasks like driving to simple ones like feeding oneself and going to the bathroom; so there will come a day when you'll need someone who will take care of him 24/7. Hence, start thinking about getting an at-home caregiver or a residential care for elderly with dementia right now. Begin to research this issue, plan your finances and start discussing this with your nan. A good, trained caregiver will be your godsend. Having her/him in your lives will ease up the psychological damage that you will go though during the last years of your loved one with dementia.
In the future, please consider lying therapeutically and abstain from fixing your grandpa's storyline. I know it hurts you to hear him say something about having recently seen or spoken to a deceased relative, but he doesn't remember any of it, so reminding him of a death of a loved one will make him upset all over again. Whenever my grandma talks about wanting to see her dad who died in the 1950s, we just straight up lie to her that he is on a vacation and will be back in a few weeks. Same goes for telling him about his diagnosis, but this is my personal view. 
I don't know which state/country you live in but reach out to your local Dementia organization. They can provide you with lots of very useful advice and support and remind you that you are not alone. 
If I can be of any additional support, please pm me. Good luck to you and I hope your grandpa's condition is reversible.

comment 4: Hi,
That's part of the problem, he's very private, stubborn and the sort who would stay in denial for a long time, he would also get angry, frustrated and upset if we spoke to him about it and wouldn't let any of us come to the doctors with him so we can't ask the important questions; let alone get anything done. He's all there mentally, it's just his memory that's the problem.
My granddads children (even my father) are all hesitant to step in and sit him down and talk about it partly I assume because they don't want him to actually have dementia (don't we all want that?) and because of how he will react to it. I've been trying to push my father at least to step in or at least speak to the other siblings to try and get them all to agree on something. It's not really for me or my mother for example to step in as we can't do much being non-immediate family.
As far as our medical knowledge goes (we have a very healthy amount between us) it certainly looks like vascular dementia, he's had 3-4 MRI scans over the last 3-4 years and they haven't said anything yet, I fully expect the results of his most recent set of tests to come back saying that he definitely has dementia and I can see something happening on the medical side. He's always drunk a fair amount of alcohol, probably a little too much on a regular basis throughout the years but not to an alcoholic degree, he still has a few beers here and there but only really 1 or 2 on a night to the pub for example because he just can't handle his beer anymore.
You mention the unable to recognize people in photos, my Granddad is terrible for this. He struggles sometimes to even realize that some pictures are his wife (granted she does look a bit different) but he very rarely manages to recognize any of his children in any pictures unless the picture is within the last 15 years.
My granddad also mentions that he ""saw this lovely [insert dog breed] down the town a few days ago"", it's the same story every time, likewise he keeps telling us about all of his mischievous doings back when he was a young man. When 10 years ago none of these would ever be mentioned.
We've been getting photos out a lot whenever they come round, likewise we have made them photo calendars, buy them some old school music just to try and help with his memory.
In the UK, the doctors can just bring up their notes on the computer and the MRI scans will be available for any doctor that sees him to see.
We haven't noticed him unlearning things so to speak, just confusion with anything technical (I can understand that) and forgetting to do things. 
I spoke with my mother today and an agreement she has with my Nan is after her other knee is replaced (later this month) she is willing to go to a few age concern meetings/events (for tea and biscuits) to see how it is there but part of the agreement is that she'll only go if my mum goes along with her for a few sessions because she's obviously and understandably anxious about it.
Ahh, we already lie and abstain to help with his stories, we know he's confused and forgets and there's no point getting in an argument with him over something silly, we just as bad as it sounds, nod and smile. The only reason my Dad mentioned to him about he thinks something is going on (memory/brain wise) is because my Granddad started the conversation and it was the first and more than likely only good opportunity to speak to him about it, in private, without his wife (she'd chip in with comments which wouldn't help)
Your advice, story and help is much appreciated. No need to apologise for typos :)
Edit: Apologies for the typos. I'm writing this on my phone.
comment 5: Hi, sorry for a rather later reply, but here we go:
From what you have written, I am getting an impression that your grandpa's progression into the disorder/disease according to this outline is either in stage 3 or 4. The outline is a bit general and may not fit every person's symptoms but its translation was given to us by my grandma's physician.
Have a look at https://www.dementiauk.org/ for support. I don't know where exactly you are in the UK, but here in Aberdeen we have http://www.alzscot.org/ chapter and although I'm not originally from the UK and my grandma isn't being treated in Scotland, I have been visiting them for some moral support since last year and they have been extremely helpful. So have a look online for a local chapter and do give them a call even if you don't have anything to say and just need a bit of encouragement that you are doing all that you can. Also, I don't know if the NHS covers elderly care but maybe it would be worth calling the NHS and asking them about palliative care for elderly with dementia? I'm sure there must be some sort of help out there.
Yes, get your Nan on board as soon as she feels better. If possible, have your grandpa's GP or physician talk about his diagnosis to her, so she fully understands the severity of the situation. Then, inform the rest of the family and start working on a plan for your grandpa. The sooner you agree on one and get everything ready, the less anxiety you will feel and the more opportunity you will have to spend quality time with your grandpa before his condition gets really bad. 
I can understand your father and his, to some extend, unwillingness to accept his father's (possible) diagnosis and move on with it. My dad has been struggling too. His mom (my grandma) has been a strong and independent woman all his life and brought up 7 kids all on her own, gave them very good education and took care of their kids when they couldn't. To see her now struggling with tying her laces and making tea is heartbreaking. So my mom and I have become my dad's counsellors and we try to support him when he feels sad and upset. If your dad has been showing signs of sadness and anxiety because of his dad's health problems, and he isn't willing to share them with you, then maybe it'd be worth to talk to him about seeing a counsellor?
Hope it works out for you!
comment 6: Hi, Thank you for your reply, very very late from me.
I had a look at that website and we believe he's actually stage 4, but not too far away from being stage 5. Over the last few months it's been getting quite noticeable.
So, he had to go back in to the hospital to get the results for his scans and the way we decided to deal with it was instead of any of his children or his wife go with him one of the grandsons went in with him as he tends to be more accepting around us we think it's because he doesn't feel as embarrassed which I can certainly understand but none of us judge him or anything we're all very understanding people.
They confirmed to him that he has dementia-alzheimers and vascular dementia as we expected and he took it surprisingly well, he didn't get upset or anything but the hospital were amazing and made it sound not as bad as it sounds. The hospital gave us some telephone numbers and we were asked to organise a meeting with a lady from age concern / dementia uk.
The lady went to my Granddad's place a few days ago and they (Granddad, Nan, their daughter in law and the Age Concern/Dementia UK lady) discussed a bunch of things, she suggested a series of things that should be done such as a joint power of attorney, getting attendance allowance for my Mum & Dad as they go down a lot and help them with all sorts of things from decorating, cleaning, sorting their tablets, taking them to the hospital/doctors... etc). Again he surprised us and was all okay with it. We think it's because it's confirmed now so he can't be in denial anymore because you would understandable deny it, I certainly would!
We're going to organise another meeting with the lady again but this time without my Granddad being there because there were a lot of things that weren't brought up that are a concern including things like in the last two weeks he's only showed twice and if this was brought up in front of him he would definitely get angry.
My Nan, unfortunately is rather useless she is the sort of person who won't step up to the plate and take control. He's always been the one in control of things. She's also really not good with knowing details because she nags at him and she also is very sneaky and uses his obvious forgetfulness to get things that she wants even though she doesn't need it. I'll can't think of an example right now but everyone notices it.
The family have already spoken without Nan & Granddad being around about it as we were all confident that is what was wrong and had been trying our best with no experience with it before. We've already for the last year or so been spending more time with them because we all had thoughts that it might be dementia creeping in and in hindsight we now notice even more occasions were we're thinking ""oh maybe that was dementia starting..."". Today for example my Nan & Granddad, Uncle & Aunt, Mum & Dad are all going out for a meal and to the theater for a show :)
As for my Dad, he hasn't shown any signs of sadness or anxiety. We'd notice it if he was because it's normally very easy to spot. We're just getting on with it, kind of shrugging it off and keep everything normal but now trying to put things in place now that we have a diagnosis.
Sorry for such a huge reply again but thank you for being a wonderful help, we really appreciate it.
comment 7: :)
comment 8: You need a good doctor and a good lawyer. Take him to the doctor. Explain what's happening and that you or your father need to be present for appointments to discuss issues and meds. Secondly, your father needs to apply for legal conservator of his money, or POA, or guardianship. OR he needs to be placed in a memory care facility because legitimately elderly people cannot care for other elderly people. Especially if he is already hitting his wife. There are several meds that help lessen symptoms such as anger and aggression. They do not help the disease itself but they will mitigate symptoms so that you all don't want to kill each other. Have his license taken away. Driving is not advisable. You can easily change this to just a govt issued ID. If he cannot be trusted to stay at home or to be civil around his wife you may need to consider having someone move in to help care for them. Or like I said, a memory care facility. Neither are cheap. In the states memory care places range from $4,000-$6,000 and up per MONTH. This entire thing is scary and horribly stressful but it needs to be done, the sooner the better. By the time I made it home to help my dad he was hiding knives under his bed and living on hostess snack cakes and not paying the mortgage. It was bad. 
comment 9: Hi,
I should have mentioned, we are in the UK and healthcare is free and universal so the doctor side of things isn't really an issue especially with our local doctors who are fantastic.
He would understand what is happening, but he would be in denial, he would get frustrated, angry and upset and just wouldn't come with us to the doctors (let alone to see someone about POA)
He's still mostly all there, he's made it very clear before even when he was much younger that if he needed to go into a home/care facility that he would kill himself as he doesn't want to be a burden nor does he want to be unable to do things for himself. We have noticed that recently he has been letting people help more with things which isn't like him, almost like he's starting to realise he can't do everything anymore.
In regards to the physical violence, he has stopped and hasn't hit her in 6~ months and that is after we spoke to his wife about how she needs to stop winding him up, going on at him about forgetting things. She's the sort of lady who would frustrate even the most sane so I can kind of understand my Granddad but we are all well aware and in agreement that he can't hit, we've told her if he does it again to tell us and we'll have to sit down with him and talk about it with him present as it's unacceptable and will NOT be tolerated.
Do you know of any legal means for us to either put a tracker on his car or on his keys (I would put one on his phone but he uses old school phones) just so we know where he is for his safety and our peace of mind. His driving is still very very good, I can't really falter him in terms of his driving.
We check up on them regularly between the sons and daughters and we also make sure they get out and about, be it food shopping, clothes shopping, random trips to the town for coffee or even take them to the cinema, theatre... etc so we know roughly what they're like, except for the financial side of things he refuses to talk about money and keeps everything private when it comes to money; it's a very British thing to do unfortunately.
comment 10: The only gps trackers I know of require a monthly service fee. But if he has a newer vehicle services like onstar can be helpful. Google for a while and see what you can come up with. I would work on the money thing if you can. Just to be sure he isn't giving it away or whatever. My dad was very very easily upset about his money, of which I had total control of for the last year of his life. Most of the time I could redirect him but we did have some major fights about it. At the end of the day it's all being done with the persons best interest in mind. A lot of people will hide symptoms. They won't ask for help out of pride. And the will forget they even need help if they do realize it. Patience is key. And persistence. Be observant and note any changes in behavior etc. 
comment 11: Hi,
I posted a lot of stuff over at https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5rto1f/looking_for_advice_on_my_granddads_ever_worsening/desjtge/ about the results of them actually diagnosing him and the dementia uk / age concern lady advised a series of things like power of attorney, letting us know about all of his bills and everything so it can be sorted and managed.
After the lady had left he actually drove my Mum back to her home and after dropping my mum off he was supposed to be going back home straight away however an hour and a half later we got a call from our Nan asking if he had left because he wasn't home yet. We explained that he had already left and we told her we would drop in to the pub to see if he was in there and drop into the supermarket to see if he was there but just as we were going to leave the house to check the phone went off and it was him. He had just got home after 1 hour 40 mins when the car trip home is about 8-10 mins. He said that he had gone and done the lottery and looked at some football results. Which as far as we are aware would only take 20 mins max, there's still 1 hour 10 mins of unaccountable time. We have no idea where he went.
comment 12: It's hard to develop a plan without access to his physicians and medical records - doesn't the spouse have access or any authority?  To more practical things: I would ""break"" the car (take out fuses?) or ""lose"" the keys so he can't drive - it would be horrible if he harmed someone. Limit the amount of cash and try to make sure he doesn't carry checks (my dad would just sign a blank check and hand it to the cashier at stores for them to fill out...).  Make photocopies of identification he carries in his wallet because that will probably get lost.

"Survey for caretakers - help me understand what problems you're facing? Hi /r/Alzheimers,
After working on a weekend hackathon project, I have been interested in small devices that can help caregivers with loved ones who suffer early stage dementia or Alzheimer's disease.  I think these devices could improve the ability for these people to live independently a little longer.
I would like to know what caregivers need, and if there is enough demand to develop such tools.  Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to complete this survey!  Here is the link:
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/6ZVQKJK
Mods, please let me know if this is in violation of your rules and I will immediately take this post down.  I don't believe this is advertising, insofar as I'm not making any immediate profit off of this survey.  Furthermore, this is far from a get-rich-quick scheme.  I sincerely want to develop tools that would improve the quality of life of patients, and simplify the caregiving process.","comment 1: I've gone through the survey, and while there are intriguing questions raised there, I have some general feedback.
I'm a developer with multiple decades of experience, and I can see (in a general way) where you're going with this. I appreciate and approve!
As I was going through the survey, I realised that my wife just sort of drifted away from Facebook a few years ago. At the time, I thought she had lost interest, but now in retrospect, I realise that she had lost comprehension.
The same with her use of the iPhone. In both cases, I worried that it was her eyesight, so we got her eyes checked and purchased new glasses. No change. It was just that she didn't really know what to do when presented with a Facebook screen or a smart phone.
In terms of my anxiety of her going out walking by herself, a phone seems kind of bulky and in danger of getting lost or stolen. If there were a device something like a fitbit or Apple Watch, that certainly would allay any concerns.
Since I'm with my wife most of the time nowadays (and we have a small house), I couldn't really relate to the other features you were asking about, but I'd be interested to hear from other caregivers as to their opinion.
comment 2: Thanks for your comments.  This is indeed a good point.  I imagined that patients in the early stages would be as connected as you or I, and carrying a modern phone with bluetooth and gps.  It's good to know that this won't be the case for all patients, even in the early stages.  
Indeed, a smart wearable might be a better requirement.  My understanding is that an Apple Watch has a GPS radio, but doesn't have a way to broadcast the wearer's location to the internet.  But there are inexpensive Android wearables out there that have more-or-less the complete cell phone experience, with 3G and GPS radios.  It might be as simple as building a simple watch face on the front-end and adding some monitoring software that runs behind it.  To be determined...
Thanks again for your comments. =]  They really highlight the fact that it's hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution.
comment 3: Please don't let my comments dissuade you from pursuing this! I think it's a valuable avenue to go down.
Things are complicated; life is complicated. But making things better for our fellow-sufferers can only be a good thing.
comment 4: I agree with the simplicity and portability of the device.  I switched my mom from a smart phone to a flip phone and she can't dial that now either.  As for Apple vs. Android sounds like the android wearables are a better option but in my experience the apple gps is better at locating in real time.  Non the less of course if you need a phone for it to work of course then it is not good enough.
Oh and thanks you may have explained to me why she watches (and complains about watching) the news.  I have tried to set up netflix for her on the TV but that didn't seem to keep her attention either.  Speaking of TV a complicated thing for her is the remote.  She can't understand pushing the device buttons means the remote won't work.  I have painted the correct device button gold so she could get back to TV/Cable box control but she doesn't understand that.
comment 5: Yeah, she depends upon me to switch from listening to music on the CD player back to the TV. I'm totally cool with that. It kinda spooks me that she'll stare at the blank TV when the CD is done, and I've not noticed the music has ended.
I noticed a while ago that even watching our favourite rom-com movies was not satisfying anymore. I'd start crying at the appropriate places (yes yes, I'll admit it), but she wouldn't.
I have to admit I cry at also inappropriate places, like in our morning Wake up & Dance, but what the hell, I'm entitled.
comment 6: To answer the question you asked in the title:
• I worry about her wandering around (that is, I worry when I have to leave her alone for a bit). She needs some sort of thingie that prominently displays her name and address for any good samaritan who encounters her and wants to help.
• I worry that her food choices have become very limited, and I'm unsure that what I'm feeding her doesn't accommodate all her dietary needs. These days she will eat granola bars and yoghurt, but balks at pretty much all the 'real food' I try to feed us both.
• Scheduling of her doctors appointments when she needs to 're-up' her prescriptions.
• Something that can engage her mind during the day. She spends most of her time watching cable news, because she cannot follow plot lines in more drama type of television. She likes comedy, and music videos otherwise.
comment 7: cough
comment 8: I may have to quit my job soon to take care of my Mom. How much would I get paid by the state or government to take care of her?
comment 9: I have no idea.

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/6ZVQKJK","comment 1: Done. 
Um, most of the products you are surveying about already exist on the market in the form of baby safety gear. 
You really want something I'd be interested in? I want a safety device that can track the location of an eloped patient in real time down to a 10 foot radius. I want it to be waterproof and tamper proof that is safe for frail skin and can't be removed by an elderly patient. Think ankle bracelet, but softer and smaller that reports in real time to a website that I can access at any time to see exactly where grandma is going. I want to be able to set a radius alert that either creates a radius around the house or a fob that I can carry on my person. 
You make something like this and just about anyone who cares for someone with wandering behavior will be interested. 
As far as I know, there isn't anything like this on the market. 
comment 2: Thanks for your feedback.  It is incredibly helpful to hear back from people who can tell me to look down one path and NOT to look down another path. =]
comment 3: Yeah, that intercom/speakerphone stuff just wouldn't work for a lot of patients. By the time they would need such a device, they wouldn't know how to use it much less know to push a button when they are in need of help. A simple text is useless. By the time I got an alert ID probably already know grandma was missing.
Dementia is hard to nail down but going in the direction of strait monitering is better. The less reliant the device is on patient input the better because that would capture a wider range of patients on the cognitive impairment spectrum. Wireless baby moniters work well in a lot of these instances because there is no input from the patient. Moniters work great, but won't tell me where grandma went when she escaped. Luckily for me grandma usually ended up at the same place, but that is rarely the case with dementia patients. 
My sister in law recently was part of a search for an elderly patient that escaped their house one night. All the neighbors searched for 3 days, and the police eventually started just looking for a body. A day laborer stumbled on her in an orchard about a half mile from her house and called the police. Every night she was out the temp dropped down into the 30's. No one knows how she survived given how sick and frail she normally was. A strait up tracker that was always attached to her would have alerted everyone to her exact location and prevented such an arduous search. 
If you can create the tracker I described, you would not only capture consumers who care for elderly wandering patients, but also a ton of parents of special needs children with cognitive impairments, parents of toddlers, or just parents who are paranoid. That is a MASSIVE market. 
comment 4: Thanks for the follow-up.  I find your response really valuable, but I just want to make a couple comments to make sure I understand your replies.
> Yeah, that intercom/speakerphone stuff just wouldn't work for a lot of patients. By the time they would need such a device, they wouldn't know how to use it much less know to push a button when they are in need of help. 
The idea, as I envisioned it, is to hear a patient who is crying out.  The patient wouldn't be using specific voice commands they would need to learn, they would just be shouting for anyone to help them.  Would this be more useful, since there is nothing the patient needs to know or do except the normal human response?  Or do patients tend to be unable to even call out for help when they are having problems?
> A simple text is useless. By the time I got an alert ID probably already know grandma was missing.
How would you already know that grandma is missing?  The product that I envision would be sending an alert at the very moment that the patient leaves the house irregularly.  Irregularity is to-be-defined, but it might mean leaving at odd hours (after dinner, before breakfast) or any time that the cell phone is not being carried on the person.
comment 5: First one, some patients are non verbal. My grandmother when she got to the non verbal phase would chew on the insides of her cheeks, fidget profusely or other non verbal queues to suggest to me she needed aid in some way, whether it be a dirty diaper or a cramping muscle or whatever else. A baby monitor would catch this most of the time. Most moniters have a button I could press to let me speak to her like a walkie talkie to let her know I was coming.
The second thing: baby proofing doors can prevent a lot of escapes but not all, but again who care about a blanket text, I watched granny like a hawk but she was sneaky as fuck. I should clarify, she had 24 hour live in caregivers (me being the main one) and she still managed to escape. She'd wait until I threw a load into the dryer or went to make a bed, or go to the bathroom (with the door open even) and make her move. I'd notice the minute I'd walk back into the room where she was sitting which, no joke, I would never leave her more than 3 minutes. Grandma was super quick when she wanted to be. Once out of the house, even a couple seconds ahead of me she would essentially disappear. Again, I am fortunate that she would usually end up in the same place, but most patients aren't like that.  
I'm going to tell you right now, don't bother with cell phones. They can be chewed on, flushed, peed on, etc. They are impossible to wash, and are useless unless on the patient, which I can just about guarantee, 90% of the time a patient escapes with nothing more than the clothes on their backs and where they are going is the important information, not that they have left an area because a patient can be astonishingly fast when they want to be. This isn't just 'simple app stuff' you need to design here. There's a zillion apps, and they all have a major flaw, a phone can be destroyed by the patient. Trust me, if you want to do this right you need to essentially make a consumer version of those ankle bracelets they put on chronic drunk drivers. Putting something on a phone like this would be mostly useless. Think of a dementia patient like a giant 2 year old. Would you expect a 2 year old to not destroy a phone if for no other reason than to satisfy curiosity? Also, there were times in the day I wouldn't want anything phone like near grandma because she would stick a lot of things in her mouth. I'd be afraid she'd bite down on it mid sundowning fit. 
It needs to attach to the patient in some way at all times for it to even be mildly effective.
The thing you need to understand about dementia is that there are a lot of times a patient is perfectly coherent. That's why you want it to be tamper proof. It's the times they are suddenly incoherent that is the problem because those moments happen randomly throughout the day and night with zero warning.
comment 6: Here is something that may fit your needs. I've used it successfully with some clients with dementia. It's a gps tracker that goes in the sole of the shoe.

comment 7: The closest thing are GPS locators for dogs.  You can make one into an ankle bracelet.  Here are a few of them:

"Need to hide a Wander Guard I am a social worker at a nursing home that has a locked memory unit. It is a requirement that each of the residents wear a wander guard device that will alert the facility if they attempted to elope. It is typically worn on a bracelet around a wrist or ankle. However, one particular resident continues to take it off. We need to find a way to mask the wander guard device so that it can be placed on his body and not have him take it off. Does anyone have any crafty suggestions on how to disguise/mask/hide it?","comment 1: If he wears a belt look the bracelet around the back so it's connected to the belt but not visible to him. 
comment 2: Sew it in a pocket, if the resident's clothes allow for it ? 
comment 3: There is only one device per resident. They are probably about $200 a piece, so it wouldn't be practical to sew it into one piece of clothing when they have so many changes of clothes. 
comment 4: If they wear pants with a belt, it can be adhered there too. Or if he has glasses, add a necklace/drawstring/lanyard to it and attach the wander guard to it.

"Worried About a Neighbor I am really sorry if this is the wrong place for this post. If it doesnt belong here I will delete it or the mods can handle it. 
I will try to keep this as short as possible but it might run on a bit. Last night at ten PM my dogs went crazy and started barking at something outside our front door. I went to look and I saw a little old lady crouched beside my garage hiding from something. This is in Anchorage, AK and it was 15 degrees out and snowing heavy. 
I opened my door and asked ""who was there?"" and she replied ""its me Susan"". The next couple of sentence she spoke where clear as far as the words go but the words didn't go in any kind of order. So I invited her in and got her something warm to drink. We chatted for like 20 minutes, she had no ID or other effects with her just a coat, house slippers (her feet where frozen), and a pocket knife. She was very confused about where she was and wether she knew anyone in Anchorage at all. She didn't have a phone or list of contact numbers. At this point she told us she has some kind of dementia. 
I suggested that we call the police to come help us find out where she should be. At this she started to become very agitated and upset begging me not to call the cops, crying. She said she could just call a cab. I got her calmed down and told her I could give her a ride if she could remember where her house was. So we got in my car and started looking (I was very skeptical that we would find it) but sure enough after 20 minutes and some back tracking we found her apartment. She invited me in and we hung out for about twenty minutes. Her apartment was cozy and filled with lots of really interesting art by some fairly famous Alaskan artist and bunches of other cool pieces I didn't recognize. She told me very lucidly about her family, her dead husband, her daughter and sister. She told me all their names and married names and about her grandkids. I gave Susan my phone number and told her if she needed anything to call and not to leave her house again. Then I left and went home, this was about 11:30 PM. 
I dropped by her place this morning with coffee and checked up on her. She remembered me (but not my name) and thanked me for my help. We had a pleasant chat and drank coffee, at certain points she was confused about people, places and things and then other times she spoke very clearly and confidently about things. 
So heres my question, I found her adult daughter on Facebook she is a second grade teacher at a school very close by. I want to send her a message but am very uncertain how best to approach the topic. My intentions is to let her know that I found her mom in a pretty unsafe place and if she wants to exchange phone numbers so that if she needs someone close by who can check on her that my wife and I would be happy to help. How do I approach this so I don't make Susan's daughter feel like I am judging her for letting her mom live alone or for what happened. I just don't want to see this lovely older woman get hurt because of improper supervision. At the same time Im just a neighbor its not really any of my business and her family may very well have a good handle on things. ","comment 1: Absolutely let her daughter know.  People with dementia can be very good at keeping family members fooled as to the extent of their affliction and the daughter may not be fully aware of what's happening.  (Nights can be especially difficult for these patients and if you don't live with someone, you often don't see the full picture.)  If her family had a good handle on things, she wouldn't have been outside in 15 degree weather.  I also would inform APS so that they can follow up and make sure that some sort of support is provided for this woman.  Sometimes families take the ""ostrich approach"" and sort of pretend it's not really happening, and with APS involved, they'll hopefully be provided with different avenues for support in getting help for the mother.  You are a kind human to get involved and especially so for checking on her the next day.  By all means, don't feel badly.  You did a great job and I'm sure the daughter will be grateful that you stepped in to help.
comment 2: Thank you, I hadn't thought of APS. Im going to sound like a creeper but I looked through her daughters FB page and there are tons of pictures of her mom with her and her kids at lots of different holiday party and family events from this past summer. From her FB page she looks like she cares about her mom very much so hopefully she will take my message as I intend it. 
comment 3: I think she would.  You certainly come across as a compassionate person and I for one would be very grateful to someone like yourself.  Always nice to know there are wonderful humans like yourself!  Good luck and Happy New Year!
comment 4: I don't know if this will be of any help, but dementia patients in the late stages of the disease experience something called ""sundowning"" which is a time period after sunset when they get extra confused, restless, agitated and anxious. My grandma who I believe has some form of dementia, too gets very hazy around sunset and often wanders around at night. Because we don't live together we have someone in her village who watches out for her and brings her home and informs us about how she is doing. I think the old lady's daughter will appreciate your message, concern and offer of help very much. 
comment 5: As someone with a mother with dementia, please contact her daughter! I would want to know. She may be in the process of working on things for her mom, but she still deserves to know her mom was lost. You can say to the daughter exactly what you said to us in your last paragraph. :)
Also, I would call Adult Protective Services. I had to report my own mother to them. At first calling APS seemed weird, did it mean there was neglect... for us it was self-neglect on my mom's part. APS will allow the elderly woman to get the help she needs, and a social worker can check on her.
Thank you for caring! 
comment 6: Thank you so much for the response. I am so sorry your family is going through this. My own mother is getting up there and has a bunch of different health problems, none dementia related and it has been really hard getting her to accept the help she needs. I hope you had a wonderful holiday season. 
comment 7: As someone who cares for a loved one with Alzheimer's I would certainly want to know both that dangerous wandering had happened and that there was a caring person nearby willing to help.  It was very hard for me to accept help initially but now if someone offers a day/time they can help out I snap up the offer!
comment 8: Tell us what happens 
comment 9: I will
comment 10: I would definitely let the daughter know.
She may not realize the danger her mother poses to herself. Oftentimes, with dementia, the person does fairly well in a familiar environment (like their apartment), but they get very disoriented when they venture out into unrecognized territory.
The mother may be experiencing a worsening of symptoms, and if that is the case, it is in everyone's best interest for the daughter to be aware of this.
comment 11: I defineitly noticed this. Once she was back in her apartment she seemed to remember everything a lot better. I sent her daughter a message on FB hopefully she reads it. 
comment 12: Nothing new to add in terms of advice, just want to say that you did  a really good thing. I don't know many people who would have handled the situation with such grace and compassion. 
comment 13: Awww... thanks but I think I did what most people would have. Im just glad I have dogs, if they hadn't started barking I wouldn't have known she was out there.

"Heartbroken and Worried My sister in law, 58, was diagnosed with Dementia about 3 years ago. She was ""ok"" for a while but has been on a steady decline recently. My brother is the primary caregiver and it has taken a toll on his health too. 
She has recently started sneaking out of the house while he is in the shower. She has a GPS bracelet that she wears that allows them to track her through the Sheriff Dept but it is usually a 2 hour ordeal wondering where she is. They typically find her sitting in someone's car in the neighborhood, which in itself is scary because people not understanding what's happening could become violent in the protection of their belongings.  
We saw them tonight for Christmas Eve and when she arrived she was crying and breathing heavily from what her doctor has said in the past, is a panic or anxiety attack. She has trouble forming coherent sentences and most of the time just mumbles. Very restless. Sits down and then gets right up and starts wandering around the house. 
My brother is torn on placing her in a nursing home. They don't have the money to pay thousands a month for her care in a nursing home of his choosing and has been denied MediCaid/Care on 3 separate occasions. Someone even told him he needs to divorce her which would make a ward of the state and they would then place her, but they could put her in a home anywhere in the state.  She is the light of my brother's life. They have been together since their junior year of high school. 
Does anyone on this sub Reddit have any advice on where to turn for help or assistance?","comment 1: No question about it. Put her in an institution. Otherwise it takes down two people. Apply for Disability on her behalf, that would bring in some money. I did for Early Onset Dementia and got it, to the tune of about $400 a month.
comment 2: This is not safe and your brother needs help. Please call the Alzheimers Association and tell them you need resources and advice. Ca APS, tell them you are concerned about her safety (wandering!) and health. They can provide help as well.

"GPS tracker for elderly I'm looking at GPS trackers for my Dad. He won't carry a smartphone, but we think we can get him to carry a tracker. Just wanted to know if anyone had any insights.  Location is Illinois.","comment 1: Hi there, I would call the Alzheimer’s Association. You can try Medic Alert and Safe Return. It's a great system to track someone with dementia in case they wander. Good luck! 
comment 2: Getting a Medic Alert and Safe Return is really worth it.  The Alzheimer's Association used to provide GPS tracking device, but they discontinued for several reasons.
comment 3: I had a professional caregiver tell me that trackers give people a false sense of security. We never got one for my dad and just keep on eye on him.  We stopped him driving early on. 
My opinion is that they are a good back up.  I think the Alzheimer's website has a recommended one.  
comment 4: I had been looking for something similar to this for my mother.  I just recently found this item offered by Ting, a smaller wireless provider based on Sprint.  They are likely available on a bunch of other carriers too.  I really like the form factor, it looks like it would be unobtrusive and not get fidgeted with.

comment 6: LoJack makes a good people tracker. Uses cell towers and GPS. I used it for my father for a year or two before we moved him into his current facility. [edited a minor typo]
comment 7: I came here to ask the same question. This issue with my father in law is that he's suborn and mean. When he wanders off, he's usually pissed as hell. He wandered off last week, at night, in the rain but they found him. One of these times, they're not going to find him. He needs a tracker but he won't wear one or he'll take it off just for spite. I'm looking for a chip of some sort that can be sewn into the hems or seems of his clothes. He won't know it's there so he can't remove it but it can be washed with the clothes. Guess these types of thing don't exist.
comment 8: Hello All.  Thanks for the replies.  We've decided to try the Yepzon brand.  I'll update in a few weeks to let you know how it goes.
comment 9: How is it working for you? (Hoping Mom will always ignore a cell phone in the bottom of her purse.) 
comment 10: Update:  The only way you can tell if it's charged is when it connects to the network. Our yepzon's last connection was January 3.  I contacted yepzon and they said there were failures in the 2G network that affects the connections and the pairings of the devices.  I'll wait a bit more hoping they will work it out.  But right now, I can't recommend it.

comment 3: This is not a tracking option but could help. Find him a cell phone similar to his current that has an sos button.  This is a dedicated button that calls a programmed number. The one we used would even turn the phone on and then dial the number if needed.   They are starting to make tracking watches (often for children) that use a SIM card but that is another thing your father (or mother) will have to make sure is charged and he is wearing and had poor reviews. Again I have no help to offer in the tracker as I like you, viewed the options and could decide if any were actually up to snuff.

Have you considered an android or apple watch on a cellular data plan? There are geo location apps on the watches that help you track your routes.  You would be able to see the routes on a computer. It would be both functional for him (keeps time and shows date) and for you (tracking mechanism).

comment 12: My FIL is not quite at that point.  My hope is that he will have something and be used to carrying it before it's really needed 
Pocket Finder is supposed to be coming out with new device soon.  Hopefully it will work well.

"Does anyone have experience with GPS trackers for people with dementia who wander? My grandfather has started wandering a lot, including at night, and we need some way to quickly locate him once we realize he has left his apartment.  He will move into a place where he can get more consistent care when a room opens up.
In the meantime, does anyone have any personal experience with these devices in this application?
Thanks!  ","comment 1: We first tried project lifesaver but it didn't work for our son with autism that has sensory issues. Then someone told us about angelsense. They say they also work with people with dementia and Alzheimer's. It's a wearable gps tracker that will send you an alert with his exact location (anywhere in the US - which we wanted because our son visits his grandparents in another state during the summer) if your grandfather exits a predefined zone. You set the geo fences and any travel or exit is monitored 24/7. You can even give the home where he will be access to find him if they want. We give our school this access and they can find him if he leaves school grounds. Battery life is almost 24 hours so he will need to have it charged daily. It's the most advanced tracker we've seen and we've tried them all. 
comment 2: Thanks,  I'll look into those. 
comment 3: Been thinking about something like this for my dad. I see where PocketFinder is $130 but does anyone know how much the monthly service plan costs?? Is it month to month or is there a yearly contract?
AngelSense has a Fall Special going on right now where you get the device and first month for $100 then it's $30 a month with a 1-year contract. 
*edit Ok looks like PocketFinder is $13 a month
comment 4: Yes, first attempt was a tracker that attaches to the keychain. It's heavy and needs charging daily.
Naturally over time mom carries the tracker less and less frequently.
comment 5: Yeah, I was thinking that would be a problem.  Some have longer battery life, but the tech is still pretty new I guess.
comment 6: PocketFinder worked well for us. You'd need a way to ensure they carry it (keys?). You can set geo fences that will notify you when he exits. If you're not worried about discretion/hiding it, look up project lifesaver ankle band. 
comment 7: If he's going outside the building can you track his phone?  My father wasn't in the habit of carrying keys but almost always has a phone. 
comment 8: I don't have experience with GPS trackers.  I did want to ask a couple other questions though.  1) Does he live with anyone?  And 2) If so do you guys have a bed or door alarm so that you know when he's at risk of leaving?  
comment 9: Generally,  he has lived alone for 2 years since my grandmother passed. Someone has been staying with him this week and there is a sensor on the door to text someone if he opens it,  but it doesn't say if he left or where he went. There are also Webcam in his apartment so we can see him. It's more about finding something to let us know where he is if he leaves. 
comment 10: I am interested in the Safety Net Tracking system.  I got the name from a man who works as an EMT.  It goes by radio signals and it is sort of like a Lo-Jack for a person.   
comment 11: Yeah,  we finally got my grandfather on that,  or something similar. So far no incidents,  but seems like a solid system.

"My (f31) dad (m79) had a stroke--how to ensure that his doctors are aware of the full extent of his struggles? Thanks for reading, sorry for the long post...I am new to posting on Reddit and also posted on r/stroke...my dad had a stroke late last year. There are several issues that worry me but I don't know how to relay my concerns to his doctor because 1.) He seems oblivious/in denial of the many changes in his personality and physical abilities, and goes out of his way to downplay or straight up lie about any issues when his doctor asks him how he's doing 2.) If I (or my mom) mention anything about his issues in front of the doctor he blows up and claims we are exaggerating and plotting against him and will verbally abuse my mom if she ever says anything ""negative"" to his doctor. Physically, he was lucky in some ways--although he can't drive, he can still walk without assistance and do light exercise, dress himself, cook simple meals, etc. But the stroke definitely took its toll on his behavior/personality and cognitive functions--he struggles with confusion (loses track of time, events, conversations), is extremely temperamental, misreads social cues--like almost everywhere we go, somehow he ends up creating a scene with him screaming at someone, whether it's a barista, a receptionist, or a random person at the store whose cart accidentally and lightly bumped his cart in line. He has gotten physically violent with me once during an argument stemming from what would normally be considered a benign, easily resolved miscommunication. It is also impossible to know how much of these incidents he actually remembers afterward--if he does remember, he staunchly denies that he yelled at someone or overreacted in any way. He is also still hell bent on taking the driving test and getting his license back which scares the shit out of me. No one in our family thinks he should ever be behind the wheel again--aside from his emotional and cognitive impairments, his left side of body is still weaker than his right and it shows. But...apparently his doctor hasn't ruled it out so he was able to make an appointment at the DMV for someone to meet him, go over his medical history and paperwork in a month and see if he is allowed to even take a behind the wheel test.
He also doesn't eat much. Usually it's a small bowl of oatmeal or a low calorie protein shake (less than 300 calories) in the morning, then goes on a long walk and is usually out for 2-3 hours, gets just a coffee at some point (no snacks), and comes home and has a shot or two of whisky and eats very lightly at dinner. He's about 5'7'' and 128 pounds. For reference he was around 160 - 165 and healthy most of his adult life, worked out and lifted weights regularly and had a hearty appetite, was never obsessed about calories or keeping a specific diet. However I'm concerned now because he seems obsessed with his weight--he talks proudly about how this is his ideal weight (he says this is his ""army weight""--back when he was drafted at 18!!), and that he's never felt better about the way he looks than now, even when EVERYONE, including his doctors and nurses, comment on how thin he's getting, and advise not to calorie-restrict any more than he has, friends who haven't seen him in a few years couldn't recognize him in person, etc.
Bottom line is I wonder how much treatment, (whether it's antidepressants, or other medication/therapy of some sort) that he SHOULD be getting that he's not because his doctor isn't made aware of the full extent of his issues. When he is in front of the doctor/nurses, my dad will magically turn into the most friendly, easy-going, ""I am totally fine!"" person, and fishes for any kind of praise he can get from the doctor or nurse. As soon as we reach the parking lot he reverts back to being hostile, and refuses to follow most of his doctor's suggestions. My oldest sister (f42) was given power of attorney after a heart surgery about 3 years ago, but is no longer heavily involved with his medical care since the stroke. Is there a way to make sure his doctors are informed of his condition without causing further conflict between him and family caregivers?","comment 1: [deleted]
comment 2: Sorry to hear about your dad, your situation sounds really fucking tough, and thanks for sharing.  It's comforting to know there are others out there facing similar challenges and how others are learning to deal with the fact that sometimes there's not much we can do but to offer our support and make suggestions but still lean out of it and accept that they're gonna do what they wanna do...
comment 3: You can call the Dr. and speak with a medical assistant. This person cannot tell you anything about his health, but you can tell them what you think they should know.
Also, consider video taping his outbursts. You don't have to show him, but remember you are being honest.
And, leave him alone as much as you can. The s*** will hit the fan someday, and you might be more involved than you want to be.
Good luck.
comment 4: Thanks for the suggestion regarding the medical assistant.  I've thought about recording his outbursts but I am just really afraid that it will aggravate him even more? He's already very cynical and paranoid about anything my mom or I say, that even if we recorded and played back to him a scenario where he could see himself saying or doing things that he's denied, it wouldn't matter because he would already be hysterical at the fact that people are recording him and treating him like he's crazy.  
comment 5: Sometimes, with relatives that don't believe what I say, I have to remind myself I am telling the truth. The video, if you were to make one, is for you. 
>You don't have to show him, but remember you are being honest
And then, sit back and wait until he self-destructs. I'm kind of in that position with an unhealthy relative now. I can't do anything but watch. It is not how I'd be doing my life if I were this person.
comment 6: I've seen this several times, and its always complicated. As a can/caregiver in my 30s let me share a couple of points:
1) whether you, I, or anyone else likes it, your father is still in control of his own life. He does not want to have people making decisions for him, period. So everyone who lives him will have to respect his wishes even if they disagree. This will help reduce the abusive behaviors due to his stroke.
2) Doctors will likely only sedate him because there's no miracle medication that fixes personality disorders beyond phtcotropics and I assure you, that those aren't a good answer so, let your dad do as he wants with his own medical care. Quit trying to control the doctors understanding.
I know that what I'm telling you is a hard thing to hear. But I've seen this go both ways. And one day, the people who love you will be worried about you as an old lady.... Would you want everyone (seemingly) to randomly take over your entire being? He probably feels like that's what us happening, even if its not true. And another stroke due to stressing him may kill him or worse. 
I'm sorry for the direct honesty, but I mean well.
comment 7: Thank you for your honesty--your comments made me re-think a lot of my feelings about this ordeal and reminded me to always try harder to empathize with my dad even when it is difficult to do so.  
comment 8: I'm glad, and thank you for saying thank you :) it makes my day to know I helped! (-:

"Not the sub I planned to join this week :( Mom was diagnosed recently, I wrote her an email Mom,
I may never really know how tough the past few weeks have been for you, Or even the past few years, because I can imagine that you've personally noted symptoms for some amount of time already.
I've cried a lot recently. I've lived in this vacuum of political activism for the past year, and years even earlier, and I've become very emotionally tied in because I care about this nation, I care for people around the globe, and i understand the opportunity and privileges that you and Dad and friends and family all around have given me. I prefer to not over indulge myself with personal recreation and self centered-ness all the time.
The recent developments and what appears to be the end of a revolution are now dead for all intents and purposes. that one politician is a liar and a power and money addict who will say anything and do anything to serve herself. I'm holding out just 1% hope for a change of her heart.
But even in that contextual loss, which has felt almost at hard as the last time that I ran competitively in a track and field meet, I struggle to express my heart aching to the new world where you, and Dad, Chris and Beth, and Jen live,  Where We Are as a Family. Its a new emotional challenge in life that no one can practice for, There is only reality when it comes.
I know that you are still extremely clear minded and ready for decades ahead, your ability to keep the house together so beautifully, keep the job responsibilities at Wally World for as long as you did, to deal with the gravity of your recent breast operation and treatment, and to deal with the every accelerating change of family and work between Chris, Beth, Dad, myself and Jen, and also the challenges that you've seen your sisters live through, between John's passing, Kathy's stroke, and all of the irregularities that come later in life.
its all an incredible swirl, and it creates stress and frustration. AND this is why all people in their age should be given a retirement and given the freedoms and comforts of community and spiritual calm.
This is your era for indulgence and an era for expression. Drop the F bomb, make the lower joke than usual, have that wine or some gummies, and keep in mind that you're still the exact Sally America that God intended for you to be.
The feats of consistency, discipline, courage, and inspiration that author the story of your life can only be punctuated with a wildcard! You and Dad beat me to the Grand Canyon! There are still dozens of great American geographical and cultural treasures out there which neither you and Dad, or Jen and I, or Chris and Beth have visited. I can promise you, and you know it in your heart and from experience, there will never be a day that passes where you and Dad look back and regret going for a traveling vacation.
Jen and I depart for another road-trip about Vermont tonight, under much needed circumstances. I am really struggling with my career yet again. Freedom even if for only two weeks provides enough of a breath to fall back under water, but in the world of cubicles I'm not sure if i'll ever find land or a floating object to prevent from drowning. I cry in happiness to see where you and Dad have been able to travel in the past couple years. Its Dad's moment to retire soon, and ensure that the two of you are fully released to enjoy yourselves.
Physically and mentally you are just beginning to feel a new perspective, an emancipation, where you go with the next 5 years, and then 10 years, will only be guided by your imagination, and maybe the house cats (if they have any say in it, Bruce, Jenny, Ally, and Rip altogether!).
You deserve everything around you, every emotion and idea thats contained within you, and everything that lies ahead. Let your imagination get creative, and keep Chris and I on the hook for assignments because we owe you the world still. You gave Chris and I each the childhoods of the American Dream. Comfort, Fun, Adventure, Discipline, Friendships, Community, Diversity, and most importantly Love.
You and Dad Take care while Jen and I vacation, Enjoy the Soylent and gummies, and keep your thoughts creative, your Trust steadfast, your Faith focused, and your heart as warm as it always has been.
No Matter Where Your Mind Takes You, I'll Always Know Your Heart
Love always,  Your oldest, and wildest, Son","comment 1: Very sweet. I hope you actually send this to her!

"Don't think I can keep doing this + money woes I'm sorry for what's going to be a long, untidy, and overwrought first post.  I had a terrible day today (complete with my very first panic attack) and need to vent and ask for some advice. 
When I was 13 my mother suffered a traumatic brain injury. She gradually recovered, but over the following decades had a number of unrelated surgeries and health issues.  I ended up taking on varying degrees of caregiver responsibilities throughout all of it.
Now I am 36 and she is 77, and I am feeling increasingly depressed, hopeless, frustrated, angry, and frightened.  
At this point she is suffering from severe memory and cognitive issues.  The memory problems I can almost deal with, but I simply don't know how to handle her inability to think rationally.  I'm stuck in a cycle where I feel like if I can just find the right way to explain something she'll understand it.  I know it's not going to happen, but I don't know what else to do when she harasses me relentlessly with questions and then insists on debating the answers. 
An example: she gets four pain pills a day that are put into a sectioned box for her.  She insists she MUST MUST MUST have control over that box (I keep the rest of the month's supply locked up, because she WILL overdose if she can access them.)  I put the box with the pills on the kitchen table in the morning for her, and once she takes them she doesn't get any more until the following day.  Without fail she will move the box and lose it.  She'll then seek me out and tell me that I failed to give her her pain pills.  I'll explain that she moved them and lost them, as she does every day.  She'll say that I put them on the table in the mornings.  I agree that, yes, that's true, but she's the one who later moves them OFF the table.  She'll repeat that I put them on the table in the morning.  I'll try to figure out why she thinks that information is relevant.  I spend half an hour looking and finally find the pill box hidden under her socks in the bottom drawer of her dresser.  I remind her we go through this multiple times a day and put them back on the table.  She insists she never loses them.  I walk away, and five minutes later she tells me she has no pills and I must have forgotten to give them to her. 
What's missing from that cheerful little scenario is the gas lighting, subject changes, and general drama that surrounds the entire conversation.  As I'm looking for the pills she's following me asking me what I'm looking for, reminding me I was the one who put the pills on the table (yes, I know, THANK YOU), insisting I haven't given her pills for weeks, switching topics mid sentence to ask what her doctor said at her appt last week, arguing with me when I tell her, and asking me if I have my period because she doesn't understand why I'm getting so frustrated.  
Now, there's an obvious answer here, right?  Just take the pills away so she has to ask for one when she wants it and they don't get lost.  Except when I do that she harasses me even more.  Why do I have HER pills?  No, she never lost them, that's bullshit.  Why am I treating her like a child.  How dare I suggest she can't keep track of them or that I have to care for her on any level.  And on and on and on and ON 
To be clear, this behavior isn't just about the pills.  She does this for everything, even the simplest of questions.  She'll ask the date, I'll answer, and she'll stare at the calendar, shake her head, and say she doesn't understand.  Just trusting that I am in fact correct is impossible.  
Now I know she's not purposely doing this to stress me out.  Though I do feel confused and conflicted that she seems to be ale to take other people at their word.  If she asks them a question and they answer she might repeat the question several more times, but she won't insist they are wrong or use the question as a starting point for a two hour long debate.  So I'm curious why she does this to me, even though she's driven me to tears on multiple occasions.  She'll keep going when I'm literally begging to be allowed to sit and eat for just five minutes without having to answer any questions. 
As far as the family situation, I'm the youngest of six and none of my siblings have any interest or involvement in care giving duties.  Several of them have outright stated that mom is 'my job'.  Outside of that, I might as well not exist for them.  They'll never once asked for more information on her medical conditions and I can't imagine them ever asking how I'm coping. 
My father worked several jobs when I was young, which is the reason taking care of my mother got pushed off on me (I'm not necessarily saying it was a good reason, just...an understandable one?  I may resent it a little.)  By the time I was a young adult the pattern had been established and any time she had a surgery or illness I was the one expected to take off work so he could continue paying the bills.  Now he works nights and sleeps all day, and interacts with mom for MAYBE an hour each night.  I do all of the cooking, cleaning, taking her to appts, and deal with the endless questions.  For whatever reason, she does not harass him and will hush me if I'm frustrated because he's sleeping and 'shouldn't have to deal with this.'  But I should, I guess?   When they do interact, he really has a hard time coping and gets frustrated within seconds.  I know how hard all of this is, but he takes it very personally if she can't remember things and I end up running interference between them.  And yes, I know how messed that is, and the funny thing is that when I was a teen I used to say I would never become my father's wife.  Meaning I wouldn't cook for her or clean up after her like he wasn't capable of doing it himself like my mom used to.  Well, now I've become my father's wife and my mother's husband, and fuck all if I know how it happened.  
On the legal and financial side, I'm screwed.  When I was fresh out of college I gave up a great career opportunity because mom was sick and it would have meant moving away from her.  I found a local job that I did very much enjoy, but eventually had to leave it and found it difficult to go on working full time with mom's mental state deteriorating. Somehow I found a job where I could work from home, but the company closed down.  At this point I haven't worked for five plus years, my savings are gone, I have a big old employment gap, and no idea how I 'm supposed to both work and care for her.   I rarely leave the house for more then an hour because mom inevitably 'gets sick' and threatens to go to the hospital/punishes me with questions/has a mysterious fall, etc.  Creepily dependent r 'us over here.  The amount of stress she causes me over doing something for myself for fun is so high it's just easier to stay home.  And then there's the simple fact that I'm afraid she'll lit the house on fire/let the cats out/actually fall and hurt herself/wander out of the house/not eat all day even if the food is already prepared/try to drive/forget to feed the cats all day/possibly self harm or attempt suicide.  
I'm living in my parent's house and my father does provide groceries, utilities, a room, etc, but we've never been a well off family and I'm not comfortable asking him for other things.  There's a lot of basic stuff that is plain worn out, like clothes and my barely functioning laptop.  My car needs two thousand worth of repairs that ain't never happening. 
Legally, I don't have financial or medical power over my mother.   Someone SHOULD, but my dad hates confrontation and doesn't want to upset her.  I've been trying hard lately to get him to go talk to a lawyer and figure out what he needs to do to be prepared for when it comes time to move her to a care facility. I do honestly that might be better for her, even if she's resistant or upset at first, but again he refuses because he doesn't want to upset her.  So I have all of the responsibility, but absolutely no legal power.  
I just...this used to be easier.  Even when she had her neck operated on and couldn't get out of bed, I could have a rational conversation with her.  I can actually remember being 13 and making a clear and considered choice that I was going to be responsible for her.  But when I was 13 I thought I would have plenty of time to be independent later...only later still hasn't arrived. But now that I'm feeling like a fox in a trap, ready to gnaw off my own leg to escape, I'm in a financial position where I can't just pack up and go.
She was doing the pill thing tonight and suddenly I just couldn't.  I couldn't.  I couldn't catch my breath, couldn't move, couldn't talk to her.  Couldn't do anything but focus all of my will and conentration into NOT screaming at the top of my lungs.  I've had many, many days where I felt overwhelmed or lonely or angry (or all three), but nothing like that has ever happened before.  I'm scared, and I'm downright terrified when I imagine I could still be doing this a year or two years or five years from now.  
I'm not even sure what advice I'm asking for.  Any suggestions for programs that pay caregivers or assistance programs for unemployed people (I already used up my unemployment, obviously.)  Suggestions for how to take care of yourself when you're with someone that absolutely will not respect boundaries?   
Just...help?  
(I have posted to reddit about this situation before under a different username and I""m almost completely sure a different subreddit (I think r/relationships).  I lost access to the email that was linked to, so deep apologies in advance if I am wrong and I did post it here previously>)  ","comment 1: Ok can't solve a lot of your problems but how about using some keyfinder technology to help you with that pill hunt?
Amazon has lots in different price ranges, I bet there are even some that are for things like pill boxes.
For example: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01547K0BC/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1469845970&sr=8-2&pi=SY200_QL40&keywords=key+finders&dpPl=1&dpID=417UPn8NDxL&ref=plSrch
If you have a smart phone look into rfid tags, they are stickers that'll do the same thing, using your phone as the tracker. Amazon has these too.

"Dealing with my mother with dementia tl;dr: Mother has been recently diagnosed with dementia. I need help and advice.
SORRY FOR THE LONG POST. NEEDED TO VENT. ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE AND MY THOUGHTS ARE ALL MESSED UP, SO IF YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING PLEASE LET ME KNOW
Hello, I am 29 years old and my mother is almost 74. 
Story
She has been getting worse since 2010 (noticeably) and I suspect that it started in 2003/2002. Even though she has been getting worse since 2010 we've only been seeking doctors since dcember 2014. This is due to the fact that she was taking care of her own mother (96 years) who had been bed ridden since 2010. She had a pretty strong stroke and later had successive micro infartions in her brain completely destroying it, spending the last 3 years in bed screaming non stop (really non stop) until her death in august 2014. 
We all believed that my mother was just suffering from depression, lack of sleep, unbelievable stress (I took care of my grandmother a few times ... I couldn't stand it for 20 minutes, let alone 2/3 years). Then she started sinking .. fast ... REALLY fast. 
I forced her to go to neurologists (she lives in a small town in a third world country, where she was a doctor (geriatrics and nephrologist) until 2010, for 41 years) and it took a really long time to take her to the doctor (500km away). He sent for a few tests and it took us a really long time to get back to him due to my mother's panic attacks making it impossible to travel. So, we looked for doctors in town. One of them NEVER said she had anything, just medicated her with donepecile clorhydrate and memantine clorhydrate (both used in the treatment of alzheimer), which only made her worst and the other doctor said she didn't have alzheimer nor dementia and he'd consult his coleagues and get back to us in 2 weeks. 3 months later we had to track him down and practically beg to get our tests back so we could go to another doctor. After that I tried taking her with me to where I live, a large brazilian city and my mother lives in a small uruguayan city. I tried taking her with me but she went completely crazy after arrival and I had to take her back home immediately (after 1 hour in my city) by car, where she procceeded to freak out the entire 6 hour ride and open her door while a car was passing us. 
Finally we go to a new doctor a month and a half ago who said it clearly .. she has dementia. At that time my world came crumbling down and I barely heard a few thing: ""She's probably had several microinfartions in her brain, which is certainly why she is always dizzy. She certainly has mixed dementia and is firmly planted in the 4th stage of dementia and presenting some symptoms from the 5th stage. Her dementia has a vascular side to it certainly and presents some symptoms similar to alzheimer and another dementia. We need to perform a pet scan with the FDG and PIB markers to get a better idea"". 
This destroyed me, but ok, I'm prepared I can manage. 
It turns out that I'm not prepared and I can't manage. 
After the doctor's visit she has been progressively worse very fast. Until a week and a half ago she was taken by her brother to the emergency room because she stopped talking and was completely stiff. Turns out she was severely dehydrated (probably a combination of medicine) and since then she can barely walk a little bit with help because she falls on her back if you don't grab her (her position is literally like the back slash ), doesn't take her medicine (we basically wait until they dissolve in her mouth), doesn't eat well, doesn't drink a lot of water and rarely ever makes sense or is able to pronounce all the words she wants. 
I checked this link about the stages of dementia and I can certainly tell you that she is now firmly in stage 5 and hast at least 75% of the symptoms of the 6th stage of dementia. She went from 4/5 to 5/6 in just 3 weeks and I'm scared.
Ok. Sorry for the long vent but I needed it. Now I'll post some probably relevant information and ask you some questions and ask for some guidance.
Info
-I'm an only son
-She lives with her brother (71) and he has hired 3 more women to help him take car of her. 2 of them have been with her for a long time (one of them is a nurse and the other one helped take care of my grandmother) and they are absolutely wonderful with my mother and then a new one, that seems kinda useless (also a nurse my mother knows) because she's really quiet and I don't know if she can deal with my mother, but has planted herself as an ok care giver.
- I don't put her somewhere to take care of her because in her city, many of the asylums are known for hitting/hurting their patients or keeping them drugged up. And if I took her to one in my city she would freak out. I also don't take her to one in Uruguay's capital because of this link
. 
- I live 500km away in Brazil. She lives in Uruguy. I have a job and if I had another boss I'd be fired already. Instead this one lets me get back home whenever I need it and really helps me. This is specially kind considering the economical crisis that is happening in Brazil. The past 6 months I've spent at least 3 here. And since she's been taken to the hospital until her pet scan I can't get back to work. I'd be fired anywhere else. I have a really great boss (no, he doesn't reddit).
Current symtpoms
- Can't walk without help.
- Can't do anything without help.
- Can't maintain a conversation.
- Confuses past and present.
- Talks to dead people.
- Confuses me for her brother and her brother for her father that died in 1977
- Confuses TV and reality
- If we don't give her medicine that make her sleepy she doesn't sleep.
- She starts crying non stop after all medications wear off and stays like that for about 6 hours. I don't want to give her too much because it could make her worse, but if I don't give her something she'll kill herself. She literally tenses up for 6 hours tried to fight, get up and all that until her next medicine
Questions
- How accurate is the link stating the stages of dementia?
- I know my mother has mixed dementia. I know one of them is vascular dementia, another one could be alzheimer. Any suggestions? Until we make all the tests it's impossible to know and they might take some time. Even if it's wrong, someone giving me an idea is better than nothing.
- How can I give her her medicine?
- She's been getting really dizzy after she goes to the bathroom. Waht could it be? I already tried talking to her doctor but he isn't here. He'll only be back by friday next week. Any suggestions are welcome.
- Has anyone experienced such a fast decline in health? In january she was able to talk perfectly (was kinda forgetful and dizzy) and she was able to walk. The nurse we hired was hired back then because my mother had a tendency to do whatever she wanted, not take her medicine or take any other medicine in any doses (we didn't know it was dementia, I had my suspitions but I'm an engineer, not a doctor, and no other doctor said it at the time). In march she had a lot of difficulty saying some words and started creating memories (If I said a number and someone said bank she would get it in her head that she needed to go to the bank to deposit the number I said in her account .. she did that for weeks, every day at least 50 times a day and she would read a piece of paper put it down then pick it up again and read it again .. she did that for 30 minutes non stop .. I timed it once). An in the last 2 weeks she can't dfferentiate between television and real life, she has hallucinations, can't maintain a conversation, can't do absolutely anything without help and is getting worse. I can feel her getting worse and everybody else around her as well. 
Advice
- How can I make her feel better?
- Does anyone know how to deal with this? I'm kinda young and wasn't expecting to go through this at all, even though my mother had me almost at 45. She's always been a rock for her entire family and many people in the city (remember she was a doctor .. a beloved doctor to some a hated/loved/respected co-worker to others).
- I live 500km away and besided going to her house every weekend and on emergencies I don't know what else to do
EDIT: Added a question and reformated some of the text","comment 1: Firstly, I am so sorry you are struggling with this. I am a dementia specialist carer completing a degree in Dementia Studies in the UK, I will try to answer your questions as thoroughly as I can.
Please excuse the wall of text, I'm on my phone. 
Progression: It's likely that due to her vascular dementia she is continuing to have what are known as TIA'S, which is a ""transient ischemic attack."" This is basically a mini stroke and could be behind the quick deterioration. Alzheimers disease progresses steadily instead of in steps. A vascular dementia will be like going down in steps, and can happen over a few days or a few years. 
Diagnosis: whilst this is not the nicest fact, it's true. The only way to 100% diagnose a dementia is via an autopsy of the brain. When a doctor diagnoses a dementia, it is not set in stone. So far the vascular dementia diagnosis sounds accurate, so does the alzheimers disease. You mentioned she also talks to people that aren't there, do you mean she is talking to a person and mistaking them for someone else or talking to an empty space? If it's the latter, it is possible she has a lewy body dementia also. This can cause hallucinations and symptoms like Parkinsons disease. There are around 500 different types of Dementia. It is unfortunately very difficult to diagnose.
Medication: most medications are also available in a liquid form, and if not then in a soluble form so they dissolve in water. You can also get medication that dissolves in the mouth, speak to your mum's regular doctor about switching to liquid or soluble medication. If it's pain relief, you can get transdermal patches (usually either fentanyl or buprenorphine). These are basically plasters that stay on for between 3-7 days and release a certain hourly dose of pain relief that is absorbed through the skin.
Her mood: with dementia one of the most difficult things is often that the person cannot express themselves anymore. Think of your mum like an iceberg (weird but hear me out) what you see is what is above the surface  (crying or being angry) and that's her way of communicating to you that something is wrong. Below the surface, that's where the problem is and unfortunately you can't see it. It could be something like needing the toilet, pain, feeling sick, shoes being too tight, discomfort, not hearing well, not seeing well, things being in the wrong place, frustration as she doesn't know what to do, she's tired. It's mostly about trial and error. It could be that she is experiencing depression as this is unfortunately very common in people living with a dementia, especially alzheimers disease. Medication like fluoxitine or citalopram (which are available in liquid form) can help.
Stages of dementia: the link is not very accurate. Everyone's experience of Dementia is intrinsic to them, no one else will experience it the same way. Generally stages are referred to as ""early"", ""middle"" or ""late"".
Dizziness: if by bathroom you mean urinating, she may have a urinary tract infection. If you mean pooing, she could be constipated. If she is just getting dizzy when she stands, it could be an issue with her blood pressure. It could also be none of those and something else entirely.
How can you make her feel better: you will know this better than anyone else. Try things that your mum liked in the past, or really anything at all. Again it's a bit of trial and error. You may not always be able to make her feel better. It's also important to focus on what she can do, not what she can't do. If she is able to eat with her fingers instead of cutlery then great, that means she can eat independently and will give her that little bit of confidence. Try and encourage her to do as much as she can.  Try to go along with her reality. If in that moment she believes you are her brother, try not to tell her otherwise. I know it's very upsetting :(
Coping: there is no one way to cope with this. I live in the UK, and we have a couple of organisations that can help on the Internet.  Try www.alzheimers.org.uk or www.dementiafriends.org.uk. Both of these have forums and people to talk to who are going through similar things as you. 
If you have any more questions please feel free to message me and ask. If I don't know the answer I can try and point you towards organisations that do. Most importantly, remember to take care of yourself. It is extremely hard being a carer for a family member and you need to make sure you are the number one priority.
comment 2: Let me start by saying thank you to your advices. Some of the things you said I didn't know where possible (or just forgot) and were extremely helpful. 
About the diagnosis portion:
 - She has talked to dead people but rarely. Looking back, they happened when she out right refused to sleep for 48 hours and sometimes after she takes the quetiapine (she really tries to fight the urge to sleep ... it usually takes at least 3/4 hours to make her sleep with 25mg of quetiapine). But she confuses people all the time and I never contradict her, even when she can't say words I just complete her thoughts with random words like ... ""thing"", ""them"", ""him"", ""her"", etc.
About the liquid medicine. I completely forgot about it. I'll talk to her physician. 
About the mood. I almost understand her behaviour like science. I can tell when she needs to pee, I can tell when she starts getting too agitated and then starts crying non stop (usually a few hours after citalopram) so I give her plidex, a medicine with 3.5mg of diazepam. It usually calms her down but it doesn't work all the time and I am really afraid of giving her too much medicine, because I know it can worsen her condition.
About the bathroom. Probably too much information given in the original text. I just meant to say that she barely walks to and from the bathroom. Today she walked a lot more than she usually does and she did it until her legs were shaking (it's really difficult to tell when she's tired ... I said she walked a lot more but it must have added up to 1 or 2 blocks, which is not much).
About the dizziness. It started in 2002/2003 (I was 14) when all of a sudden she stood up from the couch looking like she was agonizing and she ""drunk walked"" (body pressed against a wall) until she reached the bathroom and started puking. She put her head on the sink, spread her legs and put her butt on the wall (very thin bathroom) or else she would fall. I attribute that episode to the beginning of her condition, I truly believe that this is the moment she had her first micro infartion. She went to doctors but they all said: ""you're fiiiine .. you're gonna outlive us all"" and all that ""jazz"". Some of them treated her for vertigo. She suspected it wasn't vertigo, but like all doctors, if there isn't anything showing on THEIR OWN exams, then it's nothing. She did the next MRI many years later when I forced her to and by then the damage was already done.
About making feel better. The thing about doing things she liked is that the only thing she did was work, drink some mate with her mother while watching TV and she can't watch TV anymore because she confuses reality and TV. Fortunately I always aggree with her reality and I go along with everything. Probably the only thing I was doing right. The only thing I can make her do is hug her and kiss her a lot, because it's the only way we can communicate, but it's really difficult for me, I'm not a very touchy person, I don't like being affectionate, I wasn't even affectionate as a child, but I can't complain. That's one f the few moments she feels well. What kills me are the 5 minutes she's completely lucid she says that she wants to die or asks me to kill her.
About coping. This is my first attempt at coping. I tried talking with her brother, but he's kinda closed up and the rest of the people don't really understand. As much as they may love their grandparents, when it happens to a parent or parental figure it's so much worst. When my grandmother had it I prepared myself and was able to get over it really fast, but now that it's happening to my mother I'm breaking down.
About being a carer. I am while I'm here. It kills me but I can't leave my job to take care of her and I can't take my job closer to her, so I'll have to worry whenever I'm away and stay by her side when I'm not working.
Again thank you for your help. Saying these things actually made me feel better and understand it a bit more, even though I couldn't give much information and also pardon my english. It's not rusty, I use it every day for my job, but it isn't my first language and I find it difficult to express myself sometimes. 
comment 3: If she's this advanced, I'm not convinced that she will be able tell whether she's in Uruguay or Brazil.  In any case, you really need to secure your own position in order to give her the best care possible.
comment 4: Yes she can. She identifies her home. When she leaves her home she flips. At least for the moment she recognizes it. 
Thank you for your help
comment 5: I work in nursing homes. I deal with dementia a lot.  
People with dementia tend to have plateaus and then they decline and then they plateau again for a bit. Especially when there's a big change in what's happening or you take them out of their usual Comfort setting it can trigger a decline.  There's been a bit of research in transfer trauma.  There's a reason old people don't like change. 
What I can say about coping is that with family members of those affected by dementia this is really where the grieving process start to happen. Your mother is no longer who she was. You may have glimpses of the past ohlf what what she wants was.  But there will be no recovery. It does not get better it's really about prolonging the life and keeping the affected as comfortable as possible.  
Whenever you are dealing with behavior the best thing you can do is meet her where she is. If she is looking for her mother do not tell her her mother is dead. Tell her that Mom is at the store or someone else is watching Mom for a bit and she gets to relax depending on what time her mind is at.  I'm a firm believer that reorienting is one of the worst things you can do because it causes the person to relive that grief every time.
Don't push yourself too hard and know where you're at your limits. You can't be a good caretaker when you're tired.  If you need help get help. Whether it be an in-home aide to help you or seeing a therapist about the stress level.
I wish you the best.  I hope this helps you.  If you ever have any questions about a particular Behavior or something like that feel free to inbox me.  I work in Recreation.
comment 6: The funny thing is that I'm doing exactly what you said. I never contradict her and always say stupid things so she loughs. What kills me is when she just can't stop crying and struggling. It physically and emotionally destroyes her and there is nothing I can do.
Thank you for your help
edit by the way. Isn't the progress just too fast? I mean. Her head doctor say her two months ago and then saw her in the hospital. He left the room almost shaking. Looked like a terrified kid
comment 7: It progresses differently for everyone.  :\ I've seen people walking and talking (although very confused) pass a few weeks later from rapid decline.  I've seen one woman linger for a few years bed bound and completely unable. Total assistance with everything. It may be unusually fast but it isn't unheard of.
As for the behavior I would recommend seeing if there is any medication that could be given as needed.  The key thing in my opinion is comfort.
comment 8: I'll do that, thank you
comment 9: This sounds really awful for you, and I'm sorry that you've got such a tragedy going on with your mother.
Do you think her sudden decline might be because she continues to have strokes?  It almost sounds like she may be regularly having little ones.  Is the medication she is on available in any other form besides pills?  Perhaps her caregivers could give her injections or something.
I don't really think there is much you can do to make her feel better, to be honest.  I know that you desperately want to, but she is likely past the point where she could be easily soothed or treated for particular issues.  Is there any kind of sedative or anxiety reducing medication in her treatment regimen?  
comment 10: I suspect it, but they haven't done a new MRI to confirm it, just a cat scan (I think that's what it's called in english) and they say that it came out ok. 
About the injections ... yeah. I'm really worried about turning her into a pin cushion. And yes there is anxiety medication, but when it doesn't work it really doesn't work. 
Thank you for your help

"Introducing eSole. A startup trying to help those with Alzhimers and Dementia disease eSole is a start-up in the wearable technology eHealthcare sector, with the initial focus on tracking and monitoring those with a high propensity to get lost while undertaking day to day actives, such as those with Alzheimer's and Dementia.
eSole is a GPS tracker embedded into our own custom insole, which can be placed into a person’s shoe.
Our product has been designed from the ground up, taking in to account the needs and requirements of the end user in a way as to not to break their routine. Our custom insole designed  for maximum comfort. We also have a custom charging pad with anti-trip power cable and a large visibly marked charging area for ease of use. We aim to move our device to be a predictive device to help reduce the financial and human cost of Dementia. 
This is a brief overview of our product and business. We are looking for feedback and welcome people to ask questions. 
We are on social media if you want to find us. Facebook,Instagram and Twitter search esoleltd  ","comment 1: There are a couple issues I have in general with wearable trackers:. 
1) the patient needs to remember to wear them. In this case if she has loads of shoes how does she remember to use her insole?
2) Charging, how does she remember or even tell she needs to charge it.
How do you handle these?.
comment 2: Hey goosetavo2013
Thanks for your question and sorry for the delay in my response. 
Question 1. ""The person needs to remember to wear them"". I often get asked this question. Our research from speaking to carers in the field is that people with the disease often have very limited shoes often one or two pairs. So we feel confident that our device will be in the right place at the right time. 
Question 2. How will they be charged? Another great question, we are actually wanting to design our own large wireless charging pad. We have several smart features we hope to implement. One is having large charging coils to allow for large charging zones. Our hope is that the person can simply have this charging pad where they would normally put their shoes and just place their shoes on their. Our aim is to have the insoles charging inside the shoes.
We don't want to break the persons routine so we try and consider this every aspect of our design.
I hope this answers your questions if not I can clarify 
comment 3: It would be cool if walking charged the device. Maybe that's  too far in the future.
comment 4: Hi kbsncme 
Sorry for the very late reply. That is something we hope to introduce in V2.0 in our device. In 1-2 years. perhaps the technology will be there.

Today I found TrackR. It is intended to be put on a keychain or your pet. But it is small enough to attach to clothing, or put on a neckless. The only feature missing is an invisible fence or some way to alert you when your ""item"" travels out of a defined zone.

"Selfish caregiver? Hi everyone,
Thank you for reading. I just need some advice on how to cope right now. I am thirty, and my 28 year old husband is currently in the hospital for a month undergoing a bone marrow transplant. He had advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma and there is a fifty fifty chance he will make it.
He has already undergoing a year of treatment, and we face another year after this. Before this I have dealt with some health issues, a difficult job, and some depression issues. We moved a year before his diagnosis, so I don't have a big net of friends to lean on, and my husband is very introverted and really just hangs around me. I feel so embarrassed saying this, but I have developed bulemia as a result of the stress. It hurts to eat due to my medical issues I just purge every night now. Since I am at the hospital with him every day and come home and spend the night alone It has evolved over the last few months into binging and taking anxiety medications and sleeping pills to stay calm.
Everyone in my life feels sorry for me. It makes me feel pathetic...I wish I was able to be more positive and optimistic about our situation, but I try my best just to hide it enough from my husband. 
I feel so selfish I am so depressed I can even take care of myself enough to do the dishes or keep the house clean. For the most part, I have spent all my free time lying around in bed because I just don't want to face anything outside of work and the cancer.
Thanks for reading. I called a therapist to talk to someone about the bulemia issue and to help get me back on track, but an other advice would be welcome.","comment 1: My heart goes out to you. I'm considerably older and take care of my wife with AD, however I can certainly relate with the feelings of depression and loneliness that comes with carrying the torch alone.
A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon journaling as a technique that might help get my head straight. I started to read a lot of very positive comments about the technique and found a free app called ""Journey"" that could be used. So I started. Interesting that after only a couple of weeks, I'm beginning to look forward to each day sitting with a coffee before my wife awakes, and just babbling to noone.
One of the bits of advice was to include a comment about what I am grateful for....hello...grateful? Actually, I have a lot to be grateful for, and thinking about it and writing it down and then rereading it a few days later is helpful. Actually does lift the spirit. So look into journaling....it's free, easy to do, helps to get some focus on your feelings, and lots of people swear that it helps.
Another item that might help is to read the recent commencement speech by Sheryl Sandberg. I saw it in the news and was impressed by her comments....she also speaks about recording a joy from each day. A helpful speech.
http://fortune.com/2016/05/14/sandberg-uc-berkley-transcript/
Remember that there are always people that have it worse than we do, and be inspired by how they cope. Best of luck to you.
comment 2: From my perspective you are beating yourself up over some perfectly rational & valid behavior. You have an awful lot to deal with right now, so it's no wonder you don't have energy left for the dishes. It's easy to underestimate just how physically taxing emotional exhaustion is.
Quiet time in bed is one of my main coping skills. Kick back, pet the cat, maybe watch something on TV. Best way to recharge. The trick for me is to give my brain something else to do besides think about things.

"Getting mom's mental decline off my chest. Not sure if it's indicating dementia or just age-related. I don't think it's age-related. I [30sF] live far away from my parents [late50sM] and [early70sF].  They visit us approximately twice a year, since I was pregnant with my son.  I started to notice my mom's memory wasn't quite the same as it used to be, a few years ago.  Not so bad that it was worth mentioning to anyone other than my husband, just to ""make a mental note"".
In the last 2 years, and with the perspective of not seeing my mom regularly for 6 month intervals, I've noticed a pretty steep decline in her short term memory. I mentioned it to my older brother (also lives far away, but sees slightly less of my parents due to a difficult wife), mainly to see if he could see it too.  He wasn't too worried at first, but keeps tabs on what I tell him (privately).
This last visit with my parents, I had my dad on his own and I asked him directly about it.  He said that I'm right, her short term memory is pretty bad.  He also mentioned that she is very very good at hiding it from most people (and that she is aware of it herself).  She can reason things out, her overall ""intelligence"" is seemingly unaffected, but she really struggles with organisational things: where did she leave her purse, what does she need to do before leaving the house, having trouble keeping track of names occasionally, repeating questions or things said in the previous 10 mins to 24 hrs....  To hide it (from my husband, for example) she resorts to telling anecdotes/stories that require long-term memory only.  Subtle, but effective.
My grandfather was sharp as a tack until the day he died of complications from an unexpected stomach ulcer (age 83).  By contrast, my grandmother had a 2 year downspiral of her cognitive abilities before she died of heart attack (age 86).
My son is only little, I want to have another baby and my parents love coming to where we live to help out and spend time with their grandson.  I'm just worried that her memory is declining faster than anyone has control over.  My mom had undiagnosed heart issues (that required an emergency pacemaker installation), and the doc said there was a small chance that those issues could have contributed to some cognitive decline.  If that is the case, the doc said that it should level off where it is.  If not, I think it's more than just age-related mild forgetfulness.
My parents do crosswords and sudokus together daily, and read a lot and watch TV/movies and go to concerts.   But because of my mom's organisational issues and also a leg issue related to a childhood case of polio, she won't go out and walk much anymore.  She used to drive and walk and take the bus, but now she avoids it.  I noticed it on this last visit.  I also read that daily exercise in the form of short walks is one of the many things that can help with dementia/memory loss.  She just won't do it though, and it's really frustrating to watch!
I trust her with my son, but I'm not sure my dad does - so when they're watching him, my dad takes primary responsibility.
I guess I'm not really asking a specific question...Just more to get it off my chest.  That being said, I know my mother well, and I know that she never wants to be a ""burden"" on anyone.  The country my parents live in (they are resident there, retired after 30ish years working in that country) has very liberal euthanasia laws (in the legal comparative sense, not political).  The laws have been around a while...I wish I could just ask her how she really feels about that.","comment 1: You're suspicions are probably spot-on. Losing so much short term memory and failing at organizational tasks are symptoms similar to dementia. You should talk to them about it, now, when she is still able to make decisions, so you can at least get instructions on what she would like. Frame it in a life-planning sense, talk about wills, DNR orders and ""what happens if you're memory issues should get worse""? Her spouse is much younger so that helps but will also be very hard on him if her dementia worsens and she lives another 20 years.
Hopefully it prompts her to go see a neurologist and/or geriatric doc, find someone that specializes in dementia and go from there. Maybe it's vascular-related and treatable, or maybe something longer term. I can't stress enough the importance of having a conversation now and how much of a burden it will remove if you have her input on what to do next. None of us ever do a ""great"" job dealing with this :(
Best of luck!
comment 2: I went through this with my dad. Eventually I had to just say to him, dad I'm worried about your memory. He has gone back and forth about agreeing with me and saying he's fine but he's definitely changing. Mom wouldn't acknowledge it either, until recently.
What I would recommend is having your dad talk to her first. She might be in denial but if you both sit her down or the family does it will likely be more overwhelming and she may become more upset or feel attacked.
I agree with the other comment about framing it in a life planning sense. When my dad would shut the subject down I'd let it go but always made sure I verbally expressed ""Fine we don't have to talk about this if you really don't want to. But, ignoring it isn't going to make it go away, and getting medical attention is always better to do earlier than later.""
Sometimes hearing someone else say that is enough. Good luck.

Any advice for cooktops (induction hob) with safety features to avoid saucepan left on height for long period? My father (with dementia) is starting to leave saucepans on height all night. Must be some device out there? ,"comment 1: You could unplug it and tell him sorry, it's broken. 
comment 2: I found this product.  Their website is appalling, so I could see how much it cost, but it sounds good. 
comment 3: I briefly installed a device that was supposed to alarm if the stove was on too long. Turns out my LO just ignored the alarm, because she didn't understand what it was for. Same with the smoke alarm, it didn't even register- she had no clue what it was for. That's the point that I disabled the stove; first I just unplugged it for a while, then I plugged it back in but took the knobs off so the burners couldn't be turned on.

"I'm trying to develop some technology to help those with dementia and their families. I'd really appreciate some feedback. My grandfather suffered from dementia during the last 10 years of his life. In the period where he was still able to live independently (at home and then in sheltered housing), there was constant worry that something might happen; and regularly something did. On numerous occasions the police showed up at our door at 4am having found him wandering in his pyjamas. Another time he had left the oven on and almost caused a fire, or his windows wide open when he went to bed in the evening, and once just couldn't get out of the bath but was too embarrassed to pull his alarm to call his carer and couldn't reach the phone to call us directly.
Thinking back on this experience and interacting with others recently it’s clear that these aren't occurrences that are unique to my personal experience with dementia. 
Essentially, for the past few months I've been developing some technology/sensors that could allow families of dementia sufferers to non-invasively remotely monitor their relative’s environment and activity. The devices completely wireless, small, and discreet. They allow families to check up on activity or receive remote alerts to their phones if something unexpected happens at their relative’s house. They will be able to monitor and receive alerts on things such as unusual door and window activity,  temperature, humidity, and light in individual rooms. With these measurements close family members are able to be alerted if their relative has gone wandering unexpectedly, left windows open, the oven on, lights on, the bath running, etc. The sensors can even be used as a direct-to-family panic alarm or automatic fall alert if the user is willing to keep it on their person.
I'd really love to hear thoughts on this, and hear about your own experiences and difficulties in caring for relatives. What day to day problems do you face that you could envisage this sort of thing solving?
Having been through this myself, I am very passionate about using my engineering abilities to hopefully provide solutions that could really help ease the lives of both the sufferers of dementia and their families.","comment 1: I think that's brilliant. My granny would have been able to live on her own A LOT longer with something like this. I would have bought it without hesitation no matter the price.
Being able to do things inside the house remotely would be amazing. Like turning the oven off, being able to adjust the temperature too. 
How about an intercom?
My granny was always confused on how to use a cell phone and would always loose them. I would have loved to be able to talk to her or have her talk to me with just the push of a button. 
I love your idea and if I was rich I would give you lots of money to help this become a reality.
As soon as my granny was moved into a home she changed and hasn't been the same since. Freedom and independence is so important, IMHO. This sounds amazing.
Her favorite song is ""Don't fence me in."" 💖
comment 2: I have worked with persons with Alzheimer's and other Dementia's for 28 years. Anything to add a level of safety is brilliant. A community that has 24 hour staff and peers to interact with is a best choice, as it allows the family primary caregiver/spouse/child to become the loved one again and provides a better quality of life for all. This isn't always possible primarily due to finances. Average income for those 65+ is $24,000 annually and the average cost for care is conservatively $72,000 annually.

"Gas Stove Scare First off. I thank God I was working from home today. My mom is 84. And I've suspected she has dementia from other clues (she asks the same questions repeatedly, she's forgotten how to do things she's always done, she's ""slower"" in her gait and seems constantly unsure, etc). But she has more good days than bad on average. 
Well today I was working from home and in my den. The den is around the corner from the kitchen. My mom had gone in to make herself lunch, nothing unusual about that. The only thing I've taken over has been her medication preparation and distribution since I suspected she's forgotten to take it one day.
She'd gone back to her room and I started smelling gas. She'd turn off the taps but turned it back on without letting the auto ignition click on to light the flame. 
If I'd have been at the office there would have been a tragedy. She could have asphyxiated (???) or could have blown up the house.
My house is pretty much wallpapered in notes to keep her on track, but I'm thinking I'll be ordering an electric stove today after this scare.","comment 1: Getting her to the doctor for an evaluation is also indicated, as some forms of dementia are reversible, while others so fast moving that the stove investment may be rapidly followed by an out of home placement, making it a waste of money.
comment 2: Remove the handles so she can't turn on the stove anymore.

"Someone please help, one of these days I truly am gonna kill myself. My grandma has dementia and I am more than done with all the shit I have to put up with day in and day out. I am literally pulling my hair out every single day just trying to move on with all the stress I have to deal with.
Let's just start with a few things I have to deal with:


Name calling: My grandma is very religious and I'm constantly being called a ""demon"" or I should go die because she doesn't like the way her food is prepared, she blames me for ""supposedly"" for going into her room, or just for something so menial and retarded I just can't.
My grandma loves to believe that everything is mine mine mine: This one really irritates me and just overall makes me want to punch a wall, because no I'm sorry BUT NOT EVERYTHING IS HERS. After she's done eating she likes to take the plate and silverware to her room because ""she bought it"" and it is supposedly hers, and once it is in her room it then is lost forever in the dark abyss of her luggages (she doesn't use a dresser despite one being in her room). You don't know how infuriating it is having to buy and waste money upon buying new plates, cups, you name it just because my grandma took it. Not to mention, she believes every single one of my own Nike shoes is hers, clothes of either my own or my moms are being stolen left and right, and just recently she stole my dogs fucking sweater. I don't know about anyone else, but when my own shit is taken I feel as though it is an attack on my own very existence, and best believe until whatever is stolen is returned I will not stand for such bullshit.


Too many questions: I feel as though I just tape a sign to my forehead that reads whatever question she's asking, and often times it's the same god damn question just asked over and over and over and over and over again. It'll really drive someone nuts. Sometimes I get so tired of answering the same questions over and over again, so I just flat out ignore her and when I do that she gets mad that I don't answer her questions. I get so frustrated with this one because she asks questions such as ""where's my mother, father, or brother?"" and I of course for the millionth time in row have to break the news that they of course are all dead.


She walks out the door: This one is truly my favorite as it requires me to waste my time and physically chase after her around the neighborhood. If my grandmother is truly upset, because of whatever reason it is she loves walking out the front door and going who knows where. You don't know how many times I've had to call the police because she wouldn't get into the car with me, and come back home and sometimes I feel so embarrassed having to call the police. Not to mention, just recently when she walked out the house she started to throw rocks at my car and wanted to hit me with a stick.


Hygiene: This one is just really fucking gross and there's no easy way to put this. But once my grandmother is done taking a dump sometimes I notice she doesn't really wash her hands even though there's a HUGE sign in the bathroom mirror that reminds her. All she does after depositing her shit is splish splash a little water and a smidge of soap onto her hands and doesn't even properly scrub. Not to mention, she hasn't taken a shower since like November and me and my mom try and try our best to urge her to take a shower but no as she thinks we are attacking her.


These are the things that only just scratched the surface of what I have to deal with day in and day out, and I know what everyone is going to say, it's the disease don't take it seriously, just brush it off. No. I am done brushing it off and I am taking this shit seriously.
I also just want everyone to know that I am only 21 years old. I am a full time college student. So on top of all the stress of my classes at school I have to deal with the stresses at home. Also no, I don't have the means to go out and live on my own. I'm certainly not a trained professional and unfortunately I am only getting paid a measly $200 a month (under the table, I am not on the payroll).
Clearly my own mother does not see how stressed out I am as she does not have to deal with her as I do. Sometimes when my grandmother comes home from her senior day care program I have to either use my own money to buy her food (which she doesn't even eat sometimes) because we are out of groceries. Alternatively, I do not feed her at all and wait for my mother to come home from work which isn't until 5 to 7 at night and my mom is too tired from work that she doesn't prepare dinner until 9 or so and the diner isn't done until 10 or 11. All the while my grandmother goes to sleep around 8pm-ish and is thusly too tired to wait and eat the diner my mom has prepared. So it is really my fault that sometimes my grandma does not eat at night? In my own defense, no it is not.
This is just a copy and paste from a post I made previously. But this is an update, as I truly feel as though I need to kill myself because I cannot take the stress any longer of living with my grandmother. I have already cut myself within the past week and bang my head against the wall several times. I cannot guarantee what will happen in the future. I live in the state of California, USA in Sacramento and if someone could just pinpoint me to a website for an assistive care living or a lock down facility. This would truly be helpful to me.","comment 1: Honestly, this all sounds like typical dementia behavior. 


Lock your bedroom doors, closets where you put important things, etc. Usd paper plates and plastic forks. Who cares if she takes them? Sometime when she's out of the house, go in with a garbage bag for the paper/plastic, and find any real dishware she might have taken. 


This is typical dementia. Of course she's repeating questions. Her brain can't hold new information. If you're about to lose your cool, get up and walk away, or excuse yourself ""to the bathroom"" for a few minutes. 


Get double bolted locks, so she can't get out without a key. There are also cheap alarms you can stick onto the door, so it will chime when it opens. 


Before she leaves the bathroom, go in with her. Hand her the soap, turn on the water, and demonstrate what to do. It's the same thing with showering- not only do they forget they haven't showered, but they might also forget HOW to do it, and their brain often plays tricks on them- the water coming from shower head can look scary, it might feel cold even though it's warm, they might be afraid of slipping or think the bath water is deep even though it's quite shallow. If nothing else, use nice scented anti bacterial lotion, and try saying ""hold out your hands"" and when she does, put some on and demonstrate rubbing it in. Get Lysol spray and Lysol wipes, and just do a quick wipe down of door handles, sink handles, etc.


I don't think you should be her caregiver either. I'm not trying to be harsh, but you don't sound compassionate or understanding. Maybe it's compassion fatigue & you're just burned out, but maybe this just isn't something you should do. Not everyone should be a caregiver. It sure doesn't come naturally to me. I get it- I'm 23 and caring for my grandmother, she's exactly like what you've described and worse. This disease is a bitch, and caring for someone with it is extremely hard. I wouldn't judge or blame you for not wanting to do it. You're still young, and probably missing out on a lot of opportunities. I'm still in my early 20s, but for several years I was living like an 80 year old, and I regret a lot of missed opportunities and the ability to be young & spontaneous. I was with my grandma 24/7, but was struggling physically (migraines getting worse, gaining weight, very depressed) and couldn't afford to not work. Now I'm with her only on weekends (her aide is Monday-Friday) and it's been great for me. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, I promise you. <3 
It's important to understand that she isn't doing these things on purpose- yeah, maybe some of it is due to her personality and habits before the dementia. But she has a brain disease. Her brain is literally dying. Think about how scary that must be for her. Even in my grandmother's more advanced stage, she KNOWS something is wrong, although she won't admit it outright. She is incapable of thinking logically or rationally like you and I do. The brain chemistry changes- they lose taste perception, temperature perception... Sometimes the only thing that truly tastes ""good"" to them would be disgusting for us. 
I understand your frustration with the daily chaos, I really do. It's exhausting. In the past hour, I've ""made dinner"" twice because she refused to eat the first time, I've persuaded her that she doesn't need to get dressed to go to the doctor (it's 8 pm), helped her pick out 5 outfits for wherever she's convinced she needs to go, snuck the dog out to pee (she refuses to let the dog out), dodged tons of questions about dead family members (ps- don't say they're dead. Tell a white lie. Mine is ""your parents are safe in Florida, with your sister""), brought her in from outside twice, mashed meds in some ice cream because she refuses to take them... It never ends. Unless you feel a calling to care for someone, it's a daily grind and a chore. It became easier for me when I started looking at it as a job, not as caring for my family member. I see her more as my patient than family, and that helps me cope. 
Check out aplaceformom, your local Alzheimer's association, and other caregiver support resources. I'm not sure if it's national, but there's an awesome one near me called care2caregivers that has been a wealth of information for me. Call your local agency of aging, or even adult protective services for your county- they should be able to point you in the direction of finding a home, getting on a wait list, and figuring out how to pay. If Mom doesn't agree to make a change, then move out and let her figure it out for yourself. It won't take long for her to see reality. Stay with a friend or family member ( going from place to place for a few nights each, if possible). Talk to someone at your school to see if they have any temporary/emergency housing. 
((Big Hugs)) 
ps. If you ever feel like you're about to lose it, and are a danger to yourself or others- WALK AWAY. Go sit outside, go for a walk around the block, lock yourself in the bathroom, whatever you have to do to stay safe. And while you're figuring out the more long term arrangements, get on Craigslist, care.com, see if any aides at the day center want extra hours, ask through word of mouth... Find someone to supervise her, even if all they do is make sure she doesn't walk away! Your health (mental and physical) is important too!!
comment 2: Thank you so much for your post. It's not that I'm discompasionate it's just that my grandmother used to live with a caregiver this was about a year ago now and the caregiver got overwhelmed with taking care of her that she was more or less dumped onto us. I didn't sign up to be her caregiver, in fact I was strongly against this decision of my grandmother living with us. Ever since my mom got a new job all she really does is make sure my grandma gets on the bus to go to her adult daycare program and my grandma comes home around 2 to 3:30 pm. Since my mom doesn't come back around 6-7 I'm stuck taking care of her all alone just me for 4-5 hours Monday through Friday.
comment 3: It's definitely harder to be invested & kind & forgiving when it's not really something you signed on for. It's hard anyway, but once that resentment starts building, every little thing is hard & hurtful. 
I'm glad I didn't come off as offensive. I was trying to be honest, and sometimes I can be harsh. It wasn't intended to be critical or judgmental, I swear. I understand completely the situation you're in. 
Until you guys have a long term solution, my best advice is to breathe, and focus on this: ""so what?"" So what if she hides things? You can find them eventually. So what if she refuses your meal? Put it in the fridge and offer it again next time. Don't let her behaviors ruin your day & sanity. Don't sweat the small stuff, and pick your battles wisely. 
((Hugs)) message me if you ever need to vent, or pm me and I'll add you on Facebook. There's a great group on Facebook called dementia caregivers Support group. It's been a lifesaver for me.
comment 4: Thanks I'll be sure to check out that Facebook page and definitely pm if and when another episode erupts.
comment 5: Just to chime in, I don't think it's a lack of compassion on your part, especially since you haven't really even had the chance to live your life, yet, but are already being burdened with something that your mom, and/or any of her siblings, if she has any, should be taking point on. I'm guessing that you want to tell your grandma to 'think', and have that happen, which it's not. Do as another has suggested, and seek help/assistance from the state, as well as looking to 'A Place for Mom'. Your grandma's wandering is an accident waiting to happen, and there are probably other at-risk things going on, maybe involving electricity and things that catch fire, for which you can't reasonably be expected to catch all of them unless the only thing you're doing is focusing your attention on her when it's ""your shift"", which, again, isn't fair to you. An assisted care living facility sounds like the most viable option.
comment 6: Get the doctors / social careers involved it sounds like it's time your Grandma transitions to a residential home. I'm a little older than yourself and work in a dementia friendly care home and can appreciate the stress this must be causing .  The things you and your mother are experiencing are far beyond fair,  you guys aren't her carers and although no one asked for this its not your responsibility. It's sounds like for all of you involved you need to make a serious decision quite soon I'm afraid. Good luck.
comment 7: I read your previous post. Looks like things haven't changed at all. Your mom either can't afford or won't consider alternative living arrangements. If being her caregiver for 3-4 hours a day is having this kind of effect on you, you need to make it stop. You don't have to deal with this, it's your choice whether to stay or go. Stay with a friend or relative while you figure things out. Anything will be better than this.
Not everyone is made out to be a caregiver. Later stage dementia patients are very difficult to handle, they can do harm to themselves or even others if not handled the right way. You're not handling this the right way, you're either too stressed/burned out or not properly trained to handle it. Without the proper tools you're likely even escalating situations instead of winding them down.
My advice, move out and get help.
comment 8: I nearly went insane looking after my wife when she had dementia. She died 3 years ago. When she got past the point of home care being possible she went into care. It took me years to recover. They say that the mental health of the carer is one of the biggest risks - as you know.  there are ways to cope etc but you might have heard all that already? 
I am rushing out the door and will read your post more carefully and maybe comment more. What other care options are there for you? 
comment 9: Jesus. This is way too much for you to have to deal with. Your grandmother should be in a facility with people who are trained to deal with dementia. 
edit
I can totally relate to your frustration but please don't kill yourself. ((hugs))
comment 10: With absolute respect to your family, I don't think you should be put in this position at all.
Does your grandma receive Medi-Cal as a secondary to her Medicare?  Does she have assets?  There are many assisted living facilities that have space reserved for such individuals.  
comment 11: Have you checked to make sure you are using all the resources available to her?  Contact your local Alzheimers Association chapter to see how they can help you.  Caring for someone with this disease can be soul sucking.  Learning strategies can help you cope.  
comment 12: TRUST ME. I have tried all the strategies. I am 100000000% done.
comment 13: First of all, I am so sorry for the situation you have been given.  My dad has dementia and we recently found a place for him nearby but it is pretty expensive.  Is there any savings or anything that she personally has or is there any money available for a care facility?  If so, I've used www.caring.com andA Place for Mom to find facilities. You will need to look at ""memory care"" or alzheimer's facilities and ask for those that have locked doors or alarms that go off when doors are opened.  They should be able to help you find something even if there isn't much money available.  I think there may be state funded nursing homes (?) but I am not sure.  Overall, i think I liked caring.com better in terms of customer service.  They seemed more genuine and they didn't constantly call me and bug me.  There will be some of that of course...
Have you asked the day care facility if they know any place?  Being local, they might have a better idea of good places.
My dad is at a place that is a national chain, called Brookdale.  It is pretty good and cheaper than a few others that are supposed to be good but its still a lot of money.  I don't know how memory care works everywhere but make sure the price is all inclusive.  If its a place that charges by how much they have to do to help your grandmother then beware and be careful.  (For ADLs or Activities of Daily Living). It should be a place that can do everything she might need and not charge more or less.  I don't know how nursing homes differ from memory care.  I know that insurance generally won't cover much.
I was hoping to have my dad live with my family but just staying here for a week before he moved to the facility showed me that it was impossible.  I can't believe you have been saddled with her care while going to school.  
If it is too expensive to put her in a care facility, maybe you can look into hiring a caregiver for when she isn't at the day care facility?  I don't know what the major companies charge (like Home Instead) but you can ask at the day care to see if they know any reliable and honest smaller businesses that do care giver services.  When my mom had hip surgery and needed temporary help, she hired someone that was recommended by the other retirees in her community.  It was just a lady who is an RN and had some people who worked for her.  I couldn't tell how above board it was but they were honest workers.  Caring.com can probably help you with that too.
I wish you luck!  Please try to talk to someone in the meantime - councilor at school?  Breath.  And find something that takes the edge off like listen to music with a headphone in one ear while dealing with her. 
Oh!  Also, some senior centers give away food to seniors.  You might be able to collect some for her.  Some churches have senior programs too.  Our local Methodist church has meals during the week and I think they may also hand out food but not sure.  They also have an alzheimers support group but that involves you having time to go - so not sure that will help, but perhaps you could go once to ask if anyone knows of a facility??
comment 14: I was (and still am) in my 20s when I lived with and cared for my grandmother who had dementia. I can really relate to a lot of what you're talking about. Poor hygiene, name calling, and asking the same question over and over are all part of the process. You have to help her use the bathroom, brush her teeth, and bathe her because it sounds like she is beyond understanding how to do those things.
Being a caregiver for someone with dementia is very stressful. It sounds like you may be dealing with more than you can handle. I think the other commenters here gave excellent advice. I think it's time to look into having a caregiver come in at nights or look at a long-term care facility. 
Look up your county on this list to see if you can contact the local agency on aging in your area.
comment 15: So this sucks for you! Sounds like your stuck in a shit place I mean for fucks sake your the grandchild not even the actual child, and your parents don't seem to understand the predicament you are in. ( side note most parents if they hear their child say I might kill myself, will instantly jump in to help, don't know your parents though)
Anyway I'm no expert I have similar experiences though my grandmother went through this same thing and she was a very religious southern Pentecostal. I have been almost shoved out of a vehicle on the freeway, and had a knife to my throat all while I was a child due to this disease. It fucking sucks. I don't even remember my grandmother as the loving person she was anymore because of the last years. It was terrible, I feel for you more though because I was young I didn't deal with the hygiene or care my mom did. 
Two things I wanted to say, First I worked for the last year in a dementia facility and have grown a way better of an understanding of the disease. It's frustrating, but shit imagine what they are going through, fuck they are tortured every second with a disease they can't comprehend cause it's eating their fucking brain. I've sat with grown ass men and women who were fucking incredible in their life times, that can't do anything and cry on your shoulder because they can't fix themselves. It's terrible on their side, I'm not trying to downplay your side at all, I'm just saying a lot of their frustration that comes out isn't you personally, it's them and they feel it.
Secondly however, you are 21. You need to instantly stand up for yourself and focus on you. You are the most important thing in your life and fuck the perfect age to rock out whatever the fuck you wanted. Shit this life experience alone will help you so much in the future.
I hope this made sense sorry if it didn't I was drinking and on mobile, this just hit close to home
comment 16: I found it fucked up that my mom said to me ""only Jesus has the right to take your life away"" like bitch fucking try me. I'm not playing around anymore. The stress is too much for me. I am done being her caregiver.
comment 17: You're right but let that slide. I understand the feeling I'm an atheist in a southern penacistal world. Luckily I live state away. Don't bring religion into it, it will make it worse(even if you're right). Focus on the facts:
You can't do it emotionally or physical ally ( that's the hardest part, it isn't a weakness just too much to bear).(bare?)
2. It isn't your responsibility.
3. You're happy to help, you just need some also.
Relay these feelings if that doesn't help keep asking, shit message me if you want. Honestly though I am no expert. 
comment 18: If you want the nuclear option call http://www.cdss.ca.gov/agedblinddisabled/PG1298.htm
and tell them your mother is forcing you to care for your grandmother when you are not capable of doing so and your Gran is in danger as a result. Social services will come get your Granny, and possibly arrest you or your Mom, but it will be over.
comment 19: OK well my mom does a lot of shit but nonetheless I love her and I do not wish for her or myself to be arrested.
comment 20: You could also try telling your Mum if she does not get a proper placement for your Gran you WILL call that number, and then there will not be a choice.
comment 21: I remember your previous post. Did you look into state funded nursing homes. They can only charge the income the person has. Your local Alz. Asso. or your counties Council on Aging should be able to help you (I mean your mother) find a facility. Your Grandma needs to be in a facility. You should not be taking care of your grandma. I realize your mom is tired and stressed also, but if she cannot get dinner fix before 9 pm when she has a mother with Alz. waiting to be fed, she does not need to be taking care of your grandma either.
First, your mother should be trying to get your grandma into a facility with a little help from you. Not the other way around. Second, if your mother makes excuses not to put your grandma into a facility, puts it off, or tries to put this responsibility totally on you....well I'm probably overstepping when I say this but, if I were you, I would flat out tell your mother that you would not be available anymore in the afternoon's to take care of your grandma. Period. Come up with a good excuse like I will be studying at the Library or with friends or a study group or whatever you can come up with. I would stick to my guns no matter how guilty she tries to make you feel. I would make sure I was not at home during those hours anymore. This will force your mother to do something about your grandmother. Right now she does not have to because she has you. The only other thing I can think of would be for you to get a part time job and move into an apartment with other roommates. I know you are young, and putting your foot down and sticking to your guns, no matter what (like guilt and religious jargon), and making big moves can be scary, but if your mother does not change this situation, you need to find a way out. You are to young for this. You need to get your education. 
One other thing, go talk to a counselor at school. Pour your heart out. Let the counselor see how stressed you are and how destructive this situation is for you. Maybe they will be able to help you convenience your mother that this is a very bad situation for you to be in.
I'm surprised the day care has not said something about your grandma's behavior and hygiene. 
I'm starting to believe the real problem is your mother, not your grandma.

"Intro and my non life Hello all, new to this sub. My life is so out of control right now. I am an alcoholic, in recovery (feeling great about that), and mental health issues. I also take care of my mother. She has Leweys Body Syndrome (sort of dementia symptoms with mobility issues). The constant threats and demeaning comments used to roll of my back, but I have my down periods and this just makes it that much worse. Add to that, there is no pay (live for free with mother and sisters in the garage, but contribute with food), and trying to find 2nd or 3rd shift work that ties in with buses has been negative so far. So no money, constant demeaning, trying to stay on track with my own health. I went to the store for food yesterday, maybe gone 25 minutes. She got up and fell, after she was told to sit and wait. She had everything right there, but she got up anyway. And no social life. You have no job? Live with your mother? Great dating resume! I moved here to help take care of my mother, but except for dressing and bathroom issues, it's me. Sorry for the rant, in what was really to be an intro. Hope everyone has a good day!","comment 1: There are bound to be social agencies where you live that can offer help. Where I live there's the League of Older Americans. They run the Meals on Wheels program and have groups where caregivers can meet to talk about our family member. They also offer a daycare program for people with dementia/Alzheimers. 
Our group for caregivers meets once a month. It is led by a psychologist who knows programs and doctors who can help. Plus you meet people who are going through the same thing and don't feel like you're all alone. I haven't managed to get my sister (who has dementia) to go to the daycare center but I'm working on it. I also see a counselor twice a month for depression. The counselor had so much information about aspects of dementia and how to deal with my sister that I don't know what I would have done without her. 
You don't have to face this alone. There is a large community out there who can help you. Just start looking!
Take care of yourself.
comment 2: Thanks, I'll look into these. I see a doctor here 3/15 and should have enough meds to carry me through (recently moved from Tucson, AZ and had to wait for med coverage here). I'm sure there are groups like you mention here in FL, given many seniors here. 
comment 3: We completely understand that here :/ You're in the right place. 
comment 4: Thanks, I appreciate it. My sisters took her out for the day/evening. I was welcome to go, but needed time to myself. Move something things around, dishes, and organize my small corner.

"Project lifesaver guy came by today and strapped the watch thing to my step father. I have the frequency, is there any way I can track him myself? Apps? Computer programs? Buy a thing? ","comment 1: First of what is the frequency and how does he gets tracked?
"
"MIL wandered off today &amp; indicates she will do it again. Are GPS devices effective? Today my MIL wandered off early this morning while her husband was in the shower. It took all day to find her. She was in just short sleeves despite weather in the teens and miles from her house when police finally found her after receiving reports of a confused woman in a bank. My FIL has, in the past, used her cellphone to keep track of her, but this morning she left her purse in the house. 
She has a lot of aggression towards her husband lately. She insists he is trying to harm her, is very suspicious of him and everything he does. She recently hid her drivers license from him leaving him unable to get new healthcare, because she believes he is tying to poison her. This morning she left because he wouldn't take her out somewhere at 5 am. Because it was dark outside still she thought it was night time and wanted to go out. We are sure she will attempt to leave again, and will not willingly wear anything her husband gives her. 
Will a GPS device really work in helping to locate her if she wanders off again, and do they make one for dementia patients that has a lock or some other deterrent for taking it off? I am looking into an alert bracelet as well with her name and number but I'm not sure she will keep even that on. ","comment 1: The very real possibility that she might become paranoid enough to harm your father should be brought up with her doctor, as well as the wandering. With both those, she could be committed involuntarily (or ""sectioned"", depending on your country). The aggression can become very bad quickly.My aunt ended up in jail.
comment 2: Thank you for saying that. I genuinely worry about him, but I'm not sure what they will do. My husband's siblings are very against any idea of her in a facility, even temporarily. We are getting together this weekend to discuss options and indoor after this they will realize it is not just about her husband's safety, but hers as well. 
comment 3: > My husband's siblings are very against any idea of her in a facility, even temporarily.
Sadly when most people think of putting a parent in other living arrangements, they think of nursing homes.
I have a close elderly family member who is in a care facility at the moment that only houses dementia patients. She has her own room and is able to use her own furniture (couch, tv, bed, pictures, etc) so it is more like an apartment. It is almost like a small community.
comment 4: If you haven't already, you might want to talk to her doctor about options for managing paranoia, aggression, etc., with psychiatric medication.
Anti-depressants and/or anti-psychotics can make a world of difference in her happiness, contentment, peace of mind.
Good luck...
comment 5: Thank you for that suggestion. They lost their medical insurance and are in the process of getting it back. I will bring this up ASAP. 
comment 6: Do you know for sure what type of dementia she has?  I have been reading about Lewy Body Dementia and it sounds like the drugs really do have an effect on the quality of life of someone with dementia and can help lessen some of this behavior if they are correctly diagnosed and given the corrects medication.  At least one of you should read about the medications and get to know it and any changes in her behavior to make sure its going ok.  Doctors rely on accurate representations of the patient's behavior.  My father was never put on a memory medication for 5 years and is only now getting it.  They also changed his meds to reflect Lewy Body dementia rather than Parkinson's and its really made a huge difference.
My other advice though if improved medication does not cut it is to get her to a place where she will be safe.   
comment 7: I don't unfortunately. Until now my in laws approach to this has mostly been to ignore it or make excuses. This is the first time she's been in a situation where they can no longer shrug it off. She was diagnosed two years ago, but is not on medication currently because at the time she refused it and no one has brought it back up since. Now they realize this was a mistake, but what's done is done and we need to start the process over again. 
Her children are very against having her anywhere besides home, but this is something I am going to discuss personally with her husband as I think he has a more realistic view of what the future holds. I will certainly urge him to go back over the house and make sure any thing that can pose a threat is hidden away in the meantime. 
I appreciate the advice. When they go to see the doctor I will ask my husband to speak with the doctor about the specific type of dementia she has. I do know they were told it could be hereditary. Her mother and sister both had dementia before they passed away. I mostly remember the doctor saying this because my sister in law was devastated and looking into possible screening for herself.  
comment 8: Best of luck to you and your family!  
comment 9: Thank you!
comment 10: I did a quick search and found this kids watch. One feature I liked was the ""Electric fence"" ""After adding an electric fence name, you can set a fence with the watch as the centre and with a radius of 100 to 5000. The APP Client will receive an alarm when the watch enters or exits the fence."" Maybe he could slip this in her purse instead.
This is a whole page filled with tracking devices. One of them goes in their shoe.
As a simple not tech solution, put her information in all of her clothing. Like a kid going off to camp. That way if the high tech solution fails the cops can look inside her coat, shirt, or pants and find out who she is and who to call.
comment 11: Thank you for the resources and suggestions. I am going to talk to my father in law about adding her name to clothes. The insole GPS is actually one I'm considering. I don't see many reviews on it.m, but it will probably be her best bet. If she can remove it I'm almost positive she will. 
comment 12: Project Lifesaver is a program run through many local police departments across the country. The sheriff or a deputy will fit her with a bracelet or anklet that is difficult to remove. It has a GPS in it, and if she wanders the police will be able to locate her. 
I use Pocket Finder. It's a bit chunky, about the size of the palm of your hand. Does your loved one habitually carry a certain item, like keys, or a purse? My loved one wanders too, but always brings her purse. If so, you might be able to find a way to hide or secure it to that item. Like this incident you described, it's not a foolproof strategy because they might not bring it- but it's an idea. I charge it twice weekly, and re-sew it into the lining of her purse each time. There are different power settings- to save battery, you can put it in airplane mode and just activate to tracking mode when you need to locate her. It is VERY accurate., quick and user friendly. I have used it three times to find my loved one. I think it was like $130 to buy the device, and $13/mo for a service plan. Worth it. We will keep it until my loved one is immobile/bed bound.
At this stage in the disease, please be aware that all sharp items should be locked up safely. Scissors, knives, garage and garden tools- someone with dementia who isn't thinking clearly could injure themselves or someone else. If she has the Project Lifesaver anklet, you'll need to make sure she can't remove it.
comment 13: Thank you, I did find some information in Project Lifesaver and will call them in the morning. 
I'm pretty sure my FIL has secured anything dangerous because she has threatened him in the past, but when I speak to him tomorrow I will ask him to go back over the house. It's a great suggestion at this point. After the wandering episode the other day she is even more out of sorts than normal. 
comment 14: A lock box (like the fire proof kind you can use for documents) might work, so your FIL can still access those things when needed (knives, scissors, meds etc).
I'm sorry to hear all this. My loved one has gotten agitated and physical with me twice. I made myself a ""three strikes"" deal- if she lays a hand on me ever again, I'm done and out. I think sometimes it's hard to admit when we, as caregivers, are in over our head. I actually stepped way back and now only see my LO 1-2x/week, and it's been a huge relief to my mental and physical health. Maybe your FIL needs to make a similar deal, draw some sort of line- he does not have to live with physical abuse, whether the abuser is of sound mind or not. She can't necessarily help or control how she's behaving, but he doesn't have to suffer as well. There have been many, many instances in which the person with dementia and/or the caregiver have both suffered serious physical harm, as a result of agitation/violence, stress, and an unsafe environment. I think sometimes the best, kindest thing to do is admit when it's too much. For what it's worth, the top reasons for someone to be placed in memory care are: agitation & violence, wandering and incontinence. 
If her behavior has changed or gotten much worse quickly, it is absolutely worth getting her checked for a UTI. UTIs are common with dementia because they tend to not wipe properly, and the infection can wreak all sorts of havoc. It's a very well known connection to behavioral disturbances and violence in dementia. It can really add a lot of confusion and paranoia, and sudden behavioral changes. It might also just be how the disease will progress for her. 
I know you said they don't have health insurance right now, but it's past the time for medication. He can call 911 or bring her to the emergency room if it gets bad, and they will have to treat her. If he refuses to bring her home, then they have no option other than to keep her, or they can send her to a geriatric psychiatric unit which will stabilize her with medication. If they are having financial difficulty, she might be eligible for Medicaid, which is actually a good thing with dementia. Medicaid covers the cost of long term care in a nursing home/memory care facility. 
There's no easy answers. ((Hugs)) I belong to a wonderful support group on Facebook that you guys should check out, especially your FIL if he uses a computer. It's called Dementia Caregivers support group. It's an amazing source of info and support.
comment 15: I am definitely going to check into that Facebook group. My FIL doesn't use Facebook, but my husband will join in to share resources with him. And thank you for the great suggestions. My MIL has a very hard time with the bathroom, so I will ask my FIL to bring this up next time they see the doctor and to learn what the warning signs of a UTI are. I am going to talk with my husband about picking up a lock box tomorrow for him, so that he can start keeping things that might pose a danger to her safely away. 
You brought up a lot of things we hadn't thought of. I appreciate the thought out reply. We are having a family meeting tomorrow to figure out the next steps, so you've given me lots to talk over with everyone. 
comment 16: From my research and what I've seen posted, they make them but they are pretty expensive. One of the best solutions I've seen is buying a cheap phone with GPS and getting a cheap plan and installing a parental app that can track the phone. I don't know what the app is called but from what I understand parents use them to track their kids with the GPS in the phone. This only works if they keep the phone on them, I've heard of sowing the phone into there pocket but keeping it charged would be though and they would have to wear the same pants. 
comment 17: This is actually what my FIL currently does. He keeps it in her purse because she doesn't like to even leave the room without the purse. Unfortunately she left it behind this morning when she left. The wearable devices are very expensive though, so I guess I'm just wondering if it's actually worth the cost. 
In the meantime I will talk to him about trying to figure out a way to keep the phone on her instead of her purse. 
comment 18: I don't have any experience with them so I don't know if they are worth it or not, but I think if they have the right health insurance then it might cover some of the cost. 
comment 19: Can you guys camouflage the doors?  Add an alarm to the door so he'll know if she leaves?
comment 20: We are definitely adding an alarm to the door. 
comment 21: I think Seroquel, Trazodone and Ativan would be much more effective at helping keep track of your MIL than a GPS. The logic runs to me that if she needs a GPS, what she really needs a boatload of meds and/or to live in a lockdown memory care unit. 
comment 22: I agree that it is time for medication, and we are pushing for an emergency appointment with her doctor to re-evaluate. The GPS is for the more immediate moment and for peace of mind from now on. Even on medication, dementia patients sometimes wander off just from confusion. Now that it's happened once we want to make sure we are doing everything possible to avoid her wandering off on her own for any reason.

"Caregivers... Do medical alert bracelets and devices work? Caregivers, do you find that electronic alert devices (bracelets, keychains, cards) are effective? 
There are several companies that offer medical alert technology. 
The basic rundown seems to be that if something happens, a helpful stranger or emergency medical teams can scan the device with their smart phones and obtain information. 
The information is loaded into the device by the patient or caregiver so it can be tailored to their ailments. This means that there is a higher likelihood of early correct treatment and less chance of dangerously mixing medicines or treating for the wrong issue.
It sounds nice but is it effective? Do people know to look for the bracelets or what to do when they find them? The technology relies on databases and some companies charge a monthly fee ($5 seems average). Is this too much? Do people want to wear the bracelets? To me it seems like there is no use in the thing if you can't convince someone to keep it on?
Just wondering if anyone has experience with these things and would they recommend them?","comment 1: My mom has allergy to penicillin and the ER did notice her bracelet . I was with her, of course, to let them know. 
comment 2: EMTs are trained to look for them. Strangers, well, they have no duty or training to. 
$5 seems pretty cheap to me, but it sounds like your real issue is getting the person to wear it.
(my mother threatened to replace me with a bracelet; I asked her if the bracelet was going to fetch her paper in the morning, or make her dinner :D)
comment 3: So they do work because EMTs are trained to look for them, but strangers won't necessarily notice them. Hmmm... I guess that's not ideal but it's better than nothing. 
... I wonder if there's a way to make them more noticeable...? Also, free. Ha!

Tracking Devices for Patients? I'm trying to find a GPS tracking device for my father. The highlight of his day is taking our two dogs for a walk around the neighborhood. The disease is starting to progress more rapidly and I'm increasingly concerned about him getting lost on his walks. Does anyone have any suggestion for a GPS tracker that I could have him wear or attach to his keys? I'd like to be able to track his movements on my smartphone so I can go direct him home if he loses his way.,"comment 1: Not a response to your main question, but you might also consider putting GPS on the dogs.  (And if your dad is resistant to  wearing a GPS tracker himself, he might be more open to this.)  TAGG Pet Tracker is the one I'd been considering for my own dog - a small collar-mounted device.
comment 2: I haven't had to look into one of these yet, but one time my mother in law got lost driving, and we just used Find My iPhone to see where she was. Thankfully she doesn't drive anymore, but it was a good last-minute scrambling kind of lifesaver. If your dad has a cell phone that he will reliably take with him, I would certainly use that or a similar service.
comment 3: There's an app called Life360 that we use. Its helped us many times.
"
"Simple Student Market Research Survey Hi, I am an industrial design student who is creating a medial device/gps to remotely monitor loved ones with dementia. This device would be targeted at the next generation of dementia patients who will have grown up surrounded by technology. It can also be used by current generation because it requires no interaction from the user. I have set up a very simple survey to help me collect market research to create a more focused concept. Thank you.","comment 1: I actually use the family tracking app for android, Life360 to track my father using the GPS in his phone.  It's a fairly good free alternative to buying a seperate device if your loved one still uses or carries a phone.  Otherwise this device you are creating is a great idea.
comment 2: Thanks, I was actually thinking about going deeper into the concept to include a small wearable device that can keep track of a persons overall health (still cant believe they actually have chips that can monitor brain and nervous patters to remote sense emotions accurately).
This is a good point about the app that can do gps for phones (didn't know trackers where free). Knowing this I should spend a bit more time on the drawing board.

"New here. Dad wanders a lot. He wandered too far today. What can I do? The police found him 2 miles from home. It seems wandering de-stresses him. He collects rocks, screws, bolts, coins. He always stays real close to home though, and always comes back in. He still knows mom. ...and that's about it. He reconizes me, but has no idea who I am. This is the turning point in which something needs to change. Locking him in the house seems cruel, he'd go nuts. Are there trackers I can buy? GPS things, maybe a warning/alarm when he leaves the perimeter? What are my options? How can I keep him safe? Please, we'll take any advice there is to offer. We've acknowledged that he's worse now... what do we do?","comment 1: I looked into this a bit when I was worried. They have GPS services. Some even have phone interfaces so you can check in. Some let you set alarms if they leave a zone by calling you/texting you. Most charge a monthly fee to provide the constant GPS service. 
At the very least get him a locking ID bracelet indicating he is memory impaired that triggers a call to you. 
Look into getting an adult babysitter. They also have day programs for adults that can be amazing opportunities for new experiences, socializing, and giving caretakers a break without worry. 
I recommend the ALZ official website. That's where i found most of my info from when I looked into it. 
comment 2: Love that idea. If the wandering is not to an unsafe area, and not in a car (like it was for my FIL) then it's best to know where he is and be able to monitor. 
Be careful when winter comes, to make sure he doesn't wander out in dangerous weather.
comment 3: If you've got a relative wandering in a dangerous area or with access to car keys or other transit when you know they are not safe to do so, you need to do something about it to protect them. Your loved one should not be left unattended at home with a chance to wander. There are ways of doing this that improve their life, because they actually get to go do stuff all day instead of sitting inside rotting amid confusion. 
Consider getting a cheap monitor on the door that beeps loudly when opened if you're at home with them but don't want to have to hover. 
comment 4: I can confirm this sentiment was strongly reflected in Dr. Carson's presentation on Alzheimer's. After 24 hours missing your loved one poses a significant risk to their personal health (and those around them for that matter).
comment 5: Msgreyson had some great suggestions. Definitely a Medicalert bracelet, as well. Our local sheriff's office also has a program you can sign up for so you can give them your family member's name, photo, info, etc and they can keep an she put on them. One time my mother in law got lost driving, and we found her using Find My iPhone.
ETA: that driving incident was the first time she ever got lost, and we took away her keys. Driving is extremely dangerous.
comment 6: I second a social day program, maybe a caretaker - can you find a caretaker who likes the outdoors and will take him for walks?
If you don't want dad to wander unaccompanied - I've been told that a black doormat will discourage Alz patients from exiting.  There are also wallpapers that will ""camouflage"" a door as something else other than a door (like a large bookcase) so they won't get the idea to up and go.
comment 7: I'm late to the conversation, but hopefully you see this OP! We have PocketFinder. It has an app, or you can view it on the website. You can set ""zones"" and it will send you an alert if they go outside that safe zone. You can then locate them- it's very accurate. It's a bit bulky, but if you can convince him to wear it- maybe on a key chain? I have to hide it in my LOs purse. It only uses battery when it's in motion, so depending on how much he is in motion, you might have to charge it every night. I get by 2-3x per week. 
Also highly recommend having a flyer saved in your computer with his info and condition- a recent picture, name, places he might head towards, all of your contact info- just in case. They can be handed to emergency services or police, people walking on the street, etc.
comment 8: I agree with the person who recommended a caretaker or a day program. 
This is definitely a complicated scenario. It doesn't seem as though there are many ""trackers"" for alzheimer's patients, but my recommendation would be an Apple watch. To the person with Alzheimer's, it seems like just a watch, but it can absolutely be tracked and you can even monitor the vitals (heart rate, etc.) individual using it. I'm sure that there are also less expensive Android versions that allow you some kind of GPS monitoring. I think it would be worth the investment for the piece of mind that your loved one is okay.
"
"When to make the transition? Hi everyone. I just stumbled upon this sub - wow, do I ever need a support group. Hope y'all don't mind if I start right in with a question of my own.
Our situation is this - mom has had cancer (multiple myeloma) for about 9 years now. In remission now, actually, but with a whole host of complications from the chemo. Her body and immune system are destroyed. I spent most of this time caring for her while she lived alone, but moved her in with me about a year and a half ago because I noticed she was not taking care of herself at all anymore, not eating meals if I didn't bring them, losing lots of weight, her house was a wreck and I couldn't find the time to take care of her house and my own. It was a hard decision to make (especially because I had a 3 month old baby at the time) but I didn't know what else to do. She does not have a husband or other children.
Since she's moved in with us, she has had pneumonia 7 times and has been hospitalized 8 times, all for at least 2 week stays. When she comes back home, she needs full time care. We are currently about 3 weeks out from her last hospital stay (which was almost 2 months long and involved three surgeries to resect her bowel). This time her care is extremely high maintenance. She has a huge incision site that has to be packed with gauze etc, tons of medicines to keep track of, can barely do anything for herself. I am working from home about 45 hours a week and taking care of her at the same time, and taking care of my now almost 2 year old as well.
I am really reaching the end of my rope. I just don't know who to talk to about this or what to do to make it feel more manageable and less overwhelming. I am stretched so thin. My job is very demanding and I am constantly running back and forth between her and it all day long. As soon as work ends, my child is home and I want to spend quality time with her, but often find myself having to do more things to help my mom. Mom is an extremely high maintenance person on top of having lots of physical assistance needs. My daughter does not understand and has been acting out as a result, making it even more difficult to care for everyone and keep everyone happy. My poor husband has just been lost to the shadows at this point, I have no time for myself or him. By the time I'm finished tending to everyone's needs, it's past 8pm and I just crash into bed, only to start the next grueling day all over again.
I am so stressed out, and I am starting to feel incredibly trapped, angry, resentful. I just want it to end. At this point, death would almost be a relief for me after a decade of caregiving. I want my life back. I want to spend it with my family. And then, of course, I feel incredibly guilty for having those negative feelings, but I just don't know how much longer I can hold on.
So partially, I just really needed to vent, and I thank you for listening. But I do have a question now that I have laid this all out. I have been thinking a lot about a transition to a nursing home. It feels a lot like ""the end"" to me - like a death sentence or something - if I make her do this. She will be extremely upset. She hates those institutionalized environments and does not do well in them. I don't even know how to bring up the conversation with her. It will be a huge fight and she will likely never forgive me for it. But at the same time, don't I have a responsibility to my growing family? I feel like they are just getting lost in the shuffle and I do not want to miss the early years of my daughter's life. I just don't know what to do, who to prioritize. This is the hardest decision I have ever tried to make.
Has anyone been in a similar situation with your parents? What did you do?
Thanks for listening.","comment 1: Howdy, and welcome (although sorry you're here!).
I can't speak towards being in a similar situation with my parents; however, I'm going through the nursing home thing with my wife. She's 39 and has pretty aggressive MS. She's been pretty much bedridden for about five years now. 
Obviously, this is not where we planned on being. We've been struggling and making adjustments to our lives to accommodate her progression, but it's gotten too difficult: although I only work about 1.5 miles away from home, she still can't be left alone for any amount of time. So we have aides with her during the day - but they're through an agency, making barely above minimum wage, and not exactly medical professionals. Their level of care varies from really good to pretty terrible - they've repeatedly screwed up the (numerous) medicines my wife has to take, she's had some falls in the hoyer lift (which I can't criticize them too much for, as I've also dropped her from it).
But with the advancement of the disease, I just don't feel it's safe for her at home any longer. Last month I made the decision to bring up the nursing home topic. Obviously, she is/was completely devastated. She's not even 40, but facing life in the nursing home. I did my research and found an amazing home - it's about 30 minutes away (the only real downside other than being a nursing home), but it's a beautiful place with top-notch care. We talked about it (a lot), and then went for a tour. The place is great, and our hope is that after a couple years there: A) they will engage her in physical/occupational therapy that will improve her condition, and B) in that time I will be able to make home improvements so we can sell this shithole of a house we bought - a fixer-upper we bought right before the market crashed, thinking we'd have time to get it in great shape together, only to lose our shirts and sanity to this goddamned money pit... Erm... where was I? Oh - fix up this house and maybe buy a condo that could be set up for caregiving.
I hate this disease, I hate this house, and I pretty much hate life right now.
But to your original point (sorry, lost myself in a self-pitying tirade there!): I absolutely understand about it feeling like ""the end,"" and the resentment you're going to experience. 
Realistically, a nursing home is going to provide the level of care and attention you cannot (well, if you find a good one, obviously). While a child absolutely has a duty to a parent, the greater responsibility is the parents' towards the child: it's hard-coded into nature that a parent sacrifices for their child. Some(often)times that is absolutely horrible, but it's what it is. If your mother were able to look at the situation objectively, she would agree. Put yourself in her position: if your daughter were taking care of you, wouldn't you want to make it easier on her and do what you can to allow her to take care of HER child? Your mother is doubtless frustrated, scared and depressed (and rightfully so, of course). This is going to cloud her judgement and make the situation more difficult, but you have to put aside your guilt and base your decision on what is going to be best for YOUR child (and, really, your mother): you cannot continue in this situation. Not only will your mother's care suffer, but you will both begin to resent the other, your daughter will resent YOU/your lack of attention, and I'm sure this is hard on your husband as well.
I'm so, so sorry that you are in this situation. But I think you know this is for the best - there's just a ton of guilt and feeling like your failing your mother that you have to deal with. Not only would I suggest going forward with nursing care for your mother, but look into counseling for yourself - this is going to be hard to deal with, and having someone ""outside"" the situation to talk with would also be a big help.
Soooooo... I hope this helps? Stay strong, and we're here for you any time (even if we're not always the quickest to respond!)!
comment 2: Um....wow....just, thank you so much for your response. And I'm so sorry to hear about your wife. At least my mom is almost 70 and has lived a long and wonderful life. As age declines, we expect these things to happen. You do NOT expect these things when you are in your 30s. I cannot imagine how devastated you both are. Truly my heart goes out to you.
I think you are completely right that this all really just comes down to guilt for me. It's been a hard thing to come to terms with - that I just can't provide for her anymore in a way that is healthy for everyone.
We actually had an initial conversation about it this morning, just to get the ball rolling and the idea in her head. It was hard for me to bring up but she was receptive and understanding. Now we just have the long journey ahead of us to figure out timing, find the right place, etc etc.
Thank you so much again for your thoughtful response. It really does help to have someone to talk to about everything.
comment 3: kwip, words fail me . . . I simply cannot tell you how sorry I am for you and your wife.  My brother-in-law had MS and died in a nursing home at age 52, so I have an awareness of at least some of the challenges you're facing.  My husband and I both loved his brother very much, and as I'm reading your story it feels like my heart is literally breaking for you and your wife.
I honestly don't know what, if anything, to offer you in the way of advice based on his experiences.  It occurs to me that some things you may not want to hear and other things may not even be good for you to hear!  If you have a question you'd like to ask, however, please feel free to do so and I will attempt to answer it as honestly as possible.  
Our thoughts andprayers are with you and your wife!
comment 4: I came here because I was feeling sorry for myself, having given up my career to care for my 88-year-old mother (who has Parkinson's disease and a genetic vision impairment) for 6 years largely alone, without respite or a support group.  
And then I read your story and kwip's and . . . wow . . . you two ARE AMAZING!!!
So many of the things you said resonated with me, SiaMaya, especially the husband lost to the shadows and the feeling of just wanting it to end and then feeling guilty.  I think these are feelings that anyone would inevitably have under the circumstances you've described, so please just accept them as natural and don't be hard on yourself for them!  
Because my mother is older than yours, my sister (who lives out-of-state and deigns to speak to our mother on the phone for 5 minutes once a week) has for the past four years aggressively tried to place her in a nursing home.  About four years ago, mother agreed to stay in a nursing home temporarily while she was getting some physical therapy and she called me every day of that 6-week period, begging me to get her out of there.  
Now, as my mother's condition continues to decline and her needs increase, the question has come up with more frequency, both in my mind and expressed by my husband, and the memory of those calls is one of the barriers.  We have a fine nursing home in our town, but I know that I could never have my mother begging me to get her out of there and ignore her pleas; it would be torturous for me.  As a result, I applaud the fact that you're talking openly with your mother about it and referring to ""we"" when it comes to the journey ahead of you.  I really think that, if it's at all possible, getting her on board and facing the decision as a family is key.  And since you have small children, I think discussing this with your mother in the broader context of ""family"" may be helpful to you; they are also her grandchildren and it seems likely that she would want the best for them and be willing to make reasonable sacrifces to ensure their wellbeing.  
I sometimes worry that the natural feelings of frustration, etc., that you outlined may color the decision of when to transition my mother.  I value myself as a person, love my husband and other family members as well as my mother, and realize that there are no guarantees with respect to my own lifespan or theirs.  In order to find the appropriate balance between mother's needs and the needs of the others that I love, I try to objectively ask myself whether, as her situation currently stands and given the limitations of what I can provide to her in the way of care, my mother is ""better off"" in her current situation or in a nursing home.  Our family's value system is such that we don't necessarily value quantity of life over its quality so her happiness -- as well as mine and my husband's -- are factors that weigh heavily into the determination of where she would be ""better off.""  By measuring it this way I think that when the answer is that she would be ""better off"" in a nursing home, we will be confident that we are making the right choice.
As you proceed on your journey to find an acceptable ""home"" for your mother, you may want to check out the automated Philips Medication Dispenser at http://www.managemypills.com to help keep track of the tons of medication you mentioned.  This has been a real Godsend for us -- and I have no relationship whatsoever to the company! -- and found it super easy to install so, even if you only use it for a couple of months, it may help you find a little extra time in your already incredibly busy day.  You can load 10 days' worth of medication into it and it will automatically dispense medication up to 6 times through the day on a schedule that you set up.  My mother, for example, takes 1 pill at 7:00 am, 2 pills at 8:00 am, yet another pill at 9:00 am, pills at 1:00 pm, at 5:00 pm and at 9:00 pm because that's the time schedule that works for her medication.  The machine could at least in theory be set up at your mother's bedside and all she would have to do is push a rather large button -- the machine calls out nicely whenever ""It's time to take your medicine"" -- for the cup with the appropriate medication to come out at the appropriate time.  The cost is about $90 a month and it's well worth it to us because it means that I only have to think about medication once every 10 days when I load the machine!
I'm so sorry you're faced with this challenging situation, but I know you're moving forward thoughtfully and carefully and that your decisions will therefore be wise.  
comment 5: Thank you so much for your kind and thoughtful reply. I am so grateful to have other people to talk to about this and hope that we can be a sounding board for you as well anytime you need it. It is so hard to walk this path alone.
It must be so difficult for you to face this decision knowing your mom is not on board with it at all. I can not even imagine how much that must add to the guilt and burden you must be feeling. This is not an easy decision to make. It is easy to feel that we are letting them down somehow, after they spent so much time and energy bringing us into this world and caring for us for so long.
For my family, there is no other option than to talk about it openly. My mom raised me alone and it was just us for my entire childhood. I feel a strong sense of loyalty to her and I truly want what is best for her. However, I am beginning to realize that my biggest priority in life right now has to be my own child. I owe her exactly what my mother gave me, and we have talked about this and mom understands and agrees with that. I'm afraid I'm not able to be the best mother to my daughter right now with all of the stresses and demands that come with caregiving. It's been one of the big reasons we've begun this discussion. It's difficult to be thinking about this so early - she is ""only"" 69. Cancer sucks. The treatment worked in putting the cancer in remission, but it totally destroyed her body and immune system in the process. It's sad. I wish we had more years of her being healthy. She seems like a pale shadow of the person she used to be. I am already grieving her in many ways.
I am also exhausted, burnt out, stressed out, overwhelmed, frustrated, depressed, anxious. I definitely need some therapy and help on my own, but I also think that working full time and trying to be a full time caregiver as well as a mom to a toddler is just stretching me way too thin. I just simply and honestly explained everything to my mom and that I feel I am at the limit of what I can handle at this point. I think being open and honest about all that really helped her be able to move forward with thinking about changing our situation. You are right - discussing it in the context of how it is affecting the entire family has really helped her gain some perspective on the situation outside of her own experience.
We actually visited her doctor today, and he told her in no uncertain terms that she needs to be move. We have some concerns about the air quality in our house (it's older) and she is having a lot of trouble breathing. There's also a concern that she is sick so often because she lives with a germ factory (toddler in daycare). So that has really helped us get the ball rolling as well....if we have to move, then it makes sense to go ahead and make the move to assisted living so that everyone can get what they need.
I think you are coming at your own decision in a logical, rational, and compassionate manner. It's not an easy thing to do. I hope that, when the time comes, you are able to find a place for your mom that she also finds acceptable and can be happy living out her remaining years.
Thanks so much for the recommendation on that dispenser - it sounds wonderful! We definitely struggle with helping her to remember everything so an alarm and automated dispenser would be a lifesaver. That's a steep price tag for my budget, but I will definitely look into it.
Anyway, I just really appreciate your response, and for you listening to my rambling :) It's amazing how much it helps to just be able to talk things out with other people that have some idea of what you are going through. My husband is sweet and kind and supportive, but he doesn't totally ""get"" what I am going through on both a physical and emotional level. It's good to know we aren't alone. I'm extremely thankful for reddit, as funny as it sounds. You guys have been so kind.

"How do to know if a loved one is taking their medications? Hi guys,
I'm wondering how you keep track of medication compliance of a loved one when you're busy with your day?
All the best","comment 1: The only way is to watch them take it. But try getting a pill organizer with different containers for each dose(am pills, bedtime pills) instead of the bottles they come in. That way if the dose is not in the container it has been taken. Unless it's in their pocket or the couch or the toilet...
comment 2: I have found that when presented with a week's worth of pills all at once, they can overdose, i.e. take more than one day several time in the same day. I found a container that looks like the weekly pill container but each day's pills are in pods that pop out. That way I can only take out a specific day and set it out without having to worry about my wife taking more than one day. Hope that makes sense. I found these containers in a grocery store but not all carry them so you may want to be on the lookout for them. 
comment 3: Uhm, I didn't come here for advice. My pill situation is totally handled. 
comment 4: This is really hard to do without being there. I used this pill dispenser:
GMS Med-e-lert - 28 Day Automatic Pill Dispenser, 6 Alarms, 6 Rings, 1 Key with Clear Lid https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002TSHGIU/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_XBs3vbXN6DMMF
It rotates to the next tray and beeps and flashes. It stops beeping when you turn it over to dump pills out. I combined it with a distinctive bowl to dump the pills in. This is not foolproof but we were able to, through rote, learn to take pills with some regularity. If they never dump the pills you can see they have been missed. You can check the bowl to see if they were swallowed. It's always possible that they have been tossed out etc. 
comment 5: Our pharmacy packages still the medications in daily am and pm doses.  They are labeled with the date and time the meds are to be taken.  It is simple enough that my mom is able to follow along when thou she is preferred advanced and lost in most other daily affairs.  It was not something she wanted to try at first, but I insisted she must.  It's the best thing I have done because the whole pill thing was making me crazy!  Once a month I talk to the pharmacy, we make any changes needed, and they fill everything for the month.  The only problem comes in if there are changes, then it gets tricky.  So far we have only had to add meds so it was manageable.  If her dr wants to drop some it will have to wait until the end of the month.
Good luck!

"Looking for an inexpensive clock My mom is losing track of the days and time periods. What I was after was an auto-updating calendar (without too-short abbreviations), and a clock, preferably analogue, which differentiates between AM and PM. There's this one, http://shop.alzheimers.org.uk/product/large-automatic-day-night-flip-calendar-clock-vat-exempt/ which fit the bill, but they seem really expensive, considering a tablet PC could be bought for the price. Is there any other cheaper solutions?","comment 1: What about a tablet with a screensaver that does this? (Not sure if one exists, but given the variety of clocks, it might.)
My father also loses track of night/day, as well as seasons (though honestly it's only in the winter and it's seems to be him hoping spring is near...). He never knows what day of the week it is, but that isn't something that he or we care about particularly. He's not left alone for substantial periods without at least phone call check-ins, so I don't have much to suggest. 
Is there a broader goal this solves? (Does she get agitated when she doesn't know? Can she maintain more independence if she knows? Does it impact her dependence on you/others?) Just trying to think of other solutions, because that's a lot of money for a clock!
comment 2: My concern is to reduce anxiety, as she constantly worries over appointments, even though I take care of them all.  And also to possibly help with night wandering, it may help to back up my assertion that it's the middle of the night.
comment 3: We tried several different methods but found shelling out the money for a DayClox was worth it. Sometimes she unplugs it, but the clock goes right back to the day / time. Plus it's easy to read and it lets them see the date and the day.

"PSA: Learn from my mistake. Always leave yourself at least two ways to get back into the house. I had a bit of excitement yesterday evening.  My dad is in the late/moderate stage of ALZ.  I've done a lot of adapting to his behavior and done the necessary ""dad-proofing"" to keep him and the house safe.  I put a door guardian on the front door (this thing is awesome - highly recommend it!).  I've got wooden dowels in the tracks of both sliding patio doors.
So I got home from work yesterday and pull into the garage. I walk in the house and do a preliminary sweep to see what he is up to and to see what he's misplaced.  He's in his bedroom tearing apart DVD cases.  Cool.  So I walk back toward the garage.  On my way I flip the door-guardian closed on the front door from when the caregiver left.  Now if this were taking place in a movie - that is the part they would have shown a closeup shot of in slow-motion.
So I put my bag down and walk out the garage to go get the mail and bring the trash and yard waste bins back to the side of the garage.  Dad closes the garage door while I'm doing this.
Uh oh.
Panic strikes.  I have keys, but they won't do me a lick of good.
I knock on the door, he ignores me.  I run to the patio.  Knock on the back door to try to get his attention.  10 minutes later he walks by.  He opens the patio door the 4 inches it can move before it hits the dowel.  Great - at least he can hear me now.  I ask him to open the garage.  I know full well he can't understand instructions, but I ask anyway.  REPEATEDLY.  I motion with my finger pressing the button.  He's not saying anything and not really looking at me.  5 minutes of this until he starts walking toward the garage door. YES!  He opens the door to the garage and walks in there, but doesn't press the button to open the outer door.  DAMMIT!
So this continues for FORTY minutes.  Me running around the house trying to get his attention and trying to get him to open the garage.
Luckily, the guy 2 doors down (who happens to be a carpenter/do-it-all handyman) was around and saw me.  He came by and helped me remove the sliding patio door from the track and I was able to get in.  HOLY MOLY!  This guy is a lifesaver.  I felt (and still feel) SO indebted to him.  He wouldn't accept anything I offered though - ""Don't worry about it"".
TL;DR:  Moral of the story - leave yourself a few ways to get back in the house, even if you're outside for only a minute.","comment 1: How old is your dad?
comment 2: he is 68
comment 3: I'm thinking that the Door Guardian might not be such a good idea, and it might be better to install a deadbolt keyed on both sides. In addition to which, having an extra key locked in a key lock box that is opened by button press combination.
comment 4: There's never a dull moment when demented parents are involved.

"Phone for Mother-in-law My mother in law is 60 years old and has some very serious memory problems. According to her son, she's had some emotional/psychological challenges throughout her life and they've compounded with the memory problems. We've done our absolute best to help her - from the initial realization, having her license removed, moving her into independent living - but she resists absolutely everything we try to do. She's also manipulative and only seems to remember things she wants to remember - she's aware of her memory problems and sometimes clearly uses them to manipulate us. This has made getting a diagnosis impossible - plus scheduling neuro appointments, oh my… 
Her 92 year old parents are also a hindrance to our progress. They thought nothing was wrong, eventually supported us, then she brain washed them, and now they scold us for not caring about her. It's fun and after 3 years is starting to wear on my family.
To the point...
She was recently involved with a dangerous person while in independent living. We hadn't removed all of her money - she freaked out, and it's tough for her children to completely remove her freedom - but the guy managed to convince her to buy a car in both of their names with cash, she actually went shopping for him, he ended up living in her apartment, and somehow stole all of her cash (we're talking thousands - her mother sends her cash in the mail… wth). She didn't tell us about him and managed to hide the entire situation from us for 3 weeks and even made up a false name for him. When we learned she was seeing someone, we were happy for her. Then we figured out the car situation, then the money, then found a couple bruises. One day she was lucid and wanted to call the police, admitted that he caused the bruises and stole all of her money. The police did nothing because we couldn't find him or the car and we didn't have a record of the cash.
The man has a significant criminal record (DUI's with an impounded car - now we know why he wanted her to buy one, multiple thefts and break-ins, and he's homeless). We're convinced he manipulated her and gave her attention and now she is protecting him. (She is ""in love with him"")
We were concerned for her safety. My wife has POA so we took control of the money and we're safe legally. We changed her phone number and blocked his and moved her to her parents' for a month. Somehow, and I have no idea how, she managed to call him. We had a week-long saga of phone blocking, which ultimately seems to have worked. Now she's moving back to the area - new room, no name on door, man is banned from the building - BUT we're very afraid she will figure out how to contact him.
We want a dumb phone for her with some serious blocking potential - as in, she can only contact a list of numbers that we designate. We haven't found anything that is helpful or available in the US. It'd be nice if there was GPS tracking on it.
Any suggestions?
tl;dr: Mother-in-law, neuro degeneracy, psychological problems make it more challenging, involved with bad man who steals money and abuses her, she vehemently protects him, need to get her a dumb phone that can only call listed contacts, would like to have a gps tracker in her phone, can't find anything, hoping for suggestions and maybe some advice...","comment 1: I think they make phones like that for little kids. There are like 5 buttons max and the parents have to program the numbers and all the kid can do is press a button that dials one of the pre programmed numbers. 
comment 2: Reddit has a sub /r/cellphones which might be of more help.
comment 3: Didn't know that! Super helpful. Thanks!
comment 4: Your experience is my biggest fear with regard to my own mother.  What a mess.  You might consider posting your story on the Alzheimer's  forum board:  https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=topics&f=151
comment 5: I didn't know about this either! Thank you! Yeah… it's been challenging to say the least. I'm sure it's challenging regardless of age, but as a group of 20-somethings there have been many tough realizations and decisions so far

"My mother thinks having one executor or one person to keep track of medical is playing favorites. What can I say to make her understand? My mom is 82.  She's fairly healthy, but makes terrible decisions because of her anxiety. I had a whole thing typed out, but deleted it because it's simply frustration on my part.  Stuff stuff stuff, three days in cardiac ICU and I've realized she isn't taking care of herself.  Her hearing is shot, so she can't hear doctors.  She starts and stops meds on a whim (or because someone gave her essential oils).  She forgets a LOT of stuff.  
I was the executor of her will.  I spent all three days in cardiac ICU with her.  She doesn't remember any of it.  I talked to her primary care doctor and found out how mom is mismanaging her own care.  I've partnered with the doctor.  I've typed up notes from every doctor.  I've put them all online and made her a folder.
There are nine kids.  Five are my mom's natural kids.  I've discussed with her the importance of having someone as a primary point of contact, medically.  Someone to pay the bills; someone to document doctors; someone to interact with pharmacy if mom can't.  She said it made sense.  Then I find she's been inviting different siblings to different doctor's appointments.  When I confronted her, she said she refuses to play favorites.  She wants all of us to be executors of her will.  She wants all of us to go to her doctor appointments with her.  
IDK what to do.  I told her I'm out totally.  Yet she still keeps calling me asking for advice on her health and will.  She doesn't understand why I refuse.  I don't want to talk to my siblings because, frankly, they're nuts.  Some of them will get it.  Some of them will want to manipulate my mom to get stuff.
Should I just abandon her?  IDK what to do.","comment 1: This may not be too helpful, but maybe you'll find a something in here. She needs to accept that there is a necessary process to this phase of her life, and this website and their documents are a fairly commonly used resource. 
I can see how it's a frustrating situation. You may want to call a pow-wow with all your siblings, so that all of you are on the same page; that way if she invites Harry or Fred to an appointment, they will say, ""we need to take Betty, she's your executor"". 
comment 2: Oops I totally missed your last paragraph. Even if you don't get along with your sibs, you all need to be on the same page... I hope it works out. Absolutely do not abandon her. 
comment 3: I understand your frustration. I am dealing with the fallout of my 80 year old mother not taking care of herself. I only have one crazy sibling, so I've got that going for me.
It sounds like she needs to turn power of attorney over to someone. You probably can't have her play fair. You should contact an elder care lawyer for more information about how to do this. I've been to /r/legal, and they are very helpful in pointing in the right direction.
It's not fair. More later.

Gps car tracker The other day my grandfather-in-law took his car for his normal 15min daily ride. He didn't come back for 4hrs. Now we are looking into getting a gps tracker for his car. Any suggestions?,"comment 1: sounds like you need to consider getting his license revoked.
I Went through the same thing with my dad back in december.
It's not easy but when you consider if he runs a red light or gets lost
for a day in cold weather, it becomes a safety issue for the community.
you will probably need to get creative with the method you employ for taking care of this.
remember it is the best for HIS safety AND the safety of the community.
comment 2: Hide the keys.  It can be difficult to have a license revoked and even if that is successful, many will forget their license is no longer valid. In addition, allow him to drive with a passenger occasionally so that he retains some sense of autonomity, as long as it is safe.

"I need help Hi Reddit, 
So my father has Alzheimer's over 3 years now and it's gotten quite bad lately. I've family trying get him care but it's taking along time to get anything done. I've 3 brothers, 2 of which live away from us with there own families. I'm working full time as a retail manager and my other brother works nights and weekends as a bar man. I seem to be the only one that gives a crap about this as I'm the youngest in the family and live with my father and older brother. I have to move out soon due to work so will no longer be at home but I'm worried constantly about my father that something might happen if I'm at work and no one is at home.
I've been trying to get care for him and it seems to be taking forever to get any form of help. He goes to a day care house 2 times a week for a few hours but it's not enough. We have a tracker for him in case he goes missing which has been happening a lot lately. I have a car so I'm always the one who has to get him if he goes missing.
I'm from Ireland and I was wondering has anyone here got any advice on what to do? I'm constantly stressed, I'm having panic attacks and anxiety. I'm just lost and I can't stop worrying. Can anyone tell me what I can do to try speed up the process of getting some form of help as my brothers don't seem to care and I'm going to end up in hospital at this rate. 
Thanks for any advice","comment 1: Have you tried https://www.alzheimer.ie/Home.aspx yet? I'm in the North, and the UK-based service that I use, which is what I looked for to find this, is brilliant. 
Also, this might sound stupid, but, have you thought about approaching one of your local TDs? They can really be helpful dealing with situations like this; I'm not even joking. 
If I can think of anything else, I'll update, but I really think you should tell the people I've mentioned, not only that you need help, but that it is affecting your health and possibly your work situation. 
hugs, love. 
comment 2: Thanks for the reply. I'll get onto them tomorrow to see if I can find some form of help. I'll check out a local TD I didn't think they could help us! 
I'm going to the doctors tomorrow as I think I might need to see someone just to talk too, I've suffered from depression for a long time before all this so this isn't helping. 
Thanks for the advice and I'll keep you posted! 
comment 3: I'm also a long-term sufferer of depression and watching my mum go downhill with the dementia is draining me, but what else can we do, eh? Saying that, if we don't look after ourselves first, that's a whole other shit show, so I'm glad you're going to the doctor.
Politicians are there to represent the constituency interests and their constituents, but it's amazing that we never think to ask them for help. They can really make a fuss about stuff like this! 
Best of luck, love. Big hugs, and let me know how you get on!

"Alzheimer's Support Groups I went to my first Alz support group today. 
What got out of it:
We're not alone. It's good to talk to others, if for no other reason then to vent. But I did get a lot of good tips & tricks from this group:

Dad likes sweets, bribe him if we have to

Lying is good. It's therapeutic lying - an alz patient will shut down & stop talking if you keep on correcting them that they're wrong.


Instead of saying There's no one here but us, Dad say The other people here, are they bothering you when he's loopy at night. If they're not bothering him then fine. If so, say something like I'll ask them to leave

Choose your battles. Wearing the same clothes you did yesterday is nowhere near as important as getting him to eat today
Lower the heat setting on the hot water heater. Many elderly have lost their sense of pain where heat is concerned
If he has a set of clothes he likes wearing, buy him several copies of it. It may be comfort, it may be an emotional bond to it.
See if Dad can do specific things, like empty the dishwasher, fold clothes. He wants to feel helpful
Maybe we should buy him tickets to the Opera again. He enjoyed that so much
The movie Still Alice, We may want to check that out. It's about a college professor who goes through Alzheimer's
MedicAlert - a way to track a wandering person. Something to research.
There are support groups (on the Alz website) all over the place but they are not all alike. Some of them have lecturers, some are just caregivers talking, some have doctors there to answer technical questions that lay-people have. You have to check them out until you find a group you like

I'd love to see this subreddit collect all this information into one big helpful sidebar. Not just what I've found but what others have found too. ","comment 1: I especially like the point about the lying - I know it's hard for people to see, but holding firmly to ""truth"" in the context of relating to a person who literally can't comprehend/retain the truth is not a kindness...
comment 2: Agree. The lying part was the hardest/weirdest thing to learn because as a kid I was always taught to be honest, and as an adult have always been a straight-shooter. But how many times should someone have to go through the pain of losing what they equate with independence (""Your car is at our house... you asked us to hang onto it since this place doesn't have a garage""), the death of their parents (""Why haven't they visited? They don't get around very well but cousin Fred is taking care of them.""), or the death of a spouse. At this point, it would just be cruel to remind them of these things. And for the little things... it just doesn't matter. If he says he just bought those shoes yesterday what's the point upsetting him in order to be ""right""? Who cares.

"Looking for GPS watch for amnesiac adult This isn't precisely for Alzheimer's, but I hope some people in this sub might have some information.

"A little dignity goes a long way Hi Reddit, 
My dad has early onset Alzheimer’s and while he knows what’s going on he gets lost easily. After spending a few hours looking for him last night I have been thinking about something to help him go out of his own and call me (or my mother) and allow us to ‘track him’.  I looked online for some ‘tracking monitor’ or easy phone… they were all somewhat patronizing.
So I was thinking if others have this similar problem and what they used to fix it? Are there any products around that allow him to have some control of his life and his dignity? 
Any help would be much appreciated. ","comment 1: You should look into www.lifeprotekt.com. I have dealt with this company and it works very well. They offer wearable (watch-like) GPS devices, and a variety of other products that can come with good service plans. The devices can be linked directly to your iphone/android/computer desktop, and will give you updates. GPS technology is such an important asset to have when you have loved ones who can wander away or go missing. 
Wandering is such a dangerous behavior, and these kind of wearable devices are a good way for you to keep tabs on your dad without making him feel patronized. Also, try contacting your local police department-Let them know that your loved one has an issue with wandering, and sometimes local police departments can provide assistance in paying for GPS technology.

"Finding care for dad. Need to vent My dad, 66 is chronically ill, I'm 25 and my brother is 28.
I grew up with a pretty rough childhood. My mom was emotionally abusive, and the only interest or support my dad did gave me was financially. I spent my teen years taking care of myself, researching, studying, trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with me mentally and how to fix it. Without any kind of counseling or medication, I've been able to independently bring myself to find happiness and peace within the past 2 years... for the most part... with the exception of dealing with family. 
My dad has good intentions, he really does. He was never abusive, just maybe emotionally neglectful. He's just not very socially intelligent. His idea of being a good dad was working full time, providing money, having a pretty wife, a nice house in the suburbs, 2 kids, and a social life with weekend leisure time with family friends. Perfect life, right? Turns out that doesn't work out so well if you're constantly worried about money, your image, and what people think about you, rather than love. My dad got really sick when I was around 13 or 14 and had to get his kidney removed. He also got diagnosed with COPD and was in and out of the hospital over the next year. It was shortly after this that my mom divorced him and left us all in my childhood home and moved away to go start her new life of independence. She and I barely talked for the next 5 years, and she never fought for any kind of custody, nor did she pay child support. This was also the same time my brother went to college. So just me and my dad are left in our house - aging dad, newly divorced, depressed, very sick, with a typical 15 year old girl with hormone overload, in general being a wreck and a handful. I also didn't fully understand the gravity of my dad's health situation and the long-term implications of it; no one ever took the time to explain it to me. I think I found out about the COPD by finding a brochure in his bathroom that was probably titled something like ""So You've Been Diagnosed with COPD..."" then Googled COPD.
Eventually I went to college, and my brother moved back home, we switched spots. The house fell to complete shambles and my dad's disease progressed. Everything is broken, nothing works, trash everywhere, junk everywhere, yard is a mess, dust everywhere. My dad doesn't have the energy or lung capacity to take care of the house, and my brother just lives like that normally, and doesn't understand why it's bad for dad. Going home is extremely depressing, both because of the state of the house and how my dad is living, and because it reminds me of a very sad childhood. Both parents have always been very anxious and negative, and never had much of a sense of humor, and the COPD has definitely not made it any better for dad. He shoots down or tries to challenge everything you say. He has this unbearably dry, cynical sense of humor, if you can even call it that. He wallows in self-pity and every day he tells you, ""today is not a good breathing day for me"". Yes dad, we know... you're on oxygen 24/7 for a reason. Being around him makes me feel like I'm in a vacuum where any positivity, humor, love, or happiness that exists in the world gets sucked out.  
My happiness is based on travel and adventure and by surrounding myself with positive people doing meaningful, constructive things with their life. I am not meant to stay in one place. While old high school and college acquaintances are settling down, buying houses, and having babies, that is the last thing I want to do. The career I've built for myself has full-time travel in its nature and the field has no job opportunities in the city where my dad lives. That said, I am still partially financially dependent on my dad. He's been very generous in helping me out when I need it and in paying my health/insurance/student loan bills. 
I don't think he would expect me to, or ask me to stick around and be his primary caregiver, but honestly, I think he wants it and he needs it. It seems weird to consider the possibility of him having some kind of assisted living situation while he's still driving himself to the office and working 9-5 daily, so it's a confusing situation. He still makes a healthy income, but his personal life is not okay. I think he's partially in denial of his reality. He can't walk more than 20 ft at a time, yet he rejected my suggestion of getting a wheelchair or some kind of device to improve his mobility. The other day he suggested my brother, him, and I go to do something on the weekend like go to a museum or a place ""we can walk around"". Confused about how he thought he was going to walk around, I suggested we go see a movie instead. He agreed, and upon the end of the movie having to walk from the theater to the exit, he had my brother and I push him in an office chair we found the whole way through the lobby to pitying glances from onlookers. Had he just had a normal wheelchair or walker, I doubt anyone would have looked or thought twice about it. My aunt suggested he mov into senior care facility, but he said he didn't want to be around old people... he's a senior citizen. 
It kills me to see him struggle to breathe and enjoy life, but at the same time I really need to care for myself mentally. I'm finally in my own recovery phase and getting my life on track. I'm otherwise happy and I know where I'm going and what I want to do for the first time in my life. It's like I've spent my whole life caring for myself and trying to figure out how to be happy, and now that I've found that happiness that was so elusive for the greater part of my life, it's irreconcilable with caring for my ailing dad. I'm 25, I just want to enjoy life for once, I've endured and waited long enough. If I were to be my dad's primary caregiver, that would all be thrown out the window and I'd revert back to a world depression and anxiety. At this point in time, I've been accepted into graduate school overseas and I want very badly to go. I've lived the past 2 years in another country away from dad and just came back to dad's city for the past few months to spend time with him. His situation just came back and hit me like a ton of bricks. I don't want him to be neglected. My brother lives with him, but my brother is not the most responsible person in the world. I fear I will go to school far away for a year, and lose my dad in that time and live the rest of my life feeling I should have done more. But I also dread the idea of being stuck in a horrible suburban hometown in the southern US, in a home full of bad memories and feelings, and throwing a promising life and career out the window for a parent who never gave me the love or emotional support a child so obviously needs. Feeling very torn, confused, guilty. ","comment 1: Have you talked to your brother directly about his ""care"" of the house and your Dad while you've been gone in college?  If he could see how he is neglecting the house and your father, perhaps he would keep things a bit more tidy. I would guess that he might have the same emotional ""pulling"" that you do... feeling torn on helping him because of his neglect when you were growing up.
Would your brother will be staying in that area even if your father wasn't in the picture? If so, then it seems logical that he would take care of your Dad while you are off doing school. 
Does your Dad have the funds to have a cleaner come every week or so?

"Drug Compliance (help please!) Hi Reddit- I am part of a group trying to develop a better device/method to keep drug compliance with Alzheimer's Patients. What have your personal experiences (whether you are family or friend or the patient) with drug compliance? How do you think this can be integrated into home-care (as in, if we were to improve upon a device such as the pill box to insure that the drugs are actually being taken)? Any other general comments regarding Alzheimer's in-home care (esp drug compliance) would be greatly appreciated! p.s. what would be a good Alzheimer's support group to look into to get more personal feedback?","comment 1: I had to resort toadying for twice a day visits to have someone physically hand my dad his pills and stand there while he took them.  I tried weekly pill boxes, then a pill box with alarms.  He either didn't hear the alarms, or would dump the pills out to stop the alarm but still not take them.  I would call him and he would swear he had taken them.  
comment 2: With my grandmother she was overdosing when we would leave a pill box for her, even with an alarm reminding her to take them or phone calls coaching her. We had to resort to just giving them to her in a cup (she had arthitis in her hands as well) and sometimes tricking her into taking them (she always wanted pain pills, so all of her medication were ""pain pills""). But like someone else who posted below, we would also have to stand by and coach her.
Maybe something that is timed and won't open until it is the appropriate time to take them would be enough, I mean it is not like we can integrate all the medication into one super pill that is somehow easy to swallow!
You might want to reach out to the Alzheimer's association magazine and see if they would be willing to have a questionnaire in one issue. Each major city has their own caregiver's support group, looking there would probably be a good resource as well. Good luck!

About two years ago. A year ago he moved to assisted living but we still use this. It became ingrained and is part of his day now. I call about 10 mins after it is programmed to go off and ask him to check the bowl he dumps the pills in, to ensure he actually took them. Most of the time he has, but if he hasn't I ask him to take them while I'm on the phone. About once a month he will skip a dose (it stays in chamber and is evident)

"Wearable for someone with Dementia Hi All,
I could really use some help. I've been working on a way to have Alzheimer's patients wear activity sensors for my research, and I'm wondering how I can best get someone to wear one every day.   
It's a little module that can be worn as a watch/wristband, pinned to clothes, etc.  My concern is that someone might not recognize/remember a new gadget on them, and remove it. Any ideas? ","comment 1: If you could build it into a working watch that might work. Other than that I would say if they have a caregiver ask the caregiver if they can keep an eye on it and if it's taken off to try and have the patient put it back on, then record the date/time it was put back on.
comment 2: What it looked like this? I don't think I can get it to look like a regular watch...  I'm wondering where else to put it.
comment 3: If not a watch, maybe you could decorate it to look like a jewelry bracelet. Or maybe like an antique styled necklace if it can be worn around the neck.
comment 4: Unfortunately I'd say it'd be best to have like a house arrest bracelet. What are those made of? Because I'm hoping if drunk drug addicted freaks can't get it off I'm sure it'd be difficult for an elderly dementia patient to.
comment 5: I've seen GPS systems modelled like watches, and bracelets, and the people (only about three) I've used them with didn't take them off, as long as it's familiar as an object that should be on their wrist it seems to be fine.
comment 6: I think I should test it out, but yes I want to make something nice looking. Would feel terrible (especially due to connotations) if it were used like an ankle monitor that they use for parolees!
comment 7: Identify something they routinely wear and embed the chip in that?
comment 8: I've seen them as little chips that could easily be embedded into the heel of most shoes, maybe that could be a solution? Although it might necessitate having a chip for each pair of shoes commonly worn. How big are the devices? 
comment 9: Is this project still active? I am a product designer. My mother has dementia. I have done some small work on cognitive prosthetics and would love to help you.

"Wearable GPS tracker I'm looking to find a wearable GPS tracker for a friend who has a loved one with dementia. They are moving their loved one to a home with a caretaker but would like the extra piece of mind that a GPS tracker could provide.
Was wondering if anyone here has used any such device or has advice and recommendations. ","comment 1: http://pocketfinder.com
We had one of these for my dad. Works great and has a gps app to track with! 
comment 2: My cat has a Tagg. Cheaper device and plan. A few months in and no problems. Wander alerts, map on browser or smartphone. 
comment 3: Things like these are a good option, you pop a SIM inside and they have a decent battery.  The issue is making sure the person has it on them when they wander, and that they don't jettison it (my mother has a tendency to remove anything from her bag that she doesn't think should be there).  I'd look at an ID bracelet or necklace, something with ""My name is Dave, please call xxxxxxxx on this number"" - we found my mum that way when someone picked her up on one of her excursions.

"Alzheimer Track - Crowdfunding project Dears,
I would like to present you our crowdfunding to create ""Alzheimer Track"",
base in a Stanford University MOOC final project.
Alzheimer Track, is a mobile application that uses the QR Code technology
to find patients who may be lost in the street due to the memory loss
caused by the disease.

"Device that makes noise when someone goes outside a perimeter? I'm looking for a device that will alert me when the elderly woman I work for leaves her apartment building. She lives in an apartment in an elder care facility, but the family pays me to spend time with her a few days a week.
They've tried basic GPS, but it's not reliable for her. The facility actually has an alert bracelet that goes off when she leaves, but it's often faulty and the staff are too used to hearing the noise to pay attention.
The family is hoping for some other noise-making device or something else that will allow the facility to know when she leaves a certain zone.
Price is basically no object.","comment 1: Have you tried this option?  It offers a wrist band with GPS and will alert if patient goes out of range.  If not I'd check to see if you know anyone who is geeky-handy a radio type transmitter wouldn't be too hard to make.

comment 2: This would be fantastic, but the family is already using this exact product. :/
They like it, though they say it can be spotty sometimes. Now they want something noisy as an extra precaution. 
comment 3: I've heard of this option:
>The premise of the technology is based on alerting you when your loved one has wandered off too far from a preset location, allowing you to set up a geographic boundary known as a “geozone”. When the individual wanders off and leaves the preset geozone, you are quickly notified via an email or SMS text to your mobile phone. The service also provides emergency tracking in case you need to locate a loved one immediately.

comment 4: I have the same problem with my dad so I just put alarms on all the doors so when he opens them I know he is headed somewhere with out me. 
comment 5: Niceish,
Check out GottaGo Gives app for iPhone and Android at GottaGo Gives Perhaps that will meet your needs. It is inexpensive and it is made for smartphones. They are also coming out with a dedicated device that will do the same thing in next few months.

"GPS Tracking for Alzheimer's patient in Greece Hi r/Alzheimers,
I'm currently doing a little research into GPS tracking for a friend's grandfather who lives in Greece - he has a tendency to wander, and his family wants to buy a GPS tracker for him. The only problem is that the majority of the products I've seen require constant internet accessto work - does anyone know of any products that can send SMS co-ordinates instead?","comment 1: Try looking at the Tramigo Portable

"Looking for a tracking device for my grandma who has dementia/alzheimers. My grandma is currently staying with another relative but she comes back to us this weekend. While she was away, she got out of the house and my uncle had to chase her halfway out of the neighborhood. We are looking to buy her a tracking bracelet so we know where she is at all times. If anybody knows where I can find one or the best ones on the market, please comment. Thank you. ","comment 1: There are a few types of tracker you can buy, the most basic (and cheapest) is a mobile phone - we put a mobile in my mum's handbag with numbers like ""Husband"" and ""Daughter"" in it - it won't help them pinpoint her, but it'll give the police a rough area, and anyone who finds her can use it to call you.  
Then you move onto things like these which are genuine GPS systems - the problems with these are making sure they stay with the person.  My mother has a tendency to ditch anything she doesn't like the look of, and if your grandma is getting out, you need to figure out what she always takes, and how toy attach a tracker to that.

You may want to look into this program. It's not available everywhere but it's basically exactly what you are describing.

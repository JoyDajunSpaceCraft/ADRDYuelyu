"hi all, i've posted here before about my dad. he's 71 and for the past year or so i've been keeping a mental checklist of warning signs of dementia. so far he's been checking every one. memory changes are obviously the biggest, but i've also noticed increased speech problems, confusion, aggression and falls. now, obviously i don't know 100% whether he has dementia or not, so i want him to see his doctor about it. i doubt she would have any idea what's really going on since he only tells her about physical pain, and he tends to downplay his confusion &amp; memory loss too. should i talk to her myself, or is there a way to gently coax my dad to ask himself? he and i share the same doctor, so i'm thinking about bringing this up to her anyways at my next appointment. if anyone has had any experience going through this it would be greatly appreciated!",How to gently suggest testing for dementia?,1,hi ve posted dad s 71 past year ve keeping mental checklist warning signs dementia far s checking every one memory changes obviously biggest ve also noticed increased speech problems confusion aggression falls obviously n t know 100 whether dementia want see doctor doubt would idea s really going since tells physical pain tends downplay confusion amp memory loss talk way gently coax dad ask share doctor m thinking bringing anyways next appointment anyone experience going would greatly appreciated gently suggest testing dementia

"on wednesday, my mom's boss called me to alert me about my mom's diminishing job performance. she's becoming forgetful and they brought it to my attention that they've been covering for her mistakes for quite some time and they don't know how much longer they can continue doing so, especially with a new system being implemented at her job. her boss told me all of this info asking me to take her to the doctor so they can be updated about my mom's current condition so they know how to proceed.currently, my mom's in a stage where she's asking questions that she's asked before and i follow by asking her ""you don't remember...?"" she shakes her head, then a second later recalls the answer. the max i'll be asked the same question is 3 times within \~2 hours. she is also forgetful of buying things she's brought the day prior, this is a somewhat recent issue that has developed. my mother also had a pacemaker implanted in june, last year, after developing an arrhythmia, it took many months of hospital and doctor visits until they found the issue. her recent doctor's visit (last friday) also revealed that my mom has high blood pressure. we had lab work done this thursday so we're awaiting results and farther info. i'm here to ask what should i do next, what should i expect next? my friend told me to consider alzheimer's and i think i'm on a good path with the blood work being done. i'm just an only child to a single mother so i don't have much guidance with these things.","My [22 F] Moms [62 F] job is in jeopardy, she's becoming forgetful",1,wednesday mom s boss called alert mom s diminishing job performance s becoming forgetful brought attention ve covering mistakes quite time n t know much longer continue especially new system implemented job boss told info asking take doctor updated mom s current condition know proceed currently mom s stage s asking questions s asked follow asking n t remember shakes head second later recalls answer max ll asked question 3 times within 2 hours also forgetful buying things s brought day prior somewhat recent issue developed mother also pacemaker implanted june last year developing arrhythmia took many months hospital doctor visits found issue recent doctor s visit last friday also revealed mom high blood pressure lab work done thursday re awaiting results farther info m ask next expect next friend told consider alzheimer s think m good path blood work done m child single mother n t much guidance things 22 F Moms 62 F job jeopardy s becoming forgetful
"i notice that my mom has her idea of the past very mixed up. she is the kind of person who loves the past and reminicing about old times. lately though, she has things mixed up. her memories are real to her, but are no longer accurate. life events are condensed, combined and or jumbled up in major ways. i was of the understanding that dementia affects short-term memory but not so much the long term memory. her most recent assessment shows only minor cognitive impairment, but why is she mixing up events so much? how does impairment affect the long term memories of older people? how do i respond to her stories?",Over 80 with jumbled memories?,1,notice mom idea past mixed kind person loves past reminicing old times lately though things mixed memories real longer accurate life events condensed combined jumbled major ways understanding dementia affects short term memory much long term memory recent assessment shows minor cognitive impairment mixing events much impairment affect long term memories older people respond stories 80 jumbled memories
"cross-posted at someone's advice from r/relationships for context, my mom used to work in entertainment when she was around my age and up until 30 or so, and was relatively well-known, so i get why she is extra cautious about certain things like making sure the blinds are down and thinking that people are staring at her or paying her extra unwanted attention - it probably has literally happened to her. she was also harassed at her last job by her (male) boss, which i'm sure fuels her reasoning for this kind of behavior...but increasingly over the last ten years or so, and especially over the last couple, she's been saying some things that i think are completely ridiculous. for example, we've been having some issues with hot water consistency in our shower recently but apparently none of the neighbors in our apartment that she's asked have had the same problem, and she's convinced that the landlord (who admittedly is slightly sketch) is tampering with our hot water in order to provoke her because he has it out for her and/or wants her attention. another example - a nice scarf we bought went missing a few years ago and she's convinced the landlord broke into our apartment and stole it. or an example not involving the landlord - she reads a lot of anti-""country x"" (preserving anonymity) news online and follows that stuff on social media, and when our wifi goes out she tells me it's because country x is trying to sabotage her (or broadly, people who are anti-country x). i think she also reads a lot of sensationalist news about robberies and murders and kidnappings and whatnot, and so is pretty paranoid anytime i leave the house, but maybe that's just a mom thing?my grandfather exhibited similar paranoia towards the end of his life (according to her, and no formal diagnosis of anything - he would occasionally tell my mom that his caretaker at the nursing home wanted to kill him), and she both acknowledges his paranoia and does not believe she's wrong about any of the things she's saying. i tell her she sounds crazy and make the comparison to my grandfather, and she obviously does not take that well and tells me that she just won't confide in me about these things going forward, which isn't what i want - i just want to shake some sense into her. i don't know what to do - like yes, country x is pretty messed up and i'm sure they do some pretty sketchy surveillance shit, but i doubt they have the capacity to fuck around with our wifi all the way in america... and yes, our landlord is kinda sketch but who the fuck breaks into an apartment just to steal a scarf and spends their time messing with one person's hot water? none of this is well-received, she has shot down every suggestion i make about a therapist (she doesn't trust strangers with her secrets and personal life), and i have no idea what to do, or how worried i should be.i should also take care to mention that all she does is talk about this stuff - she doesn't behave erratically or do anything crazy besides occasionally being moody/in a bad mood because she thinks xyz. i also suspect a lot of the country x paranoia is fueled by the amount of stuff she reads on the internet, but that doesn't really account for the landlord stuff...someone on r/relationships mentioned something about early onset dementia. in all other respects she has everything 100% together - she's the family planner, family accountant, family organizer... from a life/care-taking perspective she's probably the most capable person i know! but this paranoia is really starting to worry me.any ideas/guidance, please?",My (24F) mom (56F) is exhibiting increasingly paranoid behavior and I don't know what to do,1,cross posted someone s advice r relationships context mom used work entertainment around age 30 relatively well known get extra cautious certain things like making sure blinds thinking people staring paying extra unwanted attention probably literally happened also harassed last job male boss m sure fuels reasoning kind behavior increasingly last ten years especially last couple s saying things think completely ridiculous example ve issues hot water consistency shower recently apparently none neighbors apartment s asked problem s convinced landlord admittedly slightly sketch tampering hot water order provoke and or wants attention another example nice scarf bought went missing years ago s convinced landlord broke apartment stole example involving landlord reads lot anti country x preserving anonymity news online follows stuff social media wifi goes tells s country x trying sabotage broadly people anti country x think also reads lot sensationalist news robberies murders kidnappings whatnot pretty paranoid anytime leave house maybe s mom thing grandfather exhibited similar paranoia towards end life according formal diagnosis anything would occasionally tell mom caretaker nursing home wanted kill acknowledges paranoia believe s wrong things s saying tell sounds crazy make comparison grandfather obviously take well tells wo n t confide things going forward n t want want shake sense n t know like yes country x pretty messed m sure pretty sketchy surveillance shit doubt capacity fuck around wifi way america yes landlord kinda sketch fuck breaks apartment steal scarf spends time messing one person s hot water none well received shot every suggestion make therapist n t trust strangers secrets personal life idea worried be i also take care mention talk stuff n t behave erratically anything crazy besides occasionally moody in bad mood thinks xyz also suspect lot country x paranoia fueled amount stuff reads internet n t really account landlord stuff someone r relationships mentioned something early onset dementia respects everything 100 together s family planner family accountant family organizer life care taking perspective s probably capable person know paranoia really starting worry me any ideas guidance please 24F mom 56F exhibiting increasingly paranoid behavior n t know

"my grandmother just turned 91 and for a little while now has been on the gradual decline in terms of memory. when there are a couple of us in conversation, i have noticed that more and more she sort of tunes out. she is also constantly losing things. she lives with my parents and i can see the affect it is having on them and her.just yesterday i was visiting and she was attempting to pay her taxes online, but couldn't find her wallet. in the search, we found her check book in the sleeve of a sweater in her dresser. this is becoming a constant problem.when i asked her if everything was ok, she nearly broke down, but she would not let me help her to continue to search. she is about as stubborn as they come. i am curious if anyone has any tips on how myself and my parents might be better able to help the situation. do we hold onto all valuable items for her? i know that she wont like that, but seems like losing the items is more traumatizing each time then the anger she might have from losing that independence. any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.",Grandmother (91) keeps misplacing items,0,grandmother turned 91 little gradual decline terms memory couple us conversation noticed sort tunes also constantly losing things lives parents see affect her just yesterday visiting attempting pay taxes online could n t find wallet search found check book sleeve sweater dresser becoming constant problem when asked everything ok nearly broke would let help continue search stubborn come curious anyone tips parents might better able help situation hold onto valuable items know wont like seems like losing items traumatizing time anger might losing independence help provide would greatly appreciated Grandmother 91 keeps misplacing items

for some reason this post wasn't allowed in r/askdocs which is mildly infuriating so asking here and hopeful a doctor will respond. my mom was diagnosed with lewy body about six months ago by her neurologist with input from a psychologist who tested her. she was prescribed medication to deal with hallucinations. no follow-up appointment was provided and although it wasn't explicity stated that no more appointments would be necessary there was a general understanding that there simply wasn't anything to do be done about the onset and progression of the dementia. we've since moved her in with us and intend to look after her for as long as we are able.her symptoms have progressed and at my mother's insistence we've reached out by phone a few times about meeting with the neurologist but we don't hear back beyond his assistant telling us she'll check to see if he thinks an apointment is necessary. we never hear that an appointment isn't necessary.i don't want to pester a doctor if there's no point in scheduling a follow-up. i know this is incurable and we know where this is ultimately headed. but i don't want to give up scheduling follow-ups if they're any way helpful for her either.what position are in here?,Should we not expect follow-up visits after a dementia diagnosis?,0,reason post n t allowed r askdocs mildly infuriating asking hopeful doctor respond mom diagnosed lewy body six months ago neurologist input psychologist tested prescribed medication deal hallucinations follow up appointment provided although n t explicity stated appointments would necessary general understanding simply n t anything done onset progression dementia ve since moved us intend look long able her symptoms progressed mother s insistence ve reached phone times meeting neurologist n t hear back beyond assistant telling us ll check see thinks apointment necessary never hear appointment n t necessary i n t want pester doctor s point scheduling follow up know incurable know ultimately headed n t want give scheduling follow ups re way helpful either what position expect follow up visits dementia diagnosis

"ok, so my dad (m88) was diagnosed a couple of months ago. vascular dementia, after numerous strokes &amp; tias. he became impossible to care for at home. he has type 2 diabetes, and this has damaged his gut to the point where it gets backed up. basically he couldn't get to the loo in time, shat everywhere. they tried everything, adult diapers, all that, no good. so now he's in a care home, and my mum had basically done her grieving, figured the man she married was long gone. now the care home are sending her video messages of him holding up a banner saying ""i love you"". she's in tears, i'm in tears too. i don't want to abandon him if he's still in there, he's not dead yet, but i don't want her to be suffering either, if they're making him do this &amp; he has no idea what he's being made to do. the damned place never answers their phone, either. what to do?",Dementia in the time of COVID-19,0

"today i received a message that my great-grandma was taken to hospital. my great-grandma is in her early 90s. i'm not sure when or if it was diagnosed but i think she has alzheimer‚Äôs, in which she started showing symptoms for when she was around 86, maybe earlier. in hindsight it's clear to see why but i believe she started showing symptoms of dementia when she started to accuse my uncle and my cousin (his son) of stealing from her, which she adamantly believed happened. this may have coinsided with some home renovation carried out by the council, i'm not sure if anything was actually stolen but she seriously believed my uncle and cousin did it which led to friction and upset. fast forward a year or so later to the next time i saw her and it was clear that her memory was detiorating, she remembered me but she seemed struggled to remember the last time she saw my nan (her ex-daughter-in-law which visited her the day or week before). as i left in the car (with my mother and aunty) i was upset as it was starting to set in that the grandma i loved dearly was starting to fade away, doubled with the news that my mum told me in the car that she also accused her of stealing several items.these accusations have upset my mum deeply and she has not seen my grandma since (i have since learn that accusing people of stealing happens regularly in those diagnosed with alzheimer‚Äôs and told my mum that it wasn't my grandma talking).fast forward another 2 or 3 year later to last september and i went to see her with my nan, which was the first time i saw my grandma since the prior visit (i was conflicted to whether i should go to see my grandma anymore or not her and at the time i didn't know accusing family of stealing was connected to her illness). although i was expecting her memory to have worsened i thought she may she have still remembered me. but it wasn't until she asked who i was, who my mother is and how i was related to her did my heart drop. i had to contain my emotion as i was on the verge of crying infront of her and my nan.i haven't seen her since and i am constantly filled with regrets and emotions...would she still have remembered me if i saw her more often? i can't but help thinking that in her time of need i abandoned her and left her without a reason to why i stopped visiting her. what makes it even harder is that i can't even apologise for what happened and tell her that i'm sorry.",If only I...,1
"tl;dr should i bother with stressing my mother out for two days of off-site testing when i know my mother is in the end stages of alzheimer's? i received a call from my mother's nursing home asking if i would consent to an mri of her brain, upper back, lower back, and legs today. the doctor has ordered these tests to happen over two different days. my mom has been in a wheel chair for several months and been in a nursing home for three and a half years. the nursing home will have to transport her both days to a facility for the testing because they do not have the equipment onsite. i asked what they hope to glean from the testing as she has a progressive disease and leaving the facility is very confusing to her. they said to see why she is not eating well or ambulating any longer and they want to know what is going on and if there is some sort of pain she might be in because she is not able to communicate what she is feeling. from my perspective we know why, she has a progressive disease that slowly takes away your abilities. i have not consented to the testing yet and don't know if i should. does anyone have any thoughts or experience with testing during the end stages of alzheimer's?",End stages and testing,0

"hi all. i've got grandparents living in florida in their own house (ie not any kind of assisted living community) and i just found out today that my grandmother has been diagnosed with alzheimer's. i'll give some quick context to our situation and would love to hear the thoughts/advice of this community.even getting to this point has been difficult -- my grandmother is extremely stubborn and independent, so while we were aware she had been slowly losing her faculties for some time, it took a concerted effort to get to the point of a diagnosis because of a combination of her own stubbornness and her long-time doctor's complacency. my grandfather is still sharp as a tack but wheelchair bound, so he is not in a position to care for both of them.it's clear they need to have more around-the-clock care, but the problem is that my grandmother will never agree to that. she insists there is nothing wrong (i could get into all the examples of how that is not true, but just trust me when i say she needs better help). the problem is she still has some level of lucidity, so we can't force her to do things she doesn't want to do (keep appointments, etc). it is important to mention that most of the family lives in pa, so while we've been trying to help care for things, it's simply not going to be possible for us to give her the level of care she needs. one of my uncles lives close by there and visits often, but he is simply wholly unprepared to deal with how complex the situation has become. obviously i don't think the right thing to do is to wait until she has an accident or hurts my grandfather to take more decisive action. what should we do in this 'in-between' period where she is lucid enough to have her own agency, but will inevitably be in a potentially dangerous situation soon? are there resources we can work with?thanks for reading and appreciate any guidance in advance.",New to Alzheimer's and looking for guidance,1

"hi all,thank you again in advance for your advice.i'm wondering if anyone has any experience with the crisis care list in ontario. the situation with my grandmother just keeps escalating and escalating and last night she accused my grandad of murdering my great-gran (who has been gone for 20 years and died at 97 in her sleep). this was while she was holding a knife, so the safety concern has gone from her running away to potential stabbing. my grandad spoke with the geriatric team we've been working with along with their gp and the consensus is she needs to go on a crisis care placement list.the problem here is that my grandad cannot drive due to poor vision, and our understanding of the crisis list is that she can be placed on a list 100km from where they live. they're up in simcoe-muskoka so that could be as far south as barrie and extend up to north bay. so we're worried about this for obvious reasons. we're also worried as all research has been shown that if we turn down the first bed the case file gets closed and we have to start again.does anyone have any advice on how to navigate this all?",Crisis Care List Ontario,0
"rather complicated scenario but my sister placed our mother in a nursing home / memory care facility a few years ago as mom came down with alzheimers. sis &amp; mom where much closer than mom &amp; i and so sis did all of the work since mom was more comfortable handing over poa to her, they lived in the same city, etc. everything was going fine, but then sis died (cancer) two years ago and so i've assumed all of the work she was doing -- poa, etc., though i live in a city 4 hours away from where mom lives in the nursing home. the deal this facility made with my sister was that if we ""private pay"" for at least two years, then once the ""private pay"" funds are all exhausted they will accept medicaid to cover her expenses there.they've repeated this to me and so far i've accepted it -- though they haven't provided this assurance in writing (i'm thinking of asking for this).but over the past year, i've noticed they are doing things that i suspect might be them getting ready to try to *discharge* mom from their facility once her private pay runs out -- even though they agreed to keep her. without getting into a lot of detail about what they are doing that has me thinking they are trying to *build a case to move her out* -- i'm wondering if others here have dealt with this and how did you handle it?i've read a few horror stories of *assisted living* facilities doing this by saying the patent fell -- discharging them to an er -- and then refusing to accept them back from the er saying they aren't equipped to handle a patient that has fall risk.but mom is not in an assisted living facility, she is in a full memory care facility with 24 hour nursing staffing. can a facility like this still try to play this game?my concern is that they wait until she transitions to medicaid -- then they try to force her out -- and then i'm stuck trying to find a place to move her that will accept 100% medicaid pay (because her private pay funds will be all gone at that point). with covid now a thing -- it feels like it could be a new tool for such homes to use to force somebody out? send them to the er, and then refuse to take them back...am i worrying too much about something that has a super low chance of happening?",Has anybody had a nursing home / memory care facility try to force out your relative after their private pay funds run out and they switch to medicaid? ...even though you met their guidelines when that relative was placed there?

"hello all,newbie here, and this is my story. i (25m) live with my grandmother (65f), who at the same time, is a parent to me as i have been living with her since birth. over the past five years or so, she has slowly been experiencing cognitive decline. her memory is foggy, she forgets where she places things, forgets what day/time/month/year it is (and is constantly asking me what day it is etc), and suffers from symptoms of paranoia regarding theft of possessions and things of that nature. the reason i am posting here is because, about a month ago, she remarked to me how she wanted to go see her sister (who, for context, lives 2000 miles away) and how we had already seen her that past weekend. when i told her that was not the case, she flipped and got argumentative with me, so i dropped it. i try to explain in succinct and helpful ways about things etc when she asks, but to no avail. most of our conversations either begin with her yelling at me, getting mad at me for being so ""abrasive"" towards her, or end with her telling me to shut the hell up (or bringing up past transgressions i have made against her in the past). it seems that she is extremely distrustful of me because of these past issues, and as a result, she seems to believe she is fine. however, i have talked with her sister, as well as her counselor and medication prescriber about these issues, and they agree that it is not a psychosis, but appears to be dementia. she also has trouble taking medication properly (she takes more than the prescribed amount and often runs out before she should).however, my grandmother firmly and adamantly believes that ""she is not that bad"" and that ""it's just adhd""... furthermore, a neurologist who she saw a few months ago suggested a neuropsychological examination to be done, both in order to determine what is going on, and also have a more broad picture of the underlying issues... i just do not know what to do anymore, and it's gotten to the point where her providers are asking me to look after everything for her. and remembering my own issues or appointments etc, on top of her stuff is becoming frustrating, unbearable, and exhausting... i do not have poa or anything of the sort, but her medication prescriber has mentioned to me that we should look into getting that set up.. i just don't know where to turn, what to do, or how to proceed because she fights me and her doctors at every fucking turn... because of this not knowing, i have begun to just give up on helping her and have developed an apathy towards her issues, but at the same time, i want to help her... i just don't know how... (to add, she is eligible for medicare in two months, but does not qualify for medicaid, so i don't know where i stand with long term care options, nor whether or not i can have her admitted locally for this issue if i am concerned for her safety since i don't have poa or anything)... any help?thanks",Needing advice please,0

"hi reddit. my mum is 53 years old and is overall in pretty good shape both mentally and physically, but there have been a couple of things i've noticed over the last month and a bit that have started to slightly worry me. the first thing is that she'll get confused in the middle of a conversation. for instance she'll forget what we're talking about or why we're talking about a certain subject ect. the other thing is that she'll ask me the exact same question within 1 or 2 hours. both of these things happen quite rarely (3 or 4 times within the last month), but it's still something that i've picked up on. it also might be worth noting that she had covid 6 or 7 weeks ago so she might have ""brain fuzz""? any thoughts and opinions are appreciated, thanks.",My mother potentially showing early signs of dementia?,0

"dear friends, recently - over the past two years or so - my mom and i started noticing some changes in my father's behavior. he sometimes forgets recent things - not obvious things like names or addresses, but more like details in a recent conversation, what he had for breakfast, who he was on phone with, etc. he also has a tendency to repeat things in the same conversation. mom and i were always worried that he would develop dementia (because his father and one older brother had it), so we got him to see a doctor as soon as these symptoms started showing. however, the doctor thinks his mri report was fine, and he made him take some informal memory and math tests which he passed easily. what's more, my father has always been a pretty forgetful (and repetitive) person, so we're not sure if this spike in forgetfulness is indicative of dementia, or just a quarantine side-effect.one thing i also notice is, his forgetfulness is kind of context-specific - like he would only forget details related to certain things, and only when he's dealing with certain people (e.g. he tends to forget more when he's communicating with my mom, compared to anyone else). i don't know what to make of it, but i've heard the first symptoms of dementia are only apparent to the primary caregiver (my mom in this case, i live abroad).i guess my primary question is, assuming the worst (early dementia) - what can we do to make his situation better (or at least, prevent it from getting worse)? i've browsed some of the material posted on the resources section of this subreddit, but they largely seem to cater to later stages in dementia, while our confusion is about the diagnosis itself.thanks in advance for any and all help! feel free to direct me to other resources/forums/experts to e-mail.",I'm not sure if my dad has dementia,0

"a few months ago i went to visit my grandmother in the nursing home she resides. when i arrived she was having an episode where she was severely stressed (partly because of her low blood sugar).this has left quite an imprint of fear in my head and the following weeks i found myself completely losing joy from what was still keeping me occupied and under constant worry/fear that i might be getting dementia too. and of course i was seeing signs of dementia in everything around me too: from news articles to conversations with my parents. because i‚Äôm 29 i find it doubtful that this is the case but it has left a hyper attentive mark on me. i also brought it up during a visit to my gp, and he confirmed that it shouldn‚Äôt really be the case for me.for the past two months i‚Äôve been hyper aware of every small forgetful thing (ex: not knowing where i left my keys) or error in speech (ex: not remembering the dutch (my native tongue) word, but knowing the english word) i‚Äôve made. it cumulated to the point where i had to keep myself occupied with mindless gaming to prevent myself from thinking, was afraid to speak so i couldn't mispseak and panic attacks when i‚Äôm trying to sleep.last month i decided to go to a psychologist and while the panic attacks had stopped just two days before the appointment she did help to find solutions should they return and i feel future sessions will help.i have managed to somehow lower the amount of times i think about the potential of having dementia but the thoughts haven‚Äôt left me. i have tought of going to a hospital and having an examination done, but that creates more fear by thinking what if my fear gives me a false positive or what if i really am in the starting phases.as it stands right now i haven‚Äôt gone and visited my grandma in over a month. it‚Äôs killing me inside because i know she appreciates me visiting and spending time with her, and i do want to take whatever time i can still get with her. but at the same time i‚Äôm afraid that visiting her will return the panic attacks and make me even more hyper aware of flaws.is there anyone who has dealt with similar things and has managed to beat the fear?",M(29) fear of dementia,0
the neurologist says that federal medicare and a medigap plan is better than any of the commercial plans. most doctors dislike federal medicare because its slow to pay and the neurologist agreed...but...said federal medicare is better and faster coverage. many of us on this sub are caring for an elderly family member on medicare. the process of choosing an appropriate program is onerous. i've even busted an insurance broker selling us a plan that in the fine print excludes dementia symptoms. every state is different. any good suggestions for florida?,Medicare and Dementia Coverage in Florida,0

"we moved my grandma into assisted living on july 5. her entire circle of family, friends, and doctors believed she would thrive in that setting.fast forward a month later and my grandma is doing miserably. her mind seems to have been broken by the move.the first day she moved in, she was aware it was assisted living. the second day, she started believing she was living in a shoe store in the mall.her number one request prior to moving was that she could bring her dog with her. we moved her dog out a week ago and she hasn't even noticed.i was her main caregiver for nearly 4 years and she doesn't recognize me most of the time.she started wandering the halls and getting lost. she made her way downstairs twice and started yelling she was being held hostage in the mall. it's just been bad. very bad.there was a plan in place to get her into a routine this week that included day visits to memory care. she has always thrived on a routine. if she didn't adjust, the community would recommend we move her into memory care.unfortunately, the plan has been derailed by 2 hospital stays. she fell yesterday and was transported to the hospital because she sounded like she was slurring. she was checked out, deemed fine, sent back to the community where she immediately fell again and hit her head and is now under 72 hour watch in the hospital.my dad and i have a meeting with the community today to secure a room in memory care for her to move into as soon as she is discharged from the hospital.my question is: will memory care be appropriate, or are there other options we should be looking into? we just want her to be safe.",Will Memory Care be enough or are there other options we should look into?,0
"on monday we are visiting a memory care facility for my mother-in-law. what questions should we ask to make sure we find a decent place for her?she‚Äôs 67 years old and was diagnosed last year. she saw a specialist last week for the first time and he confirmed that while she may have dementia, she has been suffering mini-strokes that have been slowly killing her brain. the result is symptoms that are basically identical to dementia. my husband said the person he spoke with said medicaid would only cover the total cost if she has less than $2k to her name. she currently has about $80k from her various pensions and savings over the years, and they said she could pay with her money (supplemented partially by medicaid) until she‚Äôs down to her last $2k and then let medicaid take over from there. we have no expectation of receiving any inheritance from her - we just want her to be someplace close to us so we can visit her for whatever time she has left. does this sound standard/ advantageous? what other questions should we be asking about finances/ quality of care/ etc.?thanks!",Memory Care Facility Questions,0

"hey everyone, first time poster here. my mom (78) was diagnosed with parkinson's about 8 years ago. the initial decline was very slow and gradual, but in the past year her cognitive decline has really picked up into full-on dementia. lots of describing things that aren't there, thinking she needs to go places, thinking she has missed appointments and events, not remembering who some people are, dates/timelines all over the place, etc.we've stretched out living at home as long as possible by adding safety measures but lately she has been more physically active than ever (thanks to a medication adjustment), however she is very unsteady on her feet and frequently forgets her cane or walker, so it's only a matter of time before she seriously hurts herself in a fall. i live a day's drive away but my dad and sister that live with her are taking her on a tour of a brand new memory care facility, where she and my dad will presumably move in shortly. \[side note: dad's also 78, 100% mentally there, but overweight and aging, so he can't keep up with mom's care, especially waking up 2-3 times a night for bathroom visits.\]now that this is all in motion, it's a little overwhelming for dad and us kids, but we're committed to keeping mom safe and as happy as possible as her decline continues. the move itself is going to be jarring i'm sure - my parents have been in the same house for over 40 years.i don't really have any super specific questions, but i am wondering for those of you that have gone through something similar with a loved one, what advice do you have for me, both short and long term? also, this is particularly difficult for my dad, who has always been a keep-his-feelings-to-himself kind of guy, but mom is his everything, and he is showing clear signs of depression. what should i be doing to support him as well? i appreciate any thoughts or advice you can offer.",Time has come to move mom to assisted living - looking for what to expect/prepare for,0

"so i have been a professional care giver for about five years now. i have worked with various disabilities both physical and intellectual, terminal diseases, brain injuries, dementia. i also have worked with people of all ages from children to geriatrics. i now currently work with three men in their 20s who all have disabilities.after reading about me before you, i'm very uncomfortable about how much people are taking to this story. i find it very disturbing that any hired caregiver would start a romantic relationship with the individual he/she is working with. not only does the person she works with have a disability, but also is battling depression and has attempted suicide. to me, this would be the same as starting a romantic relationship with a person in a psych facility for suicidal ideation. being a caregiver who mainly works with the male population i pray that the family members do not compare this character to me. i take my job very seriously and i do care about the guys i work with, however i would never push those boundaries. also for any of those familiar with the story, is lou hired help from a home health care service? how is she not concerned about losing any licenses or certifications for sexual abuse? i'm very concerned about the effect a movie like this is going to cause and i am interested to see if anyone else feels the same way.",What are your thoughts on Me Before You,0

"x-postso this is a really long story, but the short version is i moved into an apartment in january and the situation with the landlord went south real quick. turns out she's senile and/or in the developing stages of dementia/alzheimer's and she's literally impossible to deal with. so after a few months of living in constant fear of being seen coming and going (she lives next door...) and sparking a confrontation that inevitably led to police coming and the entire neighborhood coming out to watch the fireworks, shit hit the fan in a big way this past monday and we bailed.so i leave work early and get to the apartment and the situation escalated from an 8 to about 100 as soon as her and her (equally out-of-her-mind) daughter see me. they call the police, say that nobody gets to take any of their stuff unless i leave (the reason why they hate me is the long part of the story) so out of deference to my friends i bail. i was told to come back and get my stuff when everybody else was done, so i enlisted a few friends and we did just that. when we were about to leave the situation went sour, police were called, i was bit twice, punched probably 20+ times by this little old lady. it was ugly. the police, obviously tired of having to deal with this crazy old woman and her bullshit, picked that exact moment to become ambivalent towards the whole situation. i was forced to take all of my property, put it back in the house, and was told that if i wanted it i'd ""just have to take her to court."" i've since been back to the police office twice and am met with at best indifference, but more commonly outright hostility at the nerve i have coming in there and thinking that i have a right to my own property. so obviously the police have no interest in helping me, and if i actually have to take my landlord to court to get my stuff back it's going to end up in a landfill before i ever see any of it again. most of it i couldn't care less about, all of my clothes have been at my girlfriend's for a while but there is some stuff with a lot of sentimental value attached to it that i'll never be able to replace and that's the stuff i really care about.reddit, what do i do?","Landlord is holding my property hostage, police couldn't care less.

"so i replied with something similar to this in another thread on this sub but i wanted to hear if anyone else has had different results. my mother (80) passed last year from cancer. before she did, she was pretty much incapacitated from a hip replacement due to a fracture in cancer riddled bone. she was a very difficult individual all of her life and became much more so with illness. no dementia so no way to have her declared incompetent. however, she essentially refused all outside help and was demanding round the clock care to the point that my father and i didn't get more than 2 hours of sleep at a time for nearly two months outside of those times she was hospitalized.we were at the end of our ropes and truly unable to safely take care of everything she needed by the end. each time she was at the hospital we would communicate this to the doctors and social workers. and each time they sent her home anyway with nothing more than a list of services to call despite us explaining that she wouldn't accept the outside help. we tried hiring people and refusing to do all of the care while that person was available but mom would scream and refuse help form them to the point that they all felt they had to immediately hit for liability reasons.we tried eps who again just gave us lists and also pretty much said that as long as she was in the house we had to care for her if we couldn't keep other caregivers there. not that we wouldn't have cared for her just that we were trying to see if there was a way to force her to accept even a modicum of outside assistance before one or both of us had a psychotic break due to stress and sleep deprivation. the answer is that there is no way unless they are declared incompetent.the point is, pretty much every post suggests handling a difficult elder by telling the doctors, social workers or eps that they aren't safe at home like that is some magic bullet that will fix things and it's not. the hospital is not going to keep them more than a few days extra, they are not going to force them into rehab or care, and they are going to expect anyone that is resident in the same house to see to it that care is provided no matter what the situation.","""The home situation is not safe"" advice is NOT a magic bullet",0

"i'm looking for advice regarding my father in memory care. he has parkinson's and advanced dementia. the issue is that gets up in the middle of night and falls. so far he hasn't done anything worse than bruises and scrapes. this is now happening almost on a weekly basis. his dementia is such that no matter how much we tell him not to get up, he can't remember to stop doing it.the facility has a policy of calling emergency personnel every time there's an unsupervised fall. he's usually taken to the er. this is very traumatic for him, because he doesn't know what's going on - to the extent that he gets into physical altercations with the emts. (he also got covid, which could easily have happened on one of these occasions - there was no outbreak in his memory care).we've hired a hospice care service that has nurses who can come out and check his condition after one of these falls. we'd like the facility to call them first, unless he obviously has a broken bone or other evident serious injury. they refuse to do it, even if we sign a care directive instructing them to. i understand their desire to avoid liability, but i feel that if we sign a directive they should be able to get past that.any advice?",Unnecessary 911 calls in memory care,0

"hi all, i feel this inident i saw today is similar to what some of us post about as far as older folks rambling/not being aware, etc.i was at the er vet with my cat today and an older man was there with his pet. in the waiting room he was loud and would go over and talk to anyone who would listen and even when they stopped listening he would keep going on and on or find someone else to sit near. when a nurse came to take notes on what was going on w/ my cat (which is pretty serious situation honestly), he kept interjecting about irrelevant things. the nurse kind of ignored it but i politely but firmly told him that it was my turn to speak to the staff and that he would get his own time. he did stop but honestly he had already talked through he entire summary of what was going on with my cat by then, distracting me to the point that i forgot to hand them medicine to administer to her, which i realized later. so they take my cat back to the exam room and he starts up w/ me again so honestly i started ignoring him and moved my bags and laptop to another part of the room. he in turn found someone else to talk to and had the ear of a woman in her late 60s, seemed like, who had all of her faculties and was she was kinda replying to him occasionally. when she leaves to wait in the parking lot with her husband (one pet parent is allowed in at a time), he starts telling techs and front desk ppl how other vet offices are nasty and hang up the phone on him, and how he wants to ""picket"" another vets office. he complains about the price and says ""i don't want to spend too much money on this cat,"" etc. he was so repetitive and loud, honestly the staff were saints with him and even then, at a certain point they cut him off, told him they had to get to other patients and to have a good night.the lady who had gone to wait with her husband came back in, retrieved her dog and went to the front to pay. she said to them that she felt bad for him, that he seemed lonely and didn't seem to realize how he sounded to others and how repetitive he was.i couldn't tell if this was dementia or a pre-existing personality issue or not, or both but it was sad and i felt kind of bad for being semi-annoyed but also irked that someone like that would say they're going to picket a veterinarian for what was likely no reason except a price he disagree with, and to disrespect people's time with vet techs. does anyone have any opinions on what might've been going on w/ this guy?",i saw something sad/frustrating today :/ felt I could come here to talk about it,0

"for the past few years, my family has been struggling quite a lot with my grandmother, who has alzheimer's. among all of the problems we have had to go through, there is just one for which i can't see the solution. whenever my grandmother goes outside, especially in the spring and summer months, she walks around the neighbourhood. this would be totally okay, if not for the fact that she would also pick the flowers out of our neighbours' yards. the worst part of it is the fact that the neighbours have come to us, telling us about the meaning that went into the flowers that she consistently picks and ruins. the flowers that she picks are being grown for a specific person who isn't doing well health-wise. not only that, but she also picks flowers that they're currently growing for a competition, and it just so happens that these flowers are quite hard to grow. so clearly, i understand that they have the right to be angry and frustrated with my family. however, i found myself in an ethical dilemma: where on one hand, someone's meaningful flowers are being taken, but on the other hand, the other choice is confining her inside, effectively putting her under house arrest.she is in the moderate stages of alzheimer's right now, still generally able-bodied, so she refuses to go to a nursing home, where she can be taken care of. whichever way i seem to look, there's no solution and it's putting an immense amount of stress on myself and my family. could anybody help offer a solution?",Help!

(my mom could be exaggerating though) i don't know why he's worried, since it's my 4th year, and he wasn't overly concerned when i left for 1st year. i also recently started my nursing school pre-consolidation that has 12-hour shifts, but i worked 8-hour shifts this summer, and again, he wasn't all that concerned then either? if anyone has any ideas of why he's so worried, and what might help, i'm all ears! would email-ing my parent's throughout the day help?

"incontinence is starting. last time, a few weeks ago, she realized that she peed herself. this time it didn't register. i know it will get worse. what is your experience with depends? how may changes a day? any tips? i am thinking i'll need some kind of couch and chair covers as well.",Experience with Depends?,0
"dad with signs of dementia wakes up and open my room and mom's door. we have no key and we live in a small house so there is nothing we can do, he have an appointment with a doctor in october :/ and it is worsening so quick he just slep 1 hour at night and i will stay awake till he decide to sleep. he uses to wake up each 2 or 3 hours to go to the wc but now he just join out bedroom saying things about his work( he has been retired for 10+years), in the day all he wants is to leave the house. what can we do? the last time he slept was in the morning, he didn't even had a nap",Dad with dementia,0
"hello lovely people all around the planet.my mother has an emergency button on here wrist, for emergencies, like falling or going to the toilet, which rings my mobile.she utilizes it 1-3 times a night, half the time it's a toilet call, the other half she's afraid of something and just wants to talk or wants to get up at 2:00 am.she's not sleeping well, even when i put her to bed late and have a toilet session before getting to bed.after the last accident (broken hip) she was on strong medication (tilidin, tramal and some other opiate stuff) and she was sleeping all the time, often also during the day. at that time she was incontinent and urinating into her diaper most of the time.to be honest, i begin to miss these days, as as of now i cannot sleep anymore and with work having started again, after 3 months, i'm at my breaking point. i cannot do this anymore. i'm done. i want to crawl under a rock and just sleep. then i realize, it's not possible.my mother is not ready for a nursing home, she knows exactly what is happening in the moment when something is happening, but she is mixing everything up and forgetting most of the stuff after few minutes, but she remembers if she gets reminded.i'm pretty sure she will be sedated, put into a diaper and left alone in a bed for most of the time. actually this sounds like something what i'm thinking of, kind of, except for the most of the time part:(what solutions have you found for a peaceful night, for you and the person you take care of? medication? something less aggressive than the stuff mentioned above? i cannot think of another solution.i will probably talk to the doctor on monday about it.",How do you handle the nights? *mild rant*,0
"i learnt 3 years ago that my mom would pop xanax every morning for the last 20 years. this shocked me and i asked her to stop. she has tapered off and now stopped. i have noticed that her mental state has worsened ever since. is this due to lack of dopamine that xanax used to provide to her for decades? which doctor should i consult regarding this because she is undiagnosed but her symptoms will manifest more strongly within a couple of years requiring an official diagnosis. i strongly suspect dementia since her personality has faded away and she only responds on surface level, and is recently forgetting things.","My mom stopped xanax, good idea?",0
"this morning he woke up and set off the alarm at 4:50am. i contemplated whether or not to give him his breakfast/medicine, but concluded it was too early and told him to go to bed since it was too early. he understood.we try and give him his medicine doses 8 hrs apart as prescribed. usually, the earliest i feel like he wakes up is like 6ish/6:30, but other times he‚Äôll wake up at 8/9am. i didn‚Äôt want to give him breakfast/medicine now since that would mean i‚Äôd give him his lunch at like 8/9am. i feel a little bad for telling him to go back to bed. i‚Äôm not trained in taking care of someone with dementia. was this the right thing to do or should i have just gone ahead and made him his breakfast/ gave him his medicine?",Is it okay that I told my grandpa (who has dementia) to go back to bed) when he woke up too early?,0

so I've been caring for my grandmother with alzheimer's for some time and so far she has slowly gotten worse. since caring for her she has always had issues with certain food textures and frequently spits out her food and hates most things ( except sweets lol). I've just learned to ignore it and let it be.today i served her chicken noodle soup and for the first time she said it was too hard and couldn't swallow it. i found this odd considering she loves peanuts and eats them regularly as a snack. so i pureed her food and she ate some more thankfully. my concern is her comment about not being able to swallow and if this is a sign of disease progression or just her way of saying she doesn't like the food. going forward i guess i should just puree everything? i know that eventually she will not be able to swallow foods but i expected it to start popping up much later.,Food issues,0
"today my mom had two tantrums when i attempted to discuss the idea of a caregiver/companion to her - my dad is her main caregiver, and he is exhausted and desperately needs some respite. i don‚Äôt live in their area, so i can only visit from time to time. at one point when my mom was screaming at me that ‚Äúi‚Äôm not going to have some woman coming into this house to take care of me‚Äù, i was like, ‚Äúokay, well, how about a guy instead?‚Äù üòÇüòÇ sadly that did not go down well with my mom, but i found it funny, and it provided a little levity in an otherwise very stressful day.",A little humor amidst all the stress and difficulty.,0
"yesterday, i traveled 600km to support my grandma, because my uncle (her son) died 3 weeks ago to a liver cirrhosis. now, my grandma has had dementia symptoms for years, but this is probably the last straw (and i get it, losing your own son is tragic)because she has advanced to a stage of having hallucinations and now i think that she has delusions too and i don't know what to do.so, i was just sitting in her living room, when she was like look there's a bus and it's full of people. yes there was a bus, but there was no one there. it was empty. and that there's bees. none. there was none.then i got kind of scared and panicked, and just answered 'okay...""and my cheeks got flushed because of how scared i was and she came and hugged me, and suddenly was like ""you have very high fever! go rest you're so hot"" and i can assure you, i'm fine. i have nothing wrong with me. but she insisted to the point of yelling, so i got scared and fled to another room (the room i sleep in) and pretended i was sleep.what should i do? i do not have anywhere else to go, and i can't leave before monday evening because of train schedules...",Visit at my Grandmother,0
"i (19f) have been with my boyfriend (18m) for two years now and i‚Äôve seen his mother (50f) slowly progress from being a talkative, outgoing, elated woman to someone who struggles to get out of bed in the morning, is in a constant state of depression, and gets lost going to places she once drove to every day. she is taking medication for depression, anxiety, as well as memory loss, but it seems like her condition is worsening very quickly. they live far away from the city, so it‚Äôs difficult for her to get any interaction outside of phone calls with her sister and the chats i have with her every now and then. i‚Äôm very worried about her, i worry she‚Äôll get hurt or they will have to leave the house (in the middle of a nasty divorce and she has very little money), i worry when i see her sitting alone all day doing nothing but look out the window or watch tv. it‚Äôs incredibly heart breaking and i don‚Äôt know what to do.i also worry for my boyfriend who i love very very much. he has pretty bad anxiety, and his mother‚Äôs state has taken a very large toll on his mental health. he‚Äôs often annoyed and frustrated when he has to talk about her or to her when she can‚Äôt remember things. i try to talk with him about seeing a counsellor who will be able to help him cope and who can help him better than i can, but he becomes very angry at the mention of a therapist.we‚Äôve talked about going with her to a neurologist to figure out our next steps, or checking out her medication to figure out if something is wrong there, but i always feel like i‚Äôm over-stepping my boundary. i don‚Äôt know what to do. tl;dr: how can i support my boyfriend and his mother who has early onset alzheimer‚Äôs?",Boyfriend‚Äôs Mom has Early-Onset Alzheimer‚Äôs (Please Help),0
"my mom has shown signs of declining memory and cognitive function for the past 2-3 years. she is under 65 and due to covid it's taken some time for my mom to be able to see her doctor with my dad present at the appointment to advocate for her.she finally did an assessment recently and couldn't remember things like her birth date and simple directions (she can no longer drive). i'm honestly devastated, but glad at least now she's getting medical help. she's able to have conversations if you're patient, but has trouble communicating needs (like needing to use the washroom) and sometimes forgets what we are doing (like when we went shopping for her dress).i love my mom and want to include her as much as possible in the wedding, without causing undue stress. so far, we've eliminated the parent speeches, and my dad will be with her all night. i'm planning to invite her to get ready with me, but thinking i'll opt to send the bridesmaids out for lunch so it's just the two of us for the last hour of hair and makeup.is there anything else i should be considering? i'm a little worried the mingling with family aspect of the wedding will also stress her out, but i'm not sure how to mitigate that.",Mom with early dementia at my wedding,0

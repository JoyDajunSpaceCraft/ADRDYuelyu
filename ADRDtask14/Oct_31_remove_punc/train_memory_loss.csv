"hey all.my grandma has just received the diagnosis of alzheimer's disease and my whole family is confused about the best approach. we will obviously be speaking with all the medical professionals we can, but because it's the christmas period we haven't gotten much yet and wondered if you could help get my mind a bit clearer?my grandma doesn't know she has alzheimer's, my aunt was told while she wasn't in the room. she knows that she had scans, knows that her medications are going to change, and knows we're all worried about her but she has no idea about her official diagnosis. my grandad (she is his carer) and aunt don't want my grandma to know, because they're scared at her response. her mental health in general isn't great and her main alzheimer's symptom is paranoia and loss of emotional control.i don't feel like this is fair and will just end up creating more dangerous situations in the future. as she deteriorates she's likely to get more confused and surely having time to come to terms with the future before this happens is better? all i'm imagining is periods of lucidity being filled with ""what is wrong with me""what is your experience of this stage? was the person aware of their diagnosis? any general tips for dealing with this to make her life/our lives easier?thanks!","New diagnosis, what is best?",1,hey all my grandma received diagnosis alzheimer s disease whole family confused best approach obviously speaking medical professionals s christmas period n t gotten much yet wondered could help get mind bit clearer grandma n t know alzheimer s aunt told n t room knows scans knows medications going change knows re worried idea official diagnosis grandad carer aunt n t want grandma know re scared response mental health general n t great main alzheimer s symptom paranoia loss emotional control i n t feel like fair end creating dangerous situations future deteriorates s likely get confused surely time come terms future happens better m imagining periods lucidity filled wrong experience stage person aware diagnosis general tips dealing make life our lives easier thanks New diagnosis best

"hi all. i've got grandparents living in florida in their own house (ie not any kind of assisted living community) and i just found out today that my grandmother has been diagnosed with alzheimer's. i'll give some quick context to our situation and would love to hear the thoughts/advice of this community.even getting to this point has been difficult -- my grandmother is extremely stubborn and independent, so while we were aware she had been slowly losing her faculties for some time, it took a concerted effort to get to the point of a diagnosis because of a combination of her own stubbornness and her long-time doctor's complacency. my grandfather is still sharp as a tack but wheelchair bound, so he is not in a position to care for both of them.it's clear they need to have more around-the-clock care, but the problem is that my grandmother will never agree to that. she insists there is nothing wrong (i could get into all the examples of how that is not true, but just trust me when i say she needs better help). the problem is she still has some level of lucidity, so we can't force her to do things she doesn't want to do (keep appointments, etc). it is important to mention that most of the family lives in pa, so while we've been trying to help care for things, it's simply not going to be possible for us to give her the level of care she needs. one of my uncles lives close by there and visits often, but he is simply wholly unprepared to deal with how complex the situation has become. obviously i don't think the right thing to do is to wait until she has an accident or hurts my grandfather to take more decisive action. what should we do in this 'in-between' period where she is lucid enough to have her own agency, but will inevitably be in a potentially dangerous situation soon? are there resources we can work with?thanks for reading and appreciate any guidance in advance.",New to Alzheimer's and looking for guidance,1,hi ve got grandparents living florida house ie kind assisted living community found today grandmother diagnosed alzheimer s ll give quick context situation would love hear thoughts advice community even getting point difficult grandmother extremely stubborn independent aware slowly losing faculties time took concerted effort get point diagnosis combination stubbornness long time doctor s complacency grandfather still sharp tack wheelchair bound position care them it s clear need around the clock care problem grandmother never agree insists nothing wrong could get examples true trust say needs better help problem still level lucidity ca n t force things n t want keep appointments etc important mention family lives pa ve trying help care things s simply going possible us give level care needs one uncles lives close visits often simply wholly unprepared deal complex situation become obviously n t think right thing wait accident hurts grandfather take decisive action in between period lucid enough agency inevitably potentially dangerous situation soon resources work thanks reading appreciate guidance advance New Alzheimer s looking guidance

"okay so my grandma married her husband who was a resident of canada and now he's a citizen here in the united states, he has dual citizenship. over the past year and a half my grandma has noticed that he's been getting confused and forgetful more and more and when they go to the doctor he won't allow her into the doctor's room with him and he won't tell her any information. she called his doctor's office on the sly and told them about some of his forgetfulness and confusion problems that he'd been having recently and they called my grandpa and scheduled an appointment for him to come in and take a cognitive test. he failed the cognitive test and they wanted to do a cat scan on him. he told my grandma this information and he had scheduled with them to have the scan done and then the next day he was telling her when she mentioned it that he didn't schedule that and he will never take it that he's just getting old. she sent me some recordings of him talking to his primary care doctor he was trying to cancel his scam permanently with her and she was trying to explain to him that he was confused and he just is not accepting of it. the next day he decided he was going to the cat scan and got ready to go and they went and he got the scan done so now the forgetfulness is happening within a very short time and yesterday she said that he didn't recognize her for a minute . he is 84 years old and very stubborn and setting his ways he's always right he won't accept any help from anyone with anything and now that he's going through this it's very difficult for my grandma. so the issue we are having is that he won't allow her into the doctor's office and he won't allow the doctors to give her any information about what's going on with him is there anyone that's been through the same situation that knows how to go about making the doctors allow her to come in the room anyway even if he says no or at least giving her the information so that she can properly care for him or get him medication that he may need? i don't know how if someone passed a cognitive test they would still allow you to be able to drive a car and he's now talking about going and buying a car and sometimes he'll just go and take the car and drive himself somewhere and get lost it's not safe but he refuses to have any help we're telling anyone what's wrong. she is supposed to find out what happened with the brain scan on monday.",Help me and my Grandma!,1,okay grandma married husband resident canada s citizen united states dual citizenship past year half grandma noticed s getting confused forgetful go doctor wo n t allow doctor s room wo n t tell information called doctor s office sly told forgetfulness confusion problems d recently called grandpa scheduled appointment come take cognitive test failed cognitive test wanted cat scan told grandma information scheduled scan done next day telling mentioned n t schedule never take s getting old sent recordings talking primary care doctor trying cancel scam permanently trying explain confused accepting next day decided going cat scan got ready go went got scan done forgetfulness happening within short time yesterday said n t recognize minute  84 years old stubborn setting ways s always right wo n t accept help anyone anything s going s difficult grandma issue wo n t allow doctor s office wo n t allow doctors give information s going anyone s situation knows go making doctors allow come room anyway even says least giving information properly care get medication may need n t know someone passed cognitive test would still allow able drive car s talking going buying car sometimes ll go take car drive somewhere get lost s safe refuses help re telling anyone s wrong supposed find happened brain scan monday Help Grandma

"rather complicated scenario but my sister placed our mother in a nursing home / memory care facility a few years ago as mom came down with alzheimers. sis &amp; mom where much closer than mom &amp; i and so sis did all of the work since mom was more comfortable handing over poa to her, they lived in the same city, etc. everything was going fine, but then sis died (cancer) two years ago and so i've assumed all of the work she was doing -- poa, etc., though i live in a city 4 hours away from where mom lives in the nursing home. the deal this facility made with my sister was that if we ""private pay"" for at least two years, then once the ""private pay"" funds are all exhausted they will accept medicaid to cover her expenses there.they've repeated this to me and so far i've accepted it -- though they haven't provided this assurance in writing (i'm thinking of asking for this).but over the past year, i've noticed they are doing things that i suspect might be them getting ready to try to *discharge* mom from their facility once her private pay runs out -- even though they agreed to keep her. without getting into a lot of detail about what they are doing that has me thinking they are trying to *build a case to move her out* -- i'm wondering if others here have dealt with this and how did you handle it?i've read a few horror stories of *assisted living* facilities doing this by saying the patent fell -- discharging them to an er -- and then refusing to accept them back from the er saying they aren't equipped to handle a patient that has fall risk.but mom is not in an assisted living facility, she is in a full memory care facility with 24 hour nursing staffing. can a facility like this still try to play this game?my concern is that they wait until she transitions to medicaid -- then they try to force her out -- and then i'm stuck trying to find a place to move her that will accept 100% medicaid pay (because her private pay funds will be all gone at that point). with covid now a thing -- it feels like it could be a new tool for such homes to use to force somebody out? send them to the er, and then refuse to take them back...am i worrying too much about something that has a super low chance of happening?",Has anybody had a nursing home / memory care facility try to force out your relative after their private pay funds run out and they switch to medicaid? ...even though you met their guidelines when that relative was placed there?

"hello all,newbie here, and this is my story. i (25m) live with my grandmother (65f), who at the same time, is a parent to me as i have been living with her since birth. over the past five years or so, she has slowly been experiencing cognitive decline. her memory is foggy, she forgets where she places things, forgets what day/time/month/year it is (and is constantly asking me what day it is etc), and suffers from symptoms of paranoia regarding theft of possessions and things of that nature. the reason i am posting here is because, about a month ago, she remarked to me how she wanted to go see her sister (who, for context, lives 2000 miles away) and how we had already seen her that past weekend. when i told her that was not the case, she flipped and got argumentative with me, so i dropped it. i try to explain in succinct and helpful ways about things etc when she asks, but to no avail. most of our conversations either begin with her yelling at me, getting mad at me for being so ""abrasive"" towards her, or end with her telling me to shut the hell up (or bringing up past transgressions i have made against her in the past). it seems that she is extremely distrustful of me because of these past issues, and as a result, she seems to believe she is fine. however, i have talked with her sister, as well as her counselor and medication prescriber about these issues, and they agree that it is not a psychosis, but appears to be dementia. she also has trouble taking medication properly (she takes more than the prescribed amount and often runs out before she should).however, my grandmother firmly and adamantly believes that ""she is not that bad"" and that ""it's just adhd""... furthermore, a neurologist who she saw a few months ago suggested a neuropsychological examination to be done, both in order to determine what is going on, and also have a more broad picture of the underlying issues... i just do not know what to do anymore, and it's gotten to the point where her providers are asking me to look after everything for her. and remembering my own issues or appointments etc, on top of her stuff is becoming frustrating, unbearable, and exhausting... i do not have poa or anything of the sort, but her medication prescriber has mentioned to me that we should look into getting that set up.. i just don't know where to turn, what to do, or how to proceed because she fights me and her doctors at every fucking turn... because of this not knowing, i have begun to just give up on helping her and have developed an apathy towards her issues, but at the same time, i want to help her... i just don't know how...

"dear friends, recently - over the past two years or so - my mom and i started noticing some changes in my father's behavior. he sometimes forgets recent things - not obvious things like names or addresses, but more like details in a recent conversation, what he had for breakfast, who he was on phone with, etc. he also has a tendency to repeat things in the same conversation. mom and i were always worried that he would develop dementia (because his father and one older brother had it), so we got him to see a doctor as soon as these symptoms started showing. however, the doctor thinks his mri report was fine, and he made him take some informal memory and math tests which he passed easily. what's more, my father has always been a pretty forgetful (and repetitive) person, so we're not sure if this spike in forgetfulness is indicative of dementia, or just a quarantine side-effect.one thing i also notice is, his forgetfulness is kind of context-specific - like he would only forget details related to certain things, and only when he's dealing with certain people (e.g. he tends to forget more when he's communicating with my mom, compared to anyone else). i don't know what to make of it, but i've heard the first symptoms of dementia are only apparent to the primary caregiver (my mom in this case, i live abroad).i guess my primary question is, assuming the worst (early dementia) - what can we do to make his situation better (or at least, prevent it from getting worse)? i've browsed some of the material posted on the resources section of this subreddit, but they largely seem to cater to later stages in dementia, while our confusion is about the diagnosis itself.thanks in advance for any and all help! feel free to direct me to other resources/forums/experts to e-mail.",I'm not sure if my dad has dementia,0,dear friends recently past two years mom started noticing changes father s behavior sometimes forgets recent things obvious things like names addresses like details recent conversation breakfast phone etc also tendency repeat things conversation mom always worried would develop dementia father one older brother got see doctor soon symptoms started showing however doctor thinks mri report fine made take informal memory math tests passed easily s father always pretty forgetful repetitive person re sure spike forgetfulness indicative dementia quarantine side effect one thing also notice forgetfulness kind context specific like would forget details related certain things s dealing certain people e g tends forget s communicating mom compared anyone else n t know make ve heard first symptoms dementia apparent primary caregiver mom case live abroad i guess primary question assuming worst early dementia make situation better least prevent getting worse ve browsed material posted resources section subreddit largely seem cater later stages dementia confusion diagnosis itself thanks advance help feel free direct resources forums experts e mail m sure dad dementia

"i have been the caretaker for my 75 y.o. father in law who has progressing lbd. he fell and got a compound wedge fracture in his lower spine last year and has had his mobility limited at times.after he left the hospital and rehab facility earlier this year he was bed bound for about two months straight. he was urinating on himself, sun downing like crazy, taking his clothes off for no reason etc.. we thought he was not coming back at that point and it was heartbreaking, especially because of how quickly everything escalated and declined..out of nowhere he started getting out of bed on his own. it was terrifying at first because of the fall risk and confusion but he was actually better for a while. for about six months he was going to the bathroom on his own, coming out to watch tv, hang out with us, get his own drinks/snacks, and getting out of the house for outings (with the wheelchair)about eight weeks ago he went back to bed bound for no apparent reason besides his claim of severe back pain. he refuses to bathe so my husband and i have been the ones giving him sponge baths, changing his clothes and linens. so when he suddenly started complaining of this mystery pain, we thought he may have fell again and not told anyone, we were sure to check for any kind of bruising and there were none.long story short, his other son (pot) brought him to the hospital to  find the source  of the pain..three days later he was discharged and the only info that was given to us about pops  condition was he has degenerative bone disease and he is  failing to thrive  now the pot is awol and we don t have any answers.. last night he pooped into his hand and tried to hide it in his bed.i did some research on  failure to thrive in adults  and there is nothing conclusive with the info that we have but it seems like the prognosis is pretty grim.i have a feeling that the doctors said that because there is nothing else they can do and he just needs to be comfortable.. answers from the pot would be very helpful but i don t have that..does anyone have any experience with lbd and/or  failure to thrive in adults with dementia ? i know every experience is different but i am desperate for a grasp on what is going on, without any sugar coating..thank you so much for any response and hugs to this whole community!

"my fil was diagnosed with alcohol-induced dementia after going sober since around march of this year. i suspect there may've been subtle signs of it in a previous (unsuccessful) attempt at sobriety a few years ago, but it was a fairly brief time period, so he received no diagnosis back then. we (my so and i) have been through a whirlwind of a few months- fil had a couple stays in a behavioral unit before alcohol-induced dementia was diagnosed and since then he's been back once because of suicidal ideation and has also been diagnosed with several other major health conditions that are related to his alcohol and nicotine use. most recently, fil had a seizure (after a few days where he would barely speak to us) and was in the hospital in a sort of catatonic state for a couple weeks. since, he's been better and was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for physical and speech therapy. the facility recently had a positive covid case so we aren't able to visit fil in person, but fil is now present enough to call so a couple/several times a day and sounds astoundingly present. fil was able to point out a tiny correction that needed to be made in some paperwork were working on for the medicaid application that we would've never caught otherwise.i guess my question is - is this normal for this kind of dementia? if we don't have the medicaid app complete by the time he's released he'll be staying back with us and i know this is so hard to predict. but has anyone seen re-introduction to living with family as a positive this recently from a diagnosis for this kind of dementia? my fear is that when he was staying with us before, things always went downhill because we still have to be working full time, we can't engage with him 24/7. i know my so is getting optimistic that he'll be back to his old self soon, but i can't shake the fear that his current clarity is because he's in a place that can help and we can't rely on him staying as great as he is right now if he's back with us - where he can't get the attention and type of care he may need.","Alcohol-induced dementia, seeking advice",0,fil diagnosed alcohol induced dementia going sober since around march year suspect may ve subtle signs previous unsuccessful attempt sobriety years ago fairly brief time period received diagnosis back whirlwind months fil couple stays behavioral unit alcohol induced dementia diagnosed since s back suicidal ideation also diagnosed several major health conditions related alcohol nicotine use recently fil seizure days would barely speak us hospital sort catatonic state couple weeks since s better transferred rehabilitation facility physical speech therapy facility recently positive covid case n t able visit fil person fil present enough call couple several times day sounds astoundingly present fil able point tiny correction needed made paperwork working medicaid application would ve never caught otherwise i guess question normal kind dementia n t medicaid app complete time s released ll staying back us know hard predict anyone seen re introduction living family positive recently diagnosis kind dementia fear staying us things always went downhill still working full time ca n t engage 24 7 know getting optimistic ll back old self soon ca n t shake fear current clarity s place help ca n t rely staying great right s back us ca n t get attention type care may need Alcohol induced dementia seeking advice

i recently moved my family member into a independent living facility. they have a diagnosis of cognitive impairment and we re fully independent and living on their own before this move. the move however has taken a toll with the unfamiliar surroundings etc and thing have been very challenging. the problems have been augmented with the community banning family members from entering the facilities including the apartments. i have some services coming to their apartment but i know that if i was able to go in and help organize and orient them to the apartment this would all go or have gone much smoother. i ve spoken to the community administration and leadership and to my dismay they have been less than helpful. their best suggestion is that  these things just take time . it is very hard to just sit by and watch and wait while i can see a decline right before my eyes.is anybody else in this situation or have any suggestions? i think this would ve been easier without all the covid restrictions and at this point i really regret moving during this time (but it was inevitable and i thought the earlier the better).,Suggestions for a move into independent living,0,recently moved family member independent living facility diagnosis cognitive impairment we  re fully independent living move move however taken toll unfamiliar surroundings etc thing challenging problems augmented community banning family members entering facilities including apartments services coming apartment know able go help organize orient apartment would go gone much smoother i  ve spoken community administration leadership dismay less helpful best suggestion  these things take time   hard sit watch wait see decline right eyes is anybody else situation suggestions think would  ve easier without covid restrictions point really regret moving time inevitable thought earlier better Suggestions move independent living

"so i have been a professional care giver for about five years now. i have worked with various disabilities both physical and intellectual, terminal diseases, brain injuries, dementia. i also have worked with people of all ages from children to geriatrics. i now currently work with three men in their 20s who all have disabilities.after reading about me before you, i'm very uncomfortable about how much people are taking to this story. i find it very disturbing that any hired caregiver would start a romantic relationship with the individual he/she is working with. not only does the person she works with have a disability, but also is battling depression and has attempted suicide. to me, this would be the same as starting a romantic relationship with a person in a psych facility for suicidal ideation. being a caregiver who mainly works with the male population i pray that the family members do not compare this character to me. i take my job very seriously and i do care about the guys i work with, however i would never push those boundaries. also for any of those familiar with the story, is lou hired help from a home health care service? how is she not concerned about losing any licenses or certifications for sexual abuse? i'm very concerned about the effect a movie like this is going to cause and i am interested to see if anyone else feels the same way.",What are your thoughts on Me Before You,0,professional care giver five years worked various disabilities physical intellectual terminal diseases brain injuries dementia also worked people ages children geriatrics currently work three men 20s disabilities after reading m uncomfortable much people taking story find disturbing hired caregiver would start romantic relationship individual he she working person works disability also battling depression attempted suicide would starting romantic relationship person psych facility suicidal ideation caregiver mainly works male population pray family members compare character take job seriously care guys work however would never push boundaries also familiar story lou hired help home health care service concerned losing licenses certifications sexual abuse m concerned effect movie like going cause interested see anyone else feels way thoughts

"x-postso this is a really long story, but the short version is i moved into an apartment in january and the situation with the landlord went south real quick. turns out she's senile and/or in the developing stages of dementia/alzheimer's and she's literally impossible to deal with. so after a few months of living in constant fear of being seen coming and going (she lives next door...) and sparking a confrontation that inevitably led to police coming and the entire neighborhood coming out to watch the fireworks, shit hit the fan in a big way this past monday and we bailed.so i leave work early and get to the apartment and the situation escalated from an 8 to about 100 as soon as her and her (equally out-of-her-mind) daughter see me. they call the police, say that nobody gets to take any of their stuff unless i leave (the reason why they hate me is the long part of the story) so out of deference to my friends i bail. i was told to come back and get my stuff when everybody else was done, so i enlisted a few friends and we did just that. when we were about to leave the situation went sour, police were called, i was bit twice, punched probably 20+ times by this little old lady. it was ugly. the police, obviously tired of having to deal with this crazy old woman and her bullshit, picked that exact moment to become ambivalent towards the whole situation. i was forced to take all of my property, put it back in the house, and was told that if i wanted it i'd ""just have to take her to court."" i've since been back to the police office twice and am met with at best indifference, but more commonly outright hostility at the nerve i have coming in there and thinking that i have a right to my own property. so obviously the police have no interest in helping me, and if i actually have to take my landlord to court to get my stuff back it's going to end up in a landfill before i ever see any of it again. most of it i couldn't care less about, all of my clothes have been at my girlfriend's for a while but there is some stuff with a lot of sentimental value attached to it that i'll never be able to replace and that's the stuff i really care about.reddit, what do i do?","Landlord is holding my property hostage, police couldn't care less.

"so i replied with something similar to this in another thread on this sub but i wanted to hear if anyone else has had different results. my mother (80) passed last year from cancer. before she did, she was pretty much incapacitated from a hip replacement due to a fracture in cancer riddled bone. she was a very difficult individual all of her life and became much more so with illness. no dementia so no way to have her declared incompetent. however, she essentially refused all outside help and was demanding round the clock care to the point that my father and i didn't get more than 2 hours of sleep at a time for nearly two months outside of those times she was hospitalized.we were at the end of our ropes and truly unable to safely take care of everything she needed by the end. each time she was at the hospital we would communicate this to the doctors and social workers. and each time they sent her home anyway with nothing more than a list of services to call despite us explaining that she wouldn't accept the outside help. we tried hiring people and refusing to do all of the care while that person was available but mom would scream and refuse help form them to the point that they all felt they had to immediately hit for liability reasons.we tried eps who again just gave us lists and also pretty much said that as long as she was in the house we had to care for her if we couldn't keep other caregivers there. not that we wouldn't have cared for her just that we were trying to see if there was a way to force her to accept even a modicum of outside assistance before one or both of us had a psychotic break due to stress and sleep deprivation. the answer is that there is no way unless they are declared incompetent.the point is, pretty much every post suggests handling a difficult elder by telling the doctors, social workers or eps that they aren't safe at home like that is some magic bullet that will fix things and it's not. the hospital is not going to keep them more than a few days extra, they are not going to force them into rehab or care, and they are going to expect anyone that is resident in the same house to see to it that care is provided no matter what the situation.","""The home situation is not safe"" advice is NOT a magic bullet",0,replied something similar another thread sub wanted hear anyone else different results mother 80 passed last year cancer pretty much incapacitated hip replacement due fracture cancer riddled bone difficult individual life became much illness dementia way declared incompetent however essentially refused outside help demanding round clock care point father n t get 2 hours sleep time nearly two months outside times hospitalized we end ropes truly unable safely take care everything needed end time hospital would communicate doctors social workers time sent home anyway nothing list services call despite us explaining would n t accept outside help tried hiring people refusing care person available mom would scream refuse help form point felt immediately hit liability reasons we tried eps gave us lists also pretty much said long house care could n t keep caregivers would n t cared trying see way force accept even modicum outside assistance one us psychotic break due stress sleep deprivation answer way unless declared incompetent the point pretty much every post suggests handling difficult elder telling doctors social workers eps n t safe home like magic bullet fix things s hospital going keep days extra going force rehab care going expect anyone resident house see care provided matter situation home situation safe advice magic bullet

"hello everyone, this is going to be a bit of a write up so bear with me please.for the past year or so my grandmother has been exhibiting minor short term memory loss, it became noticeable because my mother and her were marathoning a t.v show together, after they finished watching the entire series my grandmother wanted to watch it again, and treated it as if she had never seen it before.long story short, her and my mother wound up re-watching the show continuously for the past year, my mother was bored out of her mind but my grandmother always acted like it was the first time she was seeing it.this, compounded by other minor signs of memory loss led my mother and my grandmothers sister to try and talk to her about it. in most instances, my grandmother reacted with anger (kind of a how dare you attitude) but after a little deliberation they finally convinced her to see a doctor.this is where things get kind of weird, even though my grandmother had been showing signs of short-term memory loss she was still highly functional, and capable of living on her own and generally taking care of herself. she went to her doctors appointment, and in the interview process alone the doctor determined that she probably was suffering from the early onset of dementia. but for my grandmother, it was like she completely lost all cognitive ability after this doctors appointment, in a matter of days she went from being mostly self-sufficient with short-term memory loss to not even knowing where she was, sometimes when she talks to me or my mother now, she ll pause and ask us if we re really there or if she is hallucinating.she gets these weird things in her head, and she ll make really weird statements like she told my mom  when i die just leave me here to rot, you don t need to go to the trouble of burying me  or she also once told my mom that her brother in law told her she was gonna die a long and painful death, because the drs would never give her pain medication, first of all this is completely imagined and fabricated within her mind, her brother-in-law would never tell her something like that, and when my mom explained to her that wouldn t happen and hospitals have medication they give people in their final days and moments she just became argumentative with my mom.she refuses to eat unless somebody s eating with her, and even then whoever s eating with her has to basically gorge themselves with food to get her to eat just a normal serving as she watched you like a hawk and only takes bites when you re cramming food down your throat.i don t know the full extent of things yet, but i know that she s become kind of aggressive and argumentative with my mom, this is very out of character for her as she has always been the sweetest person.i guess the thing that i m struggling with most right now, is that she had such a drastic change so quickly after being told that this is probably what it was. can dementia progress in a matter of days?

"my grandmother is 80 years old and lies in bed nearly all day. she only gets up to use the restroom or eat, but she forgets she has just eaten a snack and will get up soon after to make herself something else. during christmas she probably ate 15 cookies and my grandfather had to hide the rest of them. she is diabetic and has struggled with her weight my entire life, so i am concerned she is going to be further debilitated if this continues. her typical snacks are carbs. bread and butter, potato chips, cookies, crackers, and the likes. my grandfather can be very inflexible and has not done much to improve this problem, and my grandmother can be very defensive and rude when someone points out that she is overeating. i need to know if there are small things we could do to either curb her appetite or ensure that she is not overloading on junk food. have any of you experienced this or something similar as caregivers? what solutions would you suggest to protect my grandmother from her deteriorating memory?","My grandmother is living with dementia and often forgets she's just eaten.

"hey guys. i'm staying with my mom while my dad is in the hospital. i don't know how long he's gonna be in there but the doctors said anywhere from 3-7 days. when my dad is with my mom, she's totally fine, lucid, can do normal things, but you can tell there's something going on with her memory and if you ask her to recall things, you can tell she doesn't know how or remembers unless it's something from when we were kids or a long time ago.no one can have any visitors so her behaviors are that she'll fixate on my dad and when he can get out, why he's in there, why no one told her, but then we'll remind her and she remembers. though, there are times when she gets upset and she'll start crying just focusing on my dad being in the hospital and she thinks no one is telling her anything. sometimes things will upset her and we have to spent like 30-40 minutes just repeating the same shit to calm her down. for example, my dad called to complain last night before bed and mentioned something the doctor didn't do that upset him therefore it upset her, and so she was doing fine all day and then right before bed he upset her so it took forever to calm her down.i was wondering if you all had any links or resources on how to deal with the behavior and/or things to help calm her down, ways of talking to her, etc? my gf and i are taking care of her and i feel like what we're doing is good for the moment and calms her down, but i quickly realized that this is way harder than i thought it was going to be. we've been doing things that have helped like draw out calendars counting off days until he gets home or have learned when to tell her info and not tell her anything upsetting at all.",Resources for dealing with those who have memory loss/dementia?,1,"hey guys. i'm staying with my mom while my dad is in the hospital. i don't know how long he's gonna be in there but the doctors said anywhere from 3-7 days. when my dad is with my mom, she's totally fine, lucid, can do normal things, but you can tell there's something going on with her memory and if you ask her to recall things, you can tell she doesn't know how or remembers unless it's something from when we were kids or a long time ago.no one can have any visitors so her behaviors are that she'll fixate on my dad and when he can get out, why he's in there, why no one told her, but then we'll remind her and she remembers. though, there are times when she gets upset and she'll start crying just focusing on my dad being in the hospital and she thinks no one is telling her anything. sometimes things will upset her and we have to spent like 30-40 minutes just repeating the same shit to calm her down. for example, my dad called to complain last night before bed and mentioned something the doctor didn't do that upset him therefore it upset her, and so she was doing fine all day and then right before bed he upset her so it took forever to calm her down.i was wondering if you all had any links or resources on how to deal with the behavior and/or things to help calm her down, ways of talking to her, etc? my gf and i are taking care of her and i feel like what we're doing is good for the moment and calms her down, but i quickly realized that this is way harder than i thought it was going to be. we've been doing things that have helped like draw out calendars counting off days until he gets home or have learned when to tell her info and not tell her anything upsetting at all.

"hi,i'm looking for some advice on my grandfather / dad (there is two of us here, however the grandson is typing so i'll be typing from my point of view), this is a **big post so i'm sorry** but if anyone could have a read and provide me with some advice i would greatly appreciate it!--# noticeable onsetin 2015 we started to notice that my granddad had the start of dementia/alzheimer's and we spoke to his doctor (with his wife/my nan) to make them aware and see if they could do anything but for some reason they said that they are unable to do anything or say anything to him until he asks/mentions it...# 6 months laterabout 6 months later he had a tia (transient ischemic attack) and was taken to hospital, they released him the next morning but started him on some tablets.# 6 to 12 months laterwithin the next 6 months several people like his neighbors mentioned that he is forgetting things and repeats himself lots.# other attacks &amp; hospital visits.since then, he's had a few more smaller tia's and we notice his memory is getting worse and worse, he can't remember going to the hospital in the last 5 years (even though he's been 5 or so times, twice by ambulance).# confusionhe repeats himself a crazy amount of times, even sometimes in very quick succession. he misplaces things like his keys, phone, hat, chargers... etc and gets confused with even the simplest of things that 10 years ago he would have been able to do just fine, he's broken several things lately from trying to ""fix"" them himself because he would have normally been able to fix them but now he just does things wrong.we recently installed new taps in the kitchen and bathroom and within a month he had broken the taps in the bathroom because he tried to undo them because ""they felt broken"" which is just because they are different and could be turned easily where as his old taps had broken and were pretty fused up.he purchased a new door bell recently and he brought it over unable to get it to work so he wanted me to have a look at it, he had tried to open the doorbell to fix it and had damaged all of the plastic where he was trying to push a screwdriver into it to open it up when all he had to do was pull the plastic tab (it said ""pull me out"" on it) to get the battery to connect. i let him take it home and we said we'd come and put it up on the weekend (2 days away), when we turned up he had been trying to open it up again because it ""wasn't working"", he had forgotten that he had brought it over and the only thing required was to put it up on the wall.# violence/angerhe get's quite angry when he gets confused and he's also been a little violent towards my nan by punching her on the arm on multiple occasions, we've spoken to him about this and told him that he can not do this, we've also spoken to my nan and told her not to wind him up. it starts of by him forgetting something and then my nan goes on at him over whatever it was and he gets angry and ends up being aggressive. since we spoke to her about it he has been fine as she has been doing what we told her of not making a fuss over it, just let it go even if it's very annoying.# repeating himselfspeaking to him a few days ago, he repeated the same story to us about 5 times within the space of 10 minutes. we don't bother saying anything instead we listen to the same story 5 times. he however isn't aware that he's told us.# recent scansover the past month he's also been having a few mri scans and memory tests to check for any changes with his brain, however he still doesn't really tell any of the family (or his wife) the results and probably forgets the results by the time he gets home.my granddad was spoken to on a 1 to 1 basis with my dad in the car when they were coming back from his mri scan and my granddad said that he didn't think he had anything wrong with his memory, my dad thought this was the perfect opportunity to talk to him and he told him straight up that he did believe that he though there ""was something going on with his memory"" but that there isn't anything to worry about and that he should just get on with life and enjoy himself. after he got home and my dad had left, he apparently broke down in tears and got upset over it all. we actually went down the next morning and already he had forgotten most of the previous day and didn't mention dad thinking he has something going on. i could tell him the upcoming winning lottery numbers though (he asks all the time if i can get him the winning lottery numbers as i am always able to help fix things for him) and within an hour he would have more than likely forgotten them.# getting lost...the biggest worry with him for us is him getting lost, he goes out in the car (doesn't tell anyone where he's going) and goes off at hours at a time, we don't know if he gets lost or what is going on.what we really kind of need is to get a tracker on his car/on his keys but we don't want to appear or be invasive for his privacy, the main reason we want a tracker is to make sure he's safe and ok, there's been many occasions over the last two years where it's 11 at night and he's not home after going down to the pub, he's not told his wife where he is and she obviously gets very worried, upset and scared. we have to go out and try and find him. he just doesn't understand and laughs at it every time.we noticed a note in the kitchen about a ""loan"" and we're not sure what that is about, he says he doesn't know what it was about either and we're obviously a little worried that he might be in trouble with money and also a bit worried that he seeing someone on the side (i wouldn't be surprised, likewise our nan wouldn't be surprised) and maybe giving her money (even though the money he has is equally shared between him and his wife)# taking control...we've already kind of taken some form of control by speaking to the pharmacy (with him being there) and getting agreeing that no changes to his tablets or how they are delivered can be made by him without one of us being there because he gets confused and has changed delivery of his tablets several times causing himself lots of stress, the staff at the pharmacy stress and causing himself to have to wait a few days without any tablets.# forgetting to do things like eating, brushing his teeth, wearing a coat... etche forgets to eat and has to be reminded by his wife constantly, if she was to pass away he would quickly get into a state and either not eat enough and become unwell or just get dirty because he forgets to brush his teeth (his wife reminds him every day), he forgets to put underwear on (his wife reminds him every day) and he forgets to go out with a coat on even though it's supposed to rain later on.# what next?this is

home and we said we'd come and put it up on the weekend (2 days away), when we turned up he had been trying to open it up again because it ""wasn't working"", he had forgotten that he had brought it over and the only thing required was to put it up on the wall.# violence/angerhe get's quite angry when he gets confused and he's also been a little violent towards my nan by punching her on the arm on multiple occasions, we've spoken to him about this and told him that he can not do this, we've also spoken to my nan and told her not to wind him up. it starts of by him forgetting something and then my nan goes on at him over whatever it was and he gets angry and ends up being aggressive. since we spoke to her about it he has been fine as she has been doing what we told her of not making a fuss over it, just let it go even if it's very annoying.# repeating himselfspeaking to him a few days ago, he repeated the same story to us about 5 times within the space of 10 minutes. we don't bother saying anything instead we listen to the same story 5 times. he however isn't aware that he's told us.# recent scansover the past month he's also been having a few mri scans and memory tests to check for any changes with his brain, however he still doesn't really tell any of the family (or his wife) the results and probably forgets the results by the time he gets home.my granddad was spoken to on a 1 to 1 basis with my dad in the car when they were coming back from his mri scan and my granddad said that he didn't think he had anything wrong with his memory, my dad thought this was the perfect opportunity to talk to him and he told him straight up that he did believe that he though there ""was something going on with his memory"" but that there isn't anything to worry about and that he should just get on with life and enjoy himself. after he got home and my dad had left, he apparently broke down in tears and got upset over it all. we actually went down the next morning and already he had forgotten most of the previous day and didn't mention dad thinking he has something going on. i could tell him the upcoming winning lottery numbers though (he asks all the time if i can get him the winning lottery numbers as i am always able to help fix things for him) and within an hour he would have more than likely forgotten them.# getting lost...the biggest worry with him for us is him getting lost, he goes out in the car (doesn't tell anyone where he's going) and goes off at hours at a time, we don't know if he gets lost or what is going on.what we really kind of need is to get a tracker on his car/on his keys but we don't want to appear or be invasive for his privacy, the main reason we want a tracker is to make sure he's safe and ok, there's been many occasions over the last two years where it's 11 at night and he's not home after going down to the pub, he's not told his wife where he is and she obviously gets very worried, upset and scared. we have to go out and try and find him. he just doesn't understand and laughs at it every time.we noticed a note in the kitchen about a ""loan"" and we're not sure what that is about, he says he doesn't know what it was about either and we're obviously a little worried that he might be in trouble with money and also a bit worried that he seeing someone on the side (i wouldn't be surprised, likewise our nan wouldn't be surprised) and maybe giving her money (even though the money he has is equally shared between him and his wife)# taking control...we've already kind of taken some form of control by speaking to the pharmacy (with him being there) and getting agreeing that no changes to his tablets or how they are delivered can be made by him without one of us being there because he gets confused and has changed delivery of his tablets several times causing himself lots of stress, the staff at the pharmacy stress and causing himself to have to wait a few days without any tablets.# forgetting to do things like eating, brushing his teeth, wearing a coat... etche forgets to eat and has to be reminded by his wife constantly, if she was to pass away he would quickly get into a state and either not eat enough and become unwell or just get dirty because he forgets to brush his teeth (his wife reminds him every day), he forgets to put underwear on (his wife reminds him every day) and he forgets to go out with a coat on even though it's supposed to rain later on.# what next?this is all of our first experience with someone with dementia/alzheimer (we're pretty sure it's vascular dementia) and really don't know what to do so any help and advise would be very much welcome and appreciated. Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia."

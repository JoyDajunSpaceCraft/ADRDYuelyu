"so my mom and aunt have been talking about going about caring for my grandma when she reaches the point where she can no longer care for herself (she's still in early stages). since my grandma and aunt have always had a contentious relationship they decided it'd be best if she stayed with my mom and me. the problem is, i am trans male, so i'm no longer the granddaughter she used to know.she hasn't forgotten my trans status yet, she doesn't deadname or misgender me. and i know not to get angry at her when that happens because that's the dementia at work, not her.what i wanna ask is this: when she reaches the point where i'm back to being her granddaughter should i indulge that and go back to presenting femininely? or could i get away with taking on a role of, say, new guy who moved in next door, idk where your granddaughter is, she's probably out playing with friends? i've been on hormones for nearly two years, my voice is very different, and every few months my beard fills in more and more. i still look a bit like me, but that is only going to last so long.i'll be honest: i really do not want to go back to being a girl, especially for someone who's going to eventually forget that she had this ""girl"" in her life. (god, what if at some point she starts seeing me as her ex-husband? i look like a younger more effeminate version of my grandpa. that's gonna be fun.) but i also want to do a good job taking care of her and making her life as stress-free as i can. can i have both?",caring for a dementia patient as a trans person?,1,mom aunt talking going caring grandma reaches point longer care s still early stages since grandma aunt always contentious relationship decided d best stayed mom problem trans male m longer granddaughter used know she n t forgotten trans status yet n t deadname misgender know get angry happens s dementia work her what wan na ask reaches point m back granddaughter indulge go back presenting femininely could get away taking role say new guy moved next door idk granddaughter s probably playing friends ve hormones nearly two years voice different every months beard fills still look bit like going last long i ll honest really want go back girl especially someone s going eventually forget girl life god point starts seeing ex husband look like younger effeminate version grandpa s gon na fun also want good job taking care making life stress free caring dementia patient trans person
"my 86y old grandma has been battling dementia for nearly 5 years now. it started with her repeating stories but it went downhill after my grandpa died.her short term memory is horrible. she will ask the same question many times, forgets my name sometimes (but knows who we all are) and generally acts like a child most of the time.she seems to always be very happy, doesn't understand tv shows but finds it amusing to watch and the most interesting thing - she's completely capable of living by herself.she lights fire in the fireplace, eats food we leave her and takes meds (i have to call her to remind her of everything tho). we visit her 2 times a week.the only thing that's gotten progressively worse is her short term memory and even her long term but she still knows who we all are and understands everything we tell her. it's been a slow decline during these past 5 years.what to expect in the future?",What to expect in the future?,1,86y old grandma battling dementia nearly 5 years started repeating stories went downhill grandpa died her short term memory horrible ask question many times forgets name sometimes knows generally acts like child time she seems always happy n t understand tv shows finds amusing watch interesting thing s completely capable living herself she lights fire fireplace eats food leave takes meds call remind everything tho visit 2 times week the thing s gotten progressively worse short term memory even long term still knows understands everything tell s slow decline past 5 years what expect future expect future

"hi everyone. i'm just wondering if anyone has any advice or experience with this. my mother (71) has been declining for several years - i think about 10. her own mother developed vascular dementia in her 50s and died at 76, and also had debilitating osteoarthritis in her neck, which my mother also shares.i think that the chronic pain (which absolutely ruins my mother's day to day life) makes her cognitive function worse, but that the dementia issue would still be there without the pain.the problem that i have is that she will not make a doctor's appointment for either issue, and she won't speak to me about it without weeks of rage and silent treatment afterwards. i know that she finds it distressing and antagonising coming from me, but she has always been difficult to speak to and has become even more difficult and angry and i can't really cope with it any more if nothing is addressed. she did bring up ""memory issues"" herself at a follow up appointment for a hip replacement a couple of years ago (i was present) - her gp laughed and said if she hadn't left the gas on and knows where she is then there isn't a problem. but there is definitely a problem. to my actual question - i've drafted a letter to send to her gp to ask if they can somehow broach the subject (pain, brain or both) with her without mentioning that i've said anything. is this an approach that any gp might take seriously or even be able to follow up? i've got no family to discuss any of this with and am feeling a bit lost so i was wondering if anyone might have some wisdom to share.i know this is garbled, thank you for your time if you got to the end!",Approaching GP re. mother and suspected cognitive impairment.

i finally went to visit my mom. she's still living in her 3000+ sq ft house in a nice neighborhood (very safe). she has an underlying mental illness/paranoia/depression and now dementia (like stage 6). she can still use the bathroom. we have aides come in to help 4 hours each day. she throws a fit on any suggestion she should change her clothes. the doctor believes that a psych team would be needed to get her to bathe. we're trying to keep her at home but it's a lot to maintain (and she doesn't have a lot of income) but i feel it's time for her to move on and get additional care. i do worry she'd have to be highly medicated and potentially injured but an impatient nurse but i'm just kinda tired of having to take care of things from a distance. i also think it's unfair on her neighbors to have to look out for her (and deal with an unsightly house). the house i could help improve but i'm just not sure it makes sense to do so. but she's comfortable there and still recognizes it... what to do?,Mom hasn't bathed in years and hasn't changed her clothes in months,0,finally went visit mom she's still living 3000 sq ft house nice neighborhood safe underlying mental illness paranoia depression dementia like stage 6 still use bathroom aides come help 4 hours day throws fit suggestion change clothes doctor believes psych team would needed get bathe we're trying keep home it's lot maintain doesn't lot income feel it's time move get additional care worry she'd highly medicated potentially injured impatient nurse i'm kinda tired take care things distance also think it's unfair neighbors look deal unsightly house house could help improve i'm sure makes sense she's comfortable still recognizes Mom hasn't bathed years hasn't changed clothes months

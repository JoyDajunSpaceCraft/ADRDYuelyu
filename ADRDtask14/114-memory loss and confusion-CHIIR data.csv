advice on my grandfather / dad (there is two of us here, however the grandson is typing so i'll be typing from my point of view), this is a **big post so i'm sorry** but if anyone could have a read and provide me with some advice i would greatly appreciate it!--# noticeable onsetin 2015 we started to notice that my granddad had the start of dementia/alzheimer's and we spoke to his doctor (with his wife/my nan) to make them aware and see if they could do anything but for some reason they said that they are unable to do anything or say anything to him until he asks/mentions it...# 6 months laterabout 6 months later he had a tia (transient ischemic attack) and was taken to hospital, they released him the next morning but started him on some tablets.# 6 to 12 months laterwithin the next 6 months several people like his neighbors mentioned that he is forgetting things and repeats himself lots.# other attacks &amp; hospital visits.since then, he's had a few more smaller tia's and we notice his memory is getting worse and worse, he can't remember going to the hospital in the last 5 years (even though he's been 5 or so times, twice by ambulance).# confusionhe repeats himself a crazy amount of times, even sometimes in very quick succession. he misplaces things like his keys, phone, hat, chargers... etc and gets confused with even the simplest of things that 10 years ago he would have been able to do just fine, he's broken several things lately from trying to ""fix"" them himself because he would have normally been able to fix them but now he just does things wrong.we recently installed new taps in the kitchen and bathroom and within a month he had broken the taps in the bathroom because he tried to undo them because ""they felt broken"" which is just because they are different and could be turned easily where as his old taps had broken and were pretty fused up.he purchased a new door bell recently and he brought it over unable to get it to work so he wanted me to have a look at it, he had tried to open the doorbell to fix it and had damaged all of the plastic where he was trying to push a screwdriver into it to open it up when all he had to do was pull the plastic tab (it said ""pull me out"" on it) to get the battery to connect. i let him take it home and we said we'd come and put it up on the weekend (2 days away), when we turned up he had been trying to open it up again because it ""wasn't working"", he had forgotten that he had brought it over and the only thing required was to put it up on the wall.# violence/angerhe get's quite angry when he gets confused and he's also been a little violent towards my nan by punching her on the arm on multiple occasions, we've spoken to him about this and told him that he can not do this, we've also spoken to my nan and told her not to wind him up. it starts of by him forgetting something and then my nan goes on at him over whatever it was and he gets angry and ends up being aggressive. since we spoke to her about it he has been fine as she has been doing what we told her of not making a fuss over it, just let it go even if it's very annoying.# repeating himselfspeaking to him a few days ago, he repeated the same story to us about 5 times within the space of 10 minutes. we don't bother saying anything instead we listen to the same story 5 times. he however isn't aware that he's told us.# recent scansover the past month he's also been having a few mri scans and memory tests to check for any changes with his brain, however he still doesn't really tell any of the family (or his wife) the results and probably forgets the results by the time he gets home.my granddad was spoken to on a 1 to 1 basis with my dad in the car when they were coming back from his mri scan and my granddad said that he didn't think he had anything wrong with his memory, my dad thought this was the perfect opportunity to talk to him and he told him straight up that he did believe that he though there ""was something going on with his memory"" but that there isn't anything to worry about and that he should just get on with life and enjoy himself. after he got home and my dad had left, he apparently broke down in tears and got upset over it all. we actually went down the next morning and already he had forgotten most of the previous day and didn't mention dad thinking he has something going on. i could tell him the upcoming winning lottery numbers though (he asks all the time if i can get him the winning lottery numbers as i am always able to help fix things for him) and within an hour he would have more than likely forgotten them.# getting lost...the biggest worry with him for us is him getting lost, he goes out in the car (doesn't tell anyone where he's going) and goes off at hours at a time, we don't know if he gets lost or what is going on.what we really kind of need is to get a tracker on his car/on his keys but we don't want to appear or be invasive for his privacy, the main reason we want a tracker is to make sure he's safe and ok, there's been many occasions over the last two years where it's 11 at night and he's not home after going down to the pub, he's not told his wife where he is and she obviously gets very worried, upset and scared. we have to go out and try and find him. he just doesn't understand and laughs at it every time.we noticed a note in the kitchen about a ""loan"" and we're not sure what that is about, he says he doesn't know what it was about either and we're obviously a little worried that he might be in trouble with money and also a bit worried that he seeing someone on the side (i wouldn't be surprised, likewise our nan wouldn't be surprised) and maybe giving her money (even though the money he has is equally shared between him and his wife)# taking control...we've already kind of taken some form of control by speaking to the pharmacy (with him being there) and getting agreeing that no changes to his tablets or how they are delivered can be made by him without one of us being there because he gets confused and has changed delivery of his tablets several times causing himself lots of stress, the staff at the pharmacy stress and causing himself to have to wait a few days without any tablets.# forgetting to do things like eating, brushing his teeth, wearing a coat... etche forgets to eat and has to be reminded by his wife constantly, if she was to pass away he would quickly get into a state and either not eat enough and become unwell or just get dirty because he forgets to brush his teeth (his wife reminds him every day), he forgets to put underwear on (his wife reminds him every day) and he forgets to go out with a coat on even though it's supposed to rain later on.# what next?this is all of our first experience with someone with dementia/alzheimer (we're pretty sure it's vascular dementia) and really don't know what to do so any help and advise would be very much welcome and appreciated."

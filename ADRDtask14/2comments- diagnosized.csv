You tell her whatever is easiest on her. It's perfectly fine to fib because your are protecting them. It might be tough on you to say he's at the store or at a friend's house but it saves her that heartbreak.,,,,
I wouldn’t tell her he’s passed. I’d say he had to go on a work trip or something and then change the topic.,,,,
"Something that helped me when caring for my dad was “meet them where they are” if he thought he was 10 I went with it. If he asked for his dad that passed he would be on vacation at the shore. In my opinion it makes things easier for them and less stressful for you. Imagine if you asked where your dad was and you were told they passed 8 years ago. That’s kinda traumatic and distressing and disorienting in my opinion. I used to tell him the truth until I read an alz book that said to meet them where they are. And it has helped sooo much. I used to try convincing my dad that something was true for like an hour and he would end up getting angry/ annoyed/ sad and it would never end well. I never had that problem once I stopped doing that.  But that quote also applies to their physical ability and mental ability. Like don’t do a 1,000 piece puzzle unless they are able to. Instead do a 100 piece puzzle.",,,,
"No it's not best to torture him with reliving that pain over and over. I've never wore understood how people can believe that.

With my mom, when she asked where my dad was, I'd just tell her, ""Right where you left him"" which was 100% true but not where she thought she left him. It satisfied her because to her it meant Dad was home watching TV and didn't feel like traveling to see her.

Saying something like, ""She's not at home right now"" hopefully will satisfy him without ""lying""... Although compassionate lies are considered by most to be acceptable, to keep dementia patients from reliving painful events or going through something upsetting for no good reason.",,,,
"I suggest this all the time, but if you can, get them to watch some Teepa Snow videos on YouTube. It got through to my sister when she was like your mom.",,,,
"It's called therapeutic lying and as mentioned by others here, is the compassionate approach. People living with dementia have memory loss. And as such can not retain new information. Think of it as lying to the dementia not your grandfather. When he asks about his wife you can reply by saying...are you looking for her because you want to tell her something or you want to be near her? Provide a choice and then redirect based on his answer. Reminisce and talk about happy thoughts. Therapeutic lying has some limitations...do not embellish or make promises. So you could say ""grandma isn't here right now. Was there something you wanted to tell her or you just wanted to be near?"" Do not go on a say something like...she'll visit tomorrow, etc. Because that is not kind. Hope this helps.",,,,
"Lie. It’s the compassionate thing to do.
(I lie to my wife who has dementia every day for the reason you mention.)
It kills me but it provides her some relief.",,,,
"My dad was diagnosed 22 years ago, I made the mistake of trying to make him “realize” that he was mistaken about everything. So I had the bright idea to take him to my grandparents grave to prove to him that they were gone. I learned a very hard lesson that day and also inadvertently tore my dads heart out.

When he realized that they were gone and when he realized he was losing his mind. He was totally defeated and I felt so terrible, it wasn’t my intention. It was like it was his first time realizing they were gone and realizing his diagnosis again

So in short

Yes! LIE!",,,,
"In dementia care we are trained to lie about things like this. The reason being that those with dementia only have their emotions with them and current thoughts. You put their emotions first, and it is not fair to put them through this tormenting cycle of reliving that news. I highly recommend looking up reputable sources on training for caregiving with those with dementia and presenting these findings to your mom.
",,,,
"Absolutely lie if that spares the trauma to both sides. There's no use in pushing the truth when it brings repeated pain. I avoid talking much about mom for the same reason - after 65 years with mom, he usually breaks down if I talk about her. To spare the pain, it's easier to let him bring her up when and if he does.",,,,
"I work at a nursing home, and “lying” is honestly my go to when it comes to this sort of stuff. It’s the most humane thing to do
",,,,
"I think lying is the easy call. What is gained? I know it feels attend, but we did this with our mother, both with dad, who had passed a few years before but she started forgetting this and asking where he was, and with our brother who we lost after the point when she would have been able to process it. It was tough to not tell Mom her eldest child had died, but it was the right thing to do. She would not have been able to actually mourn him and would have just learned about it over and over (if, at that point, she was alert and oriented enough to remember him)
",,,,
"I worked in a memory care ward and the only thing that ever came from the residents being told the truth was them being devastated for the rest of the day. No reason to hurt them with knowledge they're just going to forget in the morning. Lie to him so he doesn't spend every day learning over and over again that he just lost the love of his life.
",,,,
"My mum was at the stage where we needed to tell her. My dad was such an integral part of her day-to-day and she needed answers. Eventually, after a year she's accepted that he's gone, but I've reinforced the positive aspects of their relationship and focused on gratitude for him. She still waits for him every day until she remembers he's gone, but reminiscing helps her cope. It's very individual to be honest. The stage she's at allows her to retain some recent knowledge of events. So she has some peace, but we're a year in. Grief amplifies the dementia response and she's had a hard time processing it.

If lying is maintaining the peace he feels and he can't process the reality, it's a kindness.

I'm so sorry for your loss.",,,,
"Why not say it differently? Is he religious? If so, she’s visiting old friends… (dead ones, but leave this out). Not religious, just say she’s not available.
",,,,
"I’ll just say she’s out to the supermarket and will be back soon. There’s no point because he would just ask again and again, it’s so painful for him.",,,,
"My mother would cry about her parents all the time. An SSRI (Lexipro) helped a lot. The dose is just 25% of a typical dose because of side effects (increased confusing, poorer physical coordination), but it took the edge off of anxiety and sadness for her.
",,,,
"Yes, the Alzheimer’s support person on the ALZ connect hotline mentioned something like “strategic lying” or “therapeutic lying”.

My mom keeps asking about my dad and I end up retelling the whole story (who he was, how they met, how he died etc). Like you - I’m not comfortable “therapeutic lying” for this yet - so usually I just say “I don’t feel like talking about it right now”, and that works (especially if we went over it a few times already that hour / day).",,,,
"If he is having to ask every two hours or so he is not capable of retaining the new information. It does him no good. Did you ever have a separate vacation house anywhere or have separate family vacations? If do you could say she's gone to the beach/mountains/wherever with one of her relatives. Or if he's lost a sense of time and doesnt know thst nightime=time to be at home maybe say she's at work or shopping.
",,,,
"You might be able to finnese your response like ""She isn't here right now."" ""No, I don't know when she'll be back."" ""Look! A hummingbird!""

",,,,
"I agree with most others who are recommending lying.

However, I don’t think we should judge your mom for her decision. One of my core fundamental values is honesty. We didn’t even do Santa because we didn’t want that dishonesty.

Having to deal with my spouse with Alzheimer’s and trying to reconcile that the idea of lying is okay has been/still is a HUGE issue.

Especially with teens at home who I am trying to teach the same value of truth overriding discomfort, etc.

So maybe your mom has the same belief and/or struggle. It isn’t easy and whatever she chooses, whether you agree or not, is something to support. Have you discussed it with her (as to why she wants to tell the truth)?",,,,
"This may sound weird, but is her blood pressure ok? A couple of years ago I went from doctoral student to ""can't follow a recipe"" pretty much overnight. MRI looked fine, but fMRI showed multiple abnormalities. Ultimately they decided it was many micro TBIs complicated by untreated hypertension (thanks menopause!).

I'm pretty sure this is not a common occurrence, but thought I'd throw it out there, just in case.

I'm really sorry you're going through this and hope the best for you and your mom.",,,,

"All you can do is go to neurologist who specializes in geriatric and memory disorders. makes me wonder if she has not had a series of small TIA's?

"Agree. Along the same path, a neuropsych eval would be helpful.

"You betcha! Having an accurate diagnosis is essential. Dementia? MCI? (Mild Cognitive Impairment), ALZ? takes effort, a variety of tests, time, and a proper team. Having a team that with a shared information approach must include neuropsych, psychiatrist,neurologist,geriatrician, social worker, PCP, etc. is essential. Regardless, safety of caregivers is primary. We all have limitations.

"We’re going through this with my dad (72) right now and are also struggling to wrap our heads around it. Remarkable downturn within a couple of weeks. The doctors think is was triggered by a hospital stay that caused delirium. After he came out of the delirium, it was obvious he still wasn’t himself and he got the dementia diagnosis.

"My dad also declined quite a bit following a brief hospital stay (1 night). He experienced delirium and has never fully gotten back from that.

"Another Urinalysis but with a urine culture is a good idea. UTI can be sneaky and remain undetected.

"I had the exact same thing happen to my mother. A year ago, she was able to drive, shop, knew where she was, was able to do household chores. She had some issues that were memory related, but maybe not. Became obsessed with hygiene. The bathroom had probably $2,000 worth of soaps, hair products, medicine. She would shower twice a day, do laundry almost every day - eccentric, but not gone.

Early March she had an elective surgery on her foot, and the general anesthesia changed her completely. Her short term memory is completely gone.

Neurologists just put her on memantine.

The problem is doctors really don't care about the elderly, and dementia in particular, as it is so hard to diagnose properly. I was told the same thing after an MRI, cat scan, everything.

I'm about ready to try radical solutions like order Pfizer HGH pens from Turkey. Whatever risks there are I'd rather take them and have my mom back.

Make sure she is on blood pressure meds, get her off every prescription drug she doesn't need and even non-prescription drugs. No NSAIDs, no antihistamines, no SSRI or Tricyclic antidepressants, no statins... Many drugs cause dementia. The only think you should be worried about is high blood sugar. This is a problem with HGH but metformin works 99% of the time.",,,,

"Psychosis looks like dementia and vice versa

"Same thing happened to my 78 year old mom. She had a very sudden and drastic drop in her cognition to where she had to move in with me. She was finally diagnosed with Vascular Dementia, though it took some time to get a diagnosis. She also had a vitamin B12 deficiency which can also contribute to cognitive decline. So sorry, I know how hard this is.
",,,,
"It sounds like taking her to the neurologist would be the most beneficial thing to do. Someone else here may have advice on how to get someone cognizant to do that (I’m not sure how lucid she is), it will probably involve lying to your mother either way. Perhaps set the appointment day saying it’s just a wellness visit. They can give her medication to calm her, and make a formal diagnosis. It’s not really important that she accepts she has dementia, just that a diagnosis is made which will help your family prepare for the future. I don’t know what you mean by phase. If it’s dementia she could remain that way for the rest of her life, it could get better and she will become more lucid, it could worsen, or more than likely it seems she will cycle through those. As for your father it seems as if support is needed to give him time in the form of an in home care worker, and he would benefit from dementia education about behavior, stages, coping.
",,,,
"I’m so very sorry to hear all of that, your family has already been through a lot. The neurologist can be a hurdle in itself. I know not everyone has this option, but getting a second opinion may be helpful as the current doctor doesn’t seem proactive. Dementia is hard to deal with if you’re sober, even tempered, and have the money to be home all the time, so your father is more than likely going to find all of this more difficult than most. I’m going to say something I can’t tell whether it controversial on this sub or not- you are under no obligation to quit your life to become a caretaker, and I hope no one pressures you to do so. Perhaps your mother would be ok in a nursing home where your father can visit frequently and she has more stimulation? Or in home care where he’s not really having to deal with her needs most of the day. It really falls on your dad to adult up and make these decisions, but you can do the research to guide him since he kinda seems to be looking for a way out rather than through (it’s all very hard I hold no judgment in that). Also, thank you for your service.
",,,,
"Chances are if she's to the point of repetitive questions, she's not going to be able to retain the knowledge that she has dementia. My suggestion would be to arrange for your dad to get a break several times a week. If there's one available, maybe even a support group; it can help him feel less alone and maybe give him some tools to help deal with her as she progresses, as well as give him somewhere to vent. If he's resistant, it may be time to start looking into a facility for your mom, for her safety and his sanity.

"There is also respite care, free and available in the US, tell your brother to seek out through local social service agency or Office for the Aging!

"Agreed on respite care comments. Since you said 100% ptsd disability, I’m assuming VA. They have respite benefits.
",,,,
"What if you bring in home care to help your dad? Basically lie to her and say they are for him when they’re really for her. Since she is used to him being the one with needs it might make sense for him to need care. Then they can help her since they are there anyways.

Talk to the social services department in your area and see what resources can be offered. A lot of things are pro rated based on income

So sorry, it's really tough, and sad. But yeh, it's very very hard on yr grandma to have to be suffering domestic violence & emotional & psychological abuse at her age, from someone who she's spending all her time & emotional & psychological capacity on caring for. Sounds pretty hellish. At what point will grandpa go residential, when he starts actually beating her, pushes her over & breaks her hip? :(

Have you already or can you get some in-home respite care organised, for grandma to have desperately much-needed respite time-off? If he's always shouting at her blaming her cursing at her threatening her -- just because he has dementia doesn't mean he has free-pass to abuse her. Doesn't mean she has to just suck it up and take it, that's horrendous. Poor grandpa, sure, but wow - poor poor grandma. :(

Contact dementia org or alzheimers org, get some expert professional experienced counselling on what your local options are, how to best help grandpa & grandma before something really horrific happens. Best of luck!",,,,
"I'm not sure I would recommend getting a new pet for someone with dementia, especially at the stage your grandpa is. You'll never know how he would react, worst case the pet is going to suffer.

A nursing home is not a ""punishment"" for someone's bad behavior. It's assuring someone gets the help they need. I totally understand where your grandma is coming from, but both her & your grandpa (could) profit from this. Maybe have some very gentle talks with her about it, but obviously it's her decision in the end. Best of luck to you & your family!",,,,
"The behavior change is most likely due to the dementia changing the personality part of his brain. Unfortunately it is not going to get better. Gently remind your grandma that if he does do something that incapacitated her, he would most likely have to go into a facility then.",,,,
"If you care about your grandma, you should put him in a home regardless of if you want to or not. If it's not this, it'll be something else in the future where he will again attack your grandma.. You can't control stuff like this when his disability causes it. Your grandpa will suffer no matter what you do so your grandma is really the only one you can save and should be your first priority.

If it's for financial reasons you absolutely can't move him, then maybe medication. Maybe one of those fake dogs.

If it's in the US, Medicaid should cover it. Contact your aging and stabilizes office to get a social worker to help you.",,,,
"Could you say the dog is at the vet or someone else’s home? Make a big sign for him that says “Beloved Pooch is at the vets office”. Put one by the doors, by his chair, wherever he is acting out. You can affirm that he has a valid concern- the dog is unsafe, cold, lonely, hungry, and make him feel heard. Try not to argue with him, there is no winning as I’m sure you’ve learned. Hopefully you can ease his hyper fixation with the dog with some redirection.

"This may be a long shot. But you could try one of those robotic pets. They have dogs and cats. They usually have to be pretty far along to believe the pet is real. But it sounds like a terrible situation so it's worth a shot. I'm sorry you're going through this.

"I tried the robotic cat with my mom- and she recognized the difference between that toy and an actual cat. Robotic cat ended up in the back of her closet at memory care, sadly. We ended up giving it to our little grandson to play with. They aren't cheap so it was a frustrating attempt at trying to help my mom.

Dementia is so hard to deal with. I agree with others posting here- keep saying the dog is at the vet's office, on a walk, etc. But please know, the two reasons people are placed into care are 1. incontinence 2. violence towards loved ones. Medication can help and if it is escalating, let the doctor know so things can be adjusted so your grandma can stay safe. I know of one man with dementia who just went off one day and really hurt his wife of many years. Ambulance was called and thank God the police were understanding as well. But the man was asking at the hospital why he was there, what had happened (""nothing really"") and could he go home (""sorry, no""). I also know of others at the facility where my mother is and their spouses come in almost daily to help care for them and give them lots of love and attention. Memory care doesn't mean dumping someone and forgetting about them.",,,,
"They're about $130. So not cheap but not crazy expensive either.

But I do think if the family can help take care of a real dog, that might be a good solution. I hope it all works out!",,,,
"Don’t get him another dog. It would be cruel to the animal and chances are you would end up needing to take it away, upsetting him even more. Everyone needs to come up with a reply to say to him about the dog being at the vet or something, explain the dog’s absence to him in some other way.
",,,,
"Pets can help elderly people so much, helps with stress, depression, etc. that people with dementia often experience. I think it’s a really good idea. Plus I like the fact that you have a contingency plan in place where your sister can take the dog in if needed. If it comes to that, your sister can still bring the dog to your grandparents for regular visits.

I’m not sure what country you’re in, but in the US there are “board and care” homes which are a great option if a loved one isn’t ready/doesn’t want to go into a nursing home. Board and cares are smaller in size and have a more family feel to them compared to a nursing home. Usually people get more personalized care there. That maybe an option that your grandma would feel better about, plus she could visit your grandpa all the time.",,,,
"""The dog is at dog camp. He'll be back next week."" If he is at this point, and he is, it's time for white lies. There is no reason to force him to re-live the trauma of the dog dying over and over again.

"We always say that the dog is “at the groomer” or “at doggy daycare” or “out for a walk with _____” constantly. “Look! They sent me a picture. Look how much fun she’s having/how cute she looks!!!” And no, she doesn’t remember and asks again a few minutes later. But the key is to manage the emotional state. The dog being in a safe place where she is happy is something that elicits positive emotions rather than negative ones. The knowledge doesn’t stick for more than a few minutes but the emotional states can carry over. So anything that can be done to encourage a calm and happy emotional state, like saying that the dog is safe and happy elsewhere, is valuable.
",,,,
"Maybe say the dog moved to live somewhere else, think what you might tell a small child whose pet dies. Well you should probably teach your kid what death is but you know what I mean.

Distract and redirect him. Talk about something else he’s passionate about.

"I’m so sorry for you both. It’s a hard road ahead but there will be beautiful times among it. My dad has vascular dementia and is quite far on the journey. These are some of the things I’ve learnt. Hopefully some of them are helpful.
Driving may become dangerous. My dad would drive on the wrong side of the road and swear he was on the correct side before we had his license taken away.
She may not forget who you are. It’s the short term memory that will go and it isn’t consistent, so you can’t assume what she does and doesn’t retain. Prepare for circular conversations - just when you think they understand something, you’re back at square one.
Anger and paranoia is part of it. I remind myself that when Dad is accusing me or my mum of something - usually abandoning him to take all his money - it’s because he is scared that will happen, and reassurance that we love him is needed.
Get support. Use any aged care systems you can. You will lose days of your life to wrangling the system but it’s worth figuring it out. Also, find a dementia support group for both of you.
Get power of attorney and advanced care directives in place asap. If possible, start managing all the bills and finances. Go to the bank with your mum and set up access to her accounts. At the very least, you can check statements to make sure she’s not spending weirdly.
Write down or video stories of her life. Capture her favourite memories. Do some things she loves while she still can.
Watch videos about talking to people with dementia. The tips will be useful.
Enjoy all the bright moments. Don’t beat yourself up about the hard ones. Make sure you look after yourself and don’t feel guilty if you need to reduce contact sometimes. Sometimes you need to practice compassion from a distance, and be compassionate with yourself.

I’m sure there’s more but that’s off the top of my head.",,,,

"My very independent mother also lived on her own since my father passed away. She was diagnosed with vascular dementia

It was only when things fell apart (a trip to the hospital for general pain) that I learnt her life was a huge mess.

Get involved now while she is early stage and cooperative. Have those hard conversations like who has POA or whatever is the equivalent in the UK. See a elder lawyer to ensure you’ve covered everything now.

Protect your mother now rather than fight for her rights later. The worst thing for me was not having any legal standing to protect my mother and having to go through the courts to get the orders. It was awful.

There is so much to think about but try to not overwhelm yourself. Simply educate yourself on dementia and your countries elder laws.

Dementia is individual - everyone has a different path with shared experiences. You could have the best years with your mother starting now.

Go and give her a big hug and say ‘we will get there one step at a time’",,,,

"Hi Salty_Ad, My mother has been living for a few years by herself and nobody knew she has mixed dementia, until she was found all alone and confused (with heaps of cash) in a shopping mall down in NT. There and then she was picked up in an ambulance and taken to the nearest hospital where she awaited for a place in an aged care facility. She never returned to what she felt as home. Living continent away from her and with the borders closed, POA and caretaking is shared between myself, the Public Guardian and Public Trustee. Twice a week I talk to her and I notice her changes that sure were there before, like talking in circular, aggression, apathy and delusions. I second the idea of not allowing her to drive. And finding an aged care clinic where she could, at first be taken for a few hours a day, until her final placement. Look for a doctor specialising in gerontology. Find activities she may participate like music, gardening, pottery, etc.. It's going to be a roller coaster type of life..if you need to talk, this group is awesome..
",,,,
"I would see if she’ll agree to signing power of attorney papers or whatever the UK equivalent is now…it’s much harder as the disease progresses. In early stages it’s much clearer to them why it’s necessary and they can still see the sense of it. It makes it so much easier to help manage dr visits, finances etc. on their behalf as time goes on. I would also suggest using an Amazon echo or equivalent to set reminders as to when to take medication. When my husband was first diagnosed he insisted on handling his own meds and for a while he was ok. Then his behavior changed and he was much more combative..I found he had not been taking his meds like he thought he was…he thought he took them but was remembering the days or week before. Having Alexa remind him is neutral and not me “nagging” it also resolves the whole fight of “ I already did that” It’s the push he needs to ensure he’s taking meds.

"I am so sorry your mom and you joined the dementia club. The disease is cruel to everyone. My mom has vascular dementia with delusions. She lives with my dad in 20 min drive from me, both are in their early 80s. While your mom still lives alone and is not constantly supervised by a caregiver, may I suggest some solutions that work for me or should have worked :(

Have several wifi cameras installed. Two way audio is a great feature, but it may confuse your mom when your voice sounds from a wall. This will help you to check her when she is not answering the phone or you want to know she is fine without disturbing her. Sometimes cameras help me to locate 'stolen' stuff.

Smart wifi enabled pill dispenser to manage medication regime. You will need someone's help to set it up and fill the pills if you cannot do it yourself. Mine has slots for up to 28 days. I don't need this, as I visit almost daily, but not always at the pill time. So far I am satisfied. There are smart pill dispensers without wifi, but I am glad I did not go for a cheaper model. I had a simple 4 by 7 pill box and has been managing the regime over the phone for 2 years until I accidentally caught my mom taking her evening pills twice the same day. Another use for the camera!

Wearable tracking devices sound very nice, but they need frequent recharging or batteries replacements. And are easily removed and lost. I got my mom a non-removable bracelet with her name and my number engraved on its plate. She had been wearing it for about a month before she managed to remove it and hide in some cozy place. You never know when the next step down happens and they go out to search for their 'real' home and are lost.",,,,

Check her for a silent UTI. These are symptoms.,,,,
"Elderly, especially those with dementia, do not usually show symptoms of a UTI. That’s why it’s “silent.” Usually the only symptoms are sudden changes in behavior, falling, or more confusion.

Edited to say my mother has one now. She just returned from the hospital and rehab after leg surgery.",,,,
"I know that he's just gotten home from the hospital but I would also recommend having him checked for a potential UTI. Absolutely, any change in routine, & especially something as traumatic as a hospitalization can result in a decline. With routine & care, he may regain some or all of what he has lost but it is highly individualized. However, I've found that with any sudden decline, it is usually prudent to make sure a UTI is not also in play, as many of the symptoms indicative of a decline can also be caused or exacerbated by a UTI. Sending you & your family love & support & we hope that your Grandpa-in-law is feeling more himself again. Xo
",,,,
"No worries. So, unlike people who suffer from a UTI & are younger (who would complain of things like painful urination, fever, chills & lower abdominal pain), older adults often struggle with behavioral changes as a result of a urinary tract infection. You might see increased confusion. agitation, withdrawal etc. Unfortunately, for those already dealing with dementia, these type of symptoms can be overlooked or explained away by age or possible progression & the underlying UTI can get worse & eventually the infection can spread to the bloodstream. The rule of thumb is that if an elderly person, ESPECIALLY one who is already dealing with dementia, shows signs of decline suddenly, check for a UTI to exclude that as a possibility.",,,,
"It’s worth testing for a UTI if you can. That can cause confusion, delirium even in healthy older adults. It could also be stress/agitation - or of course worsening symptoms.

Also, for us a small dose of anti anxiety medication stopped the rummaging/escaping (lexapro). It was a godsend. Best of luck to you!

"They call them “loving lies.”

A lot of “they’re out and will be back in a little bit”, etc. Just remember, you’re not lying TO her, you’re lying FOR her, to help her. ❤️",,,,
"I saw a YouTube guide video a while ago talking about this, I'll see if I can find it.

They said something I really liked in the same vein as loving lies: ""You're not lying to your family member, you're lying to the disease"", but it's up to you to pick the few which will be acceptable to you.

If it were me I would rather be saved the pain of being told certain big things like you're talking about and reliving it every time it comes up. Ask yourself what you would rather deal with if you were in your mum's position.",,,,
"I second this: “You’re not lying to your person, you’re lying to the disease.”

As their caregiver we want to do everything we can to protect them from this vile disease - often those are easy pragmatic things like preventing a fall down the stairs, or setting a fire on the cooktop. It also includes trying to remedy the psychological toll that comes will the loss of memory, awareness, and identity - which is so much more complicate and obscure. Our healthy brains look at these lies as a betrayal of the truth, but what they really are is a complicated way of redirecting and saying “let’s not worry about that thing we have no control over and upset ourselves unnecessarily”.

It’s so hard to protect someone from their own self.",,,,
"I was trying to find it earlier with no luck although I'm 90% certain it was on the YouTube channel Dementia Success Path. She makes good guide videos of different common scenarios and runs through how you can handle things. I'm just thinking it might have been in her video about how to deal with repetitive questions. I'll check her channel again tomorrow to see if I can find it. Her channel is quite small but it's really good, she acts out both sides of lots of different scenarios.",,,,
"Compulsive lying doesn't feel right to me, it's not who I am.

And becoming someone's torturer, turning their life into an endless loop of reliving the trauma of losing their spouse and their mother over and over again - that's also not who I am.

And so I resort to truths that obscure the truth. ""Dad's not here right now. Where is he? I remember him talking about needing to go to the bank."" All technically true. If her mom is, for example buried in a cemetery, ""She's at the park today."" Or if you know she's laid to rest in some other town, ""She's in Pasadena right now. I'll be glad when the flu is over, nobody is supposed to be flying right now. Everyone's missing being able to see their family.""",,,,
"At a certain point, it’s not even lying anymore. It’s emotional damage control. Word choice can be helpful for both parties (eg: “died” or “passed away” vs “peacefully resting” or “with the angels” if your family is about that life).",,,,
"Yes, give her the ""loving lies"". I know it probably goes against all your own loving impulses to do that (it certainly does for me with my sweet wife) but console yourself with the sad fact that she won't even remember that you told her that untruth. I know that's cold comfort but upsetting her does neither of you any good and you want to spend as much happy time as you can in this situation (the Long Goodbye...)",,,,

Your mom is going to get worse - this is the beginning. That was exactly my mother a few years ago but she's been living with it for 15 years because she has early onset so she's young.

Progression is totally up to the person and can be slow as molasses or can kill them in a few years. Keep her physically healthy - get exercise, make sure she is fed regularly (healthy and nutritious) and sleeps well. She will become like a toddler so routine is important, meaning eat breakfast at a certain time, giving her snacks, and regular light exercise.

Edit: Music is wonderful and you can clap, dance, and sing. It's all about keeping them happy and relaxed at this point. You'll get to a stage where keeping them in a happy mood at the present moment is all that matters.

I'm sorry you have to go through this. It sucks and I wouldn't wish it on anybody.

If she has trouble sleeping, you can take her to the doctors although my dad doesn't have my mom on anything because side effects and she's so far along that it doesn't matter.",,,,

Music and dancing/clapping and just being in a cheery good mood definitely does wonder for their mood!",,,,
"If anything, I would have her see a neurologist to prescribe anything he/she feels is appropriate. Although even drugs that supposedly slow down the rate of decline are minimally effective at best. The problem with dementia is that there is no cure or treatment. I concur with the other advice though, keep her as healthy as possible otherwise.

"I honestly don't know about drugs that can delay this. You can certainly go to the doctors but I can't tell you that a certain type of drug works (and it's different in every patient). As far as I know, you can't really delay Alzheimer's. It's just going to happen. You can make the progression as best as possible for them.

There's going to be effects like sundowning and lack of sleep or crankiness and frustration as she loses everything and doctors might proscribe anti-anxiety or sleeping meds but that just hits the symptoms and results of alz versus Alz itself. Sorry. It's a shitty disease. :(",,,,
"I'd establish her with a neurologist/gerontologist or both. They can help the most from a allopathic or western medicine side. Not that these medications can help that mu h at this point. As for supplements or non traditional therapy, you can see a naturopath or Functional MD. There is a book called The End of Alzheimer's by a research Neurologist. Can't say how much it works as we haven't tried that protocol with my mother in law. You can also look at Craniosacral massage therapy, even if it does nothing else it will help calm the nervous system.

"I'm not sure if leaving the house for a drive or short walk is possible. But sometimes just walking outside and going back into the house can help my grandma. She isn't as disconnected from her ""home"" (at least not yet). But the times she's insisted she needs to leave, I've gone with her and had her walk. Sometimes she is still upset, but it seems to dissipate after she goes back in and walks into her bedroom. Other times she just is mad at me and sits on the couch to pout, then I give her 10 mins or so and take her a sweet treat. She typically has forgotten by then and is pleasantly surprised.

"The other two commenters in this thread so far have great advice about using empathy and a little walk or car ride depending on their mobility.

The only thing I’d add would be that a distraction of some kind can get them away from the fixation. If there’s an activity they like/used to like, keeping that handy can be a good way to redirect. For example, I used to take care of a lady who liked folding laundry, so we kept a little basket of baby clothes for her to fold when she was anxious or fixated on something. Other things like this I’ve seen include flipping through catalogue magazines and putting together fake orders; or puzzles.

In the meantime I would just ask her what she misses or likes about her ""old"" home. What does she like about ""this"" home.

I also like to distract mine with items she loves in the house. We might not know where we are, but we do know the whole beloved history of a specific chair or clock or whatever that she's had forever. ""Remember this old thing?""

"You could also look at Capgras Delusion. I once supported a guy who explained that his house had been replaced with an exact copy.

",,,,
"stop trying to tell her she’s incorrect. She will feel like you are gaslighting her and eventually not trust you.

The reason your “home” IS your home, is because it innately feels comforting to you without explanation. The way you know where everything is, you can walk around at night without lights, because you just know. Without that inherent feeling of familiarity, it doesn’t feel like home. So if someone tried to tell you, “no. this really is your house, you just don’t recognize it” that is NOT comforting at all. It’s like being told to have “mandatory fun”. It doesn’t make sense to her or anyone.

When my grandma did this, she also felt like everything was a cheap imitation of her house. That someone had snuck in, stolen all her nice kitchen backsplash and cupboard handles and replaced them with plastics.

Eventually I said, “Would it make you feel better if we stopped trying to make this place feel like your old house?” To my surprise she said yes. I said, what if we do a remodel so it feels like a totally new place, not a cheap fake of your old house?”

That actually worked! Then I pulled out paint color catalogs, home decor magazines etc and we actually had a fun time circling the things she liked and making a little wishlist for the remodel. Obviously since a remodel takes time to plan, it can’t happen immediately, it basically just perpetually bought us time and a future thing to focus on

you could tell her you are on vacation. You booked a trip and the train back home is leaving in 4 days. Pull out some tourist brochures and look at activities, museums etc to flip through. Get some postcards and sit down with her to write a letter to her friends, far-away family from the tourist location.

It doesn’t matter if you ever actually go to these things or not. It’s about pushing off the concern to a future date and finding a new thing to focus on without making her feel crazy",,,,

"My wife did this for awhile, wanted to “go home”. I would take her for rides, even drove her past our previous home an hour away(which she barely looked at), and each time we pulled in the driveway afterward I’d say “ alright, we’re HOME”. She was fairly nice about it, even though it may not have placated her. But I would never argue with her when she brought it up. I would ask her questions about who’s there, where it is, what she liked most about it. Then sometimes I’d say let’s get in the car and go. I have always felt strongly that her “home” she wants is a place and feeling in her heart that is comfortable to her, one that she knows from the past in normal times, not the chaos occupying her mind now. And she wants it back badly. It makes me sad.",,,,
"My dad did this. Taking him out for a ride to ""go home"", going for a brief ride somewhere, and pulling back into the driveway would often do the trick. It was like his brain would do a hard reset when he saw the outside of his house again, so that whatever error it was stuck on would clear. It didn't always work, but it worked often enough that we kept it up our sleeves.

I have a relative who gets furious that she doesn’t remember that other relatives have passed and we don’t remind her. We of course her know if someone passes, when it happens. That relative doesn’t have to sit with her on a daily basis and watch her grieve anew each time she is told. Another example, her car has “been in the shop” for years, and she hasn't asked about it in some time. she moves on from ""in the shop"" much better than it has been sold. If it helps her have a better day and makes care giving go smoother don't sweat it.

"What helps us making a thermometer: basically code her different moods, how to recognise them, and how to handle them. If she fluctuates in lucidity she might figure out a lie here or there, and that can affect her general sense of trust in you.

Green: happy eyes, relaxed shoulders, oriented in space, etc. Likes to puzzle Orange: furrowed brow, looks a little lost, seems to search around the room. Asks questions like 'when are you leaving'. Can still be distracted with some tea and a joke, answers should be mostly truthful. Red: Angry frown, raised shoulders, pacing around. Raised voice, demands that you leave, no longer oriented in space. Will calm down once left alone, lies to placate work well.

You get the gist. Recognising and 'treating' Orange can really help prevent patients from reaching Red. Adapt it for different behaviour/moods: pain should get its own thermometer, as do anger and fear. You can even track patterns this way, by coloring in a simple table in excel. Her unrest will probably show up around naptime like you noticed. If she starts to have these moods more often, that can signal you that her needs for rest have increased. Etc.",,,,

FIL passed before MIL, who had dementia. Her memory would re-set every 6 seconds. We learned quickly when she'd ask where her husband was, to lie.

I had to deal with the same every few hours she would try and get out, get upset about the lock, and go on and on about how I'm keeping her prisoner. After almost 2 years of this, she took her cane and smashed the window. It was 112 degrees outside and it cost $500 to fix the glass same day so we wouldn't melt in the hot weather. After this we told her doctor, and they gave her https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-63989/escitalopram-oxalate-oral/details She has been taking it for 4 weeks now. She used to be a roaming tornado in my house until we gave her this medication. She is so tired from the meds she sits up in bed to eat and drink and then go back to sleep. It's not the best, unfortunately, but I would rather she sleep all day in her own bed than break every part of the family investment before she passes. We were burnt out from her constant harassment, and now when I wake her for lunch and breakfast she calls me angel and says she loves me. She literally attacked me every breakfast until we started the meds. Medicating them is a hard step to take but I wish we did it sooner. It's really the only way to stop the moods.

Redirecting them is great, but can be difficult if you are not a trained caretaker for people with intellectual disabilities. It's IMPOSSIBLE when they are charging with a weapon. Be very careful because the behavior you are describing will likely evolve towards violence. They think they are having their life or death last stand and whoever is present will be on the receiving end.",,,,
"Excellent advice. I also went through the window breaking phase (x5) and even more dangerous activities like jumping out of said windows and cutting herself on the glass (thank God it was a minor scratch).

"Try the tactics in this episode of the Dementia By Day podcast. Likely she is expressing a need for something. A need to DO, a need to be productive, maybe even hunger/boredom! This podcast example is in response to ""when can I go HOME"" but I think the techniques could be really helpful for you. Throw her roadblocks, redirect, etc.

The phone call from boss bit is super challenging. When I've run into that with residents, there is NOTHING I can do to change their mind & anything I say, like ""your boss called me & told me to tell you to stay home!"" just upsets them further. I think asking questions like ""tell me about what you need to get done at work today?"" might be helpful in giving you some clues. Maybe try letting her direct you to what will work in terms of distractions. If she gives you any ideas, make your own version of ""paperwork, cleaning, etc"" to do at home and tell her it's ""to get a head start."" Or if she clearly has no direction she plans to take it, try folding laundry together or doing a task & use the phrase ""before you go to work, WILL YOU HELP ME WITH ____?"" !!! ""Will you help me?"" has saved my LIFE in my dementia care career. Sit back & follow where she leads you! Best of luck, this sounds so frustrating! 🥺

"What stage is she in and what meds is she on? If she is taking meds, time to speak with your doctor to tweak dosage or meds. If not, a consultation is overdue. This type of anxiety is not only taxing for family but also highly distressing to the dementia sufferers. Another thing to think about is removing triggers and stressors - i.e. if her bag reminds her of going to work take it away. We had similar issues and worse - with no triggers, the right regimen of anxiety + memory pills and with adult day care this is almost 100% under control.
",,,,
"Sounds like mid stage but I don't know. I think there is a good likelihood to find a med regimen that will help reduce the anxiety. Another step is to reduce possibilities of problems - lock the kitchen if possible, or have her stay in a certain part of the house where she can get into fewer dangerous situations. Make some modifications (e.g. mom kept clogging the sing so I installed a filter the cannot remove; I only give her devices with auto shut-off e.g. coffee machine).

With Covid our access to doctors has been better and easier than ever before - we have a monthly call with the psychiatrist via video and the family doc is available by phone. I think there are many things you can do on this situation - start with getting an appointment with the doctor as soon as you can.

Redirecting every two minutes is clearly not working so new solutions have to be explored. Here we have a behavior unit you can get help from via the heath authorities - they are tough to book but very good and through when you get the assessment.

"You know what - I wouldn't correct him either. First because folks with dementia don't deal well with it when confronted with objective reality. There's no need to add to his grief/anger/frustration because ultimately his feelings will become yours. I am not trans, so I can't speak to the emotional impact of being seen by a parent in the way that you are experiencing, but my mum at this point only knows that she and I are related. Sometimes I'm her sister. Sometimes I'm her mom. I'm only ever very rarely her daughter. I just roll with it. Second reason I wouldn't bother correcting him... You are totally worthy of a positive experience with your dad. I'm so sorry that he didn't accept you when you transitioned, but I would resist the inclination to feel like the way he is treating you now is false. Like there's no way to undo his former close-mindednes and its consequences, but folks with dementia really only experience life in the moment. If you can find happiness in your in-the-moment with your dad, then enjoy the heck out of it. Again, I don't have your experience and I can only imagine how taxing it has been to have a dad who didn't support you, and I don't expect that your time with him now will undo that hurt, but he's going to see you as who he sees you so if you can roll with it you may as well.

",,,,
"You're doing great and you have no need to be ashamed.

Your dad wouldn't understand you correcting him, and not only because of the transition. People with dementia don't understand if you try to correct them when they are wrong, they would just get upset. The best way to deal with their incorrect beliefs is just to go with it. Reminding him that his other son died would also be hearbreaking. This often happens when they ask for their deceased spouses, I know that the best thing to do is just say ""he/she is not here now but will be soon"" instead of trying to correct the mistake. Also, I don't know if he would undersand such a complex concept as transitioning, depending on the stage he's at.

All this said, I can't really understand your emotions in this situation, but I always had a strained relationship with my dad, who currently lives in a nursing home. I don't know if he recognizes me (probably not), but he said some kind things to me that he never said before.

"Another pharmacy service is “multi-dose packaging” that are little sealed clear bags connected like a roll of stamps. Each bag is labeled with the day, date & time, so all the morning pills are in 1 bag and you rip it off the roll to take it. Next is the afternoon meds, evening, etc. You tell the pharmacist what times to print. There isn’t an easy way to find which pharmacies do this, I just started calling until I found a local one. They even mail it to my mom. Next to the meds we put a large “dementia clock” that says day, time, morning/afternoon/evening... and date. It doesn’t stop her from forgetting a dose, but at least she doesn’t take extra doses. ...Correction, She doesn’t take extra doses as long as she can read a clock and coordinate the printed date/time on the bag.

Do you have a way to combat this new issue? I'm assuming you've given it thought. Maybe lots of night lights are a good idea?

Effing dementia.",,,,
"Hi there, I wonder if these will help? (sorry if you're not in the UK! hopefully you or your wife can find something similar to the plug in lights)

We have them plugged in all over the house (usually because someone ends up tripping over a cat for the night time bathroom runs!) they provide a nice soft light that does light up enough to see you're way around but not too harshly that they keep you awake!



Sending lots of hugs to you and your wife!",,,,
"Yep. This is happening with my dad. Spanish is his first language and he's losing his English quite a bit. He doesn't usually realize that he speaks Spanish to English-speaking people.

And yes, talk to her doctor about anxiety meds. SSRIs helped a lot with my father, he was very depressed and anxious. It's not a 100% cure, but it does help. There are also drugs that can slow down the progression of the dementia too.",,,,
"You can talk to her doctor, you can tell him anything you like. You can ask for new medicine too. But her doctor can’t tell you anything about her medical records without her permission. So you can call and explain her anxiety. He may call in a prescription or he may want to see her first.

"Find local orgs - this is one place to start: http://www.alz.org/apps/findus.asp But also just google ""arizona alzheimers"" and there are smaller, local groups.

If a nearby chapter offers the ""understanding dementia"" class, or any class, really - take it. You'll learn things, and also have the unique opportunity to be in a room full of people dealing with what you're dealing with.

The Alz association might also have some legal classes and other stuff. Make sure your dad gets her to execute a power of attorney and health care proxy while she still has capacity.

Talk to her lots. Ensure her mind stays stimulated (surround her with puzzles, hobby supplies, music, whatever she likes). Ask her questions about her life and your childhood. Short term memory may be shot, but she'll still be able to excavate some old ones, at least for a while.",,,,
"I wish this one had more support and fewer articles. The forums at alzconnected.org seem to be really active, with people seeming to connect well. The r/dementia sub is more active than this one and seems more support-focused/personal.",,,,

I work for the Association and lurk around the subreddit. So if you need to talk to someone, please message me!",,,,
"I'm glad the holidays went well. I've heard from many caregivers find the holidays challenging as the years go by.

Since you mentioned that she is in the early stages, for me the most important thing in the early stages is the interaction with other people. Sometimes what happens because of all the emotions and confusion, the person with the disease will close themselves in. Physical and mental activity is important too!",,,,
"Spend as much time as you can with her. Make her know and them some that you love her.

"Read The 36 Hour Day. Lots of good info.

She and Dad need to have a conversation about her wishes- finances, at what point should she be placed in a care home, living will, etc. She needs to sign over POA and guardianship to a trusted family member or friend.",,,,

"That is awfully fast. Have they ruled out any other physical reasons for her decline?

My mother is 87 and first started “word searching” around five years ago. Three years ago she started complaining that her finances were too complicated, and her boyfriend got her set up on autopay and sort of kept an eye on things, but we didn’t realize how bad it was until she started having delusions and thinking that there were men coming into her apartment and stealing things.

Now she has no concept of time or place and can’t manage any of her responsibilities. We have 24 hour caregivers living there and they had to put a lock on the door so she won’t go wandering in the hallway. She still can handle showering and going to the toilet but I’m not sure how good a job she’s doing, and her makeup looks like clown makeup now.

So the progression of your MIL does seem awfully quick. Get her checked out again thoroughly for the possibility of mini strokes, nutritional deficiencies, UTI’s, etc.",,,,
I highly recommend Dr. Dale Bredesen's book The End of Alzheimer's. Here's an in-depth interview on his work with further info below: https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/dale-bredesen,,,,

"My understanding and I could be wrong, is that early onset Alzheimer's seems to progress faster than when diagnosed later. My dad is in his 80's and his is pretty slow progressing. He also took part in a clinical trial which may or may not have helped a little plus we have him on all sorts of supplements. I do agree that she should be seen by her doctor to rule out other issues as well.

"I was reading this hoping to find some tips myself. Some people are just really good at small talk. I'm not.

I find long term memory us better than short term. So anything about her childhood, siblings, places she lived, school, pets she had, long ago friends are usually a hit. Yesterday, I calmed and distracted my wife for hours with a page from the 1920 census listing her father at age 1 1/2.

Depending on how much you know (to get the topic started) it's better not to phrase it as a question but rather something like ""I always enjoyed hearing the story about your dog..."" That way, if that memory isn't retrievable right now maybe it triggers something else.

I'm sure others will respond here with good ideas which I'm looking forward to

Good luck.",,,,
"This sounds great. My FIL always kept meticulous photo albums and when I sat with him I would pull them out and get him talking. He remembered the older things much better, as you mentioned. I remember sadly the time he could not identify a picture of his children when they were young, but could still tell me about his aunts and uncles and cousins.",,,,
"Yeah. Photo albums are a great way to kickoff a conversation.
",,,,
"I have this same struggle. I find it best to not ask questions, but to make statements. I tell her about what I did today, even though I know she doesn't understand anything about computers or office work -- she just wants to feel included. Or I'll make observations about the birds or trees or flowers or weather or whatever we can see outside the window. Or, if I have the energy, I'll say, ""That's a nice picture of Martha,"" knowing that will lead her to telling me AGAIN about all the people in all the pictures on the wall (and knowing that she won't remember their names, so I will be the one filling in the gaps for her -- that's what drains me of energy).",,,,
"How about you put together a picture book? Maybe of family? Is there something in particular she likes, animals, scenery? Put pics of those in. If she has trouble saying what she needs include pics of food and drinks, pics of rooms like bathroom and bedroom. Hard to ""small talk"" with someone who can't really talk anymore. Using pics means she can just point at things. Maybe lower your expectations because this disease will take more and more of her away from you so adjust your interactions. I think sometimes just sitting and holding hands is enough.",,,,
Music that she likes? Movies or TV shows she likes? Just sit and laugh at some comedy show from her era?,,,,
"“Tell me a story”

Or tell her a story",,,,
"This is my go to. Don’t ask cold questions (open up with questions or back to back questions) as this can cause strain as they try to remember which may lead to discomfort and them lashing out.

Just tell them a story. If they tell you something or interrupt, jump into their story or conversation.

Remember that this social interaction needs to happen in their frame of understanding, which can be frustrating to the caregiver, but just keep it casual and free flowing. If your loved one tells you about a memory which is incorrect or made up, don’t be confrontational just continue the conversation.",,,,
"I printed out 5x7 pictures of my mother’s brothers/sisters/parents etc and put them back to back in lamination sheets. I then put a hole in the lamination sheets so I could put them on a metal ring. She absolutely loves flipping thru them and they don’t get lost/destroyed. She loves birds so I am thinking of doing the same thing with bird pictures.

"I talk about my day or something I read. Over and over. My dad doesn't know what I'm saying anyway so I could read the phone book if I could find one. I show him video of the dogs playing or dolphins or whatever is on Facebook
",,,,
"Short and simple questions. You can tell her about you as well but keep it short and simple sentences not a life story. Does she ever go outside, have flowers? Ask her if she likes a certain flower and what she likes, you can kinda help and say how the color is pretty or the leaves have a nice shape. See if she engages. Look at what she likes or liked in her life.

Say if she always loved fashion get online and look up fashion, things she might like or from an older era and slowly, look at say dresses or hats with her and talk about how theyre pretty or the color, see if she engages.

Just see what subjects or areas she responds too. be patient. Let her try but if she cant and you know what shes saying just reassure her

""oh yes, i know what you mean'. Then maybe state it generally.

Play some of her favorite music and see how she responds, some from her childhood.

My dad (94) will remember vivid detail from his childhood but not from 10-20 years ago. So see if you can find what she remembers and the things she likes. maybe ask her opinion, say you want to buy some new clothes, show her what you like and ask her what she thinks.

Take her flowers, maybe she will enjoy arranging them, spark memories.",,,,
"Firstly, my condolences about your uncle.
Regarding your grandma, her reality is now a very different reality, and hearing over and over again that her son has passed away will be very upsetting.

When we dealt with this with my mother, we would deflect the conversation to something else as much as possible. In your particular case, I understand that that would be difficult as you're all grieving him yourself. Perhaps it might be easier to have a very short statement that's not too hard to say so she can't pick up on the sadness, such as 'he's gone to the shops and will be back soon'.

You'll really need to play it by ear, but I'm certain that telling her the truth will be more hurtful to her every single time. This is not about lying, this is about keeping your grandmother happy and feeling cared for and safe.

Remember, she's not giving you a hard time, she's having a hard time.

You will get through this.",,,,
"I wonder if it’s better that the story has him away for a more extended time than a short trip to the store? Maybe something where he goes on a trip for vacation or business, and the family is there to take care of her while he’s away? I’m just trying to think of something where she wouldn’t expect to go with him or be back within a very short time.
",,,,
"This does sound like a really tricky situation. I'm sorry for your loss. :-(

My guess: what is hard for her is that it takes her a few hours to accept her new reality without your uncle. After a few hours, everyone around her seems to be more calm because they aren't reacting to her behavior, life starts feeling ""normal"" for her again. In her version of ""normal"", your uncle is still around, so she wonders where he is.

If I were in your shoes, and if the grief weren't too much for me to bear, I would try to make sure she continually remembers that your uncle for the whole day for the next few days. Share what you all loved about your uncle, and then constantly punctuate it by reminding her that he's gone and that everyone will miss him. Help reset ""normal"" for her.

It may seem cruel to keep bringing him up just as she starts to seem calm, but she needs help developing a new ""normal"". Her new ""normal"" has a family that loves her and is trying to figure out the best thing for her. The things to distract her with could be to help take the really bad outcomes off the table by telling her ""you won't be homeless; we will make sure you have a safe and comfortable home"", and then switch the topic back to how much everyone will miss your uncle.

What has to be tough for you all is that it sounds like she still has the capacity to understand ""normal"", but hasn't yet come to accept that she doesn't have a useful role to play as a decision-making peer in deciding her future. She isn't a peer in those conversations because her memory is too far gone to be helpful, but your uncle was probably good at making her feel like a peer. Part of celebrating your uncle could be celebrating the life that the two of them had together, where she felt like a peer.

I hope this is useful. This has to be a tough time for you, but I hope it works out.",,,,
"The overwhelming majority of experts will advise you against breaking her heart over and over again by telling her he’s deceased. Find a good lie and stick with it...it will get easier with time.

Biggest of hugs to you. A very tough place for your family to be in. I’m sorry for your loss.",,,,
"Can you provide a citation for this? In my experience having my mother live with me for a few months during a tough time in her dementia, and having read/discussed quite a bit as my siblings and I struggled with a care plan, this advice seems counter to my experience. More importantly, it sounds contrary to the advice that the OP received from the charities they spoke with. My hunch is that those conversations had more bi-directional information flow, and that the OP's pool of charities have seasoned experts of their own. I'd be careful about dismissing their experts and confidently relaying the view of your preferred experts who agree that finding a good lie and sticking with it is the best approach.

I think the type of dementia and the current state of the OP's grandmother matters in choosing strategy. Based on the OP's description, she reminds me of my mom from a few years ago. It sounds like the OP's family is having a tough time finding a comfortable lie, and that the OP's grandma still too smart to believe the lie, and too inquisitive to give it a rest. Moreover, it doesn't sound like a grief loop that she's stuck in when the truth comes out. It's a ""what happens to me?"" and ""what happens to my house?"" loop. Like I said in one of my other comments, my advice is to help the OP's grandma grieve the loss of her son and the loss of her old life with her son as the family figures out how to deal with everyone's new life without him.",,,,
"It's called ""therapeutic lying."" For many health care providers it can be an ethically sticky area, but ""white lies"" and ""deflection"" are widely considered the most compassionate path in memory care. There's plenty of scholarly research about it, plus mainstream articles (/u/teashoesandhair, you may find something helpful for you and your situation in these articles):

Therapeutic Lying: A Contradiction in Terms (Psychiatry Today)

Therapeutic Lying to Comfort Loved Ones With Dementia (US News & World Report)

Telling the truth to people with dementia (Alzheimers Association)

'Therapeutic Lying' and Other Ways To Handle Patients With Dementia (Wall Street Journal)

"Thanks for the sources. You're right that this bibliography is potentially more helpful to /u/teashoesandhair than it is for me at this point. My brief skim of the material led me to find another piece:

""What is truth? An inquiry about truth and lying in dementia care"". Mental Health Foundation. 2016-12-13

I haven't had the time to read the materials at this page, but in short, it was an 18-month inquiry completed in 2014 by a panel of experts assembled by the Mental Health Foundation regarding the use of lying in dementia patient care. They define and name several grades of a spectrum from ""whole truth-telling"" to ""looking for alternative meaning"" to ""distraction"" to ""going along with"" to ""lying"". They recommend biasing toward ""whole truth-telling"", while cautiously acknowledging that steps toward ""lying"" may be necessary in certain contexts.

Thank you for the bibliography on therapeutic lying (and for introducing me to that term).",,,,
"My father died a year ago. My mother, who'd been married to him for 61 years, is hallucinating his presence. It sucks.

Contradicting a demented person doesn't help. When you contradict them, they re-experience the grief, and then they forget it all over again. This is hard both on you and on your grandma.

A thing about dementia that sucks: You need to start lying to the demented relative. I do mean ""need"". When telling the truth causes 30 minutes of grief, followed by complete forgetfulness of the grief, all you're doing is tormenting both yourself and the demented person. Lie. Say ""Oh, he's just run out on an errand. He'll be back."" Redirect the conversation. Telling the truth doesn't benefit anybody.",,,,
"If her medicine isn't time released then mix it in with pudding, soup or whatever. My dad won't take a pill so we crush them between two spoons and mix it in. Works great.
",,,,
"That’s for depression. It will say on the bottle something like ER (extended release). If nothing else, call the doctor or pharmacy and ask if it’s time release, meaning it slowly releases the medicine throughout the day. And the doctor might have some helpful tips for getting her to take it. I wish you the best of luck!",,,,
Call the pharmacy again to double check. Maybe you will get a different person.,,,,
"The doctor’s office could be open today. I’d try them again today and ask for the doctor’s nurse. Also, did you find out if it’s extended release? It’ll be on the bottle next to the name of the medicine. Probably written in smaller letters near the bottom is where you’ll find the brand name (should be Celexa) and it’ll say something like “substituted for Celexa” and next to “Celexa”, there will be SR (sustained release) or ER, something like that. (FYI: I’m a medical assistant with Xray and phlebotomy-drawing blood. So I do have some medical knowledge, but I’ve been a homemaker for a few years to homeschool my son and take care of my grandfather who has dementia. So I can be of some help, but not as much as a practicing nurse and/or doctor.)",,,,
"That’s a wonderful idea. If your grandmother is refusing it, try it in the oatmeal for breakfast or pudding for dessert. Something like that. Also, I’d definitely not mix it in an entire bowl of something unless you’re certain she’ll eat the entire thing. Otherwise, she won’t be getting the entire dose. I’m so glad you’ve been able to have some options! Good luck!! ❤️❤️",,,,
"you can also mix them in a favorite food or beverage like ice cream or hot chocolate, something you're reasonably sure they'll consume all of. you can also buy a pill crusher from Walgreens or another pharmacy.",,,,
"The reason why time release matters is because if it’s extended release, you can’t crush it. So if we can find out if it’s extended release, then you’ll know if it’s okay to crush.",,,,
"Ha! I'm on that. I don't think it can be crushed. My pills aren't large and my doc said I can half them (I was trying to wean myself off). So maybe half them then hide them in food. She probably won't notice it.
",,,,
"Maybe look into a pill crusher (I got one for my dad, who has some arthritis issues, from amazon). He puts it in her food (I would recommend limiting her portion so you ensure she eats what you want her too, then give her any additional food i.e. if you are giving her turkey and corn/stuffing, mix the meds in the stuffing, giver her that first, then give her the corn and turkey) It may not be the “optimal” way to give it to her, but it gets her something.",,,,
"Honestly, that's a great solution. Sometimes you have to be elaborate. When they fixate on going home, God help you if you try to dissuade them. ""But Mom! This is your home of 20 years!"" will not convince them. A quick drive is a great distraction. I usually brought my Mom over to the park and then we went home. But there were days even that didn't work and then nothing worked and then semi-hysteria. And yes, your Mom may try to get out and walk back home. So you need to ensure she's monitored and there are heavy duty locks on the doors or alarms or a tracking device on her. It's so difficult.
",,,,
"I’ve found with my FIL that getting to the fear is what really helps with him. A lot of times it is because he “doesn’t want to be left behind when we check out in the morning.” When I spend time convincing him he is home then two hours later he is up and upset again. BUT if I make eye contact with him, let him know I love him and would never leave him behind he will usually say “oh, you don’t know how happy it makes me to hear that!” and then he will sleep through the rest of the night.

The things that seem to work pretty well are reminding him that he is safe, I will always make sure he is safe and he has nothing to worry about.

I definitely feel for you.",,,,
"Your BIL does the right thing. The rule I learned a hard way is No Arguing. Tell her the pest control service is spraying chemicals there right now. Not safe to go today. There is no electricity there, let's stay here for the night. Just nothing bad like fire or flood.

Safety precautions: all doors leading outside (house front door, garden gates) to be locked at all times, keys kept out of sight. All windows to be fitted with keyed locks or stoppers preventing full opening. GPS tracking device is a good option, best if it can be worn at all times. An engraved non-removable bracelet is another option.",,,,
"Forgot to add. It is bad for everyone that she doesn't sleep at night. Ask her doctor for advice and may be prescription.

"My mom complained about this constantly. She has forgot she owned a home for over 30 years and skipped that stage of life and wants to go to “her mom’s house”. She has lived with us for over a year now in her granny unit. Tbh I came to the realization that she wasn’t getting better and chose quality of life versus trying these meds that didn’t work. I asked her neurologist to put her on anti-anxiety meds. In about 2 weeks she stopped asking to go home and really took the edge off of her. She still talks about going home, but usually I can tell her she can’t or redirect and it is better. Talk to your doctor about anti-depressants or anxiety meds to help.
",,,,
"I think this has to be a three part solution.

Lock and alarm everything for when she inevitably decides, at 3am, to walk ""home"". Double deadbolt locks work if someone is always there with the key. Otherwise at least childproof locks (those sliders at the top of the door for instance) on doors and windows as well as alarms so you know if she's wandering.

Meds. Ask about anti anxiety/sleeping meds to keep her from fixating on this to the point where she's getting up multiple times a night.

If she does get up, you're dealing with it the right way: redirect with plausible excuses and/or take her for a ride around the block. Of course you can't do that every two hours every night, thus the meds to try to keep it down to a dull roar. (And the locks and alarms in case she sneaks past you.)",,,,
"This is the most common thing my grandma does. Usually I just tell her that it's too late now, and we will take her tomorrow. And just repeating the same every time she asks.",,,,
"This is quite common. Remember with dementia, folks are living a younger version of themselves.

My dad recently asked his brother is he was going to shovel the snow at moms house( she passed away YEARS ago- early 00s).

The current solution is great, but perhaps start to surround her with things from her past that are familiar. It could help :)",,,,
"She is suffering from anxiety, could also be a UTI. We had that issue from time to time. Eventually got her confortable enough at our place that very seldom we hod that issue.

"We turned up the volume on notifications overnight on our Ring camera to wake us up if my mom goes out the door (and learned lots of deer are around at night, ha) We also talked to her Dr about and got night meds to help her sleep better. We also try to keep a schedule that she stays awake until 7PM, she was falling asleep at 4PM and waking up at midnight.

One thing I’ve read: when people with dementia want to go “home” they often mean their childhood home or somewhere else entirely and arguing “You ARE home” is useless and frustrating for everyone. Sometimes when my mom wants something unreasonable I say “Maybe (or even absolutely) tomorrow” vs arguing and it seems to calm her down. Best wishes!",,,,
"Sounds like you need to enact his directive or she can apply for guardianship. Depends where you guys are located, not sure what the regulations are in the states.

"A POA would give her the right to talk to his doctor's. See an elder lawyer I'm sure they could help. Has she just tried calling the doctor's office and asking if the doctor will talk with her? He might. He may not be able to tell her everything but may give her info on how to care for him etc. I had to do alot of my own research on what to expect and care for dementia on my own, the doctor did not give me that much info. Good luck
",,,,
I unfortunately I don't know. I just seeked legal advice for my mom to get medicaid and it was free. I found free legal advice through my state. I think it would be in your family best interest to find out what could be done. Maybe that's guardianship but I really don't know how it works. I'm sure she has rights since she is his spouse. There should be a Department on Aging and Elder Services by County you live in. So sorry for your struggles. ( Fyi you could try posting this question on FB dementia group huge followers may get some other responses to help),,,,
"It sounds like she needs to get power of attorney and make sure medical POA is included. If she's not sure she can handle it, is there someone else in the family he might trust? It might take catching him on a good day. He definitely shouldn't be driving, if he gets in an accident and they learn he has dementia, they could sue him for everything, not to mention he could hurt or kill someone or himself.",,,,
The other option is going completely over his head and getting guardianship over him. That'll take an attorney but then basically it relegates him to bring a child and her being the parent and she's in charge of how everything is handled from there on.,,,,
"She needs to get a Durable Power of Attorney signed and notarized before his ""forgetfulness"" gets worse. At the very least she needs him to sign a HIPA form for the doctor to be able to speak to her. Unfortunately it sounds like he's too stubborn to admit there is an issue.
",,,,
"Driving: Since he failed his cognitive test, tell his physician he gets lost driving & ask the doc to report him to the state for a review. This will start the process to revoke his license (if he can’t get a physician to say he’s medically OK to drive within 45 days) https://www.flhsmv.gov/driver-licenses-id-cards/florida-granddriver/medical-reporting-medical-review-process/ That way, it’s not family taking away his driving.",,,,
"Okay, this is good! The suggestion with the pictures in the other comment is a great idea, but if those don't work and your grandfather calls at night, absolutely convinced your grandmother is not with him, maybe confirming this helps. Like: ""yes, we know, she's not with you right now but sleeping over at a friend / our place etc., but she will absolutely be back in the morning!"". This could be a good short time solution to convince him everything is alright.

"Umm, my mom hasn't got this bad yet, I don't have special training but, I wonder if this might help... Get 2 large (well, maybe A4 size, or half that) colour photos of your grandma, one from when they were married and a current one. Put them together in the same frame, and keep it somewhere he always sees it. (labelled ""Rhonda 1952 ; Rhonda 2015) Your grandma could get a large locket necklace, and put her photo from 30 years ago, or her marriage time in it, and wear it around her neck. Idk but...

"Ohh, sad... It's impossible to know what's going on with him, without doctor checkup. Me, I'm not medical specialist, just a normal person, my mother had alzheimers diagnosis 10 years ago, I'm her full-time at-home carer. I did some short training courses for family carers, with the Alzheimers Australia organisation (now changed name to Dementia Aust).

It could be just a rough week - it could be he is dehydrated, which causes some sudden on-set temporary deterioration - it could be he has a UTI (urinary tract infection) , which also causes sudden on-set temporary deterioration - or, it could be the next stage on his journey - also, it could be just some bee in his bonnet about that particular topic. If somebody could get him to a doctors to check those 2 physical medical conditions, it would be good.

The lockdowns around the world, are effecting many memory lossed folk very badly, it could also be partly that - folk isolated, stuck inside the same walls, without daily stimulus of going around outside meeting people etc...

If he can still reply to most questions, that's a great sign. Everybody deteriorates at different pace - some faster sooner some slower later, sometimes momentary blips of apparent worsening... Never know how it's going to go until it's happening. Only doctors can check it out and attempt answers ...

I think Alzheimers org and Dementia org in your country have telephone helplines you can call, and ask them what's their professional opinion & thoughts about your questions.

Best of luck to you and your brother!",,,,
"Not to be bold, or intrusive, but why is no one supposed to know about his condition? This is worrisome because this is a progressive disease & if he is trying to manage his condition alone without a POA & someone who can intimately walk that journey with him, the time will come where it will likely hit a crisis point.

I say this not to scare you (even though I know from experience how scary this is) but because I want to spare you some of what we went through (are still going through) with my Mom. She declined rapidly & prior to that, I spent a full year TRYING to get things in place for her as I could see that there was progressive memory concerns.

Lack of insight is a hallmark of this condition & even though his doctor may be giving him advice, relying that the doctor is involved enough to catch the daily issues that arise or that your brother is cognitively able to process how to take care of himself properly is dangerous & fraught with potential downfalls. If not immediately, then sometime in the near future. A POA (while he still cognitively can consent to one) is a priority & a will & having discussions about end of life wishes would be a good idea too. Everything about this disease is difficult, but I can honestly tell you that preparing for the worst (as hard as it IS) is so much better than trying to handle a health crisis AND navigate the legal system to be able to advocate for your Loved One.

I echo the other Redditors who have suggested checking in with his Doctor (you can fill them in on what you've been noticing without asking them to break confidentiality) & contacting the Alzheimer's society as they have wonderful resources.

If you know who his doctor is, you can call & tell him your concerns for your brother, that's not against hippocratic oath & privacy policies, simply the doc can't give you any information about another patient. Yep, I understand peoples right to privacy re : their medical issues, plus like my mother, many oldies have stigma re : memory loss issues. Dang, can just make it sort of harder. The ""return to normality"" might take some long time, unfortunately... Umm, could you try get him on some other passtimes, like join a book club, or send him crossword puzzle books, or simple jigsaw puzzles, or .... Find him some additional activities to keep his brain stimulated. As they say ""use it or lose it""... Not miserable sure is great! :)",,,,
"If it is a significant slide suddenly from what you know his normal level is, you need to get him checked out immediately. This could be due to an UTI, a stroke, etc. Is there anyone else who lives with him that you could call and ask about the progression of symptoms? If you call and they say he is suddenly worse, that is a huge red flag that something is wrong and he needs to go to the doctor ASAP. If the person who lives with him says his behavior is par for the course, that's different. Like lookthepenguins said, this might just be the topic that is coming to mind for him at the moment.

This unnatural progression happened to me. My person had significant bleeding after hemorrhoid surgery, and all of the doctors and nurses read dementia in his chart and figured this level of confusion was normal. It ABSOLUTELY was not. I had to fight for him and take him to the ER. He was admitted, and surprise, surprise, he was severely anemic and the stitches had torn. They redid the stitches, gave him blood, and admitted him overnight. Guess who was back to normal in the morning?",,,,
"I'll be honest, it's very unlikely to get better, this is probably the new normal until his next slide. I can only speak with the experience of my father having vascular dementia, which is different, but he really only asks the same handful of questions these days. Still able to talk about other things, but they aren't ""safer ground"" like you say, and so he becomes a little confused or stressed. Does your brother have a regular doctor he sees regarding his alzheimers? If so, they should be notified of changes and he should be seen again asap. Even if it's just tracking his progression, that can be helpful, but worst case scenario this could indicate another health concern. Best of luck xx",,,,
"The only way to really know is to have him evaluated regularly. Does he have someone he lives with who can provide you information on a regular basis? Perhaps a friend or neighbor you are in contact with? There will be good days and bad days as Alzheimer's is a spectrum disease and he will likely vary from day to day and week to week, while getting progressively declining.",,,,
"Maybe try looking at pictures with her? Things she would find familiar(like family or where she grew up?) I would also recommend looking at the Alzheimer’s association page online for suggestions/resources they have always been helpful in my past experience

"My dad has Alzheimer's and I asked his neurologist about ""keeping his brain active"". We talked about crosswords, puzzles, etc. She said those are fine if your parent enjoys them but they aren't particularly good at ""challenging"" the mind. She said nothing is better than conversation with others. Your brain never knows what to expect when talking with others and must always be thinking/making connections.

"I've heard learning a new language helps.
",,,,
I like to ask questions about my dads first language. He teaches me expressions so he has to engage his brain. Hope this helps.,,,,
"Would she be at all interested in something like an iPad? I didn’t think my mom would be but she uses here mini a lot. She looks at pictures (all of the kids upload photos to a shared iCloud photo); we take her “with us” via FaceTime if cooking a new recipe or doing anything she might be interested in (my brother just hands off his phone to his kids and they take her on “tours”; she plays simple games like candy crush, solitaire, and mahjong; she checks the weather everywhere; oh and Facebook, which os new to her.

I don’t know what is available on this device as far as apps in her native language, but if that’s something she would enjoy — or recordings/music/audiobooks — that could be of interest.

As far as I know, there’s no medical evidence that “brain games” really help memory. But engaging with tasks that require organized thought over a period of time do seem to help. (Not a doctor so take my interpretation with a grain of salt.) Puzzles, card games, and block stacking toys all need that kind of concentration. So do most crafts.

I hope that everyone is able to break out of their Covid bubbles soon. If it’s warm enough there, remind local people to stop by—keeping their distance and masked, of course.",,,,
"Going through my 4th family member with this disease and it varies. In my early teens I thought my grandmother was teasing me. A few years ago when I father introduced himself to me and asked me my name it took everything to prevent myself from crying. Not because I was forgotten but because he had entered this stage of the disease and it doesn't get better. There will be moments where they will suddenly remember you or they will see you as you were when you were just a child but these memories start to fade like a radio signal.

One thing I can recommend is start a photo book for her (I had a few printed since wire-bound books were not recommended). With family members and their names. If she enjoys music then get the MP3s and a player with built-in speakers.",,,,
"Thanks. Also one more thing and this has no medical backing or studies behind it. In fact, I may be wrong but I never correct someone with Alz when they mis-state something. I've seen some family members treat it as comical and the person usually shuts down out of confusion and embarrassment. I go along with what they state and try to get them to adjust. Once my father was insisting he needed to leave for work cause he was going to be late. He was retired by then and it was 9pm. He should be heading to bed soon. I quickly made up a lie and told him that he took the day off to help my older sister with a household repair. Told him I was waiting around so I can get a ride. We talked for a bit about going to Home Depot (his Toys R Us) and getting some supplies he needed. Intentionally started an argument over Lowes vs Home Depot and then sports. I put on the 10pm news, got him to fall asleep. Once the nurse and I got him into bed peacefully, I got the all clear and she could take over from there. Also if your grandmother is a wanderer the best investment is a door chime like they have at stores. You have the caretaker activate it at night. It will usually scared them into not leaving or at the very least alert someone else that they have attempted to leave.
",,,,
"It may be that she remembers you as a much younger child. So this adult in front of her is major cognitive dissonance. I don’t think our relative recognizes her older grandkids because in her mind, they are still babies/toddlers. She knows she has grandkids, but they aren’t the big people in front of her.

Also seconding not contradicting her. I find she is much calmer if you just go along with her reality at the moment, within reason, and try to redirect or deflect if necessary. The topic will be forgotten soon.

Best of luck on this journey. It is an extended grieving process, and no one gets to dictate how you process things. Indifference is still a reaction and don’t feel bad for your current feelings, they may evolve over time.",,,,
"Going through this as the primary care giver for my grandmother. It’s a weird feeling. But as the other commenter mentioned, find photos of you two together, maybe with other close family members too, save them on your phone where you can pulll them up quick, or old actual photos and put them somewhere high where you can grab them and your grandma won’t find and move them. It’s a rough battle ahead. Make sure to let the rest of the family know it’s a good time to come visit as she’s entering the later stages now. Best of luck, message me whenever if you ever need to talk.
",,,,
"We’ve been going through the same thing with my grandpa. He doesn’t remember us but seem to recognize us as his “friends”. It’s very sad all around, especially for my grandma. I would say what helps is we try to see him as a different person. It’s only the remnants of his brain left. We try to make humor of it when we can and that seems to help my mom and my aunt (his daughters). We also made a picture book too, of different objects that are labeled, and a page with his name, birthday, and all his relatives. He looks at it often and he loved it. It’s called a memory book, I believe.",,,,
"I would have your mom contact the doctor. See if there is any medication or therapy program you can get him into.

You can create a guardianship without his permission with court intervention...,,,,
Does your country have a crisis team ? Where I am you can call mental health for older adults if there is aggression towards people and they will come out and assess. I was told to acknowledge their concerns/fears then move the conversation on but I agree it doesn’t really work. Can you walk away and leave him alone when he gets like that ? It might be better to not engage at all.,,,,
"Yeah it sucks. There’s not really anything you can do to change his behaviour. His medical team might be able to prescribe something to help but it won’t stop the behaviours completely. Talk to your mum about how much she can handle or wants to handle? If it’s too much for her it might be time to be looking at care, even just temporary to give her some respite. I don’t know if they do short term stays in homes where you are but some time away from him will likely be good for her.",,,,

"I hate this with my Dad. It devastates me every time.

It's one of those times when you do have to lie and you carry the pain of the lie.

I try not to lie directly. I'll say something like ""well who knows? Let's hope so. There are lots of new medicines coming out all the time"". Say it in a positive way.

Then shut the subject down and distract. Think of something positive to say, change locations (take him out or just move rooms), give him something to eat or drink.",,,,
"Oh I'm sorry. It's such a miserable situation.

I've found it's pointless being honest. All is does is upset the person, then they forget, ask again and get upset again. It's better to fudge the truth and tell yourself your doing it for absolutely the right reasons.",,,,
"I didn’t like lying at first but it is really a good, kind, compassionate tool in your tool box. If they don’t have the capacity to reason, there is no sense hurting or upsetting them.

I’ve been lucky so far regarding that question. Once my mother asked, “am I getting worse or how is the weather?”

I grabbed on to the weather question (diversion tool) and said, “It’s pretty windy outside.”",,,,
I loath lying but I learned really quickly that their mental well being is of prime importance. It hurts you more than them but learn the art of distraction too. It takes your mind off the guilt but way more importantly they forget what was in their mind at that time.,,,,
"She knows she's forgetful. What seems to bother her is social awkwardness. So just expect it, keep being a good neighbor, and maybe get some contact info of her family if her yard starts looking raggedy. That may be a sign she's starting to need help. :)

"Just roll with it. It's likely that as you chat her memory will come back. Transitionary times can be particularly difficult for dementia sufferers.

"It's a pretty common thing for people to struggle with. If it helps, there's a lot of ""unlies"" you can tell that aren't technically lies without being the whole truth either.

In particular, focus on the feelings, either your own or the other person's. Something like ""I'm so happy you came over to chat"" or similar isn't really agreeing that this is the first time they met, but it isn't hurtful either.

Or if someone tells you their spouse is hiding things on them which is why they can't find anything, saying ""you must feel very frustrated"" is a great middle ground.",,,,

"It is really hard to do, but try changing the subject or distracting her with something she might enjoy. It can be frightening when they insist on going somewhere and she might start ""wandering"" by leaving the home when no one is there. My mom's neighbor found my mom doing just that but she only made it to her driveway when he spotted her. Luckily he got her back inside. Shortly after this and a few other close calls we found a memory care facility. There comes a point when they cannot be left alone at all. She was so adamant about staying in her condo, but we all realized it was just too dangerous to leave her alone at all.

This is a very difficult disease because they no longer use logic or reason in their thought process. When they are stuck on something they can be very stubborn too.

It may be time for your family to get more help from professionals in your area. Talking to her doctor may help you get started.",,,,
"Can you distract her from actually going anywhere by saying, ""Okay. We'll go home, but first....""

Have to get a shower, dressed, make the bed, etc. All those little things. One thing at a time.

The ""therapeutic lie"" is one that doesn't destroy her memories of the house, like it was torn down, but that you have no car, or gas to put in it, or a flat tire, or the road in front of the house or on the way is torn up. It depends on what she will accept.

After many TLies, I always wanted to go crazy, like tell her the elephants got loose from the circus, but I was always afraid that she would insist on seeing the circus.",,,,

"If it was just confusion from time to time, I would think it's probably just all the stress she is under. But making up false stories is not a good sign. I was reading that caregivers for Alzheimer's (especially for those living with and caring for someone everyday) was in itself a risk factor for getting Alzheimer's. Also, there is a family connection for your mom. Maybe it's time your mom started taking care of herself. Maybe She needs to see her doctor.
",,,,
"I'm so sorry you and your family are going through this. Dementia and general memory problems can be caused by many things including stress, medications and several diseases. It does not mean she has Alzheimer's disease, but with a family history it is important to check it out. Get her to set up a doctors appointment and if you can't be there with her, try calling or writing a letter to her doctor explaining what you have witnessed.

If she is the primary caregiver, do what you can to ease the burden when you can. How long has it been since she took a vacation, went to the dentist, went to her own doctor or went out to lunch on her own? It is very common for caregivers to neglect themselves as there is too much for a single person to handle.

If you aren't able to help in that way because you live elsewhere or your schedule is restrictive search the Internet for adult day cares, support groups, even just fun activities your mom might enjoy taking your grandmother to. I considered myself knowledgable in my area and discovered a program again the other day. When I first took note of the program a few years ago it didn't fit our needs and I forgot about it until someone brought it to my attention last week and I realized it would be perfect. (Last week I realized I no longer have to search out Velcro shoes for my SO, because while they were necessary at one time so he could put on and take off his own shoes but a friend pointed out I put on and take off his shoes so who cares if they tie or Velcro).

Just try to be supportive of your mom personally as well. This is scary for everyone involved but even if she is in denial, it must be terrifying. If you can bring her favorite lunch by, or have a pizza delivered:) I have a dear friend who visits once a month and sits with my SO for a few hours and pushes me out of the house to do something for myself. Last month she was on vacation across the globe on the day of her normal visit. I received a call from her the day before and she asked me if I would be home. Around the time she normally shows up the doorbell rang and it was a grocery store delivery guy with a few staples and one of my favorite candy bars. It was kind and I know that she spent less than a meal out, in fact the call may have cost more than the groceries! It doesn't have to be a grand gesture though, sometimes just a call or a card that says you are thinking of her will do it!",,,,
"I would speak to her about it in a supportive and comforting way. Make sure she doesn't feel accused. Tell her you are asking her to make a doctors appointment and have it checked out. If she resists ask her to do it as a personal favor to you. It will probably go very smoothly, but if it does not stay calm and either way make sure her doctor is informed of what is happening and take care of yourself as well. Feel free to reach out for support anytime.",,,,
"Sorry for what your going through my father was diagnosed 2 days ago. It's hard to talk to them about it because they may get agitated but we kept it light and funny and my dad complied with getting the tests done. Go to a geriatric memory Doctor as soon as you can so you can get answers. Best of luck to you and your family.
",,,,
"I really hope your mom can get some respite care so she can have a break.

Here, either one we go with for mom does not work. If her parents are alive (""we'll go see them some other time,"" etc), we're bad people for not letting her see them right away. If they are dead, we are bad people for lying to her because, ""My parents are alive and you're a stupid idiot."" I think with some dementia sufferers, therapeutic lying just does not work. It's upsetting because I see videos of other caregivers using the technique and it works like a charm. Sigh. My mom is one of the ones where it does not work at all. We try to distract her, etc.

She doesn't have any hobbies or interests (even before dementia she didn't do much), so she fixates on what she knows. And she is an angry, aggressive person a lot, so we get told off no matter what we say.

I really hope one of your option works for you. It's really great that you're trying to find a solution.",,,,
"Correcting will likely lead to more agitation. Id say ""oh she is at the store, she'll be back soon"" and, if he insists, yes, calling from the other room might be a good option.

She could call & say she is at the store buying groceries & needs his help to remind her his favorite snack or soft drink. A call might ease his mind.,,,,
"More elaborate charade is what my sister and I do with my mother. ANY attempt to argue ‘reality’ goes nowhere. And, when the moment is over, she doesn’t remember the incidents. So....lie with benevolence.

"My mom died of this.

There is no therapeutic benefit to reiterating the facts they've forgotten. No amount of repetition is going to strengthen, help solidify memory of the facts.

For that reason, my opinion is that there's a cruelty to ""reminding"" of painful facts they've forgotten.

For every potentially upsetting fact that came up, I would be as creative and imaginative as necessary to come up with a casual answer that wasn't painful or scary.

I figured it was painful and scary enough living with the confusion and uncertainty, so it seemed like the main gift I could give was never adding to that if I could help it.",,,,
"This is basically what we're told to do in our dementia specific training at work. Imagine being told someone you love is dead. It's devastating. There's no reason to make them relive that every few hours.

One woman I worked with would usually remember after asking me where her husband was and would say ""He's in heaven, right?"" In her case I would say yes and that it had been a while since he passed away. That was one of the rare cases when someone I worked with could remember on her own.",,,,
"As difficult as it was at first to ""lie"" to my mother, I found placating her was the only way both of us would walk away from a confusing moment stress free. I'm constantly having to tell her that her doggy is getting groomed and will be home soon, he died almost a year ago :(
",,,,
"Unfortunately there’s not really any way to work on or improve her memory. But activities that mentally challenge her (without overwhelming her) are great and will likely make her feel more positive. And the better you feel the better your brain works.

It sounds like your were getting her engaged mentally and socially. A lot of times people with dementia struggle to initiate that needed engagement, so you providing that engagement helped meet her needs and made her feel better. The same happens for those of us without dementia. If I play a board game with my friends I’ll feel better since I was able to socialize and challenge myself mentally. People with dementia just don’t have the communication skills to say “hey let’s do something together”.

Keeping a list of activities you can do with her would be an awesome idea. There are lists online of ideas. Just try to keep activities to things that she enjoys and are not too easy or too challenging. Talk to your parents to see what hobbies your granny liked when she was younger.",,,,
"I'd think that, as something to do and a way to connect, there's no harm. If she seems happy to engage with you in that way, that's great! My own mum would find something like that very frustrating, that we were treating her like a child, and maybe become angry... So I would keep an eye out for signs of frustration or upset and stop if and when they emerge. But there truly are all types! It's possible that your grandmother is having a grand time with it!

As far as a 'point' to it... Well. No. You're not building her memory by asking her to count or name things. And I'd wager that after she named the plate, if you tried again the next day she probably wouldn't have an easier time with that object. And ultimately, you just can't stop the disease from progressing.

But connecting with others is so hard for folks with dementia and that has tremendous value. So I return to engagement. If it's a thing for you to do together and that she enjoys, that's reason enough!",,,,

"Can tell you that just sitting around all day when elderly does impact thinking. Even zoo animals are now provided opportunities to play with toys and challenges to stimulate their brains.

Also elderly people lose a lot of muscle
and a sedentary life style then leads to problems getting up and moving, balancing, coordination so they don’t want to move. Add in arthritis and you can see how it all gets to that place.

Provide her with mental stimulation from old photos, music, and to the extent possible, walks and some basic exercises. Maybe a physical therapist herbalist can suggest some that won’t be overwhelming.

Take her out for drives; maybe visit a playground or park. See how it goes.",,,,
"Hmm, I get what you're meaning, but that, pointing to a plate and asking ""what's that?"", sounds a bit condescending, sort of. Dude, if she's forgotten what ""plate"" and ""fork"" are, no amount of you quizzing her is going to bring it back.

It absolutely would be great to find some other activities, though, appropriate for her ability & interests...

I don't know... A jar of different coloured buttons to sort into same-colored piles, (talking about objects of that colour, sounds beyond her, though) ..

I've found that some kids activity books or matching-cards have good stuff in them. Short, colourful, not hard. (eg matching cards - monkey/banana, apple/horse, dog/steak, carrot/rabbit; or sports / whatever) Old-style nursery rhymes if you read to her & show nice old-style pictures, from her era - she'll probably still remember those.

Sitting quoits - sometimes I play sitting quoits with my mum, got a dozen colourful kids plastic ones from toy shop, try toss them over an orange, an apple, a coke can, spread out on the floor. (lot of action for me, to go pick them up every time lol)

An oldstyle dollhouse, (or even a big picture of one) sorting the items into the appropriate rooms...

ELLA FITZGERALD hymns!! My mum (88 yrs old) since 50 yrs hardly ever went to church, I know she used to when she was a kid. One day I put on a CD Ella Fitzgerald hymns, and you could have KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH A FEATHER, my mum started to SING ALONG with them!!! I was SO shocked!! A lot of oldies, went to church when they were kids - can't remember 5 minutes ago, can remember stuff learnt as child.

MUSIC is a huge evocative reminder, you might get some reactions if you find her old favourites music.

Good on you for trying, hope you find some cool activities for yr gran!",,,,

"As the disease progresses, the memories that she has access too are older and older. In her head/reality she could very well be 30/40+ years younger and wondering why she isn't home, especially if she at some point in time lived in a different house. They may not even be complete memories, but her subconsciously trying to fill in the gaps of the bits and pieces she has.

Have you tried asking her what year it is, to see what her reality orientation is?

Currently my 77yo grandma with Alzheimer's seems sharp as a tack when you talk to her until you start talking about something that would orient her to time and place. In her reality she is about 40 years younger and thinks that I am my mother in her teens (I'm not in my teens but I look super young). She goes grocery shopping and buys food to feed a family of 6 instead of just her",,,,
"A lot of times, it seems like asking to ""go home"" is asking to be in a familiar place, with familiar people, where she knows what to do and who everyone is. Sometimes they're referring to an actual place, but sometimes it's a state of mind.

I'm sure you've realized that rationalizing and explaining doesn't work. Have you tried distracting her, by asking what the house I should like, what she does there, what the yard is like, what about the neighbors... sometimes talking about it is enough. Other times, a switch to a different topic is best.. asking about things she likes, what her dmaily was like growing up... safe topics.

As far as happening early AM or late at night, it might be because she's tired. It might also be because morning and night are typically the times we are at home, with the middle of the day spent at work and school. Her body may be sort of hard wired to think she should be home. Try playing music she likes when she starts getting worked up, and keeping busy with simple, calming tasks like folding laundry, sorting buttons, etc.",,,,
"She's looking for her childhood home with the people in it that she knew when she was young (Mom, Dad, siblings, cousins, etc). It's very common in dementia sufferers. Distraction, promises to go ""tomorrow"", etc all work to help calm the associated agitation.

"Yes! I work in memory care and this is accurate. I've heard people call them 'theraputic lies'. We have a resident who always asks if her husband is coming to get her and we always tell her a certain time. If we explained the truth, that he died several years ago, it would just make her upset, anxious, and believe we were lying to her and keeping her against her will.

The biggest thing I have noticed has been they just want to be listened to. Whether they can form coherent sentences/ideas or not, they want to feel heard and validated. OP, try the best you can to listen to her and ask questions about what the home looks like or where it is. If she cant answer, reassure her that its okay to forget and sometimes we all forget things. try to distract her with something you know she enjoys. And music does wonders, even at the latest stages of dementia! I have seen people who can't string together a sentence be able to remember the tune and lyrics of their favorite songs.",,,,

Eventually - maybe after two months - he stopped talking about going home as frequently and over time it ceased altogether.

I don't see any way around getting up and reassuring her that she is going home ""soon"". Hopefully it's just a temporary thing and you'll go back to full nights of sleep.

As /u/not-rocket-science said, consider discussing the situation with her doctor - and much respect for taking care of her at home. Best of luck!",,,,
"My grandmother is living with my mother and has asked to go home too, she refuses to go to bed when she's in that state and gets aggressive and mean. My mother calls me when it happens and I talk to her, tell her ""I'll be there first thing in the morning but not before so you may as well go to bed"" and it's enough to satisfy her (for now). When she wakes up I'm there and she has no memory of it. We take drives a couple of times a week to the area where she raised her kids, she reminisces and is pretty happy by the end of it.
",,,,
"I showed photos of my mother's old homes and her animals and distracted her with those. I think distraction and delay tactics work best. Nowadays, a couple years on, I think her memories of what she thought of as home have gone and she doesn't want to go home anymore .
",,,,
"If it's possible to make her more active and awake during the day, she may be better able to sleep through the night. Consider medication as well.

Generally just delaying with telling her they will be here after her nap or that they called and said they aren't ready yet and that she can keep sleeping and that you'll come get her as soon as they arrive would be my tactics. Assure her that you'll be watching out and that she is safe and fine.",,,,
"My late grandma would say the same. My mother still owned the house she lived in all her life so she would constantly drive between the two often up to twice a week (100 mile one way) to placate her. She was highly intelligent and a dominant personality so couldn't be reasoned with. I found that it was best to answer a question with another question, that was the only way to avoid her bending the conversation to her demands and driving my mother to tears. We all had to work to keep her awake until midnight at least so that we could all get sleep. My grandma told us she wanted to die and stopped eating. We coaxed her and spoonfed her as well as we could and brought her to doctors but she slipped into unconsciousness and died within a day.

"There are lots of things that can cause quick changes in capacity/behaviour. Big culprits are medicines that don't agree with one another, and urinary tract infections. Do you know if her doc checked these?
",,,,
"I’m not a doctor but have a small amount of experience with dementia and a big big trigger for decline can be stress.

If she is forgetting whole shows right after watching there may have been other earlier signs that were missed.

She however was probably aware that things weren’t right but definitely couldn’t figure it out, she might’ve just thought ‘that’s getting older’

With her awareness of something not being right and then having the doctor tell her she has dementia she probably got very emotional.

Emotion is harder to forget and can have a really big effect on someone.

My grandmother recently lost her best friend. She passed away and none of us knew and she instantly went into a decline.

The week before I was talking to my sister about how clear she was, she was remembering things I had said earlier in the day, that certain people were coming over. The second she found out about her friend she went into overload.

She was asking if I was her grandson, she was asking my cousin if she was going to have children (she’s married and has two teenagers who are out 3-4 times a week).

It was so sudden and so drastic and sometimes all it takes for a decline.

Dementia sucks because people can be going along fine and on a nice plateau then all of a sudden they are in a decline and it can really seem like night and day.

You gran is going to go through these declines and they happen fast or slow or sometimes it seems like over night.

Get her mind off of things, go shopping, go to the cinema, anything she likes to do or has enjoyed that don’t take too much problem solving.

It’s hard and she’s so happy you are there for her even if it doesn’t seem like it.

It’s not going to get easier and I’m not saying that as a reprimand. Just prepare yourself that it won’t, it’s a horrible disease to watch it’s very confusing and can really take it’s toll on you.

It’s going to happen fast and slow, sometimes overnight sometimes it takes months. Stay strong and take care of yourself.

"When I was caring for my mother she did this same thing. I'd already came to peace with the fact that my mom, my REAL mom, was gone and this person was just the shell of the woman she once was. When she'd ask about my ex-husband I'd give her a positive but limited answer.... Her: How's Bob doing? Me: He's doing great. I'd never bring up the fact we were divorced or that he's really a jerk because it's not relevant information in her world and just confused her more.

More or less, I'd just give the appropriate/expected answer. For example:

She'd ask me about dead relatives and I'd just say ""I haven't seen them in a while."" She'd ask if they were ok and I'd say yes.

Her: How's your mother and daddy? (lots of times she didn't recognize me). me: My parents are doing great.

Her: Have you seen my mom? me: No I haven't seen her lately.

When she'd have lucid moments and recognize me, she'd ask where daddy (my dad, her husband) was. I'd always say he was at work.

When she was having a bad day she'd get mad and say, ""why do you keep calling me mother?!"" I'd just smile and say, ""because you remind me of her. I had the best mom in the world.""

I'd also use redirection. I'd redirect her attention to something else to break that thought process. She's ask me for the 100th time what she's supposed to be doing and I'd say, ""Look at that cloud, looks like it might rain.""

I think the key is to join them in their world, their reality. Trying to make them join your world confuses and upsets them. I used to tell people it was like mental gymnastics....always jumping around and totally exhausting. Don't try to explain things in depth to her. Her mind can only do one thing at a time now, so keep everything simple, like you would with a toddler. It's hard, but don't sweat the small stuff. Pick your battles wisely. Don't take her comments and questions personally. I found it easier to call her by her first name and kind of distance myself from the situation. Don't ever feel bad about venting or ranting. Cry when you need to. Laugh a lot (even at inappropriate things). This is the hardest job in the world. Everything will be ok in the end, but getting to the end is stressful.",,,,

PREDICTIO.....",,,,
"First of all, I'm sorry to be hear about your Grandma's health. Alzheimer's is a tough disease for everyone involved.

My grandmother was diagnosed very early. Every person is different and so every case of Alzheimer's is different, but we found that she forgot pretty early on that she was ever diagnosed. I made the mistake of reminding her once in a while and it just seemed like it made her feel bad about herself. Eventually, we/I realized the best thing for her was to go with the flow - or her flow more specifically - and to be a gentle guide to a calmer place when needed. Sometimes she'd catch herself early on, but I think the nature of the disease prevented her from even recognizing the symptoms most of the time. She'd forget where she's going, but wouldn't remember how many times she'd done so in the last week, so I don't think it came up much even early on.

I don't know how things will progress for your grandma, but I do know that there will be a point in the not-too-distant future where she won't be able to recognize her own symptoms. I'd ask yourself if there is more opportunity to worry about what the diagnosis means in the meantime than to worry about the symptoms she's experiencing without explanation. I think I'd prefer not to know after my experience with my grandmother.

I read recently that this is a topic of study now that testing has advanced to earlier diagnoses. You might do some reading to learn more about what the experts say.

Edit: I forgot my advice - learn to live in the moment when you're with your grandma. She won't have a choice, so you'll best connect when you join her. Distractions are more effective than rationalizations and the truth doesn't matter when you just forget it, so play along with the delusions and lie when you need to. It's often kinder and less unsettling for her than telling the truth. For my Grandma it was always ""The children are at school"" or something similar, for example.",,,,
"Yes.. my mother isn’t “wealthy” but well off for a widow with little to no debts. Biggest question is, did she come from a more “frugal” means? My mom’s mind is really that if when she was a teen.. growing up dirt poor. So she saves literally everything. She claims she only makes a $150 in paychecks each month. She is always wary of spending anything. I manage her cash and have stripped her of debit cards and cash in general Because she would hide it and forget it.
",,,,
"My LO suddenly became extremely concerned about “cutting it off” meaning anything that used electricity. She was turning off lights which created fall risks, getting frustrated with any light left on anything electronic, such as the light on the TV turning from green to red indicating it was off. Over and over she unplugged all the TVs in the house to get those red lights to go out and then wondered why the TVs didn’t come on the next time she used the remote. She lived an upper middle-class lifestyle her entire life, but we realized that in the 1930s and 1940s when she was growing up, being careful to not waste electricity was probably the norm.

In other words, yes, this is normal. She’s reverting to her childhood.",,,,
"I think this is it. They revert back to what things cost back in the day or what they were making back then.
",,,,
"Yes, *as long as* the hallucination or delusion, by itself, isn't causing him distress, then don't argue. You don't necessarily have to fully engage in the sense of pretending you see them, too, but you don't want to argue with his reality, either. As you've seen, it just upsets him to be told those people aren't really there - and, I mean, if you think about it, if you were just having a nice chat with your brother, how would you feel if somebody told you you were actually talking to a wall? Probably embarassed, angry, scared, etc.

It's different, of course, if it's an upsetting delusion/hallucination or causing him to behave in ways that put him and/or others in danger. Then you have to act, and those are tricky as hell to navigate, so hopefully it won't get to that point for you. But if he's just enjoying a nice chat with the nice invisible ladies, let it go.",,,,
"With dementia, the person lives entirely in the moment... they can't make plans, and they generally can't remember most things, either. So your only role with them is to make them comfortable in this moment... and the next moment... and the next moment.

He isn't going to get better. Dementia only gets worse, but at different rates for different people.

If he's happy talking to the children, there's no harm in that and feel free to engage with him in this fantasy. He's happy. He's enjoying himself for the moment. Don't steal that from him.

People with dementia know something is wrong, but they generally can't figure out why they feel odd, out of place, confused, or just ""off"". So they get frustrated, and can spiral into anger, sadness, etc.

So if he's enjoying the moment, let him have it. There are few ""good"" times with dementia, so when he's not spinning in frustration or anger over his diminished capabilities, go with it! This is now improv theater and you need to react to the reality your grandfather is creating.

Anecdote: My dad's Alzheimers with Lewy Body diagnosis is pretty new, and he's still pretty good most of the time. But a stressful situation a couple weeks ago sent his dementia into overdrive and made him hallucinate that I was his best friend from childhood (Mike; who passed away almost 10 years ago). My Dad then proceeded to have this amazing conversation with me (playing Mike) reminiscing about the shenanigans these two troublemakers got up to when they were kids. His eyes lit up and he was SO HAPPY to talk to his old friend Mike again!!

I was honored to be able to give him those moments of happiness.

I hope you can do the same for your grandfather.",,,,
"As a nurse, I don't go alone with hallucinations or delusions, but on the same token I present what I see in a way (as best possible) that I'm not arguing with the person... such as ""I believe you are seeing what you see, but this is what I see _______"".

"This is quite a complex combination of obesity, diabetes, dementia, and food intake, which is unfortunately not untypical. Although the individual interactions are understood to some degree, I think science is just beginning to understand the full picture.

You are certainly correct that this is a contributing factor to the progression of the disease. Unfortunately, intervention is difficult, especially if you have an enabler in the household.

You could try to replace the food in question with low glycemic alternatives. Wholegrain bread instead of white bread, low sugar cookies, dark chocolate instead of ""milk"" chocolate, full fat milk instead of semi skimmed, etc. And you should avoid anything marketed as ""low fat"", because those products are usually stuffed with sugar.",,,,
"I don't know if this will help you, but when my mum started confusing words and ideas to the point that I didn't understand, I'd try to ask really general questions that didn't take up the content of what she was saying. So, like, if she seemed really excited about what she was saying, I'd say, ""you seem really happy about that - is it a good thing?"" Or, if she seemed grumpy, ""I can tell that you're upset about it. Is there anything I can do to help?"" Or, if I really didn't know at all how she was feeling, ""is that a good thing?"" If she confirmed it was a good thing, ""well that's great!""

I think a big lightbulb moment for me was realizing that her feelings remained intact longer than her reason. Validating her feelings helped her to feel heard and safe, which kept our relationship intact longer.",,,,
"""what do you think?"" ""What would you do?"" ""I'm not sure, but I can look into it and get back to you."" YMMV.
",,,,
"In my experience, there is no correcting. Gave up on that a while ago. Can you say something like “that’s a good question, I’m not sure.” Anything that draws attention away from her not making sense. If it doesn’t compromise their safety, I just go with it. I generally have no good outcomes from correcting anything. It just causes frustration and anxiety. Live on Jupiter with her the best you can. If she asks you for something and you don’t understand, maybe hand her a glass of water or something and if she says “that’s not what I want” say “oh, I must have misheard you.” By then she may have forgotten and you can redirect. In my experience a lot of questions just need acknowledgement, not necessarily a specific answer. But, your mom may be different.
",,,,
"Can you split them into different questions? So lets say she combines it. Can you take part of the question and see if she can clarify what she meant? If she can, answer that question. You may have to go even vaguer and just mention the general theme and see if she can clarify herself more.

For us, I think my grandmother's verbal skills made her seem more confused than she was. Maybe I'm in denial (even a year post her passing) but sometimes I think back to some of the random stuff she said and I think it was just misplaced in context (ie she was remembering a topic from yesterday) than just not being cognitive of anything.

Unfortunately, it's going to be hard, especially when the person may not be able to mentally process the diagnosis due to the diagnosis or just not wanting to accept it. Give her room to talk. Even if she's going off course and see if you can pick up a theme. Otherwise, like people said, if you can't figure it out, drop it and just say ""Well, we'll figure it out later. How about we (start talking about something else)."" When my grandmother was super persistent, we either had to admit we didn't know what she was talking about or we'd finally get it after a while of back and forth.",,,,
"I only have a beginners understanding of dementia, but I know there are so many different kinda and symptoms as well. Depression is a common one. My siblings dad has dementia and they confiscated his guns almost right away. He also lives alone, and has hallucinations and forgets things. If your dad has guns take them.

Aside from that, why Free Willy? Do you have memories of this movie? Have you asked him what he takes away from it? I think you should watch free willy with him and see what's up.",,,,
"I would hate if my loved one asked me if I knew I was losing my mind during a moment of clarity. And I know when I confront my mom in a similar way she becomes defensive.

Maybe consider asking her about her past in those moments. What was her youth like? What were you grandparents like? Does she recall that special memory of a favorite birthday that you have? What's her favorite memory overall? Her wedding? A job promotion? Take these moments to use your mom's candor to learn about her.

Obviously, stick to positive conversation topics and watch for her becoming agitated. If you see any signs of her becoming frustrated abandon the topic and try discussing something else",,,,
"Good reply, good tactic!

OP, idk, if you really feel you need to, could perhaps refer to her ""memory loss issues"" but asking/telling her she's ""losing / lost her mind"" that's rather confronting and at this point, a cruel way to phrase it. I'm sure you don't intend to be mean.

If she has moments of clarity though, for sure, ask about old times. Try playing her old favourite music, people will very frequently have positive happy response to old familiar music, it's so evocative. Check out dementia .org &/ alzheimers .org for excellent expert informative practical resources, tips, info, etc regarding care of & communication with the memory lossed. best of luck!",,,,
"I'm only a nursing student, but a lot of the information I have read suggests to ""exist in the moment with the person with Dementia, not trying to explain away their thoughts and beliefs.""

First off, I'm terribly sorry about your Grandfather's death and how distressing the situation is with your Grandmothers illness and calls.

Have you tried reassuring her that he will be home in a minute? I know it is lying but ultimately it could be best for you all. Maybe a note to her at her house saying he is at the shops or running errands and see how she feels about that? And asking the aides to confirm it?

Best wishes and good luck.",,,,
"Exactly this. OP you need not keep having her re-experience over and over and over again that he has passed. The memory doesn't and won't sink in - but the emotional distress will affect her EVERY time. Experiment with different reassuring statements- ""I'm sure he' s fine"" ""he's run to the store"" ""he told me not to worry, he's running late."" people always struggle with feeling dishonest- but those with dementia cannot change they way they process information- we have to change the way we present information- it becomes less about being absolutely factual and more about being comforting and compassionate. To insist on a reality that they cannot comprehend is a problem. Think of it like speaking with a child, would you drop all the harsh awful facts of life on them- or would you instead take into account their innocence and modify your behavior to fit their abilities and comprehension? This is not just us suggesting, this is the method of memory care professionals everywhere. Now, re the agitation, the frustration is real, I gather that! Perhaps you'd be best served to turn the ringer off sometimes. Or better yet, add another line for regular life, and only listen to/respond to her messages as much as it works for u to do so. Hope this is helpful. Its a tough road you are on, take care and all the best.

"I would tell my father that my deceased mother was out shopping, taking a nap, working in the garden; whatever would soothe him. Making him learn of her death time after time was unnecessarily cruel. Consider leaving a note that says he will be home from work in an hour. Each time she finds it, the clock will reset for her.
",,,,
"If you can find out who your dad’s doctor is, it wouldn’t hurt to call and get their advice, and see if you can help get him an appointment.

Tread lightly though - this can be a really sensitive topic to bring up with aging parents... it’s not easy to know that your mind is starting to slip and then to worry about what admitting it will all mean such as loss of freedom/abilities, people thinking less of you, etc. You know your dad best - approach him in a way that you think will get him to listen or finding supportive friends and family members to help talk with him too.

Best of luck, OP. You concerns are valid!",,,,

"It sounds like she might be sundowning. This is the kind of thing that people do when they had specific roles, and often happens at school “picking up” time.

Have you asked her why she wants to go see them? It may be that she’s seeking comfort from them, or if she always used to do the school pick up she might have regressed to that time in her life and be anxious that she isn’t fulfilling her role as your mother.

To her, home might be another word for hugs, or a comfort that her parents provided her, and she’s unable to express it as such.

With regards to telling her they’re dead, there are ways of doing this while reducing the distress it might cause. Perhaps having an area with photos and (fake) candles that she can go to when she’s missing them, or going through a book of memories and asking her to talk about them and funny things that happened in the past. Her long term memory won’t be as affected as her short, and talking about the past may help her to remember some of what’s happening now.

The other alternative is to lie and say “they’re coming later” or “we’ve got a taxi booked for tonight, until then let’s...” because if you’re caught out in the lie you risk harming the relationship with your mom, and while she may not remember why she distrusts you, she will remember the feeling you gave her. Memories are stories in a different part of the brain than emotions and I often tell people that a person with dementia may not remember facts (names, faces) but they do remember the feelings.

I’m a dementia specialist in the UK and my mum is a younger person with dementia who is quite far gone in her own journey, so happy to talk about how we handle it with my mum. She asks to see her mum every 90 seconds or so, and can get very aggressive and physical, so we’ve been there. A lot!",,,,

I tried it with my mother-in-law and it seemed to help her feel like she’d expressed what she was trying to say.",,,,
"Agree with having a easy go-to answer, also if your grandmother has another favorite topic that you like too, you could switch to that one.

My mom had repeat topics for particular moods, I think. When she was feeling down and pushing for hope or interest, I believe that's when she would say things like 'the daffodils will come up.'

Easier said than done with repetition, but maybe in this case your grandmother would be equally happy to talk about any topic that could end up along the lines of ""you were right about that"" or ""you know this part of me well.""",,,,
"My mom had dementia. She asked a lot of questions repeatedly. But sometimes, you need to lie nicely just to satisfy them. But remember what you said, and keep repeating it as necessary. But as far as your ex-friendship goes, it's not like you're seeing this ex-friend. Just say that they're doing great and let it go. I do know how hard it is, but by making it easier for them, it will make it easier for you as well.
",,,,
"The typical advice I've seen is that there's nothing you can do to correct a delusion or anything like that. Attempts to correct will, at best, not stick, and at worst, cause distress and anger and such.

If these delusions are not causing distress, the best thing is to just go along with things as best you can. It's tough and it sucks, and it goes against a lot of instincts, but it's the best for your loved one if it makes him more comfortable. If they do cause distress, try and distract and change the subject as best you can.

I'm sorry you're having to deal with this. It's pretty terrible.",,,,
"Making her feel comfortable is best. If she has some type of dementia it is important that she trust you. If you are telling her you don't believe her then she will think you are against her.

"I’d suggest two channels on YouTube. 1) Teepa Snow and 2) Careblazers. Both have been excellent with suggestions on dealing with difficult behaviors as well as explaining the possible reasons for said behaviors. The most used tool we use with my MIL is “compassionate white lies”. We get constant questions about dead relatives as well as requests to “go home” (her moms house where she grew up). At first we fought tooth and nail giving the facts to her showing her pictures, dates, etc. Nothing worked it would end in huge fights, her getting really depressed, and we’d be completely frustrated. Once we started the new technique the dynamic changed. Also, we post notes around the house reminding/reassuring her of answers we give. You’ll hear/read advice to “Live in their world” as their reality is different from ours. If you can deal with them on that level it helps alot.

"Years ago I made a little documentary about my mother's early onset dementia that might have a bit of further information for you.

The term dementia is a wide term that includes everything from Alzheimer's to Lewy Body, to a whole range of degenerative brain disorders that act differently.

In my mother's case it was confusion for a couple years that made it obvious, and she was diagnosed after getting lost on a route that she took every afternoon.

From diagnosis to forgetting my name was about 4 years. She still knew I was special to her, but not what my name was.

Conversations only mattered in the present, there was no long or short term memory in our case. She knew she was sick for the first 3 or so years. When she would struggle with things she would apologize and say it was the sickness.",,,,
"What I see is the loss of short term memory. Without short term memory things cannot transfer to long term memory. Some memory makes the transfer, most don't.

I get asked the same questions over and over, sometimes within seconds of one another.

He never knows what the day, date, or current time.

He flips the channels on the television constantly.

He needs someone nearby all the time.

He can't drive a car.

He doesn't read the newspaper anymore.

He doesn't remember his children's birthdays.

As time passes his long term memory is fading.

In time he will probably forget who I am.

These are a few specific examples, but as I see it they are all related to the loss of short term memory.",,,,
"I was surprised how much dementia is about a loss of cognition as much as ""memory"". People will eat things that aren't food, become incontinent, vision changes (can't see plate, can't see toilet, shower looks like a black hole), lose language, not know how to dress themselves or really do anything. The delusions. Hallucinations. Aggression. Inconsolable sadness. The forgetting wasn't the hardest part at all.

"Having early onset of a rare form has made me more aware of the decline. In the beginning I noticed that I wasn't following a movie or the commercials lasted so long I'd forget I had been watching anything at all. Then occasionally I'd be driving to the store or some other familiar place when I wouldn't recognize where I was. The final straw came when I kept a list one week of misspoken words, for example saying fork when I meant spoon. All the words were nouns. An uneasy feeling descended over me. This was a brain thing and I reluctantly made an appointment with a neurologist. After tests and mri's it was confirmed early onset. My kind of dementia will be spotty, I can still write on the one hand, but can no longer teach. It is relentless but it's duration will be short. For now I can see its daily erosion of my short term memory, ability to plan and initiate and its undoing of my body's integrity. This is daily life for me with dementia at 60.

The other thing is it's very difficult to predict who will have what symptoms. While the variants (vascular, Lewy body) do have specific characteristics, some people have aggression, some don't. Some will recognize certain people for a long time, some wont.",,,,
"With my MiL the recent memories vanished (what she did five minutes ago or what she did last week). Short term memory got difficult (repeating questions, not knowing answers).

The years between her children being small and 'now' got very hazy with only very few tales to tell, but she could remember very clearly things from her own childhood. Sadly those childhood memories are now getting all mixed up, she can no longer remember her siblings names and sometimes it's unclear if she knows her children and their spouses names.

Short term memory can be tested - ask them to remember something they're told, say a sentence (address = 16 High Street, Anytown; the time of day, a day of the week) and then ask them to repeat it. This is what GPs do for in-house diagnosis before referral. If you try this 'testing' yourself you'll just get frustrated and upset because they can't 'perform'.

Day to day things such as, ""Where did you get that glass"" after they've been handed a glass of juice, with the glass coming from the cupboard whilst they were watching. They don't know they've forgotten, because they don't remember it happening. It's this confusion that can be frustrating and cause angry outbursts.

Navigating round the house, and using cupboards, can be a challenge because she doesn't really know what cupboards are for - and doesn't open the doors because she doesn't know what she'll find. A home becomes a mysterious place, but it doesn't matter too much because the chair is nice and comfy, and can be slept in.

The same questions get repeated again and again, ""Did you get home early from work today?"" - ""No, because it's Saturday"" or, ""No, it's six o'clock"" can do a dozen rounds until the idea of that question vanishes and a new one appears in her mind.

We're now, also, hearing many words used incorrectly which makes understanding quite a challenge. For example, the nouns for time are all mixed up so, ""yesterday"" could be an hour ago, a week or a year ago, but she knows that ""yesterday"" is to do with past time. For her, we now admit, that ""tomorrow"" is a real mystery because she has little concept of things to come although she does know some days of the week she doesn't know when they'll be happening.

In amongst all of this my MiL knows she's just fine. A careless word from a carer leads to an eruption, because she knows she can't possibly have dementia or Alzheimer's because she is coping perfectly - and I'm blamed because I'm her daughter in law, so am evil. She'll tell people that she does her own laundry, her own cooking, bathes daily, styles her own hair etc.. In reality she does none of these things and can barely make a cup of tea.",,,,
"I guess it's important to understand more about our memory to actually understand how dementia happens. If you like, read these blogs about memory, it's a good read. https://blog.simonsays.ai/why-memory-is-still-one-of-sciences-greatest-mysteries-part-1-56ae2615c824 https://blog.simonsays.ai/how-our-emotions-affect-our-memories-permanence-part-2-7b8b9f6b5c14",,,,
"Another thing also is that physical activity can decrease as well. My grandfather is 88 years old, has never had more than a cold but his dementia means that he no longer will move. He has no concept of getting up, out of bed, doing anything- even though he is 100% physically capable. It's horrible how a brain disease has incapacitated every other part of him as well.
",,,,
"One thing I've found is that too many people (even those involved with a family member) have this idea that it's just ""surface"" memory loss. It's not. My mother is even like that. She bought my grandmother a ""word clock"" that tells you the day, the time of day (morning/afternoon/night), date, and time, with the intent that grandma would stop asking what day/date/time it was, and if she did mom would be able to just say ""look at your clock"". But forgetting the date/time is surface memory. So now we STILL get asked the day/date/time, because grandma doesn't even know what a clock is.

People also like to say that it's like a second childhood. LIES. Because I know DAMN WELL that she didn't grow up spitting on the floor (never mind getting away with doing so!). It's childish behavior, but not a second childhood. Because they don't (can't) learn. With actual children, you can correct them and eventually they ""get"" it. Dementia/Alzheimer's patients don't ever realize there's a ""it"" to get.",,,,
"The first thing you need to do is get him a thorough check up to make sure that these symptoms aren't being caused by anything treatable. After that, find a neurologist who specializes in dementia. Honestly, the meds that are currently available show little efficacy in most patients, but you can try them. A clinical trial could offer some home. Finally, dementia patients don't know they are doing anything wrong with their outbursts and they can't learn, so scolding them is meaningless. Even if you sit them down and they agree to everything half an hour later it will be as if the conversation never happened; to them, it didn't. This is why so many dementia patients end up in a care facility. Most homes are utterly unequipped to deal with them. If possible, get him to designate a POA so you have the legal ability to make decisions for him. Bring in a caregiver to give your grandmother/mother a break in her duties. It is unbelievably exhausting to care for even the most compliant dementia patient. It is, in effect, caring for a toddler with the body and legal rights of an adult.

"Disclaimer: I'm not a pro. I just have a grandma with moderate-severe stage Alzheimer's Disease and so, I'll be speaking from my experience.

First, you need a proper diagnosis. Certain types of dementias are treatable, others are not - the only way to know is to get a diagnosis, preferably by consulting several neurologists and psychiatrists. [Here's] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1307463/pdf/westjmed00154-0073.pdf) a list of reversible and irreversible dementias. The document is a bit old, but it'll help you understand (just like it helped me) that dementia is a symptom of a disease, and you need to know what you're dealing with in the case of your dad/grandpa.

Second, form what I have seen in my grandma, your grandpa's symptoms sound quite similar to hers: see them here She hasn't been aggressive, though, but this could be due to her personal character. She has always been a bit stubborn, for example, and has gotten even more so in the past 2-3 years.

Usually, with Alzheimer's you can see a physical shrinkage of the patient's brain over time. I don't have my grandma's MRI scans handy, but there was clearly more water in her most recent brain scan compared to one take 2 years ago; the density of some of her brain parts has diminished too. So, archive his scans and make sure to bring them to your physician/s for progression checkup.

Keep in mind that if your grandpa has irreversible dementia he will be unlearning things day-by-day, from more complicated tasks like driving to simple ones like feeding oneself and going to the bathroom; so there will come a day when you'll need someone who will take care of him 24/7. Hence, start thinking about getting an at-home caregiver or a residential care for elderly with dementia right now. Begin to research this issue, plan your finances and start discussing this with your nan. A good, trained caregiver will be your godsend. Having her/him in your lives will ease up the psychological damage that you will go though during the last years of your loved one with dementia.

In the future, please consider lying therapeutically and abstain from fixing your grandpa's storyline. I know it hurts you to hear him say something about having recently seen or spoken to a deceased relative, but he doesn't remember any of it, so reminding him of a death of a loved one will make him upset all over again. Whenever my grandma talks about wanting to see her dad who died in the 1950s, we just straight up lie to her that he is on a vacation and will be back in a few weeks. Same goes for telling him about his diagnosis, but this is my personal view.

I don't know which state/country you live in but reach out to your local Dementia organization. They can provide you with lots of very useful advice and support and remind you that you are not alone.

If I can be of any additional support, please pm me. Good luck to you and I hope your grandpa's condition is reversible.

Edit: Apologies for the typos. I'm writing this on my phone.",,,,
"Hi, sorry for a rather later reply, but here we go:

From what you have written, I am getting an impression that your grandpa's progression into the disorder/disease according to this outline is either in stage 3 or 4. The outline is a bit general and may not fit every person's symptoms but its translation was given to us by my grandma's physician.

Have a look at https://www.dementiauk.org/ for support. I don't know where exactly you are in the UK, but here in Aberdeen we have http://www.alzscot.org/ chapter and although I'm not originally from the UK and my grandma isn't being treated in Scotland, I have been visiting them for some moral support since last year and they have been extremely helpful. So have a look online for a local chapter and do give them a call even if you don't have anything to say and just need a bit of encouragement that you are doing all that you can. Also, I don't know if the NHS covers elderly care but maybe it would be worth calling the NHS and asking them about palliative care for elderly with dementia? I'm sure there must be some sort of help out there.

Yes, get your Nan on board as soon as she feels better. If possible, have your grandpa's GP or physician talk about his diagnosis to her, so she fully understands the severity of the situation. Then, inform the rest of the family and start working on a plan for your grandpa. The sooner you agree on one and get everything ready, the less anxiety you will feel and the more opportunity you will have to spend quality time with your grandpa before his condition gets really bad.

I can understand your father and his, to some extend, unwillingness to accept his father's (possible) diagnosis and move on with it. My dad has been struggling too. His mom (my grandma) has been a strong and independent woman all his life and brought up 7 kids all on her own, gave them very good education and took care of their kids when they couldn't. To see her now struggling with tying her laces and making tea is heartbreaking. So my mom and I have become my dad's counsellors and we try to support him when he feels sad and upset. If your dad has been showing signs of sadness and anxiety because of his dad's health problems, and he isn't willing to share them with you, then maybe it'd be worth to talk to him about seeing a counsellor?

Hope it works out for you!",,,,
"You need a good doctor and a good lawyer. Take him to the doctor. Explain what's happening and that you or your father need to be present for appointments to discuss issues and meds. Secondly, your father needs to apply for legal conservator of his money, or POA, or guardianship. OR he needs to be placed in a memory care facility because legitimately elderly people cannot care for other elderly people. Especially if he is already hitting his wife. There are several meds that help lessen symptoms such as anger and aggression. They do not help the disease itself but they will mitigate symptoms so that you all don't want to kill each other. Have his license taken away. Driving is not advisable. You can easily change this to just a govt issued ID. If he cannot be trusted to stay at home or to be civil around his wife you may need to consider having someone move in to help care for them. Or like I said, a memory care facility. Neither are cheap. In the states memory care places range from $4,000-$6,000 and up per MONTH. This entire thing is scary and horribly stressful but it needs to be done, the sooner the better. By the time I made it home to help my dad he was hiding knives under his bed and living on hostess snack cakes and not paying the mortgage. It was bad.

"The only gps trackers I know of require a monthly service fee. But if he has a newer vehicle services like onstar can be helpful. Google for a while and see what you can come up with. I would work on the money thing if you can. Just to be sure he isn't giving it away or whatever. My dad was very very easily upset about his money, of which I had total control of for the last year of his life. Most of the time I could redirect him but we did have some major fights about it. At the end of the day it's all being done with the persons best interest in mind. A lot of people will hide symptoms. They won't ask for help out of pride. And the will forget they even need help if they do realize it. Patience is key. And persistence. Be observant and note any changes in behavior etc.

"It's hard to develop a plan without access to his physicians and medical records - doesn't the spouse have access or any authority? To more practical things: I would ""break"" the car (take out fuses?) or ""lose"" the keys so he can't drive - it would be horrible if he harmed someone. Limit the amount of cash and try to make sure he doesn't carry checks (my dad would just sign a blank check and hand it to the cashier at stores for them to fill out...). Make photocopies of identification he carries in his wallet because that will probably get lost.

"Can't offer advise on how to handle this but try starting thw word for him (after the pause) see if it triggers the memory for him

"I’m surprised by how often I can repeat where he left off and my dad will pick right back up where he was going. Otherwise, usually I try to continue the conversation as if he had finished his thought, like restating what he had just said, and we’ll quickly move on past the word he forgot. If I let it linger, he gets frustrated that he can’t think of the word or lost his train of thought.",,,,
"Being consistently patient is something to think on. You can only control how you react, not how he reacts. (But this is true for every relationship). What I have learned watching mom over the last few years, is that i have to be patient. I am happily and constantly reminded by the Alzheimers Association 24 your hot line, is that I must realize that people with dementia struggle with what you and I do not give a second thought to.

When I say to mom ""It's ok"" and I smile, it does reassure her. I might have to do so a few times, but it is my honor. I just called the hotline again today for the first time in a couple of months, and they reminded me that mom struggles even with emotions. I saw her yesterday. And she was so so happy, and then confused. After speaking with the aides on her unit and the hotline counselor, I was reminded that I need to understand that mom processes information differently than you or I.

It is hard to get that stuck in my head. I'm so linear. Lol! Reassuring your dad by being patient is awesome. And it seems like you have an understanding that conversations are sometimes effortless even with pauses. If you were to take the opposite tactic and jump in to correct him, that would be counter productive for you both. Right?",,,,
"Communication is more crucial to some folks than it is to others, because we all primarily communicate in DIFFERENT ways. your dad may be one of those who PRIMARILY communicates thru words, and it creates panic when he is unable to communicate.

Also, some of us get EXTREMELY irritated when someone with an intact brain tells us ""it's okay"" and ""it doesnt matter"". To us, it is NOT ""okay"", and it matters a huge amount ! The process of losing our abilities that made us unique is tremendously painful.

Some of us really get irritated with ""help"" to find our words, because if you are guessing wrong, then hearing your guess just put the word we are trying to grab twice as far away from us. i am very fortunate that after 30 years of marriage my husband guesses correctly most of the time, so in OUR communication that is usually helpful.",,,,

"I am copying an article you might find helpful. The short of it is, you can't. My mom has some severe delusions that involve hearing and seeing things, she stays focused on the same general things, trying to tell her it is not real makes it worse. I try to not confirm, but not deny, her claims and move the conversation. For instance in the case you describe with your Dad, I'd probably say something like, ""That doesn't sound nice, but I am sure you don't need to worry about that, Dad. How did ___________ go today?"" - and when he inevitably repeats, ""Yes, I heard you, but I think you don't need to concern yourself with that, let's talk about _______________."" The article may be more helpful than my 2 cents. Good luck. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5977418/",,,,

"It's not lying. It's trying to make sense of a world that they can't understand anymore. Several forms of dementia have the fun side effect of hallucinations as well. My father insisted that he was visited nightly by sexy space aliens who tried to lure him onto their ship as well as people coming into his home and having parties. It sounds funny now, but it was distressing for all of us.

"You reminded me of a pretty funny anectode a teacher once told us. She said that her mother had to go to the hospital for an operation, and the nurses told her that she acts like she has dementia. Which she thought was pretty strange, because her mother was completly fine right before the hospital stay.

When she visited her mother, she told her how the nurses had wild parties at night, drank and had orgies. Since she never halluzinated before or had this kind of behaviour, she was really confused, but since she was a nurse herself, she wanted to understand what was happening.

It took a couple of das, but she finally figured it out: The noises of the night staff preparing everything for the day shift sounded like a party: Glasses rattle from the infusions that were kept in glass bottles back then, and the exhausted nurses at 3 a.m. telling each other stupid jokes and lauhing to keep them awake. So since her mother couldn't see what was going on, only hear, she made up an explanation that was the most logical for her in that situation, no dementia involved.

I think that shows pretty well how it is only human to come up with theories about things we can't understand. And since people with dementia have a lot of things they can't understand anymore, they come up with more strange explanations than other people. It's not lying, just the attempt to find logic in a world that gets less and less logcal for them.",,,,

This isn't something I have purchased, but like you considered for a loved one.

Keep in mind along with the initial price you pay a monthly subscription. I also checked into using these tags, but battery life is poor.

I use one of [these devices](http://www.findmespot.com/en/index.php?cid=102) when I go hiking or climbing in backcountry areas. It continually updates your position (you can decide who has access to this information) as well as the ability to send basic "I'm ok" and "SOS" messages. There are a number of other options but this one works quite well.  
You should look into the TRiLOC location watch. You can program geo-fence barriers that will alert you if the wearer has stepped out and it provides accurate locating within 10 feet. It also has other programmable features. You can find it at http://www.locationbasedgps.com/triloc-personal-locator-gps-watch/. 
I currently work and intern for Alzheimer's Association. Here are devices they recommend on their website.

We are working on something exactly like this designed for seniors and should be launching on kickstarter in Q4.  I'd love to talk to you about it.

Thanks. I'll look into that. I'm hoping for something at least a tiny bit tamper resistant and/or wearable, but this seems like one of the better options suggested so far. 
I can testify to its durability and ease of use. My family/SO have never had a problem finding me (on google maps anyway) when I've used it.

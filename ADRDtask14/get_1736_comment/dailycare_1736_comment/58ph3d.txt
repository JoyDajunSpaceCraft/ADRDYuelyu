I hear you. Dementia makes people do strange things! Some unasked for advice below. Please feel free to ignore it. 

One of the hardest things I had to learn is that there is no way to get a person with dementia to act the way they did before. It's completely understandable that these actions concern and even upset you. I find the best result come when I work around the dementia. It took me a long time to figure this out.  I knew it, but to actually do it was another thing. Life is better for both me and my partner when I accept and work around the dementia when I can. 
Don't feel bad. Here's a potty conversation that occurred between my mother and me recently:
ME: "Mom, why did you pee on the bath mat?"
Her: "I didn't! I wiped it up with the bath mat."
And it's also impossible to get them to understand your reasoning/logic/train of thought. 

I still struggle with not having those expectations
:O
Yep. It doesn't help that on a rare day when everything is in alignment, they will show signs of reasoning. I fall for it every time.

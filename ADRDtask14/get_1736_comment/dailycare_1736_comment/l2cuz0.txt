Tell him it’s been taken care of. You’ve called whomever (someone he knows and trusts) and they are doing it or have done it. Or that you have completed the task already. This generally settles my mom enough that she can move on.
Nothing me and my family tried worked for long.  Others have suggested putting notes on the front door when they try to leave, but that didn't work for us.

It's usually just constant, gentle redirecting.  Try not to get angry or frustrated if you can, it doesn't help.  I found it largely pointless to argue or debate - distracting them long enough to get them to forget about the tangent worked for a while for us. If there's something your father is really attached to, it can help to talk about that as a distraction.  Strong emotional connections can distract them for longer. For my sister, it was her cat.  If she got on one of those tangents, we'd ask her if she had fed her cat and if her cat was OK.  That would distract her long enough to forget about whatever the tangent was. 

I also installed a tracking app on my sister's phone with a geofence so I knew when she left her apartment because I couldn't be there all the time. But the geofence didn't trigger until she was a couple of hundred feet from her apartment. After my sister spent half the night outside on her porch in 20-degree weather "waiting for someone to pick her up" because she thought she was going to the store with a friend, we never left her alone again.  Someone was with her constantly for six weeks until we could get her moved to memory care.

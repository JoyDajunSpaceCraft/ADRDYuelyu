not necessarily. sounds very obsessive compulsive. try talking to her to get some help? 
she could be anxious about something, nervous, stressed,  that causes repitive movements. maybe too much caffeine. 
if she is feeling dry, itchy, she might be obsessively touching. could be complex/simple tics.  i wouldn't worry too much. keep an eye on her.  is there other signs that had you thinking dementia?
She's never done this before been obsessive compulsive that I have seen. She forgets alot of stuff and misplaces stuff then when I tell her she's the one who last had the item she gets very mad about it and me.
I have explained you get sick by touching your eyes nose and mouth why does she do that so since I said that several times she now switched to rubbing her head or hair or forehead . It's so strange. Every few seconds not kidding if we watch a movie or TV she can't sit more than 5 or 7 seconds without touching her head.
She won't get help
 She's had cataracts for 7 years and refuses to go get them fixed I keep telling her she is going to go blind but she doesn't care . She's never cared about her health. It's very sad.
if it is dementia, it could be repitive actions. her mind is stuck on doing that movement over and over. try a fidget blanket or redirect her to an activity.

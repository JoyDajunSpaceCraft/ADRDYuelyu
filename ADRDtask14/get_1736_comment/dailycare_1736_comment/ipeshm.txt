I think it is wonderful that you have given such thought into planning your visit. I always believe the heart knows and remembers even if the brain dues not. The favorite treat is an excellent idea. My mother recalls music and becomes quite animated when she hears favorite songs. You may want to play  something for her. I wish you well on your visit.
I’m glad you got to see her and have nice conversation.  Even if she didn’t recognize you she probably recognized the “feeling” of being with you and that probably brought her some happiness.  I truly wish I could have had a similar experience with my mother.  

My mom entered memory care at the beginning of March and then the Covid-19 lockdown started.
My mom got the virus and tested positive but had  zero respiratory symptoms. She was in a hospital for three long months with no contact from family.  She could not be released because she continued to test positive. She went from walking, dancing and joking with people to almost non-verbal, incontinent and bed-bound. She got back to her assisted living at the end of August and passed away yesterday- September 25th. I still cannot believe she is gone.

Love your writing! Thanks for the humor!
Good job, u/LicketyGlitz.   
Worth reading, folks.
Well said. Thanks for sharing!
You are welcome, tattoo. Even steeped in tragedy, the sense of humor my parents gifted me with still helps me see it through. Thank you for reading.
Thanks, Get. I'm guessing every dementia caregiver's emotions are ricocheting as wildly as mine right now as we add new levels of stress to an already stressful existence. While everything feels more tragic in my life right now, that sense of humor of mine keeps me (a little bit) balanced and off the edge of the cliff! 

I hope your caregiver journey is a healthy and safe one, and stays that way. Thank you for reading.

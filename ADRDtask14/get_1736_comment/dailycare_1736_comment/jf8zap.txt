White matter hyperintensities/lesions occur frequently as you age, becoming more prevalent the longer you live. It is definitely a contributing factor to dementia, along with low levels of acetylcholine, amyloid beta plaque buildup, among other possible factors. 

I wouldn’t know if white matter lesions certainly lead to dementia, but studies show that people who develop dementia usually have a high amount. 

Don’t mistake this for any kind of diagnosis. Only the doctors would be able to tell with any measure of certainty. 

Staying mentally and physically active, along with healthy eating is always good advice. I hope for the best for your mother.

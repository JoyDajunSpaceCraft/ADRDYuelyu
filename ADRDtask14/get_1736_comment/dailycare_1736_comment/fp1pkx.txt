What about a toilet riser?  It just sits on the toilet, so it’s not so far down to sit.  It might not be so scary.
My dad had this problem. My mom got a toilet safety rail like this:

Theres variations in design and price, but the one we had had this sorta back bar on it like this, and 4 legs (as opposed to two).

So we still had to take our time with him, but it was a little less of a fight. Wed guide him, turn him around, have him grab the bars and then get the bottoms loose. Then we'd try to nudge him down, and sometimes his body would stay stiff like hed be 30% sitting, but he wouldnt be totally upright. After a little bit it was easier to ease him into place... Maybe bc his arms got tired.. Or I think it just "felt" scary to drop so far into a seated position for him. It helped getting him up more easily too, as I imagine it would for many older folks with stiff joints. 

And hey its fsa compatible (and probably deductible as medical expense) so bonus. 

Good luck hope this helps
Can you warm the seat? My mom(who has Alzheimers) thinks everything's artic cold
The seat riser worked for us!
Could you set up an iPad with her favorite songs or show playing?
Does she understand why she is there? Maybe use a picture sequence with no words to help her.
Thank you!
Thank you!
We have tried music, but it’s too distracting to her and she just wants to dance. She has no prob staying on the toilet. It’s just the physical act of sitting down in the bathroom that she just doesn’t want to do. She gets real mean.
Ooh. I’ll give that a try too.
We had a toilet chair that could also be used in the shower.  A lifesaver!
I'm going thru this exact same thing with my mom too. It doesn't hurt her at all, she has no problem sitting anywhere else. She just gets really combative about sitting there. If you figure something out let me know.
Does it hurt her?
I don’t think so. She has no problem sitting in the couch.

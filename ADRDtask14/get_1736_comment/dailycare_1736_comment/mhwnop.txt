Also, if she is suddenly seeing people or hallucinations, have her checked for a UTI. It is often the only symptoms in older folks.
My wife's grandmother did this. She would kid around with the woman in the mirror. I don't recall her ever having anything negative associated with the mirror version of her. If I recall correctly, she would see her own purse in the reflection and ask the mirror if she had any goodies in her purse to share.
Yep! My mom (63) does the same thing. I let her just talk to them and I sometimes have to convince her they’re “gone” when I need to her to do something.
My Grandpa's had the same for most of his dementia, usually they're little kids who sit with him. If they're adults they usually ask how his day is going. It was a little unsettling at first but as he's gotten worse they've helped calm him often.
My mother does something similar.  The other person often originates from someone on TV.  It can get pretty bad if she's watching a crime drama and she things she's dealing with a murderer in her house.  This has resulted in phone calls to the police, adult-protective services, etc.   Luckily, this doesn't happen too often.
   At one time my Dad got really bad cognitively. he was sitting in a chair in his bathroom sitting at a 90 degree angle to the mirror. I walked in to give him something and spoke to him. Instead of turning to me and reaching out his hand he looked at my reflection in the mirror and reached out to the mirror. I spoke again and he turned to me. 

   We did two things to make things better for him. I started managing his meds because he couldnt do it. One day he took several days worth of A.M. pills at one go. That was enough and I took over. The other was changing his neurologist's med to an ER or ext release. he had been trying to take several pills at a time at certain intervals. That doesnt work with someone with dementia. 

   It doesnt surprise me. When you remember that dementia is basically eroding the brain and separating the lobes. meaning also that the two sides communicate less and less. So perhaps the areas that had always cognitively understood that person in the mirror is no longer able to communicate. When the brain has lapses it has to fill in the gap of understanding. Instead of just having no clue and thinking this is a scary stranger it thinks here is a new friend. be thankful of that at least. You could stand behind her facing the mirror and brush her hair and tell her how beautiful she is. See what she thinks. 

   During dads bad time and it thankfully only lasted a few weeks...he was seeing people. One was a young girl running through his room. he described her as a 8 yearold in her pajamas. He told me he knew she wasnt real.

   Another time he was calling me. he couldnt get out of bed and had seen people standing at the edge of the bed staring at him. This one scared him and I assured him no one else was there. I dont know if he understood they werent real. 

   From what ive read if this is new behaviour you might have the doc check for a UTI just to be safe. Yes its good these are friendly visions.

Take good care.
I had forgotten about this but I do remember now that my G'pa used to do this....
Mom hallucinated lots of people to talk to, and a hawk would apparently fly around our bathroom with great frequency. The hawk was a nice distraction from toileting for her and as long as she was happy with her hallucinations I was glad she had some 'friends'. 

What was worrying was when her hallucinations were threatening or scary. We had to move her from assisted living after she hallucinated a home invasion in which she had been beaten, because her anxiety was so out of control in the building. With the more typical 'mean' hallucinations I would very firmly tell them their behavior was not acceptable and demand they leave. That seemed to put mom at ease.

Fortunately as her dementia got worse her hallucinations became very benign. On at least one occasion she was hallucinating having a very nice conversation with me and was surprised to discover I was a twin when real me walked into the room 😄

Obviously mention this to her doctor and make sure it's not a UTI, but as strange as it sounds some people find their hallucinations comforting. Big hugs and hang in there.
Mirror reflections are totally different than hallucinations.

This is caused from the brain's failure to interpret the visual signals correctly.  Lack of depth perception plus fractionated visual signals produce the perception that there is someone there.  This can be disturbing in the privacy of the bathroom.  Most places end up covering most mirrors because the perception can change from a friendly perception to feeling of being spied on.

Talking to empty areas of the house is probably hallucinations.  i experience these and have written about the different types of hallucinations here >> [https://truthfulkindness.com/2020/01/26/hallucination-types/](https://truthfulkindness.com/2020/01/26/hallucination-types/) .
I recently read a book (recommended by someone on this sub) that the person with dementia will often forget what they look like or fail to recognize themselves, especially as their memory rewinds to earlier times. They may not recognize themselves now but will recognize themself in a picture several decades earlier. This explains talking to mirrors and also paranoia where they think that there’s someone else in the house. When it becomes troublesome taking away mirrors or covering them seems to be helpful.

The book was called Thoughtful Dementia Care by Jennifer Ghent Fuller and it was very inexpensive on Kindle. I found it a very easy read and somewhat enlightening.
Thanks!
Oh that’s so interesting it’s objects as well!
One time we were walking mom past a mirror and she suddenly exclaimed "When did I get so ANCIENT?!" 

While I'm sure it was shocking to her it was pretty funny to the rest of us.
This definitely 1000X's - my mom was doing this and it scared the mess out of me.  She'd be looking at me or so I thought, but she'd actually be looking over my shoulder and moving her head as if someone was walking around the table towards her all the time talking to them.

Turned out she had a bad UTI and she has not been the same since.

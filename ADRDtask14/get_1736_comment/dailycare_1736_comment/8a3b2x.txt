If the panic attacks are a new thing for you, you should probably go in to be seen about them.  If you aren't into medication, you can still have confirmation that they are indeed just panic attacks you're experiencing.  Numbness and chest pain aren't good things.  If you're used to them and they are indeed panic attacks, the sudden change in the way they are presenting themselves might be something to check out as well.  Basically, if your health is changing and you have the ability to get it checked out, you should do so.  Particularly with the incredible amount of stress you have been under.  
Hi. I send you virtual hugs. I have not experienced what you described but I do know stress from caregiver role to 87 year olds. I hope you find time in your obviously busy schedule to schedule some self care. I take lots of Epsom salt baths and drink chamomile tea all day long.  Peace be with us. 
Ah good point.  I reviewed with two doctors to confirm panic attacks, cardiac health checked out fine fine.  It is very strange to have a sudden change in the body.  To the doctor with me!

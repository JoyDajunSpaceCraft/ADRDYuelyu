This is a civil matter.  The cops don't know whose property it is, so they're not letting you take it.  

You need to sue her and get an enforcable court order.  
Id probably just break in, take all my stuff and deal with the consequences later.  Make sure the old bat isnt home. 
It's been acknowledged by all parties involved that it's my property
That's great.  Except she won't let you on her property, and she doesn't really have to absent **a court order**.  

The police also can't force her to let you on her property absent a court order.  

Long story short:  court order.

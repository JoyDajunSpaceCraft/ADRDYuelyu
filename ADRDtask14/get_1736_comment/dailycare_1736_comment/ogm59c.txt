I got my grandma a phone meant for people with dementia/Alzheimer's. You'll need to set up a landline for them, but it's worth it imo. I got her something [like this](https://smile.amazon.com/smpl-Hands-Free-56010-Amplification-Construction/dp/B07Z9L4S8L/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=senior+phone&qid=1625798395&sr=8-5).
Check out the Ring indoor cameras you can get through Amazon. With those, I think she can use an app on her phone when she is away to both “see” the room the camera is in as well as talk to him through it. Being able to see him may come in handy as his dementia progresses.
If I'm not mistaken, I think that the iPhone has some kind of feature where it can automatically answer FaceTime.  Of course, that would depend on your father leaving the phone (or iPad) close enough where your mother can shout and he'll hear her and come to it and pick it up.
Alexa drop in, echo shows can see the room they’re in or just do audio drop in. Yes, you can use the phone app when you’re out and talk back and forth. 

A little odd to have a disembodied  voice talking at you, might want to practice a few times.
Is he ok using the phone when he finds it? We had to try a few handsets but eventually found the Doro 1360 worked well for him.

If he manages to get out of hospital and use it again I’m considering
Getting a lanyard so that the phone is always around his neck.

I found that recently even the most blatantly obvious signage like “TV” or “PHONE” would often be missed…

Interested in hearing any tips you have if you make progress.
Great idea. I really like the flash feature. I appreciate you taking the time to help out.
Thank you. I had not even thought of this. I think this may really help out her at ease.
Installing camera(s) inside the house sounds like a great idea!

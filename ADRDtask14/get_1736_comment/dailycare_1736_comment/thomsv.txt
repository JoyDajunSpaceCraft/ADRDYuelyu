1.	Don't call them diapers to her. We simply called them "panties" or "underwear", and filled her dresser drawer with the feminine-looking panty type. So that she put them on like underwear as part of getting dressed like normal 
2.	I told my grandmother that Betty White and the Queen of England likely need these adult underwears too. but that *you would never know because they actually use them. *Aka It's actually not the adult diapers that are embarrassing.. it's when they NEED BUT DON'T USE them that can be embarrassing! 
3.	anyway you can arrange for some activity outside of the house that requires her to get actually dressed including pants and shoes? doesn’t have to be huge even just a morning walk or sitting on the front porch, but it will Require a shower and then getting directly dressed after, out of the bathrobe and into clothing which requires underwear.  and now her whole underwear drawer will be filled with the adult panties. 
4.	White distilled vinegar helps Cut down on the urine smell from laundry. put it in the fabric softener slot. you can get gallons at the grocery store but for some reason it’s next to the vinegar salad dressing and such  rather than Cleaning.
One last thing you May want to consider giving her Metamucil every day. it’s a fiber supplement that will bring her bowels back to normal equilibrium rather than  swinging from extremes of diarrhea or constipation. 

we used to give it to my grandmother in something we called "fruit tea" which was about 1/3 cranberry juice 1/3 apple or orange juice 1/3 hot water all mixed together with the Metamucil
What about disposable underwear? Does she refuse those too? I would be tempted to tell her you can’t continue on as her caregiver unless she wears them. I spent six hours cleaning/wet vacuuming  a trail of poop my mom left behind right before Christmas. I can’t imagine doing that repeatedly. I would be tempted to bail.

####FAQ

*Isn't she still also the Queen of England?*

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

*Is this bot monarchist?*

No, just pedantic.

I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.
The money is amazing and I adore my boss but I’m drained. She won’t even put on pants and regular underwear. “I don’t need those” she says. 

It might have to get to the point where I can’t allow her to leave her room until she puts them on. I hope that doesn’t come off as cruel but it’s for both of our sakes and sanity..

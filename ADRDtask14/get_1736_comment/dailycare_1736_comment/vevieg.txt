My Grandma has vascular dementia and a cat (we all live together) and on occasion gets rough with it. But we try to just monitor her with the cat and redirect her or remove the cat. As of now it is the one pet (we have other cats) she knows is hers so we are hoping she doesn't escalate her behavior. Otherwise the cat will be left in another part of the house. 

It might not be a bad idea to remove them when she gets agitated because the dogs may sense the change in her mood and it might become a loop. She gets stressed, the dogs do too, she sees the dogs becoming agitated which stresses her.
I am sorry that you're going through this. 

I had some concern with pets and my parent. Unfortunately, I did end up having to keep two of my cats in one room except when my parent was napping. Fortunately, a lot of the behavior seemed to come in phases, so it wasn't an ultra long-term situation.

Best of luck, and sanity to you.
i had a problem with that behavior when i was put on a medication to calm me; it made me extremely irritable and angry.  it was a disaster.  Many of us with LBD symptoms have problems with reactions to medications.  So you might check any recent changes of meds.  

Also suggest checking not only for UTI but infections in other areas like toes, mouth, etc.  Even small infections can have a big effect on brain behavior.

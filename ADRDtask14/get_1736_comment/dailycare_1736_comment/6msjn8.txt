How old are you? 
The burden of the mentally ill on their care givers can be very great. It's easy for others to just sit back and judge you for feeling this way, but you are certainly not alone.

Are you old enough that you can move out? Your mother should be caring for her, not you.
eh, gross attitude tbh

That's pretty genocidal
Why does my age matter?
I sadly can't move out. My mother (it's her grandmother) refuses to send her to a hospice centre because it's against her principles, so I'm fucking stuck here
I'm not 100% certain I understand
Because you're acting like a shitty little kid. Have some sympathy for a sick elderly person, fucking christ
Then your mother should care for her and you should live out? Is that an option?
I'm trying to turn genocidal into a synonym for words like 'Metal' and 'Brutal'. Because genocidal does sound metal. 
This. 
I wish I could downvoted you on this sub
You can downvote on any sub that disables the downvote button... go to the sidebar and uncheck "use subreddit style" and it goes the Reddit default style, including downvote buttons :)
Downvoting someone for no reason is pretty genocidal. 
There are reasons.

Oddly enough, there are physical ailments that can give a person the symptoms of dementia without them actually having dementia. A simple urinary tract infection in seniors can suddenly cause paranoia, confusion, aggression, and/or hallucinations (delirium). Covid can also cause sudden onset delirium to occur. 

I’m not saying your grandmother doesn’t have dementia, she very well may. I’m going to assume, since you mentioned it, that her belongings aren’t usually in so much disarray. If she were always like that it wouldn’t seem unusual enough for you to mention it. It may not be a bad idea for your mother to talk to your grandmothers doctor. 

My mother is 78. She was extremely active with her friends (before covid). 2 of her friends had their symptoms of dementia vanish with a round of antibiotics to treat a UTI. It seems weird and like they should not be related in any way, but they sometimes are.
I'm glad that your grandmother is doing well! Covid seems to have taken a toll on my grandmother, though. Last weekend, she was diagnosed with late term congestive heart failure. Thank you for your input, though!
Thank you for your input, sorry for never going into the comment section. It is likely now that my grandmother's  severe confusion is due to her late term heart failure. Thank you, again.
I’m so sorry your family, especially your grandmother, is going through this. We were all hoping 2021 would be better. It seems like that is not going to be the case. Hugs headed your way.

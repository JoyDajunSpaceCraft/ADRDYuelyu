I am so sorry that this is your situation right now.  It must take tremendous effort to maintain anything like a calm and caring demeanor.  I haven’t been through exactly what you’re dealing with, but I can imagine how hard it is.  Sending you love and hugs.  Be as kind to yourself as you possibly can.

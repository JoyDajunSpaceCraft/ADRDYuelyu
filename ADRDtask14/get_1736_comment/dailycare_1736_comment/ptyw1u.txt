Those examples do not sound like typical types of forgetfulness for dementia. Dementia is much more associated with specific short term memory loss and the inability to add new memories that often leads to weird repeated things like asking the same exact question over and over or buying a carton of milk four separate times in a day because they forgot they went to the store earlier. The early signs are very subtle though so it could be dementia even if the forgetfulness is not obvious. Best thing to do is to get checked out by a doctor because the only treatments that do anything have to be applied very early.

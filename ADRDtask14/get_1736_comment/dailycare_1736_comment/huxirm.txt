That is elder abuse. He must feed his old mother more than once a day. She probably lived through the famine, then sacrificed everything for her precious son. Although it was done out of love, she never taught him to appreciate what he had and share with others. Now she is older she might not realize that now there is plenty for her to eat, so she regresses to caring for her son and saving food. However, if her son feeds her, she loves him too much to say no. I imagine she is very sad when he grumbles and she will only eat with him because at least she gets his attention. Does she have young grandchildren? Perhaps eating with them might make her eat something? Her son needs to shape up at least during this pandemic. In the meantime you could see about elderly care, but I doubt that would help much. Will she drink? You could try to see if she will drink fruit juice, vegetable juice, and meal replacements.
Could you convince your dad to tell his mother to eat? Let him know that if he convinces her to eat when someone else feeds her he could eat in peace - it will just take a small amount of effort on his part for a big payoff. 

If he could manage to show her that he will "refuse to eat" if she does not eat as well, then she might be convinced to let others feed her. Poor dear, 70 pounds is not a healthy weight even for a tiny person.
Will she drink milkshakes or protein drinks? 

It's a shame your dad is such a selfish ass.

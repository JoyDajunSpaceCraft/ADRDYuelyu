Fair warning, once you're in you never get out. 
I’m sorry. That only makes things harder and often times the sibling(s) who aren’t there day to day achieve saint like status in the eyes of the parents being cared for which does hurt. 

Living with and caring for your parents will be stressful, exhausting, and strain many relationships but it also will give you a chance to spend their last with them and give them comfort and security that no stranger can. 

I will say, no one can do it alone, around the clock and stay sane. If you do move in, keep someone coming out a few days a week and get PT/hospice/home health or whomever is in place to train you on whatever ports need cleaning, proper lifting so you don’t hurt your back or your parent, diet and hydration, etc. 

I’m lucky to already work in a caregiver role but there is so much to learn and keep up with. Use those resources, take breaks, and remember you are just one person! 
Just a follow up on this. Here's a small sample of what you are getting into...  


 

**Functions I’ve performed 24/7 since 2014:**

* Agent and Attorney in fact 
* Caregiver family member
* Chef
* Driver
* Financial planner and advisor
* Housekeeper
* Nurse
* Nutritionist
* Patient advocate
* Safety and well being specialist

**Support I’ve received from immediate family members:**

* No caregiver support
* No financial support
* No moral support
* No concern for my well being or that of my wife
* A lot of criticism from afar with no depth of understanding
* Having distant family members call protective services on my wife and I (we were cleared)

**What its cost me:**

* A career
* My friendships, family relationships
* Nearly cost my my marriage three times
* Nearly sent to prison for 15 years defending the patient from a drug addict looking to steal her pills.
* Any chance for upward relocation to more economically viable regions. 

DON'T DO IT, LET THEM GO!
As a full time carer for my mother with Alz.   


I would say, don't do it! let them hire someone full time and take on the additional care.  

You will never again have this opportunity to spend this time helping your parents. If you can afford to leave your job, I think you’ll be very glad you helped. 
That's a very tough situation, I'm sorry to hear about it. Have they looked into Medicaid? Like others have mentioned you will feel better knowing you've done everything you can for them, but that's hardly a good trade-off for upending your life. I'd suggest exploring ALL the alternatives before you quit your job / move / ruin your marriage.
How about an assisted living facility near where you live?
This is a tough situation but I do not recommend you moving in to take care of them.
Don’t. Do. It. 
Yep. And any siblings you have will fall off the face of the planet. 
How long have you been a caregiver? Do you regret it?
Thank you, that's all very helpful advice. I will for sure keep the sitter on hand a few days a week so I can take breaks, run errands, visit my home, etc.  My mom adores her sitter so it would be nice to have her around anyway. They have amazing friends and neighbors who have gone above and beyond! Last weekend my mom needed to go to the ER and her neighbor took her, then a friend spent the night in their home to make sure she would be ok through the night.  I just don't want to assume the neighbors and friends will always be available every time there's a crisis. I have an amazing relationship with my mother so it's seems like the right decision, but I am weighing my options at the moment. 
I'm so sorry it's been such a rough time for you. 
After talking with my counselor, friends, and here on Reddit, I've decided NOT to move in. They will hire a sitter and I will just continue to visit them as much as possible and maintain my own life. Thanks for your insight. Again, I really feel for you. I hope things get better for you.
Actually it's worse than a job. It becomes a job you can't leave it it WILL shorten your own life. It isn't "spending time with the folks" its having to be the babysitter, nurse, majordomo for people who WILL ALWAYS think of you as the child - even while putting themselves in danger. 
Thank you. It's a tough call. Talked to my mom last night after this post and told her I'm considering it. She said she would want no other person in the world than me. But obviously it's my decision. 
It's too late for that, she is too sick to go through a move. Plus I totally get why she wants to be in her own home. My father would move to my town after she passed into a memory care home.
Or armchair caregiver you to death. 
I have one sibling and she's been incredibly difficult during all of this. 
Since 2015, it sucks the life from you. I had a good  post military nursung career. I had 80 in savings, I had a life.  All of that is gone now. I spend much of my time coordinating with medical staff, being live in chef,  valet, and majordomo to an aggressive and nutty patient with 16 conditions and no common sense at all.

The baby boomer generation in general rotted their brains on TV and trash food. I watch my one patient act like a petulant child and refuse to go to doctors while people without medicare die and she, hell, her whole generation piss me off.

Ive got my own conditions due to being combat wounded.

It isn't worth it at all.
I think this is the best choice, honestly. You’ll maintain your relationship with your parents as well as your health and sanity. I hope everything works out.
Nothing like being in the trenches 24/7 and having someone passing through tell you how *you* should do it better.

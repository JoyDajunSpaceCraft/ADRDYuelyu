> How can I convince my father not to give up on his life just because he thinks he has Alzheimers?

You can't, but someone he trusts, who is his equal or better, and who is an expert might be able to. This might be an old-age expert who can tell him that turning off his activities will turn off his brain early.  He won't hear that from you, but you can ask someone else to tell him.
It goes both ways. Giving up activities and hobbies may speed along his dementia, but the dementia speeds along his abandonment of those things, too.

They just start to lose interest. And no matter what the reason, he won't hear it from you. Just love and support him. He still has a job, that may be all he can handle from here on out.
Maybe these things that once made him happy now stress him out. My mom was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s when she was 58 and she quickly lost interest in a lot of activities but she has always been happy. 

I’d be interested to know what gene you looked at on the 23andme test to know about your dad. I took the test awhile back and it had a late onset Alzheimer’s test but not early. It makes me nervous that it runs in our family
I'm also curious about the genetics. I'd love to know what to look for.
How old is he?
64

As caregivers, we always intend to help. Sometimes itâ€™s not reciprocated with gratitude. Sometimes illness can cause a person to act a way they havenâ€™t before due to pain/discomfort. Be thankful you have your and your husbandâ€™s health. Good karma to you. Hope you all figure it out. ðŸ’•
You don't expect family to kiss the ring (or your feet), but gosh a little respect and gratitude would be appreciated.  I insisted on having a care contract which compensates what I do at market rates.  Makes it a little more professional.

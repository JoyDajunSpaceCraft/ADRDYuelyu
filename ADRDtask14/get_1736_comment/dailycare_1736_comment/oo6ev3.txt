Introverted child living with an extroverted mom who will share anything I tell her

It's hard. I had to set boundaries and never tell her anything about my life. We don't talk about things. I check on her daily to see how she is doing healthwise.

I think introverts need more time to recharge our batteries.  My 87 year old mother still lives alone but her vision and hearing have worsened and she needs more help.  She has always been a chatterbox, but is even worse now.  She talks non-stop until I feel like screaming.  I hate that I feel that I have to limit my time around her but I have to in order to preserve my mental health.  I think it might be easier if I was an extrovert, but this journey with elderly parents is just difficult for almost everyone.  Make a concerted effort to take time for yourself and donâ€™t feel guilty about it.  Otherwise you will soon be sick and worn out.  Sending you wishes for strength.  You are not alone.
I am the same way. Going on the offense and making the first move goes a long way, strategy wise. 

Schedule and initiate brief social interactions a few times a day. For example, sit down with her and make breakfast before you go into work. Drop in and watch a TV show for half an hour together, or give her an activity that she can do to entertain herself. Go for a quality walk around the block chatting for 20 minutes. If you catch them by surprise, they won't feel neglected and inclined to snag you every single time you enter the room. You can also make it clear: hey do you you want to go for a walk together before I watch a movie in my room tonight? Etc.
Thank you so much for sharing your experience, wisdom, and insight. Things I already know but to hear them from someone else and knowing we ate not alone to hear that too, it helps! Not gonna analyze why just going with it today because I need it. Thanks a bunch!!
I really like this suggestion thank you

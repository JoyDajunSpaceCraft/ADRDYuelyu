Yours is not a stupid post at all! The shock of being diagnosed with Dementia can be considerable, if you were not expecting it. Here is what I have found about Cerebrolysin:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrolysin

It would seem to be used mostly in Europe, is that where you are from?

Also, here is an interesting article about Young Onset Dementia, such as you seem to have:

Ohh so sorry for you... What were your symptoms? What kind of dementia? You are so young... don't you think it would be good to have a second opinion? 
On the other side, if your diagnose is right, treating the disease in the beginning is the best approach, so I think you shouldn't have problems soon! Good luck with this medicine!
I have been worried at how poorly doctors eliminate for B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism. Please check in to how to read your blood tests for hypothyroidism and B12 deficiency. There's a lot of controversy.
I do not want to offer false hope, but as someone who has worked with people with dementia for over a decade, just know that there are numerous causes.....some of which can be very treatable. I would agree with a second opinion. Perhaps someone who specializes in dementia. Knowledge is power. It doesnt hurt to explore every option. You know your body, advocate for yourself. Reach out for help if and when you need it. I wish you all the best, its not an easy thing no matter what. Internet hugs! 
Good luck, my friend! I hope for smooth transitions up (and/or down) for your health.

Thank you for the links. And you are correct I'm from a country that is a part of Europi union.
First of all thank you for the reply.  And now a little bit of a back story. I had 2 concutions as far as I know. One in a car accident and the second one at work where I fell from 2 M hight and hit the back of my head.
That was 6 years ago. I probebly noticed that I had memory problems long time ago, but the catalyst for me was probebly my mother's death 2 years ago.
Today I can remember or describe 10 conversation or things me and her done togather.  

I did go to 2 doctors and both taled me the same thing. 

And this my sound wierd but I know I'm no fine and that I'm not doing good.

Hope this makes any sense,  and I was able to explain this in any meaningful way.
Hi thank you for the replay it's something I will look in 2 . Thank u for ur time
This. So many potential vitamin and mineral deficiencies!
Thank you kind stranger. I still need to go see neurophysiologyst to do some tests , but having trouble finding one. I do hope that the test will somehow show the extent of my condition. 
Thank you I will take a look. And they for kind words
Can u explain what that is please.  Thank you

I would like to hear from you what it is like to have dementia. So I can understand what my father (recently dx'ed) is going through. I think you could help a lot of the people posting in this subreddit, who don't have dementia but who are caring for or who have loved ones who do.
it's not a cure but CBD oil has been seen to have some positive effects on symptoms of some Dementia sufferers

my Dad's been on it for a few months and we've seen a marked improvement in his cognition

if you get your diet/fitness/habits right now, you can probably stave off the worst effects for a good long while
Hey thnx for ur replay. I'm willing to do what ever it takes to make life as "normal" as possible. 

I will be taking medical leave from work for as long as I can and work on my self. 

I hoping with all the things im planing on doing that it will slow the process of dementia. 

And when it comes to diet i was planing on starting on something just was not shure what, im willing to take any fucking shots i can get if not for me, for my dauther and wife.

Thank you one more time for your replay.
You are the man!

Hey, sorry to hear about your father, and I will try to sum this up as best I can, and hope this will be of any use to you.

Let me start of by saying it's weird and frustrating. 
 I would say dementia for me is more of a felling,  I know it's there but it doesn't effect my daily life so much at this point in time.
The issue comes when I start thinking about past thing, that have happened a day ago or 7 years ago.
Can't rely pin point a time frame ( if things where 4 days ago or 15).
Some wierd information I still remember vividly like my ex phone number from 11 years ago, but can't recall 5 days of my dauthers kindergarten class from 2 years ago.
 
There is rly lot to it, zoning out for me is a big one . 
The best advice I can rly give you is talk to your father, help him , do things togather learn , or just be there it will mean a world to him.

It runs in my family and I can feel and have felt the symptoms edging in for a while but am high functioning on a low dose of time release Adderall, exercise, and low carbohydrate and sugar diet. I expose myself to as much temporary storage activities as possible such as: dancing/choreography(no matter how simple), music/learning songs, and art/ learning to draw different things or use different mediums. This will not be a preferred or even recommended approach, but in the desperate world of Dimentia, at it's current climate, no anactdotes are useless. Especially if it is helping someone to thriveas I am. You will find your grove with diligence and support.
I replied elsewhere but my dad has done well with a somewhat keto diet (he's reduced carbohydrates way down -- but I would say it's more of a diabetic diet than a keto diet), walking daily, and taking Aricept, even though his diagnosis isn't Alzheimer's. All of this has seemed to slow the onset.

Sorry for your diagnosis, but you seem very brave for having received this so recently and I applaud your reaching out to your communities. 
My father has it and him being a neurosurgeon has been incredibly difficult due to his knowledge from his profession.  The first few years were so incredibly difficult because of his arrogance on being a neurosurgeon saying he would "know" if he had dementia because he's a brain surgeon!  I was able to reach out to his neurological friends to encourage testing where he finally admitted he had "a little atrophy in his frontal lobe." 

Your humble approach in seeking out information will help you immensely.
This thread is pretty small but I have found a lot of helpful information as well as positive support that I hope you will find as well.

Since you have discovered it in the early stages, I would suggest including research in care for your later stages to make transitions easier when needed. 
My mother died suddenly and we were wholly unprepared as how to provide him with immediate care.
We went with 24 hour in home care as most of us children live out of state. He also is financially able to do this for the time being, but the incredible expense ($14,000/month) is limiting.  The dread we are facing when it's time to move him to a facility is starting to feel daunting.  Especially as the one of us that lives nearby is adamant dad's "not that bad" and we are over reacting. Many more issues there, but that's another story.

I hope you have a supportive family and good group of friends bc you will need to rely on them, so don't be shy in reaching out to them letting them know this. That's what we do.  

And a power of attorney will be necessary so start thinking about who you can trust to have your best needs in mind.  And a backup!

Lastly, I would suggest puzzles!  Anything to keep your brain stimulated.  Jigsaw, sudoku, crossword, brain treasers etc.  It's like exercises for your brain and I've read it can help delay the advancement of the disease.  Also a fun distraction to the stress you're probably feeling. 

You're off to a very positive and healthy start just by asking for help and doing research.  Stay the course, stay positive and stay brave. You got this!  

Best wishes to you and yours. 

Hey, xunavolt, just a quick heads-up:  
**wierd** is actually spelled **weird**. You can remember it by **e before i**.  
Have a nice day!

Thank you
this is something i am planing on just to get my brain work as much as i can + training of any sort
As soon as I'm done with neurophysiologyst I'm sure I'll have a ton more questions. And thank you kind person from the internet
thank you for a very informative replay. I'm sorry to hear all the problems your family has faced.

The truth about illnesses   especially if you live in a shithole country as I do, it very very hard to get anything done, or be taken seriously.

You need to be a dick about things if you want to get a doctors appointment especially if you need something very specific.

I m not sure how far my problems go or how old they are at this moment in time since I can't pinpoint a moment in time that I can say "Yes I have a disorder".

From experience I know ppl full them self when it comes to being sick, it will pass it just stress everyday life etc, but most of the time that's not the case

I'm sorry to hear that you lost your mother, for me my mother died a little over 2 years ago suddenly after just 21 days of being admitted to the hospital on unrelated sickness.

As for puzzles I do love playing Tetris with my wife, and other puzzle-like games.

Just a note on being brave, it warms my heart that some stranger thinks that about me, but its the only viable option that I have, its to fight in any way shape or form that I can.

&#x200B;

and thank you one more time for your comments and support i rely means the world to me

We had fall pads for my grandfather - they were like gym mats on both sides of bed. 

I think there’s correlation between head trauma + Alzheimer’s so head protection is best. 

Watch over your loved one and make sure they’re safe - ask their health professionals that know the patient. 

Best of luck

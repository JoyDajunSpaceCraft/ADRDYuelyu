Honestly i would ask a doctor First before reddit
You could take your mom to a neurologist for a work up and even suggest a neuro-psych evaluation which would give your mom and her doctor(s) a good baseline to monitor any cognitive changes. 

My mom also has small vessel disease. Hers was discovered after a stroke in 2016 when she had follow up MRI's. She had pretty good recovery from the stroke, but the small vessel disease is chronic. She was diagnosed with vascular dementia in early 2019. 

The only meds for this are what your GP is already doing- BP and a statin. My mom's cholesterol levels were high and untreated for years which contributed to her decline. She didn't really address it until she had the stroke which was a huge wake up call for her. She was also in her 70's. Your mom at only 56 has a much better chance of getting things under control now.
in my own opinion (as someone with several Loved Ones who had dementia when i was younger, and now living with dementia symptoms myself, along with several hundred peers living with dementia) one of the best extenders of ability is a sense of purpose. Value and Purpose are strong factors with and without dementia.  plus Sleep, and other "Best Practices".  etc.
Thank you. The doctor has prescribed several medications. However the one overseeing her care is a standard GP without any specialist knowledge around this area. So would be good to know if anyone had had exposure to a specialist in this field who could pass on helpful advice

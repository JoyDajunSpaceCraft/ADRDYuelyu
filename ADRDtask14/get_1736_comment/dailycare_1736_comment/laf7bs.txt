Not likely dementia. Sounds like it could be more of a depression/anxiety issue as she senses her ability to care for herself slipping away. Hopefully shoe would allow for an evaluation. With change in personality a CNS issue would be in the differential. would consider frontotemporal dementia.
She will not even consider getting an evaluation. The 1 time i brought it up she flipped out. I even said to get 1 to shut me up and she wouldnt hear of it.
It's a very difficult process. Just gotta be consistent with the message and be supportive. My MIL can't hear a thing but refuses to get an evaluation due to vanity. We just keep bringing it up when she can't hear something...happens daily. We are not mean about it, but instead keep repeating how much we care about her.

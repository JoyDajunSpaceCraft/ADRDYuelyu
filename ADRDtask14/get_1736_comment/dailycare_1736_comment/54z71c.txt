Is the memory clinic like adult day care you can go to every day?  Or are we talking more like going to the doctor periodically?

If the former (day care) - There is supposed to be a benefit to alz patients engaging in activities to keep their minds sharp.  Socializing is also beneficial.  I imagine the day program would incorporate both.  I'd advocate for her going.  The pride issue is a tough one - my mom has gotten to where she won't take ANY help - the earlier you can get her in a program and used to it, the better.

If the latter (doctor's office) - definitely go.  If she hasn't had an MRI or other workup - it could be something other than Alz (friend's grandma had alz-like symptoms, turns out it was a weird brain cancer that is super treatable, go figure).  Offer to make the appointment first thing in the morning where people are less likely to see.  Or your sister can offer to pretend like the appointment is for her if you bump into anyone on the way.

And talk to your sister about the cutting off of the grandchildren.  Hopefully now that she has a medical diagnosis (other than grandma is being weird) she'll not withhold the grandkids.

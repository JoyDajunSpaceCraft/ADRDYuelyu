Try telling her she is needed there. Play it off like a job.
Yestarday after coming back it wasnt the same as the last 2 times.. she was still adamant that she doesnt want to go. Still in the phase of denial that she doesnt want to be dependent and compares herself to her past self. I did try to talk to her and motivate her but didnt work. How do you guys Motivate a depressed person ?
Cannabis.

Hey there. I feel your anxiety and pain. Having to deal with the possibility of dementia is so tough on the person but also on the family. My mom was a college professor as well and when her memory started to go it dealt a blow to her while identity and our perception of her. Things change and you adapt.  
That being said, the first step is going to see a neurologist or geriatric doc that specializes in dementia. There can be many causes of dementia or dementia-like symptoms. A professional needs to be involved and rule them out first. It took us about 3 years from when we noticed major issues to get my mom to see a doc. Keep trying, keep insisting. At some point you can get your dad to go.

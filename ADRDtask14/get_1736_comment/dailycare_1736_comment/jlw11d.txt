Yes I see it every day; my wife  of 22 years will be confusing who I am but will be able to sing along to entire songs with complex lyrics like Bob Dylan stuff and lots of light pop stuff. It makes her happy too, so yes keep the lights on with color and make sure they have good stimulation.
Thanks for the tip.  Music never leaves us.

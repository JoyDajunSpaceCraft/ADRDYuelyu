You might try an adult day care center for people with memory issues? I’m not sure if they are open during Covid or not though. My mom went there 5 to 6 days a week, and I noticed on the days she was home all day(Saturday/Sunday) her anxiety was super high. The rest of the week she was pretty mellow. I think it’s because she was a teacher before she got sick, and her anxiety was her native intelligence peeking out.
1. CBD helps my Mom some.
2. Get the feeling your Mom is not engaged enough.  Whoever is there with her needs to talk with her, show her photos, videos, talk her for a walk, etc.  This is a common problem because it is exhausting and you can't get other things done, but boredom leads to anxious thoughts.
Closed due to Covid. We are on a waiting list.
CBD did nothing and she’s very anti marijuana so THC is out as she never used it in her life. 

We did get another aide and told her that the highest priority is engaging my mom . We bought all kinds of simple games and also said let her think she’s helping with cleaning and chores and such. The aide we have from 2-5 is great. The one from 8am-2pm is new and seems okay but we’ve been through six aides in two months in that shift. It’s so hard when unemployment pays more, and also where my mom is from many aides speak poor English which upsets and confuses her. The two ladies we have now are Hispanic and easier to understand and very kind. They had sent a Haitian and a Korean lady that even I could barely understand. I felt awful, but we tried each for a few weeks and had to switch. Neither was very engaged with my mom, and they made her worse with confusion, not better. We’ve tried two agencies. Even with this new girl who seems better, she calls all day long

We need the senior center to open back up. We had her all set for really cool groups for people with memory issues, but MA has a lot shit down including these groups to new people.

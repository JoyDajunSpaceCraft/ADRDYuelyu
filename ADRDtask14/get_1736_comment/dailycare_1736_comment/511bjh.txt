Do you have a formal diagnosis besides Wernicke-Korsakoff? That *is* considered a type of dementia, Alcoholic Dementia; a friend's dad died from that. You should have a physician examine your uncle to specifically find out if there's also something else going on.
To answer your question about what stage and how many more years... it varies from person to person and you would need to get a diagnosis to find out what stage of dementia he is in (regardless of cause). They have tests to measure where someone is in their capabilities.

He could take a quick downward spiral, or be around for more than a decade: a lot depends on his physical health as well. It just depends on so many factors, and I'm not sure even the doctors would be able to hazard a guess. 
I honestly don't think it might be that anymore because he hasn't drank since he was put in the nursing home.  The way Wernicke-Kosakoff is supposed to work is if you stop drinking you snap back some what.  This isn't the case he seems to not understand his age, were he is (thinks he is teaching still) and gets my sister confused with my mother who passed away from FTD about 2 years ago.
Have him seen by a neurologist for an accurate diagnosis 
You should have a physician examine him. Also, I just looked it up and it seems that Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome is only a symptom of Alcoholic Dementia. The page also says that, "once alcohol dementia develops it is difficult or impossible to reverse."

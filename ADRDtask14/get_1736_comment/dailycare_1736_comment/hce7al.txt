Hi.  We put height risers under the legs of my moms couch so she wouldn’t have so far to drop down onto a couch and that helped for a bit.  I don’t know if that might help your Mom or not.  Also my Mom was a creature of habit and would sit in the same spot always no matter what other furniture or chairs were put in to the room if that makes sense.  So just a few thoughts from my limited experience. Best to you.
When we placed my Mother In Law into her dementia assisted center we went out & bought her a big, comfy chair that has the remote that makes it easy to recline. She was already mentally too far gone and has never used the chairs reclining ability.
My father in law has a recliner that lifts and such, but I don’t think my mom could handle it’s features. Those sorts are too complex for dementia patients.
In mid to advanced dementia, a friend brought me a recliner to use for my dad since he refused to sleep in his own room anymore. He never used the recline when I would recline it for him he was scared of it.
Thanks for everyone's advice. I greatly appreciate it. We elected to use a gravity chair to prop her up some hours while she continues to sit in her favorite spot for other hours to watch TV and socialize.

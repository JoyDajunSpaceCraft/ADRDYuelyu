I wish I had some constructive advice for you! Clever is right! Too bad duct tape is wildly inappropriate, right?

I will share instead in solidarity - that once my husband gave our loved one a laxative too late in the day. She, of course, ‘laxed’ big time. She tried to change the adult diaper herself, but couldn’t get it off! So she came all the way across the house to get my husband, trailing diaper poop across the carpet, through the kitchen, down the hall, into the bedroom and another carpet. I felt so bad for her, and was dry heaving bc of the smell, and was also laughing because it was all just too much. We forever will call it the POOPOCALYPSE. 

Your situation won’t last forever - you can do it! I hope you’ll report back if you find a solution❤️❤️❤️❤️

The Always “underwear” feels more like real underwear than the standard adult diapers. That’s what we started with. I’m not sure if my mom even really noticed (but she was later moderate when she started needing to wear them).

The period underwear someone else mentioned is also a good idea, if it’s just urine. Speax by Thinx is specifically for urinary incontinence. Most hold up to 8 teaspoons of liquid according to the site. They’re not cheap, unfortunately.
Following this thread! Wondering if anyone has good recs for adult diapers that actually hold a full load of urine :( Depends aren’t as dependable as they say
If you're handy, composting toilets are pretty easy to make. Functionally all you're doing is popping in a bucket and stirring in organic material. There's also cassette toilets that can be cheaper and hold in smell better.
My  mom drank soap for several days before I figured out why she was so sick.  So much poo.  I still feel awful 10 years on.  You could put a grocery bag in the bedside toilet and bag the poo.  People put baby diapers in the trash, right.  Still have to clean it.  Might make it worse, but could try that.
My mom worked in Alzheimer's care for years, and is helping my partner and I support his grandfather as caregiver for his failing grandmother.  Grandma wears depends underwear occasionally as needed, and my mom has said time and again how important it is to just call them "underwear."  Don't make it a special thing, normalize it.

Meanwhile, grandpa, in his thick Scottish accent, calls them DI-A-PERS and it is very hard to get him to change that terminology.
My Dad used to order some online that could absolutely hold a “full” load. They were pricey and I dont remember what brand, but they worked. 
I am sorry you are dealing w this time. Its rough. But if anything, try to find the humor in it when you can because as my Dad used to say, “I have to laugh to keep from crying.” He had some pretty funny stories from those times that had us crying. Of course, Mom would be so embarrassed if she was aware of any of it, but it did lighten the load of dealing with it all. Hugs my redditor friend.
There are options that hold up to three liters. You could call a nursing home and ask where they get their stuff. They probably have all the different types in use for various residents.
Omg soappppp that’s awful! 🤦🏻‍♀️
Thank you both! We’re at a stage where we don’t think we’ll be able to take her anywhere, and I feel as though having effective adult diapers would change that. Appreciate your help

A good hallucination to add would be to look in a mirror and have a stranger looking back at you. My dad used to complain about a "wierd man" looking at him from the windows at night and in the bathroom. He had just forgotten what he looked like.
   
Edit:
   
The confusion will be the hardest to convey. How do you make someone forget how to do something? 
Near the end my dad forgot what a cup was for and when he was thirsty he would get a teaspoon and go to the sink and drink using the teaspoon.
If you have some sort of money or currency, it should randomly disappear.

Buy expensive things without thinking and overpay small purchases, to simulate loss of sense of monetary value.

Things are not where you put them + hallucinations/reasoning of someone stealing said items. 

Seeing the same person as several different people, depending on their mood.

Loss of sense of time (how much time has passed since X, what time of day is it, what year is it, what season is it, how soon a future event is due, misinterpreting clock) 

Loss of social "filter" when speaking - saying things without thinking if they're offensive/appropriate or not.
Maybe have the viewer occasionally be in a 1950s school then the view segues to the present, showing the confusion dementia sufferers can have about how old they are and what year it is.

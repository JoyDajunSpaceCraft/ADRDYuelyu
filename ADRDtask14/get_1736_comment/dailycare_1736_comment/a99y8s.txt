I can’t offer much advice on your specific questions, but maybe this alternative strategy may help... 

With my Mom, we just asked her to sit and we would come open the door for her.  Sometimes we have to do it in a way to just be really calm and gentle. Sometimes we give it a positive spin like she is getting the royal treatment (treated like a queen/princess).  My mom is still able to get out of the car on her own once we unbuckle her seatbelt and open the door, so (for now) we are usually okay at that point. 

Good luck!  I’m sorry for this stressful situation for you and your family!

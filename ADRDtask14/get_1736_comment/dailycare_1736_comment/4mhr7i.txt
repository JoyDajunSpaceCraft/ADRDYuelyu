I don't think you have anything to worry about, because Lou is not trained to be a caregiver at all. She isn't trained to do anything at all, this was the only job she could find. Will has an actual medical caregiver as well, he just isn't there all day so they hire someone to make sure Will doesn't commit suicide again.
I liked the book, but I am also not any kind of certified caregiver, I just live with my intellectually disabled aunt, so I didn't think of that aspect while reading it.

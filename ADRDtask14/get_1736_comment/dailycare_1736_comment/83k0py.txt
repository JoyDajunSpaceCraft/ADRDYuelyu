Have you checked out Liftware? It's silverware for people who have tremors and poor motor skills. Don't know if it's up her alley or not.
Great work, keep it up. Keep her helping her self as long as possible. Itâ€™s good for her motor skills and mental stimulation. 
I just did, and they look really great. For now, what we have is working, but I emailed myself a link for later.

Sorry to hear you've got even a chance. 

Dad had Alzheimers. His father, mother, sister, and two of 4 brothers had it. The only explanation for both parents is that both of them came from the same small village. 

I never did testing, assuming it was a matter of time for me. But here I am in my sixties with no signs. 

There's plenty of hope. 
EOA runs in my family as well. Same chances here, 50/50, but I am not going to test my self. My life would never be the same if I would, and I quite like my life right now :) (25 yo)
I was thinking about doing this as well (my maternal great-grandmother and grandmother both had it). I'm not sure if I want to know yet... I think I'm just going to eat healthy and exercise regularly. I'd rather not know, but at the same time I'm curious and worried. 
I am so sorry to hear that you have an increased chance. It's great that you have to opportunity to test. I would like to suggest that you apply for long term stay insurance BEFORE testing.  I have included the aarp article on how to choose one. Too many people discover they need it when they can't get it. It pays for assisted living (US average is over 4,000.00 per month and normally higher for AD ward) I didn't realize that Medicare and supplemental insurance did not cover any portion of these services until my SO needed them. The younger you are when you sign up the cheaper the rates, and to be honest having AD in your family history might alarm them to begin with. Once you have a positive genetic test on file, it will be cost prohibitive for you to get long term stay insurance and can even effect the cost of your life insurance premiums

My mother has EOA and I have been wondering about the testing process. Can you tell me a little bit more about it perhaps?

Don't worry, I can understand your reasoning. I've been thinking about it a lot as well, just came to a different conclusion. I have no idea which gene is mutated, I have to ask my mom, so let me get back to you on that :) 
I'd love to know actually! I'm pretty curious about it.

Never mind my previous comment I was so excited to find a sub reddit, saw this, and did not read the rest of the comments. I will get in contact with a hospital here in America and see what they have to say! Best of luck to you and your family. I know how hard it is to watch someone you love slowly forget everything. Hang in there and stay positive.

Am am curious as to why it takes so long to do the testing?

That makes sense. I have really thought it through and know that I want to do it so I will look into it. It's a hard decision, but maybe there will be more progress in the future to stop it.

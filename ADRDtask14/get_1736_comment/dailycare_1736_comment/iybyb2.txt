In my city, the Red Cross and another community-based agency offer rides for those exact reasons. They aren't free, but are usually cheaper than taxis, and have to be booked in advance. The drivers are volunteers, so they are screened to make sure they are safe, reliable people. Maybe her city/town has a similar program?
Uber and Lyft have partnered with third party companies to offer options for Senior, particularly for ones that may not have a smart phone or perhaps have a Jitterbug.  Google uber for seniors.  Your local Office for the Aging may also have slightly younger seniors who volunteer to transport the elderly, however, depending on the center this may be only for doctor appointments.  Giving up the license is a really big deal.  We're still hearing about it three years later.
We used Uber.  At one point we had a Family Uber account so I could help my husband schedule rides home if he became confused.  My drivers were very kind and courteous, helping with walker, etc.  I tipped a bit extra.  This worked for over a year for us until my husbands health deteriorated further.
You can call 2-1-1 to see what services there are in your area for transportation for seniors. You can also research at [ridesinsight.org](https://ridesinsight.org).

I didn't think of the Red Cross, I will check, thank you.
Yep perfect ï¿¼
Thanks, I will look further into Uber. 

Yes, the driving issue is so huge for some people. It won't be for me! But for my mom it's huge. She still thinks she will be able to get her license back "eventually" so we aren't selling the car, yet. I don't want to upset her especially since she has agreed to stop driving, and we have secured the keys.
Hmm. I need to look into the family account. I haven't used Uber much myself so I'm not aware of this feature. Thank you!
Thank you!

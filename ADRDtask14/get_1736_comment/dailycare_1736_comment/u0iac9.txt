External catheters are great. And there are also lifts (look up "hoyer lift") to help with lifting.
We use those blue chucks on the bed and dad sleeps without the depends. He is disabled on his left side from stroke. He uses a urinal at night (many times during the day and night. The stroke weakened his bladder). They have urinals with hoses that make it easier for them to use at night but my dad just uses a regular urinal that we keep bedside. Your grandpa should also get rehab/physical therapy if possible because it will teach him ways to handle this while maintaining his dignity. Bed protectors help lots but thereâ€™s still lots of laundry. Sending you and your dad big hugs
will look into this and thank you!
thank you kind person :DD  and we've been trying to get him to exercise his arm and move it more often and will definitely tell my parents about possible rehab!!! and we already put bed protectors so that his pee doesn't spill on the matress.

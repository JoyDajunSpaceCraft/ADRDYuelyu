Spend a lot of time doing things with him where he can't talk.  I'll say thats harder now with covid than before.

Does he shut up when watching a movie?  My dad likes swimming so once things sound safe, I'll be doing that with him.  Play an instrument and sing with him.  I think some gyms have virtual and outdoor classes now you can put him into so he's talking with the group instead of you..  my library has some free online classes too..  I'm going to try a virtual reality headset and let him play blackjack with other people too so he can talk to them, not me.

My dad isn't negative.  He brags all the time and I can't stand it.  

Also, is there any activity in general that distracts him? My dad likes reading the newspaper and gets lost in it when he reads.
Could you put headphones on him and play music or a book on tape ?
Unfortunately my dad has macular degeneration and can't read. He's lost all interest in watching TV even if it's just to hear the news channels. He is more or less bedridden but we can put him in a wheelchair for a change but that's it. So all your appreciated suggestions wouldn't work, but I thank you for taking the time to think of things.
Sorry, that sounds tough.

I don't know if you want to try it but virtual reality is said to allow some people with macular degeneration to be able to see again inside the headset.  Its because it changes the focal point of vision so its possible say your dad would be able to read the internet while he has the headset on.  I don't want to get your hopes up cause you'd think itd be more well know by now if it helped everyone.

But thought I'd mention since financially, you can just buy from a place that allows returns so no financial risk.  And there have been people posting success stories on reddit.  Theres specialized vr headsets specifically for people with macular degeneration too but I honestly don't know if the tech is truly there yet.  It will be someday.

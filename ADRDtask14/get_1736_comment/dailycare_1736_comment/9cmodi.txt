Not sure, I am in the U.S. and currently the sole caregiver for my 96 year old grandmother with dementia.  I WISH I could have someone come to the house and help out four days a week for free.  The only services provided here are under Medicare (very little help in home) or Medicaid (must be indigent).  But working full time and coming home to be a caregiver at night is a 24/7 operation that cannot be sustained by one person alone.  I was doing that and lasted 2 months, ultimately quitting my job until I find a solution.  Hugs to you and your family.

You can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved.
Before a doctor, I’d get her to an elder law attorney for a will, Durable Power of Attorney- durable meaning it’s still in effect if incapacitated by cognitive decline or unconscious, Health Care Directive & Health Care Power of Attorney. If she does has dementia, it’ll progress to where she can’t manage finances & things can unravel. (Lose $ to scams, paranoid you’re stealing— without DPOA you can’t protect her life savings.) But not a springing DPOA where conditions must be met in order to go into effect. If it requires a doctor’s letter, she’ll never go and you’ll still be stuck. (Our elder law attorney says if you don’t trust them now with your $, why name them as POA? If you do trust them as POA later, you can trust them now to let you manage on your own until you actually need help.) As for getting diagnosed, you could pose it that flu shots are essential in these times of COVID, but have it actually be a complete physical including memory testing. Unfortunately, you may have to wait for “an event” like a health emergency, fall, or getting lost to get her evaluated. Even with an official diagnosis, prepare for continued denial. (I’m fine, the doctor lied. You’re all out to get me.) The disease of dementia prevents her from believing she has dementia. We have a diagnosis and DPOA in effect, but sadly now waiting for an “event.”
If she is diagnosed with dementia, it's going to be a challenging experience for the entire family. I suggest you and your siblings reach out to the Alzheimer Society chapter in your area for support. Some may offer online support groups and classes as well as phone counselling. Before the pandemic, everything was in person. Everything is free and very helpful.

Brutal truth here:

It doesn’t matter whether they believe the diagnosis or not. Sooner rather than later, they wouldn’t remember that fact anyway.
Do you require a diagnosis?  It's very difficult to conduct the necessary tests without the cooperation of the patient.  My MIL found the memory tests "stupid" and refused to participate.
My mom - who doesn't have dementia - is 79 and is a 'thoughts and prayers' kinda lady too, so I get that frustration.

(I'm in Canada, btw, though not Ontario)

You may have to take her to a doctor - as a family - and have her assessed. If she's found to be without mental capacity to handle her affairs, the doctor can sign off with a second doctor to have her legal ability taken away. You might need a lawyer for that part - not sure for Ontario.

That being said - you'd best be damned sure she has dementia. Just 'reading up on it' isn't good enough, as dementia is mimicked by quite a few other issues, and I highly recommend you take your suspicions - make a list - to a doctor without her first.

If you just do it without that first and you're proven wrong, your mother will likely never trust you again, will think you're demon possessed, throw you on every prayer chain in the church and a slew of other things.

So tread carefully here. It's not easy to watch someone fade in front of you, but acting too fast can be even worse.

Good luck.
Thank you. Yes, I was thinking of taking her in to get “routine blood work” but have them assess her while there.
But you can try.
Very helpful. I did print out POA forms last week and have been helping/reminding her to make payments...makes sense to become POA now. But the DPOA sounds like a better option. 

Thank you so much for all of this information. It’s been a struggle as she’s only 68. I’m wondering if being isolated/alone during Covid has made things worse as her mind hasn’t been active. 

I’ll look into DPOA.
Thank you so much for the info and great resources!
I’ve been running into this quite a bit lately. Have a phone call or chat in-person about something and 10 minutes later it’s forgotten. She got mad about something I said about religion (we were talking about how old testament god is fire and brimstone, but if she follows jesus then it should be all about love), she went in the kitchen to make a coffee then came back and had forgotten she was angry. I brought the conversation back up and she didn’t recall us having it.
We’d like a diagnosis so we know where she’s at, if there are ways to delay decline, if she needs a care worker, etc.
Thank you for the advice. I have spoken with 2 neuroscientist friends and an MD co-worker here in TO about the symptoms and they agree to it most likely being dementia. 

You’re correct about the trust bit, though from what I know of her, mum hasn’t ever trusted anyone other than her god. But she would absolutely cut me or us kids out. One of the things we’ve noticed lately is her “turning” on people who she would never have before. She accused one of her best friends of stealing from her and cut her out of her life since. 

Thank you for the kind words!
Yep, you can also set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.  At one end is "fuck off and die" and at the other end is "I will destroy myself for you".  Neither extreme is good.  

If the other person is adamant about not doing the things you think will help them, then you can't make them do those things.  You cannot make an alcoholic stop drinking.  You cannot make a clinically depressed person stop self-harming.  You cannot make a criminal go straight.  You can try to help, but an adult insists on going down a harmful/painful path, then you have to understand: 

***That is their choice.***
A POA that doesn’t say Durable ceases to be valid whenever the person is mentally incapacitated.

We bought a round medelert off Amazon. It has a lock and moves to the next section. When it moves to the section, an alarm goes off (it's loud) and it continues to go off until the unit is picked up and turned over or for 30 min. You wouldn't have to lock it, but we do because he has doubled up before. It works for us.
There are several options including the one just mentioned. My dad uses the built-in alarm in his phone to tell him when to take meds. Then his meds are arranged in a weekly pill box divided by morning and evening meds.
There are services that will call him when he's supposed to take his medicine and they can actually stay on the phone with him while he goes and gets the pills and takes them. Many are part of insurance companies, so you might start there with a call to see if they offer the service.
If your dad is able to use computer or iPad, i am very partial to [www.dementiamentors.org](https://www.dementiamentors.org) , for us as Persons Living with Dementia .  There is also video Zoom chat as a family on Harry's Friday night chat with Forget-Me-Not.
This looks exactly what we need. Thank you so much!
He's not good at using his phone and sometimes it's not even switched on. I think the one mentioned above will be perfect. Thanks for the advice.

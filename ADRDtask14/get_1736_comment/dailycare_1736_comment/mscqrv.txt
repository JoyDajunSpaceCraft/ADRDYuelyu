Well, you have tp put your foot down.  And take away the "My father is refusing" sentence, he can't have that authority with the life of your mother in the balance.

What caretaker company/ system are you using that they may not give medications?  Not a good sign; as that is the maybe Number 2 most important reason to have someone there on site 18/24 or 24/24...

&#x200B;

So, 1) you will need to look into a locked medicine cabinet, or even one with some sort of auto dispensing timer deal... especially for the narcotics!!!  And if you ever find it tampered with, then you will have to separate the two of them...

&#x200B;

2) Maybe look at a different nursing service, as they are not providing the needs to that which you want.

Has your father ever gotten violent, or extra loud in his shouting?  also not good.  Look into Sunset violence behavior, where the pre-dementia patient also gets disoriented and goes off on a tear as the sun sets/ bed time steps are enforced...  Old people DO NOT like to give up their years long authority in their own house/ control over their body steps/ day to day activities.

I would say also, that it might be time for one of the siblings to move back in with your parents to be the boss of the house; as that is the best way to ensure that the correct things are done as the day goes on... and that both your parents will live as long as is possible ( with minimum hurt/ pain/ troubles)!
Not sure where you live, but in England, the chemist can put the correct meds into a blister pack (or dosette box, whatever they want to call it) and you dad can still feel he is in charge with the meds by giving your mum the correct day and time. The live in carer can also monitor this and become aware if any other days/times have been taken. Chemists here don’t really like doing blister packs as it’s more work for them and less money... but the service is there so fight for it. Good luck.
Thank you so much. We will get an auto dispenser to start. We cannot afford a live-in nurse over the current caretaker so that I will see what we can do. 

It is hard to put your foot down but you are right. I have not heard of sunset violence behavior, I appreciate the information. 

Right now one of my siblings lives neighboring them so it does help though I will talk with them all about more than this. Very appreciative of your help. Been feeling lost because we just started this journey with them. Thank you.
Yes the pharmacy will blister pack the regular medication but the pain meds they can not. I have a separate dispenser now and the care taker is overseeing the meds without dispensing.

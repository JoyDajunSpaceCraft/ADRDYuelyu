I wouldn't assume that because your dad is distracted and losing his keys that he has Alzheimer's.  Just keep your eye on him for now.
I agree that these aren't necessarily symptoms of dementia. Maybe try writing down (or have your mom do so) any concerning symptoms. If there is a pattern or an increase in frequency, call the doctor.

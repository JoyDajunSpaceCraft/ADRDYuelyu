This is most likely a progression based on what my dad went through. keep trying different things but they do have a tendency to eat softer foods. Also, I read somewhere that the taste buds can only detect sweet and salty food and not a whole lot of other tastes. My dad didn't like sweets until his dementia got worse. then sweets were his favorite foods.
When my grandmother was getting worse she kept saying that her hot water (drink of choice) was too cold. My aunt was super confused because she would have just put it down from being heated. But she would heat it a little more and bring it back. And grandma would say again that out was too cold. But my aunt wouldn’t heat it up more for safety. Eventually she would drink it, and we sort of assumed she just resigned herself to it not getting any hotter. It turned out she kept meaning it was too hot, and she would drink it once it cooled down. Her brain kept mixing up the descriptions. It was to “temperature” but she kept using the wrong word. I wonder if something similar might be happening, and by the time you puréed it the soup was completely room temperature. Obviously if the soup was not super warm to begin with this wouldn’t apply. But maybe she’s getting her descriptors mixed up and she doesn’t mean to hard but something else that is a descriptor of soup. It was something that happened with my grandma a bunch before we figured out what was going on so I wanted to mention it.
Might be worth getting her an appointment to see a speech therapist and have them do a swallow test to see if there is something going on. If nothing else, at least that way you’ll know if she’s just being picky or if there really is something happening.
Hmm I think that might be what's going on. Thanks for your input.

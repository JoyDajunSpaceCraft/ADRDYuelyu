You're not legally responsible for him until someone produces paperwork saying you are. Neither is your mom. Well, that's all very high level stuff...

Start with an alz.org hotline call and see if there are local or state resources to get you started. It's only the start, alz.org will point you in the right direction for your locale.
You're a good kid to want to help, but don't take on massive responsibility right off the bat.  Dementia is a long-term disease, the best thing you could do for your dad is finish school, get a good job, be stable.
You can't be a caregiver, you just don't have the resources. Since he's living with you for financial reasons, he may qualify for a number of low-income services. Definitely check out the resources posted, and see if you can help arrange supports to make his life easier while you pursue independence.

Thank you so much; I will give them a call and see what resources are available.

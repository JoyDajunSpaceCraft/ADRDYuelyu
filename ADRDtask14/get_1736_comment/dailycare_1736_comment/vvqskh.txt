I did this with my dad - exact same thing, working from home & caring for him simultaneously - and it worked when he mostly just needed medication reminders and meals prepared and a general structure of prompting throughout the day. Basically, it worked until he became like your mother. As his short term memory continued to fail, he started to forget I had work (or kids) and needed to do other things. He wanted me to sit with him all day, just like your mother, and watch tv. Even if I was in his line of sight cleaning the kitchen for example - he would be calling for me to come sit down. So I would bring my laptop and work from the couch. The day time neediness began to happen at night. If I wasn’t in his line of sight, he would wander all over the house looking for me, and sometimes out of the house. Inevitably, I had to hire aides to help me. I would recommend that you do the same. The earlier you can get her used to someone other than you being her buddy, the better. She may not want it at first, but if you can pretend you need the person there and they’re experienced wiry dementia, they should be able to befriend her. With my dad, I think he started to hate being alone because having someone else there, in his line of sight, was anchor to reality or gave a sense of security. She needs this and unfortunately it won’t get any better as dementia is progressive.

Sending hugs, btw. It is sooo difficult to juggle life and caregiving.
Oh this resonates with me so much. Earlier in my mom’s illness she was able to understand that I had to go to work, see my friends, or work from home. She now has no concept of that and needs to have me near her at all times. She has meltdowns frequently when I have to leave for work. What has helped is having a wonderful aide who has a lot of experience working with people living with dementia. My mom has formed an attachment to this aide, and I’m able to get work done when she’s here. I suspect your mom’s dementia will reach this point as well - look into hiring an aide, if possible.
Put a sign that says office on your door and dress for work, then go to work. Don’t respond during your work hours. Get a webcam so you can keep an eye on her. But what is your plan if your mom has a genuine need during a meeting? Doesn’t sound sustainable.
Look into senior day care in your area
What about putting a stuffed toy (bear, baby, dog, whatever) on the couch? My father loves his, and it can take some of the pressure off you.
I got that even in the very early stages tbh.
I had the same problem for months. The only solution that worked was hiring an in-home caregiver while I work/study. Things got a lot better, and I realised now I could even care better for my mother with things that needed my distance from her.  


I wish you good luck!
This is my mom but she dresses  inappropriately for winter. I bring her to my house on Sundays for a visit (she is in a nice assisted living facility) and in the bitter cold, -0 temps of winter, the coat she chooses is a sweatshirt hoodie. No boots, no gloves. Before picking her up I will tell her it’s cold so dress warm.

She will say, The sun is shining so I can’t believe it is this cold. It’s like she doesn’t see the snow on the ground! 

The car is warm and all the walkways are cleared but my main concern is what is there were car trouble and there she is, dressed for a fall evening rather than a brutally cold winter day!
Thanks for explaining why it's happening and the what's needed, I can see her being comfortable with anyone watching tv with her.
Thanks, I'm using signs to address certain behaviour and is working for now will try that.
I was going to suggest this if the parent is still physically able and enjoys socializing.
Thanks, thought about an animatronic cat.
I hear ya, it can get up to -40 in the winter where I live.  Clothing "mistakes" in cold weather can cost you your life here.
Someone else told me to think about being confused all the time and then being alone (even if someone else is in the house but not with them) and confused. I probably would feel more anxious too. In my experience, they become like kids again. They seem capable of some stuff but really they need a lot of guidance and reassurance. ❤️
I think if I had known about them earlier in my father's decline, I might have considered it. Now, it might freak him out.
> In my experience, they become like kids again. 

Exactly what it feels like. 

My mother is overdressing for the summer, and I'm constantly trying to make her more comfortable by taking off her winter house coat. She hates given that thing up, I tried to make her wear a lighter one I got her which she will do for awhile, but she wants they heavy hot one.   

Like damn mom doesn't it feel better being comfortable ?  Not a feeling cold due to a low blood pressure problem, that's good. She's taking medication for that and I check her BP once a week.
Pricey little comfort toys, just looked them up about $150.
I feel your pain. My dad always wants shorts and a T-shirt, even if it’s cold out, then complains of the cold. Then other times, he decides it “looks” cold outside and puts on his winter coat when exiting the house even though it’s summer. 

It’s interesting on my end because I have a 2.5 year old and they exhibit a lot of the same behaviors (she and my dad.) My 5 year old seems a bit more mature at times.
My mom does like to watch tv with her stuffed animals. What about a real dog or cat? (Not an option for my mom bc my dad hates pets.)
> What about a real dog or cat?

Would love to get one but the animal wouldn't be safe around her. She would without a doubt let it outside if it waited at the door.
I guess you’ll have to settle for stuffed animals then, my mom has them all over her bed & living room. She’s like a little kid now.

Does she have friends, nieces, nephews, etc., who can FaceTime her? My mom likes FT and thinks they’re really there. When they hang up, she says where did they go, they were just here?  She’s forgotten all about cell phones and wonders why my husband sits in front of a box (laptop), talking to himself all day like an idiot (WFH). 😂

Maybe you can schedule FT/zoom calls for her regularly so she won’t feel lonely.

Hey Lauren.  The first and most important piece of advise to give you is to learn patience and very thick skin.  Dementia is like a spectrum so not all people with it have the same symptoms.  

But, one thing is for sure, the people around your loved one are the ones who truly suffer the most.  

You’ll see periodic changes in personality and more likely than not, at some point, not recognize your loved one from a physical and / or personality level. 

My mother, who was diagnosed at 52 and is now 61, has put on over 100 lbs and went from super kind to incredibly rude to downright mean to back to being sweet again.  

Additional questions please feel free to ask.  
I would suggest recording the moment the doctor delivers the diagnosis to your mother in the upcoming appointment.  Our neurologist had me do this and it was helpful to play back later for my SO.  He didn’t rememberer happening and would insist he had no problems and it helped to connect him to the diagnosis a bit and he allowed me to help more making him safer.  Also it shifted the anger away from me.  He didn’t feel like me saying he had dementia was a judgment.  Ask the doctor about local resources that may help, someone in his office will probably have the numbers for any local day groups, the local council on aging, and any other resources your area may have.  You might not need them now, but it can come in helpful later on.

I’m not familiar with it at all - I’m sorry. 

And we had to “baby gate” my fathers home for similar reasons when my mother was diagnosed.

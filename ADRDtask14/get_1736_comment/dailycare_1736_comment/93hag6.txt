My father was in the navy years ago, so I got him custom engraved dog tags. He never takes them off now.

Iâ€™m pretty sure this is where we got my momâ€™s from! Good luck!
I just used a regular silver id bracelet for my father and got it engraved, he wouldn't have accepted using a medical type...
Perhaps she wants a more fashionable one. From what we found those tended to be flimsy. Also it is much better if itâ€™s an easily recognizable medical bracelet. However, I could see where she is coming from with that for sure!
We got my dad a [Road ID](https://www.roadid.com/?referrer=60640&gclid=CjwKCAjwtIXbBRBhEiwAWV-5nnHuiR5Mjpw9XYIysnVDpjfM_F2h-I3d_Z3oTI5HMiZ5zPxbIyirkhoCWOwQAvD_BwE) that he seemed to like and was comfortable. I put it on myself to figure out how the latch worked and couldn't get it off without help. You have to cut the band to the proper size, which I liked since I knew it wouldn't slip off.
That's the website I sent my sil, idk why she wasn't happy with those options ðŸ˜‘
That's awesome! Way to think outside the box for something to work well for him! 
I'll suggest this to my mil for gpa!

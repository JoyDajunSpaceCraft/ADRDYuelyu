She is violent.  There is a good possibility this will only get worse.  Record a violent incident and take it to the doctor, discuss your options.
I agree - meds will help a lot. Then you still will have to convince her to do those things - meds can't do everything.  My theory is that this is a deficit in executive function.  She sees each of these activities are a lot or work. Think about all the steps in getting her to have a shower. She can't follow those steps by herself anymore and even the thought can be confusing, frustrating and scary - which leads to resistance.   I will start with saying I think a shower would be a good idea later on. Then, I say I'll get the water turned on so it's warm enough. Then I'll get some interest in picking out the clothes to wear after the shower. I'll put out towels, shampoo, soap, face cloths. I give some cues in the way I say things - would you like me to put your watch on the counter after you take it off?  Can you check the water to see if its hot enough?  I try to give a choice where the answer is following the objective. It's a lot of effort, and it doesn't always work but it can work.
Wow sounds very hard...

Do you have a dementia hotline or organisation you may be able to call?
I second the others, talk to her doc and if they dont have experience with dementia find one that does. just maybe if her doc talk with her she will understand. This sounds incredibly difficult. hang in there.

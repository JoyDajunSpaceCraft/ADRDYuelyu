Just know that they will answer any of your questions and fears.  Every hospice worker we dealt with was an amazing human being.  They helped us deal with a lot of our fears.
Hospice is wonderful - they will help explain why things are happening. They are there not only for your loved one, also for the family. Ask questions about the process, it helps!
Be at peace with yourself - this is a good thing!
Hospice has been fantastic with our family! I cried at first because I thought it was a death sentence but we’ve had them for a year and I’m so grateful! Give them time to get to know your mother and you should be alright. I didn’t have any questions at the beginning but as time went on I started to have a few and they always go out of their way to find the answer even if they don’t have it at the moment. It’s taken a huge stress load off of me (I’m my dads soul caretaker) giving me more time to just enjoy him. They are a wonderful resource and I think you’ll find yourself quite happy!
Hospice was amazing for my grandfather—always reachable and super helpful! Call them with whatever you need, they are there to help.
Cannot say enough about how incredible hospice and those people helping others are.
Yeah, this is something I didn’t realize when I was in my early 20s and my grandmother was in hospice care. I wish I had taken advantage of it.

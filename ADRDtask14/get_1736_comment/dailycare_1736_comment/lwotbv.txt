You tell her whatever is easiest on her. It's perfectly fine to fib because your are protecting them. It might be tough on you to say he's at the store or at a friend's house but it saves her that heartbreak.
I wouldn’t tell her he’s passed. I’d say he had to go on a work trip or something and then change the topic.
Something that helped me when caring for my dad was “meet them where they are” if he thought he was 10 I went with it. If he asked for his dad that passed he would be on vacation at the shore. In my opinion it makes things easier for them and less stressful for you. Imagine if you asked where your dad was and you were told they passed 8 years ago. That’s kinda traumatic and distressing and disorienting in my opinion. I used to tell him the truth until I read an alz book that said to meet them where they are. And it has helped sooo much. I used to try convincing my dad that something was true for like an hour and he would end up getting angry/ annoyed/ sad and it would never end well. I never had that problem once I stopped doing that.  But that quote also applies to their physical ability and mental ability. Like don’t do a 1,000 piece puzzle unless they are able to. Instead do a 100 piece puzzle.

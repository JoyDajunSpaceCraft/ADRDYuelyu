There are a couple of things you can ask for. A lot of this I learned after my mom had a really tough time flying with my dad.

* They should be able to board first, so the other passengers aren't breathing down their neck when getting seated on the plane.
* Wheelchair, or to have them drive them around in those cars from gate to gate (it's a long walk sometimes!)
* Don't forget that there are usually companion/family bathrooms available in addition to male/female. My mom was super anxious about going to the bathroom and leaving my dad alone, but the companion bathrooms should help with that.
* You can ask the airline for a special ticket that's not a boarding pass, but it will let you past security to accompany them to the gate if they need extra assistance.

I would also just call the airline to see if they offer anything else that I might have missed.
All of these plus: call TSA Cares 
tel:+18557872227 and they can help you make arrangements to get through security with a dedicated officer to assist through the process. They can answer your security questions, and help you with the security part of the airport. They are generally kind and helpful officers who volunteer for the duty of helping passengers who need assistance through security, and my mother had great experiences the three times she needed help with my grandma. Just call 72 hours ahead of your trip, or more.

First of all, you may not be able to. If he keeps doing things that put him or other people in danger, a home environment may not be the best place for him.

That said, you can try hiring home health aides. You can try to sell it as a personal assistant to make his life easier, and that really is what they are. They can't, unfortunately, deal with any financial tasks, but they can provide companionship and help with housekeeping and other tasks, as well as giving the family a break.

Does he have long term care insurance? If not, you may have to pay out of pocket. If you go through an agency, you'll pay more, depending on your area. (Example: rates near me are $25-30/hour.) The advantage is that the aides should have gone through background checks and are bonded and insured. Also, the agency may have an easier time finding aides than you would if you tried to direct hire. The disadvantage, obviously, is cost. In the US, a home health aide is paid $10-12/hour, so it will require more legwork but cost a lot less to hire one yourself.

For help paying for an aide, try contacting your state office for the elderly. They may be able to point you towards assistance. If he's a veteran, fit example, or on Medicaid, he'll probably qualify for some assistance.

Good luck. It's a rough road, and if it gets to be too much, there's no shame in recognizing that his care needs are too much and too complex for in home care to be viable. You need to sleep and eat and work and live your life.
Great advice

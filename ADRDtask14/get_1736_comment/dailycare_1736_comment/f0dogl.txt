Don't torture yourself yourself with the "what if" scenarios. You'll drive yourself mad. If your dad is turned away from one place, get the social worker to suggest other places. S/he/they should have given you several options.
Hey there,  I do admissions at a nursing home/rehab. Look at places that have both. If he has Medicare he has to do a 3 night stay in a hospital to go to to rehab.  Look for any reason to get him admitted to a hospital I. E. UTI,  a fall,  flu etc. While be is there u can tell him u want him to go long term & they may be able to hold him. Medicare allows 100 days of coverage,  20 are fully covered the rest are covered 80%. While he is using Medicare for that  rehab stay they can help become Medicaid eligible & move him to the Nursing home.  Hope this helps!!
If he needs *skilled nursing care*, a higher standard of care, many states have waiting lists unless you have money.  If you don't have money, contact the Office of Aging in your area.
just found this.

About **65 percent** of nursing home residents are supported primarily by Medicaid

they will take his house, and assets.
This is how we did it.
Being on Medicaid does not mean seizing houses and assets. 

Please stop spreading this kind of ridiculous rumor. It prevents people who need public benefits from applying because they think they will be made homeless.
This is false. Taking house and assets could happen, but not always. I understand what will and won't be taken. I am concerned with if he will be approved or not. You don't provide a source, and you are also false. I don't know what you read, but what is taken is highly specific to the situation. As others said, don't spread false rumors.
He wont be homeless, he would be in a care facility. A care facility cost between 7-11,000 per month, unless your assets are below the limit, then medicaid takes over.
Are you a social worker or work in Medicaid offices?

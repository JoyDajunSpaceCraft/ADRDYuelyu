You are assuming it is alzeheimer's (based on posting here), but she may have been suffering from Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome- brain damage caused by excess drinking.  Or maybe she had cognitive problems, but there was nothing wrong with her brain, and your cousin feels terrible, knowing it was probably something they could have treated.  

Those are just a couple of things I thought of off the top of my head.  People are weird, and 80% of the time they do weird things for reasons that are even weirder than any of the theories I came up with in my mind.
Good advice.I am going on with the study, just called and got a list of providers who are involved.

Misdiagnosis is so common, we need more reliable testing. That's why I need to get myself together and face getting in a study. Thanks for getting me motivated. The cost of genetic testing has really come down and it is the time to start providing data that could help others. Will call a researcher and set up an appointment.
Genetic testing only tells you if you have increased odds of Alzeheimer's, similar to heart disease or breast cancer.  You can have all the genes for breast cancer and heart disease, eat garbage, and still live to 100.

There are CAT scans that look at actual plaque in the brain, but it involves a substantial dose of x-rays and a contrast agent that persists in the body, so you doctor might not order it.

There is a [new test under development](https://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2017/12070/In_the_Pipeline_Alzheimer_s_Disease__Retinal.4.aspx) that looks (literally looks) at amyloid plaque that forms in the retina.  The retina is essentially an extension of the brain.  If the test works as well as early results promise, Alzeheimer's testing will be quick and cheap, in a few years.

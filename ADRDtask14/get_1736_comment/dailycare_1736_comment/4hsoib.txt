You are lucky she asks! My dad just takes some.  Just say you didn't or don't have enough or some simple answer.  If she persists offer to make her something that is "better for her" or something.  That's all I can think of.  Its hard to communicate and hard to tell the truth to someone who might not be able to rationalize.  
She only takes yours if you're not fast enough getting her her own plate. I lost some veggies and dip that way (and then because they hard cold veggies, she messed over them and spit them out), and mom lost the last of the cookies that way.
So frustrating!  I have kids so I always make too much food so that if he's in a hungry phase, we still have enough to eat.  He needs to eat though because he was losing a lot of weight, so I take it as a compliment that he wants to eat our food and I grin and bear it.  
Yeah. It's a new situation, and I just need to get used to it. You're right; I should be happy she's eating and wants to eat. At the nursing home, she was losing a lot of weight from stressing about being out there and just plain not being able to chew some of the food. My mom was bringing grandma food from either local restaurants or from home. I don't have kids; but from what I've heard/read, grandma eats like a baby: every couple hours, it's "hey what's good to eat?". And it's hard to take time out for yourself to eat, cause you're always popping back up to do something for her, and by the time you get to your own meal it's cold, but in the time it takes for you to microwave it and sit down, she's back in the kitchen again. I don't know if it's that she's actually hungry or if she just forgot she ate so her stomach is acting like she didnt eat. The other day, I tried to wait til she took a nap to fix something for myself, and all I got in all day was a ton of those mini Twix bars and half a cup of coffee. And Im trying not to fall into indifference; but it's hard to think of something new for her to eat every time, without falling back on the "same old same old, as long as she eats, whatever."

I think you need a lawyer stat to get a POA. He also should get a will.
You need to get poa right away. You won't get a facility to take him without many documents gathered and submitted if you have to apply Medicaid. And the burden of paying his bills may be too much for him
Check hard and be double sure before u sell anything, especially his home! Especially his home!!
Tough times, but you'll get through okay. Try to stay calm and rested too. There's lots of good advice and support for you here. :)
If you can afford an elder law attorney (which it sounds like he can), it's a good deal and may make him feel more comfortable about getting a POA set up.

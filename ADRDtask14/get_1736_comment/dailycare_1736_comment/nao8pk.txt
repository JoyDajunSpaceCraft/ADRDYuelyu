very common with "irritable bowel".  Mine was caused from undiagnosed celiac disease.  i had it all my life, so it was never enough of an issue to see specialists about it, but my celiac disease was found by chance when i went to a specialist for another disease.  He gave me loads and LOADS of tests for everything under the sun, and this was one of them.  Untreated celiac disease can also be a contributing factor in Dementia symptoms.
Since you are in this sub, I imagine they have some type of dementia. What you describe is a natural progression towards to latter stages.
Oh boy that's a long road to have to travel to get to this diagnosis. I will do some googling, thank you!
Thanks that's helpful. It's sort of "on plan" for people dealing with dementia.
Yes. It begins with accidents. They don’t realize they need to go until. It’s actually happening. This is when we switched to pull up Depends.

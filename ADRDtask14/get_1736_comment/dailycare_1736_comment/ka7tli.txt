A photobook with captions/descriptions of the people or places in the pics.
Some warm fuzzy socks, a textured throw blanket or snacks he can enjoy
Is he currently in the hospital and he will be there from now on? or how is his rsnge of movement? I agree with the textured soft items-- especially socks or slippers since older people tend to have bad circulation. I also think battery operated christmas lights can be very cheerful. Easy to play with toys-- a light up beach ball has been popular hear.  You might get a cheap mp3 player and fill it with songs that were popular when he was younger.
How about a free memory Book from us at Caring Hands Ministry? Just download photos and descriptions and we will create the book and ship for free.
It's likely he will stay in the Hospital. His range of movement is alright, uses a walker sometimes

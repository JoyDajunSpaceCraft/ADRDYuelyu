Hi OP, I haven't got much to contribute to this I'm afraid. At least nothing useful. My mum is 66 and has Alzheimer's, stage 5/6. It's relatively chilly here at the moment, around 5 celsius during the day, but it gets pretty warm in summer. With some encouragement around appropriate clothing mum seems to cope okay. She does complain about being cold a fair amount and she likes to sit or stand by the radiators. When the heating goes off she often goes on a rant about how my father is selfish and mean not heating the house (he has the thermostat on 26 celsius for the majority of the day just for her so their heating bill is already crazy). She didn't complain too much this summer when it got hot though.

The thing I really notice with mum is her massive aversion to water now, because of the temperature. She HATES showering or getting into the bath because she is so scared the water won't be warm enough. She used to love swimming and would get in the sea or a pool no matter the temperature, now she won't even get in in the height of summer when the temperature is wonderful. Yesterday she hurt her foot and when I cleaned it with a wipe she was flinching and wincing like crazy - I asked her if it hurt and she said it was because the wipe was cold.
I have for sure noticed this. I live in the UK and in summer I find that my nan is much worse. She wakes up earlier because it is brighter earlier. She goes out more because it is sunny and clear. She's meaner for some reason too. In winter the days are shorter so when she wakes up at 6am I can convince her to go back to bed because it is really dark but in summer it is bright and she'll refuse.

Check out the website for the [Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration](http://www.theaftd.org/).  They have lots of helpful information.

FTD mainly effects behavior, personality, speech, and executive function.  Memory loss would not necessarily be a symptom, but if she is really worried she can see a genetic counselor and even get a DNA test.
Excessive forgetfullness in the young can also be a sign of attention seeking, especially from dysfunctional upbringing.
Could be a vicious circle? She's going through a lot lately.. the situations sounds like an emotional rollercoaster which could lead to stress and thus forgetfullness.. awareness about the forgetfulness could lead to a focus on remembering things instead of being aware of your surroundings thus leading to forgetfullness.. emotional distress (anxiety, depressive symptoms) also coexist with forgetfullness. Maybe she should seek some support from a psychologist. 

Someone else here states that it could be attention seeking.. could be, but there might be other, more common reasons.

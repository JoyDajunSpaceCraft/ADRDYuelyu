I’m sorry, I’m not able to answer. You might also post on AgingCare.com. It is a very large community, that includes lawyers, doctors and nurses.  I know they have some that post from your area. They may be able to help you find a way.
I Would check out the alzheimers connected message boards - you should be able to get a fairly knowledgeable answer there.  
Thanks, will check it out

Mom was fluent in French as an adult.  Even though she couldn’t remember her regular words, her French was still very clear.
My mom's been speaking more and more German as her dementia progresses, which is the language she grew up with. 

She's fluently bilingual German / English, and has lived in the US for over half a century. One of the early signs of her dementia was that she would start using the wrong language - talking to a waiter in Germany in English, talking to our neighbors (who do not speak German) in German. She still seems to understand both languages now, but it's hard to say.
my dad has been reverting.  He was raised in china as a kid and moved to the US as an adult.

Im hoping to find a foster home for him that speaks chinese as well cause othererwise, im not sure if hell even remember english at some point.  He hasnt reverted too terribly yet though so Im not sure if it will get that bad or not.
My friend’s grandfather had a concussion and afterwards started speaking in a dialect of Italian that only his wife could understand. It was during covid and she couldn’t be there so it made things confusing to say the least.

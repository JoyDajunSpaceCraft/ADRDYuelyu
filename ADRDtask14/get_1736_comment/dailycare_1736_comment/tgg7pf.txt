I would say wait until the 29th to know exactly.  
My mom has vascular dementia but dad had a similar decline to what you describe  6 years ago following a Intracerebral hemorrhage stroke. He is doing better somethings got better..the 5 minute memory loss got better...the speech got worse..etc.
All I am saying OP. Wait and see. Symptoms do vary. I hope recovery for you Dad. Update us and take care of yourself in the meantime.
I send you positive juju. And send you a virtual hug
I waited 3 years to seriously press Doctors… big mistake.!!!
After a manic episode in 2018 my husband’s brain had changed. New 2021 Psychiatrist (we moved to get better care) they prescribed meds for his persistent tremors, but he still needs to sleep all day. His short-term Memory is shot, he can’t follow Basic instructions, and can’t understand written instructions. Having a conversation is slow, confusing & frustrating for both of us. 
Now retired I our 50s, I care for him 24/7 and am totally exhausted at this point. Drs don’t see the full picture.I think he has early stage dementia. He used to be a scientist working for the US government, now he has to be reminded to shower.
Unfortunately vascular dementia can often follow a stroke.

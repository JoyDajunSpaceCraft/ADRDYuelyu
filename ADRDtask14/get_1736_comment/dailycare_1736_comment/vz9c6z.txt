Yes.. my mother isn’t “wealthy” but well off for a widow with little to no debts. Biggest question is, did she come from a more “frugal” means? My mom’s mind is really that if when she was a teen.. growing up dirt poor. So she saves literally everything. She claims she only makes a $150 in paychecks each month. She is always wary of spending anything. I manage her cash and have stripped her of debit cards and cash in general
Because she would hide it and forget it.
My LO suddenly became extremely concerned about “cutting it off” meaning anything that used electricity. She was turning off lights which created fall risks, getting frustrated with any light left on anything electronic, such as the light on the TV turning from green to red indicating it was off. Over and over she unplugged all the TVs in the house to get those red lights to go out and then wondered why the TVs didn’t come on the next time she used the remote. She lived an upper middle-class lifestyle her entire life, but we realized that in the 1930s and 1940s when she was growing up, being careful to not waste electricity was probably the norm. 

In other words, yes, this is normal. She’s reverting to her childhood.
I think this is it. They revert back to what things cost back in the day or what they were making back then.
I'm not sure if this is still a problem for you LO, but is there a way to put black tape over the light to make her stop seeing it and reacting to it this way?

I had a BRIGHT blue light on a monitor at work that I had to cover this way just because it was annoying AF and was in my line of sight all day as I tried working. All day, that piercing blue light!

Anyway, if she doesn't see the "off" light, maybe she'd just leave it alone.
We duck taped over the plug and wrote on the tape “leave plugged in”. That seems to have worked for the moment at least. The tape on the TV light is a great idea! I’ll do that as well.

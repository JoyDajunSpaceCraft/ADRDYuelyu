You‚Äôre doing exactly the right thing! Just try to stay upbeat and keep your answer fresh rather than letting it get stale sounding.
It's common for people with dementia to have no concept of time any more. My father passed away in December and my mom repeatedly asked when the funeral was and also repeatedly asked when we were taking her back to the facility even though I had already answered those questions many times. She would sometimes ask the same question in the span of 2 min. It's more than just being forgetful, it's not understanding linear time anymore. She may never stop asking but it's typically best to just go with it, no matter how annoying it will inevitably get.
It‚Äôs okay. üëç
Therapeutic lies aren't bad and that's definitely one.
For ME i would prefer you say "i will stay this week, and then we can see how it goes" .  i wrote about this here >> [https://truthfulkindness.com/2021/02/07/lying/](https://truthfulkindness.com/2021/02/07/lying/) .
Maybe it would be better long term to look into caregiving for physically and or mentally handicapped people. They will appreciate what you are doing and you can build up report with them. What do you think ? I am not saying you're not cut out for what you're doing. It just seems a very difficult career path.
Yeah we're still planning the Superbowl party.  I never thought about losing the concept of linear time before. This is helpful thanks üëç
I'm here until the family decides if I'm enough help or of she's gonna have to go into a facility. I fear the latter is going to be what happens she's still refusing meds and hygiene reminders.
In case this can be helpful, my friend gets her mother to bathe by calling it a spa day and getting fancy, good smelling body wash and such.
Nice! I'll try that, ty!

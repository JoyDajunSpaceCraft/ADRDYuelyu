Is she diagnosed with something?

Dementia (symptom) can be caused by any number of things- even something benign like sleep deprivation. Make sure she's taking care of herself and not pushing too hard. A doctors visit will be worth a trip.
She’s not diagnosed with anything but she hasn’t been getting much sleep with the move and working hard. I’ll take your advice and take her to a doctor. Just hoping it’s not too serious

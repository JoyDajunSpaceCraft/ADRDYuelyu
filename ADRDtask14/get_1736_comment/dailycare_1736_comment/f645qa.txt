I can’t say that I’ve personally experienced this exact phenomenon, but I have been present a few times with my clients when they passed and seen unexplainable and strange coincidences. It really isn’t uncommon to experience something like this which makes you question or want to believe in something beyond the physical realm. 

What is important in your experience is that you make of it what you will, i.e. if you want to find meaning or have your own explanation, go for it. As someone with faith, and who has experienced some profound moments, I’d say you might be onto something.

However, if I were you, I would probably schedule a visit with an ophthalmologist and rule out any issues with your vision just to be safe.
When my dad was dying and in hospice, I got a call at 2 a.m. that his passing was imminent. My husband and I got dressed and enroute a snowy owl flew in front of our car. I'd never seen an owl that close in the wild, so it was kind of exciting. We got to the hospice and later that afternoon he passed away. On the ride home, I saw a snowy owl again on the power lines, this time only a mile or so from my house. A couple of days later, I saw a snowy owl in our pine tree. I learned from a Facebook post that my parent's neighbor happened to also take video footage of a snowy owl in my parents' maple tree the day my dad died. 

I would like it chalk it up to coincidence, but that many sightings in a short time is too weird. Weirder, I haven't seen an owl again after scattering his ashes.
Who knows. So many factors present. Only one way to find out. Go for it!

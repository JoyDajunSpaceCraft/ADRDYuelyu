This may have changed since it affected us but when we needed a certain form or route of administration for a med and Medicaid rejected the claim, if the physician specified medical necessity, Medicaid would make an exception and pay for the brand or ROA needed. (The pill form upsets her stomach, so the patch is medically necessary.)
Have you tried https://m.goodrx.com/exelon?gclid=CjwKCAjwxLH3BRApEiwAqX9arXgtlONzF5XKi5GmQ0av-Zwmi25EJrRX1SneaaqAdc7RAecRh6N3IRoCTzQQAvD_BwE

Kroger says $62, add your location it might go lower
So, [this program](https://www.rxassist.org/search/prog-details?program_Id=38&Drug_Id=2480) doesn't work for her?
Do you see that the Exelon patch is helping her? We are going back to the doctors Friday to talk about possible medications for my Mom.
Thanks! I'm going to try to get on the assistance plan that someone gave me above but if that doesn't work, there's a Kroger store near us! :)
It doesn't include her med https://www.novartis.us/our-products/patient-assistance/patient-assistance-foundation-enrollment
Haven't gotten it yet due to cost, waiting on Novartis to approve our application.
I'm confused.  The program says at the top:

Program Details
NOVARTIS PHARMACEUTICALS CORPORATION
Novartis Patient Assistance Foundation, Inc.
**Exelon Patch (rivastigmine transdermal system)**

Isn't the Exelon Patch what you are looking for?
That's weird I don't see it
Edit: Thank you so much, I have the dumb!

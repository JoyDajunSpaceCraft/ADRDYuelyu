Maybe old-fashioned kitchen or workshop equipment could work, things that were operated by hand cranks instead of electricity and have gears and the like.  Some were likely designed to come apart easily for cleaning and maintenance, like meat grinders.  They can be like big clunky old puzzles.  

If he can't physically do those things, he might be entertained by watching similar sorts of videos, there are tons of people on youtube who make videos that amount to "restoring rusted-out old tools and gadgets," and they're pretty interesting.  The patient I live with is not technically minded at all and she'll watch them with me sometimes.
There are usually a lot of “fidget” blanket kind of things on Etsy.  Some might be more applicable than others.

If it’s specifically mechanical / electrical then maybe one of these circuit kits with big easy pieces: https://www.amazon.com/Snap-Circuits-SC-300-Electronics-Exploration/dp/B0000683A4
Not sure if it would help but my 12 year old and I go to Goodwill and get inexpensive old electronics just for him to tinker with.  Cheaper then buying fancy kits.
There’s a toy car thing for kids, it’s like the front seat and hood. Anyway, the car tells you something’s not working and you can fiddle around under the hood and fix it. It’s pretty extensive and accurate from what I hear,  but the tools are made for little kid hands and so are chubby and easy to hold. 
My son also has a toy airplane that can be taken apart and put back together with big screws and a chubby screwdriver. 
If there’s these things I’m sure they’re others.
The issue with that strategy being my grandfather has Parkinson’s and has difficulty with small tools and screws. Sounds awesome for a 12-year-old though.

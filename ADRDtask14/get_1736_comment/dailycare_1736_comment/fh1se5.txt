Sorry to hear about your father's condition, I'm dealing with a relative in similarly circumstances.


if he becomes indigent (no money), then he'll qualify for Medicaid, check his states guidelines to get the details.  That will provide a bare minimum of care.

As for his estate it will cover whatever debt he has , if he has more debt than his estate than it will be discharged.  Because of the amount owed creditors may  likely hire forensic accountants to see if anyone co-signed or is named in a will and may try to collect, but not likely.
Be careful that your girlfriend never gets on any paperwork with him.  When my FIL died at 66, collectors tried to come after my husband. He wasn’t on anything as a co-signer and yet they still tried and we still get lawyer letters years later. 

I’m sorry you’re going through all of this.
Thanks for the advice - and best of luck to you with your situation too
That's  terrible - I feel like we might be in a similar situation when he passes, even though like your husband, she was never co-signer on anything with him.
The vultures always try.

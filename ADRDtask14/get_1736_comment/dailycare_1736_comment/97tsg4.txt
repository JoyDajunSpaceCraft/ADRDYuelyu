I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

I don't think many will see this, but I wanted to follow up that we went with a frame from Photospring.  Of note, the customer support has been amazing!  Dan from the company even emailed the entire family to help us integrate things!  I'm very impressed and happy with the purchase.

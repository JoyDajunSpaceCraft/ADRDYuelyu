I’d suggest two channels on YouTube. 1) Teepa Snow and 2) Careblazers. Both have been excellent with suggestions on dealing with difficult behaviors as well as explaining the possible reasons for said behaviors. The most used tool we use with my MIL is “compassionate white lies”. We get constant questions about dead relatives as well as requests to “go home” (her moms house where she grew up).  At first we fought tooth and nail giving the facts to her showing her pictures, dates, etc. Nothing worked it would end in huge fights, her getting really depressed, and we’d be completely frustrated. Once we started the new technique the dynamic changed. Also, we post notes around the house reminding/reassuring her of answers we give. You’ll hear/read advice to “Live in their world” as their reality is different from ours. If you can deal with them on that level it helps alot.

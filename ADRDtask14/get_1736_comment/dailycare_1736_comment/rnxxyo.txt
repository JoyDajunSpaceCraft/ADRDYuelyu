I had this same issue with my dad last year. I found a short and nostalgic Christmas movie to watch is Charlie Browns Christmas.
The animation can be very uncanny Valley for polar express. It was the first motion capture animation for human characters so  that may be why she said it was creepy.
People with Alzheimers do try your patience, and it's hard.

Because your grandma has memory loss, the movies that are going to be clearest to her are the ones she saw when she was young.   You may have better luck with (say) White Christmas or It's A Wonderful Life.  I don't know how old your grandma is, so I don't know which movies are appropriate.

But something she can go "Oh, yes, I remember liking this" may be easier.   The same goes for music; she may be happy listening to songs from when she was young.
I feel like a lot of times when that happens it’s all about control. She saw that she could get you to react when she criticized something. Every person with dementia is so different but with my grandma if she gets too much control she gets progressively crankier and bossier. If she doesn’t like movies I’ll lean into it and make jokes about how bad the movie is. But that is just something that works for her. I see you and support you! This is a tough gig!
Yeh, that's too bad you couldn't find something appropriate for her to enjoy.  Animations are often bad choice for many dementia-folk.  Old movies, from like 50 - 60 yrs ago are better - at least they can recognise & maybe remember Bing Crosby etc.  For my (89yrold) mum, most animations are just completely confusing wtf is going on.  The colours and the speed of graphics change, it's too fast for their brains to take in, turns into just a nightmare collage of incomprehensible kaleidoscoping noise.   
Tbf  --  Polar Express I've tried to watch a few times, a bit creepy pretty boring.  The Grinch  -  I'd heard it was great movie so we went to see that two Christmasses ago at a lovely outdoor botanic garden Moonlight cinema ( Xmas is HOT here Down Under ) , tickets weren't cheap -- we had to leave after 10 mins, it was awful.  Mum looked so confused & unhappy, just being bombarded with colour & noise.  Creepy, boring, can't understand wtf is going on, and don't care, lol.  We went home & I found some ancient b&w Xmas movie with old actors I barely know - she was delighted. 

Wish you all a merry Yule!
Just spent a painful evening watching the grinch with my family, with dad saying every five minutes “what is this shit”, “is anyone enjoying this”. Every five minutes. We would have changed film, but he would have said this about anything we watched - he even says it about films he chooses and I know he used to enjoy. His levels of cognition (and hearing loss) mean he just can’t enjoy watching anything, It’s so hard to have a family movie night anymore.
We stick to White Christmas, Miracle on 34th Street and It's A Wonderful Life.  She's familiar with these and there's nothing to upset her.  Even old animated stuff like Rudolph disturbs her.
My mom was like this earlier. Complained about not being able to find her shows but when I tried to change it, she says wait I want to watch this first.
My dad liked westerns, law and order, The Godfather and…..Family Feud and…..Judge Judy🤣😂go figure🤷🏽‍♀️
Brilliant
Yeah that’s what I was thinking too. Plus, I think she got upset because mom wouldn’t let her help bake the cakes for Christmas dinner.
I really don’t like Polar Express. I feel like I’m watching a two hour cut scene from a video game.
You know what the other day we ate pizza and binged King of the Hill and she was fine 😆😆😆😆. My mom put on it’s a Wonderful life last night and she turned away from it—I mean physically in her chair. I think she was a little cranky too
I also learned that when she was a teacher she wouldn’t let her kids listen to the Grinch because she didn’t think It was suitable for kids
My grandma was kind of doing the same thing so much so that we just quietly opened Christmas gifts 🤦🏽‍♀️
Was it the Jim Carey one? Lol. Because if you don’t remember seeing it before and you can’t really follow or hear it, it probably feels like a bad trip hahaha.
It’s one of those movies we just have on because my mom and I were cooking.
It’s so interesting what they will dig their heels in about isn’t it? If you ever need to laugh or vent I’m here! I’m realizing that my name I made as a joke makes me sound like a horny dude but I’m actually just a mom in my thirties no creepiness haha.
I’m reading your name now and I didn’t even think of a horny dude I just laughed like a middle school kid(I’m in my 30s too)
Hahahah I think it’s the combination of the mustache on my avatar and the name that throws people. Love your Hermione name!
Thanks 🙏🏾

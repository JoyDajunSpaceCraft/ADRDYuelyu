My mom is like this but weight isn't one of her worries but I still try to limit what she has access to. My mom just wants graham crackers and candy so I slowly give it to her because she will just eat it if it's there.
Me too; since hunger sensations do not work i have no idea whether i have eaten recently or not.    
So in the morning i Leave my plate on the table; that lets me know that i have recently eaten.  When it comes time for the next meal, then my past dishes are cleared and replaced with fresh food.  ... same with all the meals of the day until bedtime, when my last dishes of the day are cleared.

When there is no food waiting for me at the table, i drink my protein drink.  My care-partner (husband) makes a mixture every week of protein powder, chocolate, cold coffee, cashew milk, stevia for sweetner, etc.  He keeps a smaller pitcher of it in the fridge, and i drink it hot in the cold weather and cold in the hot weather.
This is quite a complex combination of obesity, diabetes, dementia, and food intake, which is unfortunately not untypical. Although the individual interactions are understood to some degree, I think science is just beginning to understand the full picture. 

You are certainly correct that this is a contributing factor to the progression of the disease. Unfortunately, intervention is difficult, especially if you have an enabler in the household.

You could try to replace the food in question with *low glycemic* alternatives. Wholegrain bread instead of white bread, low sugar cookies, dark chocolate instead of "milk" chocolate, full fat milk instead of semi skimmed, etc. And you should avoid anything marketed as "low fat", because those products are usually stuffed with sugar.
Yeah I just don’t think my grandfather is willing to give up bread for this particular cause.

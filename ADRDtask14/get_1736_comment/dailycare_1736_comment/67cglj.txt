My mother in law would really benefit from a fidget blanket or doll because all she does all day is sit and pick at her hands and arms. She does this 'picking' so much that she has sores. We've given her a couple of fidget-type things but she hides them when we aren't there, so we never see them again.

I would love to know how to give her one of these things and actually have her use it.
https://www.creativeartco.com/memory-m-aid/ this is a Canadian company for prompts, though I must say (as a recreation professional on a locked Dementia unit) we don't have the budget for this so we make ours with clip art on the computer and our laminator. But the memory m-aid ones are decals that are reusable
I keep seeing fidget spinners and other toys in the dollar stores here.   They're designed for kids with ADHD but I imagine they might be something neat to hold in the hand, depending on how much dexterity your LO has.

my apologies, I guess the book is not decals.

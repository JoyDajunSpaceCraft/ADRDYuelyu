Hmm.. When my dad had stiffness it seemed more neurological than just muscle related to me... But then i just tried to google it and hospice and physical therapy came up.

So i guess there are things to try but you might want to consult a professional. Id ask patient's pcp if a referral to one would be recommended.

Ill be honest the physical therapy was a surprise to me. Thanks for the post and good luck.
Stiffness is an early sign of Parkinson's so it is good to be evaulated by a provider.  Otherwise massage is great as well as range of motion exercises.
My Papa has Parkinsonâ€™s and he is on a muscle relaxer that he takes twice a day. It seems to help him a lot. I hope you find something that will help him soon.
It could possibly be a side effect of medication. Maybe look into that too?

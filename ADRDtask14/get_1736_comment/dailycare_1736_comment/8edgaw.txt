IMO you can’t get your bf to open up. It’s a super tough thing to go through (as I’m sure you know) and everyone deals with it differently. I would suggest telling him that you are always available to talk/listen but that there is no pressure. He will when he is ready. Just be an open ear for him and his family members and try to spend more time with them so they all know, through your actions, how important they are to you. 
Beautiful thank you very much

Unfortunately yes my uncle who is now deep into his vascular dementia has stolen before. We were in the drug store waiting for his prescription to be filled so we browsed around the store. Once we got his prescription and got in the car heading home, a little bit down the road he pulls out a Hershey candy bar he 5 finger discounted from the store. I don't know how the heck he did that without my knowledge but since then I watch him wherever we go a lot more closely. I went back to the store and explained what happened,luckily the cashier was understanding and sympathetic about what happened. I was very nervous about the whole thing. It happens and our loved ones don't know any better.
Luckily the drug store knew whose keys they were and just thanked me for returning them. I was worried theyâ€™d be upset about it.
That's really good. Glad they didn't get upset. Hopefully you won't have to go through that again,I know its an unpredictable situation to deal with. Best of luck to you.

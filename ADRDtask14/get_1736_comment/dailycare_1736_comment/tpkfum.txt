The only thing I can think of is when I tore my ACL I had to wear this type of fixed leg brace that kept one leg straight. While I could walk it was difficult.  I don't know if putting one of those on her, would remind her that she needs help moving around and wouldn't attempt to do it on her own ?
My first thought is a bed alarm - there are a few different types, including a pressure pad on the mattress. Bedrails could also buy some time, but could add even more risk if she is determined and mobile enough to climb over it.
My great aunt is at risk of falling because of poor balance and arthritis. In the facility she is in, they had a wheelchair with a belt at the waist. It was effective at not allowing her to get up, but it made her VERY anxious. At our request they try to mostly not put the belt on her and to instead sit her on her chair that has a pressure mat. If she gets up, it will immediately beep in the room and in the nurses station. Itâ€™s not the best when she is agitated and get up for nothing, but it worked so far in preventing falls. She also have one in the bed for the night.

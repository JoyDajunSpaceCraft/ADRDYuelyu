Unfortunately I don’t have any good advice other than what you’re doing with visual signs. My grandma was very similar and didn’t recognize her surroundings. She’d be fine in assisted living in the mornings but if we ever took her out she’d get confused when we came back. When she moved to memory care we eventually had to stop taking her out (this was right around when covid hit anyways). When we stopped taking her out she was able to adjust well enough. The socialization and having friends in memory care really helped and got her to not fixate on where she was living. When her friend got moved to a different facility is when the worries came back. I know this wasn’t super helpful but I hope there’s something you can get from it.
My mom keeps asking to go back to her childhood home- doesn’t seem to remember her actual home, which we moved her out of last year. She’s in my house now. 

Some days, explaining where she is works. Some days, telling her she’s visiting with us and going back to her childhood home works. 

Some days nothing works, which is fine too- she might be upset/confused, but it will pass.
Thanks. It helps to know I’m not alone. She is doing much better this evening. If this keeps happening she will needed to move to memory care sooner rather than later.

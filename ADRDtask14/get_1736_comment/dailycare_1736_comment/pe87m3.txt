Blaming yourself for this after you are already giving all you've got is unfair. Dementia caretaking is like pushing water uphill with your bare hands. It's a war of attrition so beating yourself up over loosing a battle is pointless. Be kind to yourself and stay strong to fight another day.
It's not a game you can win, stop keeping score.
Perfection isn’t possible, so it shouldn’t be the mark to measure against. Allow yourself to be human.
Pushing water up a hill! That's a great analogy! Thank you!

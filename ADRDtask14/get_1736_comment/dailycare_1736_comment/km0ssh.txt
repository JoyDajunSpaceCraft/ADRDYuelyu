There is a condition called anosognosia* that I **think** is prominent in dementia sufferers.

Anosognosia is a lack of ability to perceive the realities of one's own condition. It's a person's inability to accept that they have a condition that matches up with their symptoms or a formal diagnosis.

Like, it's not denial. It's an inability to **even perceive it**. It's a wild concept.
I‚Äôve seen moments of lucidity with my father, who had frontotemporal dementia, but very few and far between. In my experience: Because of the long process it usually takes to one, get the sufferer to see a doctor, and two, for the doctor to eliminate other possibilities and then label the condition as some form of dementia, it‚Äôs usually too late to start looking for moments of lucidity from said sufferer. Judgement deterioration, apathy, lack of impulse control and other related things are all factors that pop up and affect the sufferer causing them to be disagreeable and think they are always right. Being disagreeable and thinking they are always right seem to be some of the first signs one might have dementia in the earlier to mild stages. But it‚Äôs just so hard to differentiate that between regular self entitled assholes or people not wanting to say they‚Äôre wrong unless you know they have dementia because let‚Äôs be honest, we‚Äôve all been there before: not wanting to admit we‚Äôre wrong. 

Hope this helps and if anyone has anything more to add I would love to know more. 

I am not a doctor, I‚Äôm simply stating information that I‚Äôve learned from my and others‚Äôs experiences and what I‚Äôve read.
Some know that they do and will tell you, but in another moment they may forget. The big thing is that you probably won't be able to reason with them if they believe something else to be true. I think that's one of the things that breaks down first- the ability to reason.  It's sometimes better to just redirect instead of challenging their incorrect belief.
My Mom knows her memory is failing her.  She gets frustrated and says " I'm just losing my mind!" It makes her scared and sad but she says it jokingly with a worried smile.
My mom is mid-stage Lewy Body and knows she has dementia, was formally diagnosed about two years ago. She is fairly accepting of the diagnosis. I think as she progresses beyond mid-stage is when she may no longer understand her condition. She is a very sweet lady (lots of anxiety but can also laugh at herself and what she calls her ‚Äúdumb brain‚Äù) so I hope she doesn‚Äôt lose her good nature.
My Dad certainly doesn‚Äôt. When he talks about being sad about his general confusion about life, etc, sometimes we try to tell him that it isn‚Äôt his fault and that he has dementia.

He never remembers that and is shocked, so we don‚Äôt bother doing that anymore
My MIL was still very lucid when she was diagnosed, but would never accept it. She would get very angry and aggressive if you brought it up, so the family quickly learned to work around it. Now, years later, she is in the moderate stage of frontotemporal dementia and now acknowledges many times a day that her brain doesn't work correctly, but still never mentions dementia. She often asks what is wrong with her, but dementia is still never mentioned. I think there would be times she would be able to accept it and others she would get just as angry as before. Sometimes I also wonder if she forgets that part of her life when she was diagnosed. Although she gets VERY agitated when she has to have her doctors appointments, so she knows something is going on.
My FIL doesn‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs a problem with him at all. In fact, he tells anyone that‚Äôll listen that it‚Äôs my MIL who has the issues. My grandmother on the other hand knew that she had an issue even at the very end.
My grandfather had Alzheimer's. My uncles had Alzheimer's & Parkinsons. My aunt has dementia, and my father has dementia.  My uncles knew they had it.  My aunt knew something was up, but wasn't so sure that it was dementia.  My father didn't believe it, and would tell you that he didn't have it. He told any and every medical professional that he didn't have it and that they were wrong.  My father even in his right state of mind, always thought he was an expert on nearly everything.  Asking for his long deceased parents, and you would tell him that they are dead, he would claim that he was joking. I believe only time, he sort of admitted that he might have it.  My father's denial that he had the disease definitely made things difficult for the family. He didn't prepare for anything.  Now my siblings, half siblings and I are trying to get a lot of things order. Things that should have been taken care of years ago.
My mother would constantly mention she has dementia and would always use it as an excuse for everything.  She is much worse now and she knows her head is not right but she doesn't mention the dementia anymore.
I have ma with dementia and I‚Äôm hoping that I can see it in myself and some one to honest with me 
First plane üòÇ to Switzerland or any country to put me down and not let me or anyone suffer
Some do, some don't. I think it's very common for people with dementia to think they are perfectly normal.  My wife thinks she's fine. She poops her pants almost daily, can't remember her kid's names, thinks that every car she sees is someone she knows, wanders aimlessly.  She requires full time care and can't be left on her own.  She still think's she's fine and doesn't have dementia.
My gf's mom has few moments of full perception; sad moments, she knows something is not right with her, but cannot even recognise when or how the whole thing happens the wrong way. 
Her strong spirit is a great help though.
Yes, a certain % do. I have been living it for some time. I stay w a woman whom knows me well and kind and understanding. Non-behavioral vararient, most likely, Dementia Pugilistica, with frontal lobe damage and seizures.
Good night
Please avoid saying that people living with dementia are "suffering" from the disease. Who are we to say they are suffering? Using the term insinuates that people who are diagnosed with dementia are miserable. As a Dementia Consultant, I have met so many people living with dementia who are happy as anything and are so full of life.
Thanks I will look it up!
Thank you, very interesting!
Thanks for replying, bless her heart.
Thank you for sharing your personal experience. Such a fascinating and heartbreaking disease.
O sorry, I was going to refer to them as demented but I thought that might be offensive as well.
That term is also derogatory. 

I just refer to them as someone who "lives with dementia" or "is living with dementia".

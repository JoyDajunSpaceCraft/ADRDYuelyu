My partner is in the early stages of early onset dementia. So far she is showing few signs of memory issues, but does exhibit many other common symptoms of dementia like diminished judgement. Her diagnosis involved brain scans, but also quite deep cognitive testing. Her specialist also told me my own observations over the past few years were crucial in her diagnosis. It may pay to get a referral to a dementia specialist as they will look at a lot more than just memory issues. 
An MRI would offer clearer and more detailed images that what a CT scan would show. Also, the radiologist looking at the brain scan would only report things that he was looking out for, so a second scan can be beneficial.

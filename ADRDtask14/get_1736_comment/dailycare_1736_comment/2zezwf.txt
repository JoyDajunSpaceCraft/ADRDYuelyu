I say don't feel bad.  

Thoughts are not actions, the thoughts you have aren't actually killing her.

I'm sorry for the way things were, and they way they turned out.  I hope there are other things in your life that bring happiness...
what happened to my siblings if you don't mind my asking? how old are you about?
Thank you.  That perspective helps a lot.
Don't mind at all.  One bro suicided, the other, over 60, passed away a couple years ago.  He was a recluse.  Both went no contact with parents before it was the thing to do with narcissists.  I'm the "baby" at 50.

This happened with my mother. She used to drink a glass of wine just before or during dinner. Then she started drinking multiple glasses of wine. One glass was almost too much for her because she is a very small woman and in her 90’s. Then she started drinking hard liquor and would start in the early afternoon. When I would visit she thought that was worth celebrating and would want me to join her as soon as possible. I would politely refuse and would try to divert her attention to anything other than drinking. It got so bad that my dad had to hide all the liquor in the house. But she started finding it so he had to throw it out. She was unable to drive so she couldn’t get more. Her changes in drinking also coincided with major personality changes. She became very mean and still is despite years passing since she stopped drinking. She stopped bathing and rarely gets dressed each day. Her doctor prescribed medication but she refuses to take any pills because she thinks my dad is trying to kill her.
He needs to go to the doctor.  Poor guy sounds depressed, dementia does that - along with being scary and upsetting.  He may also be forgetting how much he's consuming.  You really need some medical advice.

Maybe you can call his doctor and get them to call him.  Tell him his annual physical is booked on such and such a date, is there a relative they can call to leave the date with?  Something like that might work.

It's easy to be in distress and treat yourself without the PIA of a new med.  Not a good long-term strategy. 

I would take to doc (if you can), see if there are other viable options. After not drinking for years after diagnosis I had an occasional bout or two. Stupid was the only way to describe it.
My husband’s stepmom would buy non-alcoholic beer for her mother and she couldn’t tell the difference. There’s also non-alcoholic wine. During the time my mother-in-law lived with us I would dilute her wine with the non-alcoholic kind and she didn’t seem to notice.

If he is still of sound mind, perhaps he is just self medicating to distract from a larger issue. See if he needs more stimulation or comfort first. If he is not in control and you suspect it is a symptom of the dementia, you could always start "cutting" his liquor with non alcoholic liquids. There is going to be ethical gray areas throughout your journey. Ive found the best way to navigate is with this order of operations.

Yes, it’s hardest on the caregivers. My dad who is 94 is the primary caregiver for my mom. He does everything around the house and yard. Fortunately, his health is very good but I worry about the emotional toll. My mom is very cruel to him, not physically, but emotionally. She constantly accuses him of having affairs, and has hallucinations about women living in the garden shed. She calls him names and yells at him all the time. He refuses to have anyone come in to help and will not consider a memory care facility for her. They have been married for more than 70 years. He is so devoted to her, no matter what. And the really sad thing is he’s been through this with his mother and sister. Both also had Alzheimer’s. Hang in there. Know that no matter what, it’s the disease causing these changes. Take care of your mother the best you can to help her through this.
Wow, I'm sorry you're in such a sad situation.
Then you can't have it in the house or lock it up. He's going to be angry no matter what you do because he has dementia

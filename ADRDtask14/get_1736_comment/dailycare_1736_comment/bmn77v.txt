Hey aps, a year ago I began blogging about our dementia journey with Mom. I was worried that it might make the trek more onerous if I further enmeshed myself in dementia by writing about it too, but it has actually been very therapeutic to tell our story and hear from others. I think it's a great idea and hopefully you too will find it cathartic and helpful to be a story teller and facilitator.

Hi there. This is very interesting, and I went on ahead and dropped my email to subscribe. 

If you ever need help with content, I actually just finished a short (12 minute) documentary about the stress that families have to go through. If it’s something you’d like to include on your website, please feel free (just DM me first). 

Here’s the link to the post with the documentary: https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/blruwu/several_months_ago_i_made_a_post_about_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Good luck with this! I love this idea.
This is really sweet. It's hard not to be enmeshed.. if you're not feeling the pain, it means you're burying or ignoring it for later. Best to feel what you need to feel, finding an outlet for it in the process.
Ha! When I'm not feeling the pain it means the household wine stock has been depleted. ;)

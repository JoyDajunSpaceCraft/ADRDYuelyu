set up cameras
Checking it out, even just for your own peace of mind, is worth it. Cameras would be good. If the facility would throw a fit over them (some do) then leave a sound activated voice recorder so you can catch conversations between the two. Just put it somewhere out of sight.

I completely get your concern. My mom told big tales about the guy across the hall in her facility. How he'd sneak into her room at night and stand over her bed. The guy was in a wheelchair and unless someone came to get him he didn't leave his room, he was too weak to propel himself in the chair, let alone stand and started at old ladies while they slept. If we hadn't been able to see the guy ourselves and talk to the nurses, we'd be suspicious too.

She also claimed her aide when she was home was mean to her. Thing was, my brother who lived with her was right there and he never saw any of it. It's a horrible disease and lining in the world some of them create for themselves would be a nightmare.
Thanks. I thought about cameras but I‘m not sure how I’d be able to set it up. My aunt and her aide are always in the apartment.
Thank you for your reply. I experienced this a bit with my mom who had TIA induced dementia, but my mom was the sweetest woman on earth and never complained, while my aunt is sassy and demanding so I wouldn’t be surprised if she and her aide clash verbally. I will have to find a way to use a hidden sound recorder to find out if it rises to the level of concern.
maybe you can ask the aide to take her on a walk if the weather is nice? or take her to get some ice cream or something.

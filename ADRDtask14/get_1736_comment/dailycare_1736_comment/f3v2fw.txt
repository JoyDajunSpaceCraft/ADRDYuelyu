Fwiw, I have ADHD and this kind of thing is fairly common for me.  You might want to wander over to r/ADHD and post there.
If this is new, I'd consult with a neurologist.  There's no way Reddit can offer a reliable explanation.
I don’t have neurological problems and I’ve done this sort of thing my whole life. I think it’s pretty normal
I tried but I got distracted.. Buahaha kidding.  Ok, I will take a look there.   Thanks!

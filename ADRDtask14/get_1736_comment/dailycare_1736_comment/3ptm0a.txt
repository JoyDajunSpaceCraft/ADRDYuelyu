I would look for a volunteer group that works with therapy dogs and ask for a visit to check it out. Or if you have a friend/neighbor with a friendly dog maybe you could "borrow" it once in awhile for a visit. 
If your mom had a dog she loved when she was younger it could be hugely helpful. You never know what could trigger a positive memory. I'd say try it first in a highly controlled environment and go from there.
This is an absolutely wonderful idea. Pet therapy is incredibly beneficial for Alzheimer's patients. A good way to find out if there is pet therapy in your area would be to call a local animal shelter and ask if they know of any volunteer organizations, as someone already mentioned. You could also do a Google search. Good luck! 
Yes. My mother has AD and is pretty far advanced, and just before her dementia hallucinations and paranoia got really bad, I thought I'd get her a small lapdog she could croon over and love and sleep with and feed and fuss and so on. 

Not a good idea, because within months after I got such a dog her real dementia related hallucinations and paranoia-related violence started, and her favourite hallucination was that someone is killing "the baby" and she has to "save the baby" even if she rips every picture off the wall, every curtain down, smashes the glass of the windows or me if I tried to stop her. And, of course the small dog was the embodiment of "the baby" and the dog started to nip her quite seriously to escape her clutches before it was squeezed to death. 

So, Ive had to take over the dog.

Situation now is she still has hallucinations and paranoia, but the new meds she is on seem to have knocked the stuffing out of her, and made her too weak for her violent episodes, and what we have is her treating me as if I want to kill her and "the baby" that I have to keep away from her. 

Too sad. 

So, tra-la-la to all those saying what a wonderful idea - I'm glad it worked out for them

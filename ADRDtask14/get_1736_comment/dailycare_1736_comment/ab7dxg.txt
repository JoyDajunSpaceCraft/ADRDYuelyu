Many long distance children move the parents closer to them to live in Senior communities.  The parents get independence and care based on their individual situation. The children get peace of mind knowing their loved ones are being monitored for health and safety and are close enough for emergencies.  
Tough spot - and going to get tougher. Somebody must move, or you can enlist other family or purchase support for your dad uncaring for your mom. 1,500 is another planet and FaceTime wears thin quickly. Hang in! Hang in! HANG IN!
There are drugs which can help stabilize her.  Take a video of the mood swings and bring that to the doctor.  
Sorry in advance that the post is sort of all over the place, bit of a mess at the moment.
Dependent on where you live you could take family medical leave. I live in CA and when my fathers condition worsened I took 3 months to focus on him and help my mother out as much as humanly possible. CA has paid family leave where they’d pay you about 60-70% of your salary for about 6 weeks, but not sure what the specifics are state to state. 

I will say that it takes a village and that no one takes care of the caregiver so make sure you’re checking up on your father as much as possible. Caregivers typically burn out and quickly since it becomes their day to day.

If you can financially help, I’d also recommend hiring caregivers to help your father out. There are really great agencies out there that can help match you with what your father needs, especially if the plan is to keep her home. 
 
It’s a difficult situation to be in and my heart goes out to you. Best of luck and keep your head up!

Never be alone in this, always have someone that can help you and give you free time.
Thank you for being such a kind and strong person for your grandma. 

A few things we've learned:

1. Lifeguard's Rule #1.  Do not put **yourself** in danger to **save** the other person. Ie. Make sure you take care of yourself else you may not be able to take care of the other person. Get enough sleep, alone time, activity, eat well. Be kind to yourself. Regret, resentment, guilt, etc all can fester in a caregiver.
2. Support. Having someone (or multiple people) that you can COUNT ON to be there when you need a break, need help, etc. If you don't have anyone you feel you can count on start building your resources now. It sounds like you have your Aunt which is GREAT! Communication with your support is so important. Keep an open line, especially as new issues or responsibilities pop up. Make sure it's equitable for all parties if possible.
3. Resources. Find them online in your country/local area or talk to your grandma's doctor. Once found, USE them. I can only speak for where I am (California) resources seem to be scattered everywhere, but NO ONE will just hand them to you. It's a constant easter egg hunt as needs arise, scrambling during an emergency sucks. It'd be nice once your loved one is diagnosed "the system" or their doctor would hand you a map of what to do next. If you have trouble finding resources, I've found this subreddit, a few FB groups and youtube channels to be a good guide to get me on the path.
   1. Careblazers on YouTube. Also has a private FB group.
   2. Teepa Snow on YouTube.
4. Know your boundaries and know they are VALID. My fiance and I know our boundaries. Once we hit those mile markers, we know it's time to hand over caregiving to the professionals by either bringing someone else in or moving our loved one to a memory care facility. Do not compare your abilities or boundaries to someone else's. You do not care less for your grandma if you feel you cannot do task XYZ and someone else can.
5. She will change. They will blame, tell lies, make up stories, call people by the wrong name when they mean someone else, at a certain point their communication is limited to emotions they feel, not facts. Do not take it personally. It is her brain, it's the disease. 
6. Do not argue. As asinine as some things may sound, whatever lies/stories they may tell,   that is their reality and you have to deal with them in their reality. Arguing gets you to only one destination, frustration. They do not understand your reality, nor will they accept it. Our loved one is constantly asking to see her mom, aunt, etc. and to go home. We've gone through the gamut of arguing that her mom is dead, showing her pictures of the death certificate , doing the math on how old she is, etc. to now which seems to work; "We're going to see her next week. She safe and X person is taking care of her." These requests I'm learning usually stem from feelings of wanting comfort aka "going home". 

I could go on and on, it's a long, tough journey, and I hope yours is a peaceful one for you and your grandma. A lot of people cannot do this, and the fact that you are stepping up says a lot about you. But once you feel you can't anymore, that does not diminish you or your effort.
Advice, yeah. Don't do it. She will deteriorate and you will find yourself in a situation that would make a horror film look like a comedy by comparison. You will find your ability to cope slowly erode to the point where life becomes simply unbareable. I doubt you'll take my advice though so good luck. You're in for a real tough life experience.
Her neurologist should prescribe drugs to help with dementia symptoms.  

Real CBD (only buy from reputable websites/stores) is helpful to some.

Set up daily routines now, like morning walk, go to the grocery store, garden, whatever she enjoys.  Try to keep her awake most of the day so she won't wake up and wonder off at night.

Physical activity & exercise is proven to help slow down dementia.

Brush/floss her teeth for her if you can.  I wish I did this way earlier.

Begin researching memory care/ nursing homes now.
Good on you!  Yeh, don't burn-out! 

 On-line sites such as alz.org (usa), Alzheimers.org.uk, .au, etc have lot of info & resources. They also have telephone help lines.  

 Be prepared to accept a lot of "not standard/not usual behaviour" eg if the floors have been swept already & she wants to sweep them again, and 20 mins later yet again, and 2 hrs later yet again - let her.  As long as the behaviour isn't dangerous, or really too repetitive / monotonous (in which case, employ creative diversion tactic - "you've already done that" isn't usually accepted )..  

Be prepared to use lot of creative diversion tactics; be prepared to "change plan" & do something different from what you were thinking.  If she changes tack mid-activity, go with the flow.  

"Sundowning" is a common thing.  They get restless around sunset, sometimes sort of anxious.  Idk if your gran might be at this stage yet. 

 Yeh, include her in some chores/activities don't just take over & do everything, don't take everything out of her hands.  Ok, you do the heavy duty stuff, but try include her in light stuff *if she can manage it*  \-- "I'm doing the dusting, will you help me sweep the kitchen?" or "let's xyz.." 

Loud tv/radio/music can cause confusion - turn volume down when talking. 

Simplify things.  Don't try explain complicated plots to movies / tv - simplify eg "those good guys are trying to catch those bad guys but something happened", "they were having love story but something happened".  Don't try detailed explanations of modern tech eg "facebook it's like a computer magazine for friends/colleagues".  eg "download" "the app" and "get free giga" - "its an internet thing, you can get magazines or join a club"

Questions such as "what do you want for lunch?" or "what do you want to do?" could be confusing -- try "let's have tuna pasta" if the response is really unenthusiastic, try another option - if no particular preference at all, never mind, she'll most likely love whatever you cook anyway... If you don't know her favourite meals, do some sleuthing.  When you're looking thru a magazine / watching tv, show her a picture and say "wow, do you think this egg salad looks good?"    Same for activities - if open-ended questions cause confusion, suggest an activity or 2 or 3 options. 

Music is very evocative & calming - find out her old favourites & get CDs. Try some mixed oldies, see if anything brings reaction.  I was blown away last year by my mom - I'd put on a CD of old Ella Fitzgerald gospel songs - my mom hasn't been regular church goer since *decades*, but she started *singing along* with hymns *she hadn't sung in 70 years*!!  She can't remember what happened 20 mins ago, yesterday or last week.  Completely blew me away. 

Depending on restrictions / virus levels in your area, *for some folk*, Thrift Shop visits are fun (the nice ones, not the real junk ones).  They can while away time looking at tons of old vintage stuff, peruse the book section, buy a cheap trinket or 2. For some folk. 

You'll find out what activities she enjoys, everyone's different.  Get some art supplies and just do something together, if you ask her do you want to blabla, often the reply is "no I don't want to". If you just say "I'm going to xyz, here, you try one too" can be easier - and you'll find out some things she enjoys / doesn't enjoy.

You don't need to micro-manage.    If she's elderly, she'll have little sit-down 10 min naps throughout the day, don't stop her but don't let her sleep for hours. 

Don't burn out, use the online resources, enjoy the time left with her. 

good luck!
I took my 89 yr old Gma in almost 3 months ago now after she had been in a nursing home for 3 years. I wondered what I had gotten myself into at first!  So many activities she used to enjoy (needle work with yarn and such has gotten more difficult due to arthritis). 
In my gma’s case, she’s deteriorated quite quickly. She’s no longer able to do word searches or crossword puzzles. We’ve switched to connect the dots and finding the differences between pictures. She wants to feel like she’s helping me, so she will fold wash rags (even if I dump clean ones in a basket so that she feels like she’s helping)
Remember to take care of yourself first! This situation normalizes really fast, and you can get worn out without noticing. Treat yourself! Make sure to get outside and prioritize self care. 


Good luck.
You are to be commended for taking time out of your life to do this. You're adding greatly to your grandmother's quality of life, and probably keeping her out of a long-term care facility.

As long as she can sleep through the night, you should be okay. Make sure you get the rest you need, and hopefully other family members will come to relieve you from time to time.

There is a reason caregivers work 5 8-hour shifts a week.  You will be working 21 8-hour shifts.  You will need to ask for help when you need it, take your breaks and vacations, and not let yourself burn out.
Are you getting paid? I’m 24 and it’s REALLY hard. It makes you slowly resent the person you once loved :,(
Becoming a caregiver seldom means bringing significant changes in your own life. You might need to assist the older adult with cleaning, cooking, keeping track of medicines, getting to the doctor's appointments, and more.   
  
While it may be a lot to take on, chances are excellent for you to feel overwhelmed in the beginning. However, with the tips mentioned below, you'll be able to adjust to your new role with complete ease:  
  
**1. Learn how to care for your elderly properly:** You may need to learn new skills like preparing a special diet and giving injections. Never hesitate to ask questions about your elderly's health needs when in doubt.    
  
**2. Don't try to do everything on your own:** Make a list of all the tasks you need to do. When others offer help, let them choose the tasks they would like to be responsible for.   
  
**3. Explore paid help options:** Some people require help with daily activities like cooking, housekeeping, etc. However, the others may need more home health care services such as physical therapy, nursing, etc. Thus, check if your senior is eligible to take advantage of Medicaid or Private Insurance costs, saving money.   
  
**4. Set realistic expectations for yourself:** Don't feel guilty about the days when you're frustrated. Know that many senior caregivers feel the same at times. Make sure to share your feelings with people you trust. For instance, you can join a caregiver support team to talk to like-minded individuals and understand how to care for yourself while caring for the elderly.   
  
**5. Make personal health a priority:** Staying physically active, eating healthy foods, and getting enough sleep are always recommended, especially when you're a new caregiver. After all, you don't want to take a toll on your physical and mental health right in the beginning. Never neglect your medical screenings.   
  
It is understandable to be worried right now if you're new to caregiving. However, remember that caregiving is challenging but has its rewards. All you need is a little time and experience. The tips mentioned above will help you attain a sigh of relief.
I agree. Biggest regret of my life by far. Don’t waste your youth, you won’t get it back.
How old were you when you started being a caregiver? I just turned 23 and i just want to get away of this situation a let my older siblings deal with it.
My MIL moved in with us 4 months after we got married, I was 21. She was undiagnosed at the time. She moved with her sister and dad after a while, then got diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia 5 years ago. She moved in with us Feb 2019, I was 26. I’m doing my best to support my husband and keep her at home as long as we can. But I wish I could go back and just advocate for her to go straight to a long term care facility. 

Don’t just pass on the care to your siblings, that’s messed up too. My BIL is completely uninvolved and it’s awful for everyone.

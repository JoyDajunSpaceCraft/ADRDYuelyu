I have a demented parent, they are hallucinating people from their past, they now believes they ARE not were a federal Marshall. 

They had a minor car accident but couldn't tell the cops what happened, the story kept changing in impossible ways.
When my dad was in the hospital and his dementia symptoms were made worse by the ICU, he was *living* in an episode of NCIS. He watched reruns of the show all the time and I had also watched the show so when he began telling me about a guy that came in his room and was really nice, but then he walked off and cut those people up and fed them to the pigs, I knew it was from the show. But he kept telling it over and over and acting like he couldn't believe he saw it.

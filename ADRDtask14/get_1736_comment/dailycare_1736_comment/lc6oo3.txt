Ooooh I hear you. I used to come over to Dad's house after work and stay til 11. 6 hours a nite. "You're leaving? So soon?"
Yout dad sounds like a little dementia has crept in. Maybe see a neurologist. It helped us. If your dad would let you.
Definitely feel your frustration with your dad. My MIL is the almost exactly the same, especially with the narcissism. Whether it's depression or a degenerative brain disease do your best to not take it personally. Hopefully soon your dad's PCP will refer hime to a specialist to get your dad the right diagnosis and treatment.
The thing about it is, his with his insurance his doc would have to refer him, and like I said she thinks it's stress/grief/ depression which I am not arguing it could be... but she isn't one to refer out often... He recently had an MRI for something non related and had a neurology appointment but canceled it as they figured out he had an ear issue.
And now I wonder if it is depression. Losing your partner is a huge stressor and may be causing the words to escape him. But maybe you could talk to the doc alone, give him a list of symptoms. My dad saw a neuro who said he has the normal ageing 88 year old brain. 7 months later he was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia.

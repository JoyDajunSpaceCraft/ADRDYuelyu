I’m sorry you’re going through this. I’ll admit I laughed a little when I read “he isn’t in reality much,” then “he’s not so bad he needs to be in a home.” (Paraphrasing)

Ummm...he’s confused, agitated, and paranoid. He kicks your mom out of the house?!! Yeah, he needs full-time professional care.

I wish we got more information on the appropriate way to care for our elders before we actually needed it. This sub is full of people care-taking their parents completely on their own! 

If you are in the US, call your state’s social services’ division on aging (or whatever it’s called in your area). Just do a Google search.

Talk to a social worker. There is advice and help for you. You can get in-home care services, or look into independent or assisted living. Or memory care if it’s time.

It is not safe for you and your mom to care-take your dad at this point. And it’s not in his best interest, either. If any of you get sick or injured, your situation will become much worse.

Talk to a social worker. They will find resources and advocate for your dad’s best interests. 

This is a tough time. You’ll get through it.

Having to take over and parent a parent is one of the strangest, hardest things to do.   There are gray areas- not all skills and abilities disappear at once.   A person can still do laundry but not handle a checkbook.  They can call and make an airline reservation but forget all the rules of the road while driving and blame it all on the other drivers and insist that they know how to drive when they needed to give up the keys yesterday.

Legally, your dad cannot just kick your mom out of the house.  POA is needed.

Please know, doing the right thing is difficult.  By keeping your father safe (and those around him safe), you will be making decisions that might be received with fury, but do them anyway.


As you are working out how to care for him, you need to consider him at his worst. Not his best.

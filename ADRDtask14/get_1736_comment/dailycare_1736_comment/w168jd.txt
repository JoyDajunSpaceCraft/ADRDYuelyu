I am not at that point yet but thought I would start doing some looking.  DO NOT use A Place For Mom.  They are salespeople who refer to places that pay them and you will be inundated with calls and text messages, I had to block so many numbers!  Perhaps check with a local senior center and check with the Alzheimer's Association and Council on Aging for referrals and guidelines.  Good luck.
If you have any personal connections to the area where they're staying, I trust personal reviews more than the ones on websites or search engines. There are a lot of ways to game the system. 

I've seen people look for recommendations on the local subreddits. My local Nextdoor has a good group for caregivers with tons of recommendations of business and services. Also local Facebook groups.

When you seek recommendations you might want to say how it will be paid for and/or your budget because that changes the pool quite a bit. 

Best wishes to you and your family.

Be sure and understand the monthly cost and what it covers. Be sure and ask about different levels of care, what they can and cannot provide and again about the cost. Check the fine print.
I toured pretty much all the places in the area, from high end to low, minimal care to high. You get an idea of what they offer, how nice the apartments are, amenities offered, how many people are out and about, participating in activities.

My mom preferred a more urban setting so she is part of the community. Stepped care is important, as we didn't want to move her to a new place if it could be avoided. 

I talked to everyone I know and posted on my locat subreddit for references too.
I asked a similar question but for memory care. Here's a link [https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vkvp86/what\_should\_i\_look\_for\_when\_looking\_for\_memory/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vkvp86/what_should_i_look_for_when_looking_for_memory/)

I would also add: visit multiple facilities. I live in a large metropolitan area, and there are around 25 within 1 hour of my house. I've visited about 12 of them so far and have two clear favorites right now. 

Visit multiple times and talk to the nursing staff, especially the head of nursing. A good place seems to be able to tell you the details of the their residents--"Oh that's Sam. He has been here since June 2017, used to work as a civil engineer and likes to build things so we give him some nuts and bolts since it's calming" and so on.  Good luck. It's exhausting.

Diet (Kosher/Hallal/Veg) is just another criterium, such as diabetes or ostomy care, that will make it harder to find an appropriate home.  Hopefully the person who has many criteria will also have lots of money to afford that care.
That’s silly. He has dementia. Imagine if he refused to eat everything except meat because of his dementia.  Are you going to let him starve because he should still be a vegan?
It’s not a question about not eating. It’s a question about ethically maintaining lifelong beliefs. The expectation would be that the family would request meals that match. Same with religion issues - would you feed pork to someone who was a life long believer of a religion that didn’t eat pork?
Depends on the budget, menu variety, and accommodation policy. 

You want vegan, go to a nursing home that accommodates vegan diets.
Lol. Ok. It’s just a discussion. No need to be so matter of fact. I’d bet where he is now they would accommodate someone better than a nursing home. Just curios on others thoughts.

My mother quit giving them both to Dad in September. Dad did become bed bound  early January BUT it was due to Rhabdomyolysis. I’m not a doctor and can’t advise one way or the other, but I don’t see a difference in his cognitive abilities. He’s now on hospice and I am his primary caregiver as mom died in November. I did not reinstate those meds. 
Best wishes on your journey with your parent.
Memantine has no disease modifying effect.  It is purely symptomatic, shown to be marginally effective in later stage disease.  You'll likely notice no problems off it.  The XR version is expensive, but the BID version should be very inexpensive, but drug pricing is beyond my knowledge.
Is that for the generic or the brand name?
Have you checked out goodrx? Try printing one of the coupons and take it to the pharmacy it's labeled for

Just buy if off Alibaba.
You can get it online from overseas pharmacies online.
Thanks. Hospice isn't easy. I sat through that with my dad for a month. Thoughts are with you.
I've run comparisons on sites like Drugs.com or others and I'm just not seeing it this high, so I'm really hoping their answer is that they messed up.
That was the generic. That's what shocked us. It shouldn't be that much for generic from my research.
That's one of the routes we're looking at. Thanks.
Thank you

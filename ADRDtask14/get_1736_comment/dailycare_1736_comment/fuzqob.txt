Getting a door alarm will give you a heads up.  Many people will put a latch above or below eye level to prevent their loved one from wandering.  *Only* do this when someone is nearby in case of fire or an emergency.  I printed up cards saying something like "My companion suffers from dementia.  Thank you for your patience and understanding." that I could hand out in awkward situations.  Fear and paranoia is a common side effect of dementia.  If you don't have a specialist to consult with, get one and discuss this with them.  There are some meds that can help without turning them into a zombie but every person reacts differently.
Does she know who you are, or does she think that you and your dad are different people masquerading as her loved ones?  Those are called Capgras Delusions.

Did this delusion come on all of a sudden?  That's a common symptom of a urinary tract infection.  Is there a nurse line you can call?  Or talk to your neighbor that works at the care home.  She might need to go to the ER.

Definitely call her doctor on Monday morning.  She's not safe right now (she could dash out in front of a car).  She needs a med change.
Get her accustomed to a bracelet with her name and adress on it. That will tip people off that she's not well, and help her get home.

Read up on sundowning and see if this fits her behaviour. 

If she doesn't recognise you, approach her like a stranger. Call her ma'am etc. Allow her time to recognise and find her memory of you.

GPS tag her?

Involve the police in advance, let them know about your situation, so they can help. They'll know what's up when they pick her up, and may not have to ask all the questions again.

Not overpowering her is the best way to go, but safety can't be ignored. You seem to know your priorities, so trust your gut here.

Venting helps. Keep on :)

Yay, I'm so happy. Those UTIs can do a number on the brain.   She'll probably get them again, since they are common in the elderly.  Common enough that anytime someone has sudden delusions, that's the thing they look for!  So look up the symptoms and see if you can notice anything that might give you a clue earlier on that she's developing one, before she starts dashing in the street again.  

You can talk to her doctor about trying these urine test strips.   [https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/hw227994](https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/hw227994)  

Here are some other tips.   [https://www.elmcroft.com/blog/2019/february/prevention-treatment-of-utis-in-elderly/](https://www.elmcroft.com/blog/2019/february/prevention-treatment-of-utis-in-elderly/) 

Dehydration--elders don't feel the same thirst alert we do, so they don't get feel thirsty all the time.  Soups can get water in her, and some foods are naturally high in water content.

Can also help to get mom on a schedule where she goes to the bathroom more often.  Some health conditions make it harder to empty the bladder all the way, so urine sits in the bladder and lets bacteria grow.

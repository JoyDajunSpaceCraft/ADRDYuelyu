My grandfather died from dementia. I was one of his primary carers so I've seen exactly what it does, how long it takes and how much it affects the whole family. It was not an easy job to do. By the end he had absolutely no dignity left. So I've decided that if something like this happens to me my children will be instructed to take me out into a field and shoot me.

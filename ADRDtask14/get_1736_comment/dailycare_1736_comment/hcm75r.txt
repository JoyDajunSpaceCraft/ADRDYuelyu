I just finished the book Why We Sleep. It was very interesting and does talk about the sleep research and Alzheimer’s. He gives several practical suggestions to improve sleep.  I’ve implemented a few. If you really have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor and see if you need a sleep study.
I lost my mother to Alzheimer’s/dementia in 2016. I also have shitty sleep habits and worry about the affect it will have on my chances of getting it. Then that doesn’t help because my worrying causes more sleep issues.
If your concerned about your sleep, talk to the doctor about it. He may have you do a sleep study to figure out how your sleeping patterns are and if you are getting enough r.e.m sleep.

There has been a few studies that find that a lack of r.e.m sleep can lead to an increased risk of stroke and development of brain disorders later in life. (Sleep apnea) but the things you describe seem pretty normal to me.

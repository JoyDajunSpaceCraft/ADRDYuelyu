So, a debit card that comes out of that account? Or a separate "spending in shops" account with a card she can use, and you set up a standing order for e.g. $100 to go into it each month from the main account, or whatever is a reasonable amount for your area.
If there's a normal bank account with a decent balance/income, might it not be rather to change bills so they come directly out of it instead of via a credit card? Fewer accounts for you to look after...
Which country are you in? Have you already sent the POA paperwork to the bank?
A credit card (from any bank) to be used for clothes shopping, food, haircuts, etc. To be used by her sister when they are out and about.  That credit card would be set up to be automatically paid by (withdrawn from) the bank....just like we have now with the current card.
That's true, but the sister still needs to buy things like clothes, incidentals, etc. But something that I didn't think of. Thank you.
USA. The bank is all set with the POA, etc. We just don't want to touch the existing credit cards yet because of all of the autopays.
Oh, and i did contact one of the credit cards anonymously and they said the card would be cancelled once the death was reported and she would have to apply for a new, which was denied.

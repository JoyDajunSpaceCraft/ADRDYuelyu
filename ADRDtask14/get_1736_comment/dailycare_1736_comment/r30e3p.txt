We had a friends Ma in a similar condition and we gave her CBD Oil, it really calmed her down and made her sleep.
My dad is 86 with a UTI I hope has been properly treated. He hasn't been sleeping worth  shit.
You want to ask the doctor for Olanzapine commonly known as Zyprexia.  I have a 81 year old mil that I care for. She has gotten the recent diagnosis of dementia. She has a tendency to be awake all night long and wander the house. After some severe behavior issues recently the doctor prescribed this miracle drug!  It is a very light sedative, but for folks with dementia it helps get a good nights sleep so they wake up feeling refreshed and less agitated.  It has made a huge difference.  Start with the lowest dose which is 2.5mg.  

\*tip\* Please don't let your loved one self administer. Be sure to watch them for any issues with balance while taking. It is a sedative after all!!
My mother finally conked out this morning after three days of being wide awake and babbling constantly. Tried everything. With doctor's ok, doubled up on meds that usually put her right out. Gave her a melatonen. Nothing until finally her body just gave out and she's snoring away. Old age sucks mightily.
Glad she is sleeping and hopefully she will rest well.

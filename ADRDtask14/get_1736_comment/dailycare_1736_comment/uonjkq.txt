There are automatic pill dispensers like the one below that will send off an alarm if she doesn't take the pills out of the box.  Some of these also have a smartphone app so you can more easily keep track as well.

If she's not taking them out of pride tho, you are much better off having someone watch her take them.

I use cameras with two-way speakers.  I have eufy cameras though there are plenty others that work too.  I also have an Amazon echo show which you can do drop in video calls with where she wouldn't have to pick up the call herself.  I've got a door sensor too to tell me if my dad is opening the cabinet where the pills are when he's not supposed to.  This way, I know if he's trying to take pills more often than he should.  He has this bad habit of pushing g the auto dispenser box so he can get more pills out of it when he's not supposed to so it was an extra security we needed.

I personally think you should leave her in the nursing hone tho.  She's gonna need it sooner or later.  I'd only take her out myself if you're afraid of her getting covid or something.

There are surveillance cameras that allow you to talk with the person. Wyze and Ring are two I know of off the top of my head. I guess you could set the cam up over the kitchen table and either call her or use the built in microphone to talk with her and simultaneously observe her taking the pill? 

The amazon devices have a check in feature for elderly family. Maybe one of those has a video conference feature too? That way there is some interaction and you could see her take her meds? 

All of these devices use wi fi. Otherwise, maybe set up her phone to allow zoom and someone has to zoom with her daily to observe her taking her meds?

My mom is very much in the same boat of making endless noise. She either babbles or grunts and moans. Here is what has helped save my sanity and sleep:

Noise cancelling earbuds. Mine cost $70, but they are worth millions for how they have saved my sanity. I wear them whenever her groaning and babbling is driving me insane. Lots of podcasts and dance hits. 

Ear plugs for nighttime. The walls here are thin, and sometimes mom pops up in the middle of the night to have long conversations with the voices in her head. The ear plugs are rated for construction, but I can still hear my phone ring and the home alarm, so safety at night is not really a concern. Also, my watch buzzes for phone calls and alarms, and that wakes me even if I don't hear the sound at first.

Mom also is on melatonin, so most nights she sleeps through and I don't even wear the ear plugs. Last night wasn't that kind of night since she woke up at 2:00 AM just groaning. So the ear plugs went in and I slept like a baby.

Good luck and take care of yourself! People don't understand how stressful constant noise can be until they experience it and start to lose sleep and peace of mind. I am so sorry you are going through this.
Does he get engaged by any programs? Nature shows are good for my dad - no complex plots, just cool animals and pretty birds, beautiful scenes… luckily he enjoys music as well, so concerts, and is religious (I’m not but I’ll put on a movie about the Bible and it keeps him engaged, I can tune it out). Walking is a good  one too when I can join him.
I second ear buds and melatonin.

not a cure all, but they certainly keep the constant sighing and cursing (i live in a constant broken record of 'shit and fuck') to a dull hum.

9shit  to a nearly inaudible hum.
Thank you those suggestions!
He enjoys adverts more than any show, and he used to have a favourite local radio program but unfortunately it was cancelled a few months ago. He doesn't like to sit and do one thing for too long anymore, he constantly gets up and down.
Hahaha I know exactly what you mean, we get lots of "shit", "bloody bastard" and "pugh!" haha. Not to loud, but lots of other chatter too!
I use a white noise machine but you can also download white noise apps for your phone that work the same.  You need to be careful with your ears because any noise for an extended period of time can be bad for you.  So just use it at night.  For daytime stuff, medications for him are probably the way to go unfortunately. Talk to his doctor and see what they say may help. 

Good luck to you!
Maybe the radio program has episodes recorded in their archives? Maybe they’d be willing to share them with you?
I looked into it when it was first cancelled unfortunately there is nothing.... But good suggestion!
Bummer :(

My mom doesn't think she needs home healthcare assistance so every morning she turns off all the lights in the house and sits in the dark because she thinks that means the CNA won't come in the house to care for her. She was sitting in the dark in her room when the CNA came in this morning ( I had run upstairs while all this was happening). The CNA came on in and sat in the dark with my mom. Finally, the CNA asks her why she's sitting in the dark:

CNA: Why are we sitting in the dark?

MOM; Shhh.....we're hiding from the lady that's coming to give me a bath today

CNA: I am that lady. 

MOM: No you're not. You can't see me. I'm hiding. You need to hide too!

CNA: Let's go hide in the shower!
This happened a little while ago. Dad has Lewy Body Dementia. One day he was trying to trim his eyebrows. He was having so much trouble and getting so frustrated, he decided to shave them right off. When he showed me, I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from giggling. Luckily, he caught my giggles and we had a good laugh together.
Middle of the night we hear something fall in the bathroom. My mom is in there dumping her mug into the toilet saying her soda had gone flat and dropped her mug into the toilet on accident. My daughter says nana why are you dumping it in the toilet? She says it's not like I can dump it in the sink, the sink doesn't flush. My daughter says no, but it'll go down the drain. My mom then says what was I supposed to do, dump it on the floor?? My poor kiddo (just turned 18 not long ago) sometimes says she feels so guilty for laughing about things nana says or does. I keep reaffirming to her that we aren't technically laughing at nana and it really honestly was funny. Also that if we don't laugh sometimes we will go crazy. When this happened I told her about this subreddit and the funny Fridays.  I said guess what story I'm telling on Friday ü§£
My Mom said that her caretakers have recently started playing checkers with her, but they aren‚Äôt very good at it, Mom keeps winning. She tries not to win, but they don‚Äôt take advantage of the opportunities she gives them.
My dad (78, stage 5 Alzheimers) lives with us and goes out to the mailbox to check the mail several times a day.  Our neighbor's mailbox is right next to ours, so sometimes they run into each other and chat for a while.

The other day Dad goes out and we see him and the neighbor talking.  They're out there for a while, then he comes in.  My wife greets him and the conversation goes like this:

W: Oh I saw you talking to the neighbor.  How is she?  
D: Fine, fine.  
W: Was there any mail?  
D: No, no, she's a woman.
I'm stressed out with caregiving for partner with Alzheimer's. At my own yearly physical, the med people have started giving me the "list of 3 words, I'll ask you what they were in a few minutes." I've hit 65, and they're testing for cognitive decline.

At my most recent visit I was given these words: **Angry. Sharp. Melon**. 

Yeah! Can't think offhand of a better poetic image to describe my state of mind!
My mother, her whole life pre-dementia **was** a pretty accepting and an open person as far as not being racist, bigoted etc.  

Last night shouldn't couldn't sleep again, she got up shortly before 9PM. Check and found a movie she'd might like to watch, and told her "mom there's a movie starting in 5 minutes, it's about cowboys, horses, and the wilderness !" Right up her alley. She couldn't wait to watch a film she had already seen and loved before, but I knew it would be like a new film all over again for her. 

So Brokeback Mountain started. 

I was sitting nearby in the dining room on my laptop working, and for the first 30-40 minutes or so. I heard variations of: 

"You're cute!"  

"A Horsey !!!!"

"You're cute too!"

"WOW you're really cute !!!"

And Repeat ... Then at the 30-40 minute mark, it changed to:

"what are the doing?" 

"Are they wrestling?" 

"WHAT... OMG!!!"

"ARE THEY GAY?"

"THEY'RE GAY?"

"Oh look at the Horsey!!!" 


Was laughing my ass off in the dining room.
I tell my grandma every day that there is no other dog. There are no kids. They went with somebody else. And they are fine. She doesn't believe me until I say it a few times. It helps if you have pictures of them leaving with people she knows.
On a similar note to OP, my mum told me earlier today that her phone didn‚Äôt work. While we were talking on said phone. She was also annoyed at my (lovely, caring and without her my mum would be f**ked) sister for not fixing the phone she was talking to me from. Sometimes you just have to smile and move on.
Right before my loved one had to be placed in a memory care facility, they told me that our next door neighbor (who was in his 80's) had an orgy in our back yard the evening prior.

Other rare moments of levity surrounding clothing:  loved one couldn't find their pants.  Turns out pants were hidden in the freezer.

In a hotel room, loved one quietly got up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, got disoriented, went out into the hallway and was locked out, found a service elevator and took it down to the basement laundry.  Security came knocking at the door with loved one, who was smiling and buck naked.

OK, the hotel story wasn't funny at the time, but looking back, I can now chuckle.
I‚Äôm fairly new to this sub. My relative  just got diagnosed and is probably stage 5. My spouse is spending the holiday weekend, and I‚Äôll take over Tuesday-Friday, while our paid helper is on vacation. I was feeling sorry for myself and my spouse, but this lifted my spirits. Thank you to all of you who keep your sense of humor through this.
Today my parents finally agreed to cancel the home fax line.  They thought they needed it to send a scan.
My grandma has early stage Alzheimer‚Äôs and has trouble the word finding. The other day I said ‚Äúgrandma how are you feeling this morning?‚Äù she goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling kind of *imitates a mix between a cat hissing and tv static*‚Äù I was like ‚Äúummm what does THAT mean?‚Äù  We discovered that she was trying to describe butterflies in her stomach because she had a doctor‚Äôs appointment and she was nervous. Which actually makes sense don‚Äôt you think? Later in the morning she used the word ‚Äúbiological‚Äù correctly.
My mum every now n then wakes up from a nap and asks what happened to where is her grandma (who brought her up) - I say but mum, she died 40 years ago already!  NO, she says, MY GRANDMA - i tell her ‚Äú‚ÄùYES,  MUM, you are 90 yrs old now - if your grandma was alive today she‚Äôd be like 140 years old!!!   She passed away 40 years ago already!!‚Äù‚Äù     She tells me  ‚ÄúNO, you're confused and thinking of somebody else.‚Äù‚Äù   lmao
OMG that reminds me of something my great grandmother with vascular dementia did. Her husband was dying of a stroke and she was freaking out and saying: what's the number for 911?? She was also so stressed witnessing him pass away that she had a minor stroke of her own.
Let's go hide in the shower ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Gold.
That CNA knows her business.
My dad's been shaving his eyebrows off for quite some time. Recently he started shaving his eyelashes off.
Still has his dad joke game on point.
I am laughing so hard trying not to wake my baby üòÇ
My grandmother used to always ask about "the kids" and would get upset if I asked which ones, as I'm not a parent. I used to try to pacify her with saying they're with their mother. Finally said that the kids were with their dad and that calmed her down. The mother seemed to be my mother, but when I said with their dad, she thinks of my grandfather.

Today when she asked where they were, I only replied that it was Friday. That seemed to work
i dont think that‚Äôs the right way to deal with that kind of confusion, it‚Äôs probably very hard for her to hear that someone she loves is dead

sometimes with dementia it‚Äôs ok to say, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know mum, maybe she stepped out for a bit‚Äù. challenging confusion or delusions often makes things scarier for the sick person
Ouch!
Yeah..Im the kid she's asking about usually. But she doesnt know who I am. Ill use that..it's Friday..they got picked up early..
Yes, sometimes my grandmother will ask where her mom is. I just tell her she's in the city her mother last lived in.

When she asked where her deceased ex husband is, I'll tell her Florida. Either that he moved there or is visiting his sister, whichever she'll more readily believe.
Thankyou for your input.  Yes, I‚Äôve been dealing with this for 10 yrs already - she knows her own mum is deceased, we often visit her in the cemetery rose gardens nearby, and she knows grandma is deceased decades ago too. This ‚Äòbut where is grandma‚Äô thing is recent, and only when she‚Äôs been napping.  Sometimes I do say ‚Äòshe‚Äôs with xyz relatives in Sydney‚Äô (who are also all deceased decades ago).  **But then as she comes more awake from her nap, the questions for details come, and she gets confused if I‚Äôm saying grandma is still alive.**  **So you see where that approach leads us.**  I think, this usually IS the 'right way' to deal with this, for the moment.

And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äòthe right way to deal with‚Äô dementia care-takers to tell them they‚Äôre ‚Äòdoing The Wrong Thing‚Äô, from just a snipppet.  Everybodys case is different, and many cases differ from day to day moment to moment.  You‚Äôve got to roll with it, & use different tactics accordingly.
It might be implied they're at school in my case. We've said that other times. She raised me, so my brother and myself are usually the kids she's looking for, but sometimes it's her own children.
Yeah..her age doesnt factor in at all..I lived with her growing up...so it is best to be ambiguous about "the kids"

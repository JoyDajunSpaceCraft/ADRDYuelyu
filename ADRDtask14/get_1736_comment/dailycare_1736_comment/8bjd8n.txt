You know, until I read your post I hadn't thought that the fact that my wife's Memantina prescription had run out last week would have anything to do with her disturbance in her sleep cycle.

Or in the fact that she is starting to cackle like a madwoman from time to time.

Must be a coincidence.
Note to self: this was a serious post. I don't actually know what Memantina does or doesn't do, but I **do** notice when my wife's behaviour is out of balance.

I'd like to know about this too, OP. Good question
It doesn't seem that there have been large-scale studies on MCT oil for AD, so it might not be worth much ketogenic diet or not. I did find this promising but small study in which a ketogenic diet was not used: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8919247/
There have not been widescale studies, but some indications are that yes it can be useful. Too anecdotal to say really. But worth a shot and probably minimal downside, except $ spent.
The MCT goes directly to the brain. The brain relies on sugar for energy some if not all dementia people are sugar resistant  as in dibitties.  The diet and the oil is to change the source of energy from sugar and carbs to fat thus feeding the brain.
Thanks very much for this. It is exactly what Iâ€™m looking for. It does seem promising at the beginning at least. Hopefully more work will be done on it soon.
Yeah, I get that this is the hypothesis, but OP said they were curious if MCT would "make a difference," which at this point, no one can really say. The study I linked seems to suggest that more research should be done. I'm very much hopeful, but I'm also skeptical of any easy solutions.
Hormone Replacement Therapy, of atleast the sex hormones and thyroid, could make a huge difference if the disease is not too advanced yet

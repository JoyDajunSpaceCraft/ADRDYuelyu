Her mood changes might be unrelated to the new relationship. Or they might be related to attempted *restrictions* placed on the relationship.

Why is it so bad that these two elderly dementia patients are enjoying each other's company? Is there somehow exploitation going on, or what? It seems on its face that it's not *that* big of a deal, sure it's awkward, but it sounds pretty benign.
I consider your point that the mood changes might possibly be related to something other than the new relationship, quite valid. And, yes, we're aware that the "restrictions" are the likely reason for her acting out. Please understand, if it's at all possible for my mother to enjoy another individual's company and be happy without it causing her additional confusion, jealousy or potentially violent behavior then we're all for it. Our  desire is for her to be happy without complications. There are no exploitation issues here, just concern and a desire to have it all work out for her in the very best way possible. Hence the questions.

Is there any way her doctor could prescribe something like a sedative for before you go? I suppose it depends on the procedure because she may not be able to take anything beforehand, but it cant hurt to ask!
Call her physician and DEMAND they give an RX for anxiety - short acting, just long enough to get her to the appointments and hospital. Either the GP or the surgeon, she's not the first dementia patient who needed some calming like that. Then explain that she can be non-compliant and may not get to the hospital.  Then, talk to the surgeon or surgeons PA about letting her stay overnight. They call that extended recovery at the hospital nearby where my father has had surgery that would have been outpatient - but I wasn't comfortable that I could monitor or know what to do/how to handle that first day.
Even if they can't have food, they can be allowed meds with clear liquid. Depends on timing.

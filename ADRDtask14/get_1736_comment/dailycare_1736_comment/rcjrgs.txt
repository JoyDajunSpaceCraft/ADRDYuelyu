When it comes to dementia if the person is not in danger don't try and correct her or help her with reality just go with the flow, or redirect as mentioned by u/Mrb572.

My mother says things like there's people outside, someone stole my bank card, there's a fire etc - I just say "ok mum, I'll check" it's good mum here have some raisins.
Redirect her attention to something else. Just change the subject. You should also speak with her Dr. About fabricated memories like this.  My mom was able to play my brother and I for at least 5 years because she was pretty independent. It wasn’t until we spoke with her Dr when he “called” her in to run some tests. And from that moment forward one of us was always at her appointments. With a proper diagnosis of her condition proper treatment can begin.
Thanks for your answer!
I will do that, thanks a lot

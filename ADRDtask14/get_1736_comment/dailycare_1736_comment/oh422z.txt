I know the feeling. Who I care for isn’t as bad but it can be incredibly frustrating when it feels like they’re intentionally messing with you, or being so inconsiderate towards you. It is very hard. We want to do what’s best for our family but sometimes our best isn’t good enough, and we put so much emphasis on the person we’re caring for we don’t care for ourselves.

I think you know it’s getting to that point, especially since you’re suffering so much from caring for her.
Yes! Today's pictionary clue was " the refrigerator is running" and they ment the ac was on, which they cannot stand the ac at all and it's like a greenhouse inside. 
I feel for you, it's hard enough to try to guess what they are saying while keeping track of their needs and then to be sworn at. It's just more than one person can absorb. I am sorry you are in that position.
This definitely sounds like too much. I‘d contact your local Area Agency on Aging, the Alzheimer’s Association, or something similar for support. You might qualify for respite in a surprising place. (Such as if your mom was in or ever married to someone who was in the military. Some states have respite options.) Hopefully they’ll have a social worker or a counselor when they coordinate or look in to services for you and that person can guide you through the decision making process. But RESPITE is critical so it isn’t you & your husband 24/7. Blessings to you!

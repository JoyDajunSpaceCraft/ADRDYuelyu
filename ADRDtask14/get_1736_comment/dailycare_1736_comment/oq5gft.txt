I havent heard of this, but i will say that my mum had a lot of what i called physical hallucinations. If you think of a hallucination as your brain misinterpreting signals or receiving phantom signals through the eyes, the it makes sense this could happen with all the senses. For my mum it was things crawling on her that weren’t there, hearing sounds that no one made etc. Maybe what your husband is describing is something like that. But either way, i would definitely bring it up at neuro. They may know what it is for sure.
So very sad about you mum. I’m sorry this happened to her. What an awful disease
Yeah my mom thinks dog fur are bugs. I try to show her it is dog fur and she believes me in the moment, but not later
Thank you. I feel the same for you. I hope your husband turns out not to have it and that life is full of joy for you.
Yes that sounds about right

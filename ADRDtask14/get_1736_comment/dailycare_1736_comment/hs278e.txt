I told my father that it was time to take it easy.  He earned it.  When he went into a memory care center, I said we were finding him a new apartment with a restaurant so he didn't have to cook anymore.  Everything we did I explained it to him like this was the easy retirement he'd worked his whole life for.  I never said, you can't do this anymore, I said, we're going to take care of it so you don't have to be bothered by it anymore.  For the first couple of months he said his brother was stealing money from him.  But then he settled in and it was fine.  He really was able to relax without the stress weighing on him all the time.
I think that, while it’s a big step that your family is taking in having the conversation with your grandpa, it’s not going to be the last time you have this conversation with him. He’ll likely forget the conversation or feel so great in the moment that he won’t feel deterred by the diagnosis. THAT is when you’ll need calm voices and soft tones. 

There are days when my grandma so clearly has dementia, where she knows it and I know it and we all know it. There are other days when she gets so frustrated with feeling like she’s being bossed around or like she doesn’t have control of her own life; that’s when she tries to take her keys and go for a drive. Luckily we have measures set up so that couldn’t happen, but that’s the world you might be living in.

The main point is to be calm and create a foundation of trust between grandpa and caregiver(s).
Hi. My Dad has dementia and I have taken over 95 percent of finances but I let him sit with me as I write checks and he reviews my math. The team approach has worked well instead of taking it away.

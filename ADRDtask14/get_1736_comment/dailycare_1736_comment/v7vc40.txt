I'm not 100% sure what you're asking, but I'm assuming you're asking if she's on Medicaid, why do you have to pay for assisted living/memory care.

It may differ in each state, but where my MIL is living (memory care in Florida), Medicaid pays a set amount towards her room and board, but not all of it. Medicaid also pays for "level of care," which includes staff, incontinence supplies, etc. We still have to pay $2,500 a month. Medicare pays for her hospital stays. 

If your question was about something else, I apologize.
Your grandmother gets social security, correct?  Does anyone have access to her bank accounts?  I'm in PA - when my mom first went in, we had to pay the first month manually.  What happens is the home will have her social security check deposited with them, but it takes a month to kick in, so you'd really be paying that first month with her last social security check if that makes sense...
Talk to the nursing home about moving her in as a “medicaid pending” patient. some more ideas: https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/getting-into-nursing-home/
Is the $2500 a month from her SS?

Her SS doesn't cover the full $2,500, so we have to pay the majority of the $2,500.
> so we *paid* all her

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*
Yikes.  We were lucky my mom had a couple of bucks in the bank (like $7k) , and her ER trip that landed her in the nursing home only cost about $1000 out of pocket.  I guess I was spoiled - my mom landed in a great facility with an administrator that walked me through everything.

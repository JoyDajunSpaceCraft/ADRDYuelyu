Often, depression can be a symptom of dementia. I would bring this up with her doctor, and consider some medication to address the depression. It can help a lot.
Probably needs new meds or medication adjustment.  Also, I would hug her as much as possible and tell her you love her just the way she is.  Hugging may not change anything with her but who doesn't need a hug.
I’d be lying to you if I said it didn’t bother me when my grandma partakes in self-deprecation. It’s annoying and i find it incredibly aggravating. But as bothered as I am, I keep showering her with positive affirmations. Ever since I started giving her compliments regularly, she’s cut back on the self deprecation, but she has her bad days here and there and the bad thought come along with it. Just try your best to assure her that she’s worthwhile, and try to remember that this is the dementia talking; not her.
It is too liste for a personality overhaul. What she's doing was done to her early in life, and she's been practicing ever since. Telling her not to do it will just be another criticism she can feel bad about. Probably at this stage you should just get really good at changing the subject, suggesting her attention to something like the bird feeder or oh hey there's ice cream, etc.
That's a good idea, we'll try that. I know with my other grandma anti-anxiety meds worked wonders, so maybe anti-depression would help here
Always good advice. We haven't been able to see her much due to COVID, of course, so I imagine she's pretty hug-starved
Thank you, I will try more positive affirmations. My other grandma was similar, so I know that it's just part of the dementia. I do also wonder if it is part of the way their generation talked

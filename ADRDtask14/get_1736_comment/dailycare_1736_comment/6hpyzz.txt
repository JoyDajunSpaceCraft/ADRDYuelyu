idk man do we really want an army of dementia sufferers who can also outlift us?
If creatine monohydrate does slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease this may be the key:

"Oxidative stress is another fundamental mechanism of biological aging. Antioxidants defuse free radicals and reduce the damage they inflict upon biological systems. Creatine has been found in several studies to possess antioxidant properties. In animal studies it demonstrated protection against superoxide anions, peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radicals."

In Alzheimer's disease, peroxynitrite limits the flow of blood and the transport of glucose which can result in delusions, deprives neurons of energy which can lead to their death, inhibits the regeneration of neurons, and limits the synthesis and release of neurons needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness.

The success of peroxynitrite scavengers depends on their absorption into the bloodstream, their ability to enter the brain, and their effectiveness at scavenging peroxynitrite. 

Some of the best peroxynitrite scavengers are found in Korean red ginseng (including sun/heat processed ginseng), which may initially partially reverse and then stabilize Alzheimer's disease.

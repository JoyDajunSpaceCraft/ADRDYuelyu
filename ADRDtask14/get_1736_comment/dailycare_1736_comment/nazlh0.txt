Not gonna lie to you, its gonna be very tricky. My grandma was also quite stubborn and proud, but her husband only hide certain items that were important for both of them as he couldn't bring himself to hide her stuff (you might have more luck in that department). Also, a general tip about helping her. Never tell her she needs help or that you must help her, if she is as proud/independent/stubborn she will never accept it. You have to ease here in to the idea. I usually made it seem my grandma had told me to help her and then she usual would go along with it.
Yeh, bless her.  Go check out the alzheimers .org & dementia .org for your country, they have loads of tips n resources n help sheets n so on, they're a great help!.  

Maybe it's time for her to also start clearing out some clutter, maybe have a designated "important things box" all that stuff is (supposed to be) kept in.   Your folk could automate any of her bills, for eg, so she doesn't have to try do it herself, online. 

 Wow but, at 91 she can still manage internet taxes on-line  -- that's amazing!  My mum can barely manage the tv remote.   Best of luck!
Appreciate it. Yeah, when I asked if she was ok she was near tears. She shut me down from helping, but I gave her a hug and left her to it. It was super hard to see. I have learnt not to push her at all if it isn't necessary. If she doesn't want me to help search, or if she just wants to be left alone, I try not to battle her on those things because it isn't worth it. But next time I will try to just do it without giving her the option to refuse the help.
I perused their material and didn't find anything on this particular topic, but did get some other good information. 

I like the idea of cleaning out the clutter. She moved into my parents house maybe 10 years ago, when she was living alone. They got a bunch of stuff out then, but she still has more than she needs.

I appreciate it.

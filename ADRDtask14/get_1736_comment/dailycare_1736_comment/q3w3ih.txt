Yeah I went through something similar (not as extreme) when my mom was first diagnosed with AZ. It was mostly the stress/anxiety from a very stressful job and the fear I could also get AZ. Lots of things can cause partial memory loss for perfectly healthy adults. Mostly streets/anxiety. The tell is that you later recall what you forgot/lapsed. That's normally not the case for AZ patients.
Just the fact that your issues started right after you visited your grandma is also a tell this is likely stress/anxiety induced.
It's ok to feel bad about seeing a loved one this way. We all deal with it differently. The odds you have AZ/dementia are astronomically low, pretty much zero.
Try breathing techniques and keep talking to a therapist to help deal with the issues visiting your grandma caused. 
It's great to visit her but not if it's sends you into an emotional tailspin. You need to take care of yourself first before helping her feel better. It's not your responsibility to visit her regularly.

Take care.
Worry will put you in an early grave also it will give you dementia so they say. While the world is filled with pain there's not much you can do about 99 percent of it. Rest your mind and think about the kind and good things of life.
Yeah man sometimes I get this anxiety after visiting my father. Its all overthinking. Anxiety will make things worse as your brain will be frying from pessimistic thoughts instead storing properly important information

When my mom was in a similar situation, I put notes up around the house saying, “John is in the hospital. He is ok.”  And that worked for her. 

The problem was she kept wanting to go visit him.  15 minutes after we get home from a visit she would want to go back because she forgot she visited.
A Therapeutic Fib is when you lie to a dementia patient so they don’t become upset by the truth.  It’s the only way to save your sanity too sometimes. So, maybe, grandpa went to the store. Or he went over to see (whoever). Whatever you can say that will keep her happy. Why upset her over something she has no control over? And she will obsess over? Especially if you have to answer her every 10 minutes, so it starts all over again.

We had to do that with my Mom.  She couldn’t figure out why her Dad hadn’t come to visit her - could be cause he died 50 years ago! But someone told her that and she was absolutely devastated, because she didn’t remember that he had died. How cruel would it be to remind her of that over and over.  Therapeutic Fib to the rescue!
Honestly I’d probably just tell her that he’s gone out or something. I know lying sucks but if the truth is causing too many issues sometimes it’s best to lie
That sounds like a good idea, I think I’ll try it. Especially in her room. She keeps saying she gets up at night and searches the house for him.

I had to resort toadying for twice a day visits to have someone physically hand my dad his pills and stand there while he took them.  I tried weekly pill boxes, then a pill box with alarms.  He either didn't hear the alarms, or would dump the pills out to stop the alarm but still not take them.  I would call him and he would swear he had taken them.  
With my grandmother she was overdosing when we would leave a pill box for her, even with an alarm reminding her to take them or phone calls coaching her. We had to resort to just giving them to her in a cup (she had arthitis in her hands as well) and sometimes tricking her into taking them (she always wanted pain pills, so all of her medication were "pain pills"). But like someone else who posted below, we would also have to stand by and coach her.

 Maybe something that is timed and won't open until it is the appropriate time to take them would be enough, I mean it is not like we can integrate all the medication into one super pill that is somehow easy to swallow!

You might want to reach out to the Alzheimer's association magazine and see if they would be willing to have a questionnaire in one issue. Each major city has their own caregiver's support group, looking there would probably be a good resource as well. Good luck!

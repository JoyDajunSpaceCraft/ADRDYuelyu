Get a lawyer! If he is initiating divorce, she will need to get one anyway. Better now than later.
 you need to get someone to act as her advocate someone not necessarily ( maybe absolutely) the same person as her divorce attorney.
someone who can stand up for her rights.

Your State Bar should be able to give you a referral for a competent (i.e. hasn't been subject to disipline) attorney that practices family law in your area.  
Interview multiple lawyers.  Consults are free.  Find someone who you are comfortable with, and don't stop at the first one.  I think there's a misconception that lawyers are intimidating assholes (some are), but you are a paying customer.  You wouldn't go out and buy the first car you saw without doing some research, treat this the same way.  Call Law Schools in the area (U of M, Wayne State, Detroit Mercy, MSU-think that's all of the schools in Michigan), and see if they have a good referral service you can access, or if they have an alumni directory, with areas of practice you can look at.  Go to the Michigan State Bar website, and see what resources they have.  [Here's an ok site to check out](http://lawyers.findlaw.com/lawyer/practicestate/Divorce/Michigan)

Edit: Come up with questions about their experience in law, fees and their fee schedules (what's included if a retainer is required).  Just remember that you hold all the cards when choosing, so don't get overwhelmed.  You can always fire them if it doesn't work out, but, I think you'll find if you take your time and stay organized, you'll find someone relatively easily.

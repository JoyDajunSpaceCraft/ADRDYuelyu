 **If you receive SSI, you are already** [**eligible for Medicaid**](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/eligibility-medicare-can-i-qualify-before-im-65.html)**.** People who don't receive SSI but are sixty-five or older, disabled, or blind can qualify for Medicaid if they meet certain [income and asset limits](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/medicaid-basics.html).

You need to get him on Medicaid, if he's that poor, he should easily qualify.

Also, if you haven't already, look at this site

Contact the Department of Aging his county.  They have multiple resources that are helpful.  I'm in a similar situation with my mom (PA) and they've been a good source of info.
He can apply for Medicaid once his income and assets dip to around $10k, which means you will have to use his resources to pay for a home until it runs out. I'm in Missouri and the home will help me apply for Medicaid & go through the process with me. Medicaid will take his Social security check each month, but let him keep around $50. He will be able to keep around $3,000 only. Going through this with my mom.
Thanks, those are helpful resources. It looks like he should have been automatically enrolled in Medicaid, but he definitely wasn’t? I’m not sure why I’ve received so much conflicting information about that from his healthcare provider
This will be the third time I’ve reached out to our county’s office of aging. We’ve scheduled case workers to come visit twice now and no one’s showed up, due to scheduling conflicts on their end (these were days I had to take off work to be present). I’m just a bit frustrated with that office, but it seems they’re the only ones to go through.
a way to burn through those assets responsibly is to pre-pay rent and bills. Don't pay down debt unnecessarily, tho, bc when he dies, that debt will die with him. No one else is responsible for that debt unless they were co-signed onto the credit card. People will lie to you about this.

Hope that helps you!  Good luck!!!
Try looking for a local support group. When we were battling a very similar situation, I found a support group for dementia patient caretakers. It was a group full of people with a lot of various resources that we hadn’t even thought of.
That’s an interesting option. Unfortunately since our last visit, he’s no longer permitted at his primary doctor office because he kept scheduling appointments without telling us, and then immediately forgetting about and missing them. So we’re also in the middle of finding a new primary care physician for him (everyone is full at the moment) and explaining his situation all over again.

I would call the doctor (not the front desk, or at least speak to the office administrator/manager) and explain that missing appointments happened because of his dementia. That's a petty rule they have for drug addicts and non-compliant healthy (independant, young) people. It should be waived for people in your dad's condition, esp if you say that you're taking over your dad's care now and you promise that you will be handling making and keeping all appointments from now on.

Someone at the office shouldn't have been making appointments on his behalf if they knew his memory was that poor.
Regarding the POA, this may be dependent on how advanced OPs father’s dementia is. We ran into this roadblock with my dad. His dementia was so far advanced and my mother didn’t have a POA for him. They refused to allow him to create one because of his dementia diagnoses.
My dad won’t sign a POA or will. I’m in the same position. What should I do?
Why won’t he sign a POA? Does he have a dementia type diagnosis or is he of sound mind to sign a POA? 
If it’s the former, the only thing we were told that we could do was go through the court system to apply for a conservatorship. This is a long, detailed process that requires you to prove you have a plan for everything from his finances to his healthcare and prove it in court. My dad ended up passing away before we could even get to the first step. We were fortunate enough to have healthcare staff that allowed us to make calls on his behalf regarding his care, but they certainly could have denied us that right at any time. 

When it comes to a will, my dad refused to talk about putting one together, even when he was of sound mind. Drove me nuts. After he passed we found out he was in a tremendous amount of debt. So much that my mother had to immediately file for bankruptcy to save herself. The only tip I can give you here is start learning his passwords for accounts now and check his credit scores. If there’s any possessions family members may fight over, discuss it with him now before it’s too late.
Jeez. Yeah he’s of very sound mind and refuses. He seems to be totally fine rotting into the ground and expect me to carry all the burden of caring for him with no help. 

He “forgets” his passwords and has to have them reset regularly so even when I do have them it’s not for long. He’s in bad debt and continues to try to get credit cards. 

I’m getting really bitter. His hygiene sucks and he won’t let me hire someone and out bathroom isn’t equipped.
Yep. We were in this **exact** same situation. 
For password situation, what seemed to help were 2 things: A very special little black password book that I sat down and went to every single account he had, figured out the password, wrote it down, & told him to guard it with his life. He liked that. Also, I made it so he could only use Google Chrome and had Chrome save all of his passwords so it’d automatically log him in. I don’t think he realized this most of the time. 

Hygiene was one of my first real ‘oh shit, this is serious’ indicators. When I noticed he hadn’t really been brushing his teeth, he’d take forever taking showers, we had to buy him a shower chair. We eventually had to start reminding him to shower, shave, do something with his hair so he didn’t look like an escaped mental patient who had been electrocuted. Joking with him about it like that was about the only thing that’d work to get him to go clean himself, when he was still mostly able to on his own. He tried to hide the pain in his hands, but I noticed he also stopped clipping his fingernails. 

Now, as for you carrying the burden of him rotting into the ground. This was my first parent I’ve had to bury. Emotions aside, this shit is not cheap - and we did it the cheapest way possible, short of digging the hole ourselves. It cost us right around $5,000 total, maybe a little more? We even put off his funeral for 4 months just to save money for it. 
It may be hard to talk about with him, but it’s something that you will be faced with regardless of if he wants to talk or not. It’s so much better for your mind to not have to handle that when you’re grieving. 

If you (or anyone!) have any questions, feel free to ask me anything! I just went through it all & I’d love to help anyone going through it now. We felt very alone during it all & I don’t want anyone else to feel that way. It’s so hard watching your parents come to the end of their lives.

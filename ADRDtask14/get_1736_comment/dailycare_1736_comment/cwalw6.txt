Great question. I’ll be reading the answers along with you.
This is US advice. Not sure how it translate to Canada, sorry.  I don’t have all the answers, but I can tell you one part.  The Power of Attorney has to be signed by him while he is still capable. Once he is diagnosed as incapacitated with dementia, he legally does not have the capacity to sign a legal document.  So then you would have to go to court to file to become his legal guardian. That is more time consuming and more expensive than a POA.  If you can somehow get a POA signed soon, that would be best. If you contact an attorney, they may be able to help.
I'm not in Canada but my mother in law has dementia. Sounds like your father in law is in the "denial" phase where she was a few years ago. You've got limited time to snap him out of it.

You might give him some clear examples of why he needs to go to the doctor... stuff he can not deny. Forgetting who his son is and acting weird are not a good reasons. He can laugh that off. Taking a walk and not finding his way home or forgetting to turn something off on the stove are good reasons. Try to get him to see that it's getting worse and doctors, with all their faults (they're only human) are there to help. Medicine does help alleviate the symptoms of dementia but they need regular adjustment as the disease progresses.

Brace yourself for some rough riding; you are your spouse's primary support and she or he needs that support. Educate yourself; there's lots of stuff on the internet. And don't forget to keep yourself strong, if only for your spouse.

Finally, don't feel you're alone. I guess that's why I joined this subreddit. I'll likely never meet others on it, but (virtually) we're in this together. And knowing that helps me.

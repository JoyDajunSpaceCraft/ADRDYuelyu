No need to say she might have a certain diagnosis. Just gently tell her you are worried about her memory and recommend she be evaluated by her physician. It could be dementia, medication, or other reversible cause.
She lives with my grandmother, whose memory isn't great but I think that's more an effect of aging than disease.

Just making sure: if she put me down as Medical POA, there's no court wrangling or anything I have to do to utilize that? It's just that I have it and that's it?

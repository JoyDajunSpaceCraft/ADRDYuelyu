My only insight is that MIL was on antipsychotics for schizophrenia for awhile, though not sure if she was still on them in the decade leading up to her dx in her 70s. She definitely had a long history of mental stuff, from her teenage onward, whether treated for it or not. 

Right before her dementia dx she was hallucinating so my husband took her to the ER, thinking she needed to be committed again. They instead dx'ed her with a UTI. Admitted her, treated the UTI, the hallucinations stopped. They then said that at her age -- even though she had a history of mood disorders and psychosis with prior commitments -- they would treat her as a dementia patient. And such drugs were not appropriate. 

By that point her dementia symptoms were fairly overt. Memory issues. Basically 6 second memory. Though still very verbal and great at confabulation. 

It is my understanding that those with severe mental disorders have a higher likelihood of developing dementia later.  I would consider that possibility rather than looking at her meds for causality.
My mom is a complete mess without her drugs. I would trust the doctors. We have her on a cocktail of ativan, aricept, olanzapine, namenda, and zoloft. She is so much better with the meds. We did notice a bit of a difference reducing the olanzapine. We had to go from 5mg to 2.5mg. She had some bad muscle function problems at 5mg. If you posted the actual problems she is having it would help. But, trust me, drugs are needed to reduce the symptoms. It takes a while to find what makes them happy. 
Did a neurologist diagnose your grandpa, or a family doctor?

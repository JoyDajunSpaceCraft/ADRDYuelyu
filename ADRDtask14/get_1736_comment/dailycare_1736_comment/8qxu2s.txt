I was the same way maybe still am, when The birth of my first daughter Idk what to expect. I was afraid I wasnâ€™t going to show no emotions. I knew that my emotional side was shut off, but the waterworks came and felt the emotions rush me how I never felt before. I suppressed my feelings a lot when I was younger, so I guess that formed into a bit of apathy. 
Being less attached to someone, for one reason or another, makes it easier to not care what happens to/ with them, since it does not directly affect you. This may seem cold or apathetic but it is not wrong, that's just how it works. 
I didn't feel a thing when any of my grandparents died, but it has little to do with apathy, I just didn't know them that well.

You're just fine m8. Sounds like your grandparents functioned pretty similarly to mine, I'm sure you'll wail buckets when your children perish. 
Most of it is because you've seen their health decline and youve prepared for the inevitable. I didnt feel anything for months. And I thought I was a moster. But its actually quite normal.

I misread the end of your post as "will I cry when they pass away"

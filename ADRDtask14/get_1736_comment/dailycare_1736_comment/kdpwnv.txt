It sounds like the disease (or something since she has multiple issues) could be affecting the hypothalamus, which regulates body temp (hot, sweating), emotional responses (fear and crying), and hormone regulation.
Is she taking Donepezil?  Hot flashes are on the list of less common side effects.  My mother had some odd side effects when she started taking it (flushing, tingling sensation, and dizziness).  Also, it is eliminated primarily by the kidneys so if her kidney function has decreased then her dose may need to be adjusted.
how is her heart rate during this time?  A panic attack maybe?
I don't know about the hot flashes (hypoglycemia? Maybe?), but the hallucinations and emotional upset sound more like Lewy body dementia than Alzheimers. My mom has a diagnosis of dementia, but because the symptoms between Lew body and Alzheimers are so similar (except Mom doesn't get hallucinations), there's no way to confirm it short of an autopsy.
This will happen to my mother as well, however we’ve noticed a correlation of it happening when she is particularly stressed or anxious about something. It’s almost as if her brain is having trouble processing what is happening so her body kicks into overdrive and it results in profuse sweating. 

I’ve always seen it as another part of Alzheimer’s, where that part of the brain that regulates body temp/sweating is unfortunately deteriorating and therefore unable to do its job - causing these moments.
Yes I was thinking maybe something hormone related as I said. But how periodic it is is so strange to me. Once or twice a day and usually in the evening but not always.
She has many many many panic attacks through the day.

This isn't that.

I have not monitored her heart rate during one of these hot flashes.
Sounds like normal hormonal regulation times.  I bet it correlates to any sundowning episodes she might have, now or in the future.

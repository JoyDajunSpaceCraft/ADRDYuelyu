Can you get the dog fixed?
Getting the dog fixed sounds like the best option.
I’ve met a few “dog-kissers” before and it’s probably not going to stop. My friend’s mom let’s her dog lick her mouth and even though the “dog’s mouths are cleaner than ours” has been debunked she still does it.... amongst other weird shit... It’s almost like when your kid brings you a slobbery Cheeto and you know it’s gross but you take it anyway because you love them so much. 🤢🤮I’d buy her some mouthwash and set it down next to her every time you witness a make-out sesh. Again, probably won’t help but at least it’ll let her know it’s gross so you don’t have to pull the “eating your wife’s pussy and kissing you” example every time.
She may be instinctively seeking out [neuroprotective bowel bacteria](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32059401/). Lactobacillus is often found in the vagina. One theory is that humans get sick because we aren't dirty enough. I'd take her to a petting zoo and see what else she wanted to kiss, just on the off chance it might help. Its not like most of the drugs for dementia are showing much success.
Could you perhaps be a bit kinder in this situation? Yeah it's gross and all but I would say your attitude is even more disgusting. Grow up.
Fire cleanses all.

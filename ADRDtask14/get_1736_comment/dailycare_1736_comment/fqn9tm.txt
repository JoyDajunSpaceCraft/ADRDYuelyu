Okay
Grandpa passed away a few hours ago, so we are all dealikg with it
If you have hospice where you are, they need to be contacted. If not, his doctor might have some advice for you.

Here  (US) we have DNR (Do No Resuscitate) orders and if there is one, we do not do anything.  If there isn't one, we have to call an ambulance.
My grandfather passed in June. I was his caregiver for roughly seven years.
At some point I came to see he wasn’t going to get better.
So once a day usally during his nap, I would sit in my grandmas garden and think about the possibility and imagined the most likely scenarios. Basically I’d run a simulation in my mind on what needed to be done.
This oddly helped me in a way not sure if it would for you.
Though fair warning just because it’s the mostly likely scenario, doesn’t mean it will happen.
Yeah, he wants to die at home in his bed, same thing for my grandma. So we want to grant him his wish, like we did for her. But it is hard. And due to Corona virus we can't call the hospice for visits at home, which makes it harder
This might actually help, thank you very much. And sorry for your loss!
Another piece of advice is do this someplace you feel safe given you will likely come face to face with some nasty emotions.

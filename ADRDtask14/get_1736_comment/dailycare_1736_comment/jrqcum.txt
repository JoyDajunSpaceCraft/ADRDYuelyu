I'm (clearly) not a doctor, but I can tell you that my own mum's doctor said much the same about her. She doesn't have diabetes, mind you... 

The reasoning was kind of a pick-your-battles thing... When she refused to eat, she'd become hangry and everything else about her day became more complicated. When she refused to eat long enough, she lost too much weight. She was definitely underweight for a time. Clearly, a salad with some grilled chicken would be a better choice than a milkshake for supper, but at the end of the day... A calorie is a calorie. The other big thing was about quality of life. Dementia sucks, a lot, as I'm sure you know. This is a drastic over simplification, but if you could choose between living ten more days eating only your favourite foods or a hundred days when each day you become more sick and less able to relate to your world... Well... I'd pick the ten days of pasta and ice cream.

But this only applies to my mum. I can't really speak for anyone else.
Damn, this hits home perfectly. Thank you and yes, agreed.

I hate to say, but the same thing happened with my mother in law. She had two falls on both her shoulders, broke one, and tore both rotator cuffs. She was in the hospital 7 weeks. She has been much worse and it has not improved and it’s been 3 months. Her dementia has gone off a cliff. She went from living alone with help to hospital to a nursing home and we might need to place her in long term care shortly. I’m really sorry I don’t have better news. They modified her meds a lot but nothing has helped :(
We experienced an issue that limited my grandpa's mobility and caused change in his usual routine at the beginning of summer. I don't want to be the bringer of bad news; however, it negatively affected the mental capability of my grandpa. He started going in loops in his conversation and being a silent version of himself. He was on the edge of depression (or maybe he was depressed) and the memory loss that comes with depression worsened his situation. 

We were told he would not get better, that this would be his current state and dementia would continue progressing as it was. With constant care and special therapy it can get better, but that is not a promise and it won't be as good as it was before. 

I am sorry you are going through with this.
Sadly, yes.  She will likely improve once she's off the meds but not to the level she was before the injury.

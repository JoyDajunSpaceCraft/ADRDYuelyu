I tried something like this with my Aunt. I used a baby monitor to talk to her. The disembodied voice terrified her. She thought I was dead.
While I don't know of any apps designed for exactly your needs - I think there are some for video chatting with your pets, and the dynamics seem the same. Maybe start there? And if you find something that works, please, share!
I just set up a tablet for my mother after a lot of research. My mother's dementia is not as advanced so she has been enjoying the weather channel, a news app, audiobooks, some very chill music for her anxiety, and Instagram has been an incredible hit.

You may want to consider something a bit more straightforward. Check out Oscar Senior. It is just under a dollar a month and has some *very* simplified apps for video calls and some other stuff. Bonus, you can control her device remotely.

Good luck!!
Thank you, that's a great idea.  I'll search around and see, and if I do I'll respond back to this thread!
Oh this looks great, I'll try this thanks!

If others aren't willing to come and help, then NO UPDATES.  If they want to come over and make dinner, mow the lawn, take him to the doctors, even just sit  and watch TV while you get a break, then fine, but if all they want to do this chat - no updates.

The last thing you need in this situation is free advice.
That sucks, I'm sorry. 

Some people have a real hard time figuring out how to act in these situations. Putting more stress on you instead of less is awful though.

I never tried one, but there are web sites made for caregivers to communicate with interested parties. Maybe it would be easier on you to do central updates once instead of the related interactions.

They can also be used to ask for help when you need it. I found one just by googling at https://lotsahelpinghands.com

Maybe it could help. Best wishes, I hope your Dad improves.
Sorry you are going through this, glioblastoma is aggressive and changes tend to happen pretty fast compared to many other cancers. You and your sister are going through a lot too. Please take care of yourself, and consider finding a support group, friend, or therapist to talk to. I wish you and your family the best.
Feel free to vent and rant.  We're here for you.

I have a similar experience with my mom.  I initially was spending all of my "free time" on the phone with her friends and extended family giving them updates, even though I didn't want to.  After a bit, I tasked my sister and Aunts with doing that, because they were not physically present all of the time.  Eventually, we told people that this would be an ongoing process and that no news was good news.  I told people to feel free to reach out whenever they wanted, but we weren't on their schedule, and it could take days or a couple of weeks before we truly got back to them.

Everyone just wants to hear that those they care about are doing well, but as caregivers we want to talk to people about anything other than our loved ones, since it consumes so much of our time.  It's a balance, and sometimes being more firm and telling people to back off is what you and your loved one need.  You have every right to tell people that you don't want to talk about the situation all the time.
Thank you for sharing, and I’m so sorry for this entire situation. 

My mother is battling stage 4 breast cancer, her second time fighting the disease. Being a caregiver is a full-time job, whether it’s physically taking care of them or just checking in to keep mental track of their appointments. No matter how old you are or experienced with caregiving, you’re still their child. It doesn’t get easier the more you do it like people expect.

If possible, lean on your sister for the emotional support, that what I’m doing with my other brother. Taking care of yourselves is step one in taking care of your father in the ways he needs. Don’t even afraid to cut people out who don’t “get it” or keep using you for information. If they truly cared, they would be there themselves to lend a hand.

Thinking of you during this very difficult time.
I feel this. Sending you hugs! My mom was diagnosed with glioblastoma in February of 2020. We share a home with my parents, my husband and my two kids. Watching her slowly decline has been the hardest. I’ve been dealing with so much anticipatory grief. Since I’m a SAHM I took her to all the doctor appointments. But I’m also everyone’s going to for information. My dad’s brain isn’t great either, so I’m left with talking with the doctors, as well. It’s all so hard, especially when no one remembers that their condition affects us, as well.

I’m here if you ever need a fellow ear to chat with!
He’s blessed to have you ✨♥️✨ as is your sister. Keep staying strong & know you have others absolutely rooting for you. If you’re open to it, would love an update of how you’re doing this week? Best wishes 🌻
I like this.  Show up or shut up. :)
There’s also one called CaringBridge that a friend of mine used - https://www.caringbridge.org/
Thank you!  We do have support too and am currently looking for a support group.
Thank you!  That is exactly it.  We basically have another full time job coordinating and taking over all of these responsibilities in additional to our families and day jobs.  I have started just referring people to the caring bridge site which is helpful.  

I think the part that is hardest right now is that they want to talk about his prognosis (not good) and such and discuss it like I’m not affected.  It’s rough to find that balance of being understanding of the people in his life that care and want to know with setting my own boundaries when they seem to disregard the emotional impact having those conversations can have.
Absolutely! I am a CNA and often, there is one kid, one person who is doing everything while everybody else is off living their carefree lives.  I think it's terrible, but we're not supposed to say anything.

I had a patient last year, a 93 year old, sweet woman who was dying.  I never saw her two sons until about a week before she passed. Terrible.
Thanks, I have been using that recently and that is helpful to give major updates.  Please are interesting though and want individual updates but I keep redirecting them back there.
I feel for you on this. My dad passed away from glioblastoma in June after a 3 year battle where my mom and I were his primary caregivers. I can’t tell you how much I wanted to punch people that asked “what stage is it?”. It’s freaking GBM, do your research, it’s a terrible prognosis regardless. Like, you’re basically asking how soon he’s going to die…some people meant well and wanted to prepare themselves but with others it felt like they needed to know out of their own curiosity/gossip. It just felt so insensitive. All I can tell you is that your dad’s care and your own mental health and sanity have to be priority over everyone else. You can’t help him if you’re not well. I ended up having a “rep” from each area of my dad’s life that I would update via text, or call if I felt like it, and then they would spread the word. Much less overwhelming than keeping up with everyone individually. I think people really just can’t get what caregiving for a terminally ill loved one is like unless they’re in it. The day to day shitshow is hard to relate to if you’ve never done it. Doing all of that while also grieving someone that is still here is a true mind F. 

I am so sorry you are going through this and am here if you need to vent. Wishing you and your family strength and peace ❤️
You don't necessarily know the reason behind it.  Not everyone is who they portray themselves in front of people who don't spend excessive time around them.
>You don't necessarily know the reason behind it.

Very true.  Our agency says "Don't go there".  It might be a Karma thing.  Still, I wonder...

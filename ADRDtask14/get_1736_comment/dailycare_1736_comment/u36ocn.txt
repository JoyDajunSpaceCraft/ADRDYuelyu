Yes.  Wish I had this 2 years ago.  üò™
YES. After my grandmother broke her hip and was discharged to post-surgery rehab, she was not given any pain medication for at least 48 hours despite bellowing in pain all day ‚Äúbecause she didn‚Äôt ask us for it‚Äù
Yes. I am fumbling my way toward a nervous breakdown.
Yes, thank you. Although a big part of my frustration has been with Mangled Hell Care and the 5,473 government forms (federal, state, county, city) and "mother-may-I?" foolishness. I know you guys get mad at them too, but anything you can do to help with that stuff would be greatly appreciated. 

Example: my PCP says to me "you need an in-home health aid *now* to help with your dementia-dx partner." I've been asking for help for her since Feb. 4th and am still no closer. Yes, I know private pay is an option. But we're having to private-pay for adult daycare, incontinence underwear, will need home upgrades & reshuffling, and I've just come off putting mom & dad in their graves.
Yes. This info would be invaluable. Thanks in advance.
Yes!  I wish this had been around when I was taking care of my grandfather.  I have a friend now whose husband was diagnosed two years ago.
Yes please.
Yes please!  This would be such a great resource.
Yes please!
Yes!
Yes!
YES omg
1000% YES!
Yes, very much so. I am just starting my journey with my father as his caretaker and learning about Dementia, and the medical care it will take in the future.

Done. Thank you for your work.
Hey, yes, I will. Sorry for the late reply but as you can imagine, I've been busy with work and caregiving.

Sorry, I had to laugh at this one.  Once we were stopped at a gas station in Detroit Michigan and a sus guy approached my father and offered him gold jewelry from inside his jacket.  My dad begged off.... but thought that his wife and daughters who were (rapidly locking the doors and rolling up the windows of the car) might be interested.

He also bought a lifetime supply of frozen meat from a truck outside of a Kinkos photocopy place.

And this was DECADES before the dementia started...
I do not have advice but "he just sent my amygdala to Hell and back" describes me so often; thank you for this phrase.
Hahaha, your dad sounds charming, I bet that was very anxiety provoking though!
This guy hung out our house until 3 am trying to sell us one of those meat subscription services.  They also tried to sell you a freezer for all the meat for $2000. 

We actually signed up but called and cancelled before the 3 day cancellation window was over.

One of my wife’s good friends signed up with the same company and years later when she was moving she sold us the same freezer for like $100.  We had it for a while but it didn’t auto defrost so really wasn’t that convenient to have.
I’ve got a photo of him standing in an Egyptian bazaar with USD fanned out in front of a money changer. He’s been a walking accident waiting to happen always. But he is lovely. Cherish that in your dad. He could be a meanie, like in other posts.
Your dad sounds a lot like my dad! Yes, you’re absolutely right

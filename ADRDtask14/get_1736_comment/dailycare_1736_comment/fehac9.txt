I'm going on 5 years with dementia. I take ambien  but tried some CBD gummies w THC. I was waking up throughout the night I felt drowsy all day too.
I don't know, hoping someone else comes in that knows more.

A few months ago, we started giving my grandmother Tylenol PM. She already had it and melatonin on hand and did have trouble sleeping. At an appointment with a pharmacist in January, we found out the PM ingredient in Tylenol PM is the same as in Benadryl. I had already learned Benadryl is bad for dementia. The pharmacist explained that the ingredient could make my grandmother sleep, but still be really confused and tired in the morning. We don't need that, so stopped it immediately.
We were told by doctor that some strong killers and cbd may cause more issues in day. 
She recommended a small and of melatonin. 
But start small and work up.  Like 2mg. Seems to successfully put her to sleep and she is not as drowsy in the day.  I think melatonin is a lot more natural than other options.
Talk to her primary care physician. Explain what's happening. He or she knows her medical history and more options than a bunch of us on the internet who have a paragraph on a screen and our own experiences to go on. Her safety is worth the time and trouble. Good luck!

What you describe are relatively minor memory problems, which may just be age-related, or caused by things like stress, medicine side effects or a medical condition not necessarily a dementia. However if you and others have noticed a change then it is best she gets herself checked out. There is a fair chance that your grandmother is aware of any changes in her cognitive abilities. I think I would try an honest chat, and establish her view first. Things like offering to go along to any check-up or assessment might help. 
If she is open to talking about these things then you can stress that early intervention and monitoring of any dementia can play a massive part in continuing to lead a full life. Although there are no cures, certain medications can slow the onset of symptoms. A diagnosis would also possibly open the door to help and support (in Britain there are Community Mental Health Teams and Memory Clinics, etc) and areas like Occupational Therapy can sometimes help. There are lots of ways you could help your grandmother maintain a good life. As your grandmother is a lawyer she probably has her affairs in order, but sometimes a diagnosis of dementia is a good time to review financial and legal decisions about the future.
 Finally of course, she may be told that there is no dementia present. Which if she is aware of recent memory issues, would be a relief to her as well as you.

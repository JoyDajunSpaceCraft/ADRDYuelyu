I'm so sorry for your loss. My dad currently has it.  It's starting to get bad.  

Contact your local Alzheimer's association. They provide a lot of great services for caregivers so you might be able to help them help others. 
Im so sorry for your loss. My grandfather had the disease and its truly terrible to witness. Im also a PhD student searching for an Alzheimers cure right now, and I can tell you that alz org is a great one to donate to, another person put the link in their comment. you can also donate to the National Institute for Neurological Disease and Stroke (NINDS) gift fund http://www.ninds.nih.gov/about_ninds/gift_fund.htm

the NINDS is a branch of the NIH which funds alzheimer's and other dementia research at universities across the US.
Sorry for your loss.
Please know that I will think and about you and your family and wish the strength you need to finish up this journey.
Sorry to hear of your loss. My mom (57) has early on set Alzheimer's and was diagnosed 4 years ago. Just the other day we had hospice out here to check on her. They gave her about 6 months. I still don't believe it and it will be tough when it happens. I'm not sure about any charity or volunteer deals. We've had a lot of friends who have helped us out tremendously and another friend who set up a fundraiser/auction to raise money for us. If you do find a way to volunteer that would be amazing because without the help we have received I don't know what would have happened.

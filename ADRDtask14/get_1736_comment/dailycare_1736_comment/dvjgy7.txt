I’m
Not sure exactly what you’re looking for, but I know there are some adaptive designs for people with Parkinson’s. That might be a good place to start. :)
How about a spork with a more concave shape and shorter tines?  Those tend to be wider.
Www.biosmedical.com sells something called a lift ware fork that might help you
Similar to what others have said - would this help? - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiVQcgmIi08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiVQcgmIi08)
Could you find a jeweler who could make one for him?  Check Etsy.
This set contains a slightly wider thing that could be considered a spork, but has a couple of other pieces with it:   [https://www.4mdmedical.com/keep-a-temp-dish-and-bowl-partitioned-dish-with-lid.html](https://www.4mdmedical.com/keep-a-temp-dish-and-bowl-partitioned-dish-with-lid.html) 

I have tremor myself but just eat with a spoon whenever possible.  Still need a fork for cutting meat, tho.
Pastry forks are quite wide or this: [https://www.amazon.com/RSVP-Fantastic-Blending-Stainless-Scrambled/dp/B011C4SVCG/ref=sr\_1\_5?keywords=pastry+fork&qid=1573681214&sr=8-5](https://www.amazon.com/RSVP-Fantastic-Blending-Stainless-Scrambled/dp/B011C4SVCG/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=pastry+fork&qid=1573681214&sr=8-5)
Thanks, he has tremors and his complaint is that food rolls off his fork. he thinks a salad fork being wider would help. The salad forks with our serviceware is just a bit narrower. So browsing Amazon and not seeing salad forks that are wide. google says salad forks are a tiny bit wider and I dont see how that will help my dad, so seeking a solution.
Thanks, hadnt thought of those, will have a look.
Ok will look, thank you. I'm not finding wide salad forks. Only thing has been a 'mashing spoon' which is 1.25" width compared to our regular forks 1 1/16" width. And related to the nice suggestion below. That actually looks like it would help. Will have to see if he can get it a bit less expensive tho.
yea, was looking at one ob biosmedical. It has a base and uses an attachment for either spoon or fork. Drawback is that its 250 bucks. The only fork wider than our forks is a mashing fork on amazon that 1.25" compared to 1 1/16" for ours. Going to see what the sproks look like. Will talk to him about one of these if I can find one a bit cheaper or maybe medicare?
Thank you
Or a store that sells vintage cutlery - salad forks in older cutlery designs can be wider.
Hmmm, now thats an idea. Will inquire. i had joked that on Tooltime Tim would have split a second fork and soldered them on each side lol. Sadly my dad thinks of a solution and he wont entertain any other. he thinks a salad fork will be xtra wide and solve his problem. he would have me drive him all over town in search of a wide fork, not going to happen. Thank you
Thanks, will have a look. I had at one time tried to give him a spoon but he says he has to have a small spoon cause the larger ones he cant get in his mouth.
Thanks, I looked at this, here is my confusion and quandary. he had made a fuss previously about getting narrow spoons, because he has fitting a normal tablespoon in his mouth. yet a wide fork is needed cause the food rolls off the regular fork. but, if the normal sppon is too wide then how is he going to use the wide fork? he has issues eating but I think this is all perception. So I will see if I can soothe his perception. Good idea but I think the two inches would be too wide. his perception is of a salad fork thats a bit wider, doesnt exist I think. I did find a mashing spoon at amazon thats a half inch longer and is 1.25" wide as opposed to the dinner fork which is 1 1/16" wide. I ordered him two and he will probably find fault with them but I tried.
Thank you again.
I mention Parkinson’s because many of the adaptive designs are weighted. Holding heavier objects can help decrease tremors. You might find an affordable option to try out, since wider forks might not exist.
Cheaper to have a woodworker make up 4 or 5 forks of varying widths, choose the one you want, use that as a prototype to make the new fork.
yes I saw the weighted forks, may go ahead and get one also and see if it helps. Thanks again.
Hmm, good idea, thank you

I hear ya dude. I've been a high level quadriplegic for almost 12 years and assist suicide is looking like my future. 

I'm super thankful that I have an actually gf and mother who take care of me everyday, but the thoughts of how much of a fucking burden I am on their lives is eating me alive. There's a lot of personal family drama my mom has to deal with that puts pressure on my gf that she doesn't need because of her high stressful job is just terrible. 

I'm with you. Only reason these people are alive is to create jobs and make money. It's fucking horrible. I'd hate to put my family and best friends through me leaving my life, but goddamn feeling worthless every time I wake up is slowly killing my brain. 

Edit: spelling

I think about this all the time and totally agree. Isn’t it worse to see your beloved family member disintegrate in front of you? How is it that we so easily euthanise animals but not people? 

I think it’s just as cruel to force someone to live a shell of a life, rather than let them die before they really suffer, as it is to end someone’s life prematurely/murder. 

Edit: *where euthanasia is illegal.
I think Hitler had a few thoughts on this one
Yep. Heroin overdose is a way to go.

Although 50 is a little early if you are healthy. On the other hand, maybe I think that only because I'm 41. Like, at 70 I would think "eh, it's not that bad as I thought it would be, I have plenty of gas left in the tank, maybe at 80"
Agreed, and I read one estimate of nursing homes being $5000 a month. All that money spent keeping a vegetable alive.
Comment confession. My Chinese horoscope once told me that Hitler was a famous person I would be compatible with. Other than being a Polish Jew of course.

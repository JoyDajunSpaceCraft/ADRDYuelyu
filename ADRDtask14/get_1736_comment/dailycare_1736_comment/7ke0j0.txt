You really can't help them.

I know I'm late. Let them have their tantrum. Eventually they will probably acclimatize. My in-laws were a little like this. FIL said he'd be dead in 2 years. I think he's got another 10. They don't like aging, but don't want to make the decisions to sign out with grace.
It is definitely hard to deal with the loss of independence at first.  My dad feels like he's in a prison (it's a really nice assisted living facility) 

Can your dad still see, and think and hear?  If he can still see and hear, a tablet device with Facebook / games / audio books / Netflix / Prime Video might make a good gift.  

The place where my dad is has a geriatric psychiatrist who comes around to do visits - maybe a few things as simple as fish oil pills could improve his mood.  Good luck, and I hope he's feeling better.
See if the local senior center has any activities he can participate in.

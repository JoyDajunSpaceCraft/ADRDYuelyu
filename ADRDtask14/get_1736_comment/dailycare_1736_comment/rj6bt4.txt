What helps me is to not keep a large supply. I often just buy a few snack sized packages so it’s not a bag of cookies in the pantry it’s my husband’s snacks. If I eat them they won’t be there at all when he wants them. It also allows for a wider variety as he seems to get tired of things quickly and wants a change.
Are there cookies he likes but you don’t? For example, any cookies with raisins in them, I would happily ignore in my house. Or peanut butter., yuk, etc. I’m sorry you’re going through this with your husband.
I am a stress eater and i hear you loud and clear. My mother, 81, who never gains weight, lives on 3 healthy meals and an endless supply of peanut butter cups, munchoes, mini snickers, and starlight mints. With the occasional ice cream. I had a pretty good summer and lost some weight but I've been backsliding since covid ramped up and I harsly get out.  I don't know what to do. I mean, I cant help myself and sooner or later i eat whatever it is, even if i don't like it.
You could get a cookie jar on a timer lock, which wouldn’t require him to memorize a password. Something like this: https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Safe-XL-Locking-Container/dp/B00UY0TQRE/ref=asc_df_B00UY0TQRE/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198090964233&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2609980839370622031&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9021483&hvtargid=pla-378978190524&psc=1
sustagen can be great to maintain nutrition. you can add whole milk and a banana rather than just water and it becomes more a delicious treat than a chore. my grandmother struggled to eat anything when her Alzheimer's advanced but with knowing she'd at least had sustagen at lunch it wasn't such a pressurised environment trying to get her to eat at night because we knew she'd had something substantial
Are there calorie rich snacks he likes that you don't? Keep some of those at home! :)

Also have him drink an Ensure at lunch daily to help keep him getting nutrients and calories.
Yes, that might work, but they're still a temptation.
Ha, no, I wish.  One food he loves is fresh grapes. I'm ok with them but I'm more likely to eat cookies.  I like all kinds of cookies, same as he does.  :(
I didn't know such a thing existed!  A little too expensive, plus this guy is always disappearing into the garage and emerging with weird tools so he would probably figure out a way to saw into it.  e.g. he comes into the house with a pair of pliers so he can get the cap of the milk jug off.  (low hand strength).  Ah, me.  Keep a sense of humor.
Thanks, I had not heard about that product before.
I just read you answer my first part in this thread so...
What if you get individually packaged snacks and put a note by them, to you, from you. Whatever words will work, "You don't need these, hubby does, we don't want him shrinking away!" Or whatever will cause you to pause and reassess the situation when feeling tempted?
What about a protein shake for him, like Ensure? That would at least get some more nutrients in him.
If only ... !
That's a good idea!  I would be unlikely to dip into that.

Look up “validation technique” for people with dementia. The main idea is you get to enjoy your relationship with them in THEIR reality, not yours. 
Depends I look after 9 people on a unit and one man always wants to leave and  I gently remind him of his memory loss and that he could get lost and its safer for him to be here and he understands and is ok till the next time he forgets. I've seen other people tell him he has dinner reservations here and he must stay and keep us company cause we would miss him.. he kinda doesn't go for it and argues about leaving more. Another resident is looking for her mom or her small kids and I made the mistake of telling her that her kids are all grown up and shes a gramma now and she started crying because she realized her mom had past, so now I  tell her that the kids are in school and her moms out grocery shopping and her face relaxes and she continues to putter in her room. So I think you have to try some different things to see how she reacts.
Go along with the ride, forcing a reality on them. That they do not know is pointless. It can also have negative reactions, cause them stress etc. 
I work in a nursing home at the dementia unit and was taught to go along with their reality. In that stage of dementia it is just not possible for them to understand that they're sick, why they're here.. it's difficult to deal with but it would cause them too much stress to try to convince them of the truth. Whenever they're engaging in behaviour caused by dementia, eg thinking something is there when it isn't, wanting to go home etc, it's best to be empathetic and gently distract them.
If there isn't a painting behind her, can you point and say you've already taken care of it for her?

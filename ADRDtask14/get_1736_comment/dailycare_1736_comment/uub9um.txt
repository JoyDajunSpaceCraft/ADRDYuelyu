I like to recommend these as we see a fair number of our memory care residents benefit from them.

I'm a chef so my personal gift will be a full beautiful dinner and cake but the rest of the family ids struggling soo much
Blankets, slippers, lotion, CDs or DVDs she can unwrap then you can put on to watch/listen together, sun catcher or stained glass type cling for the windows, yard decorations like bird feeders.

There are also bird feeders that attach directly to the window but that might be too intense depending on the type of dementia. (They might interpret it as getting attacked by birds or shadows.)
If she like cats, get her one of those robotic cats by ‚ÄúAgeless Innovation‚Äù it would be good company for her.
My Mum at that stage went through a lot of old photos - and because her memory from them was still good helped us name some people - we organized into albums for her. She also enjoys and can still crochet, so we get her gify certificates for wool/yarn she likes choosing the colors. 

Since trips to the hair and nail salon are too overwhelming for her, we found a nail technician and hairdresser that come to our home and give her a day of beauty every month or so. She very much enjoys Downton Abby and keeps reminding us that the new movie is out! So, we will take her to the movies and probably out to a dinner after. We had a sip & paint night in our community (an artist comes and for a nominal fee you get paints, brushes, a canvas, and instruction along with wine or soft drinks) and she had a grand time. She‚Äôs always been into the arts, though, so any time we can go for ceramics, pottery, long ago stained glass, painting, candle making, etc we ask her and sign up if she is interested. 

Happy birthday to your grandmum.
Just got my mom a mani/pedi gift card for her birthday. We‚Äôll go together, so she‚Äôll get her nails all trimmed and cleaned and will also feel like it‚Äôs a big experience, plus I‚Äôll be there to help as needed. She also got soft clothes that she could sleep in but that also look presentable, since getting her to change and go somewhere is a challenge.
Perhaps an [electronic picture frame](https://smile.amazon.com/NexFoto-Digital-Picture-Electronic-Grandparents/dp/B098K2RJB2/ref=sr_1_8?crid=38GYW7X7RNFXF&keywords=electronic%2Bpicture%2Bframe&qid=1653096281&smid=A1P5LVWOUXHU7&sprefix=electronic%2Bpict%2Caps%2C147&sr=8-8&th=1).  We loaded a mixture of old and new pictures on one for my dad.  My MIL, on the other hand, disliked it as any "clutter" distresses her.  She loves orchids because they bloom for a long time.
If there‚Äôs a window available, sun catchers/ stained glass pieces can be quite nice to look at. I have a crystal prism that makes rainbows when it catches light, and it‚Äôs very peaceful. Or wind chimes, or a bird feeder.
I got my dad an Oculus for Christmas to provide some form of entertainment.  It takes some set up, and needs adult accompaniment (through broadcasting to your phone) to talk him through the process of getting to something he wants to see/interact with, but once I figured it out it provided hours of a theme we could do together, and perhaps an hour a day of entertainment/travel/viewing/experiencing for him.
Lipstick.
My MIL has been thrilled with some Go Walk Sketchers slip-on shoes. They‚Äôre cushiony and she doesn‚Äôt have to tie them.
This is a passion of mine. I've spent hours digging through shifty websites to make a list that won't break the bank and is high quality. I do own this website.

Puzzles. There are some made for dementia patients on Amazon. Lots of different puzzle amounts. Bird feeders. Some attach to windows. Hanging baskets of flowers if there are places for her to see them.
Could go generic. Chocolates, socks, smellies, bouquet of flowers that kinda thing.
Music or dvds of music based films or similar. My grandad has memory issues and can‚Äôt follow along to a film but he can remember the music and is happy to watch the same music concert dvd over and over.
A cozy sweater, a pretty scarf, inexpensive but pretty costume jewelry, a photo frame of pictures from her childhood and young life to hang on a wall as she is more likely to be able to remember those times consistently, flowers, balloons, a card that sings to you when you open it, her favorite chocolates or other sweets
My dad liked  water paints and that stage. You can get them on Amazon too.

A doll or a stuffed animal. I gave my grandma a pillow pet at 90 of a bumble bee. She loved it, kept it in her bed until her death 4 years later. When she died, I took it back. Its special to me. Her face lit up and she giggled like a girl. I will never forget that!
So sorry your family is going through this. Below are some ideas that may help.

\-Digital frame loaded with favorite photos. Maybe photos of her too doing something fun and smiling-being happy. Maybe grandkids holding up a sign saying something like "love you Grandma", so she remembers all the good times. 

\-You mentioned she lost her ability to read. What about a gift card for Audible? She can listen to books. 

\-A clear toiletry bag to put all the important things that she uses on a daily basis and make things easy to find.[Here is an example of a bag she can use for daily items.](https://clear-handbags.com/products/basic-clear-handbag-clear-purse)

\-I believe they make fidget toys to help reduce anxiety and calm nerves that are associated with dementia. Not sure about this one. Here is an example I found [https://www.amazon.com/Tactile-Sensory-Cushion-Red-Alzheimers/dp/B07FBVHKDF/](https://www.amazon.com/Tactile-Sensory-Cushion-Red-Alzheimers/dp/B07FBVHKDF/)

\-A weighted blanket or even better a photo blanket...[Here is what I found online on Walmart](https://photos3.walmart.com/category/353-full-photo--designed-blankets?size=50x60%20woven%7C60x80%20woven&povid=Blankets+%7C+contentZone1+%7C+2019-02-26+%7C+1+%7C+WovenFabric)

Hope this helps.
Hey, hope you are good. I would recommend the omivista mobii. It will make the best gift u can give her. It will help her cognitive side. It‚Äôs a interactive projector, really cool piece of tech and been awarded the U.K. National Dementia Care Outstanding Product Award 2018.

Contact them and Ask for mr soorj, he will look after you
That looks great! She doesn't seem to be into music but you never know, that looks like an awesome simple device, Thank you
I bought my mom one. She can't figure out how to operate it but I flip it on now and then.  And sometimes when I show up I see staff has flipped it on.  Nice way to change her environment for a few hours.
Thank you so much for the suggestions! It's getting into winter here so some blankets would be nice. Definitely going with the stained glass suggestions that you and the other commenter provided! Thank you!
We were looking at that today! Thanks for your reply, looks like that's the strongest contender for her "Big present"
I bought mom the cat a few years back.  She hated it then.  Fast forward and it lives in the main room of her small group home. Everybody gets a kick out of it.  Kitty sits there silently most of the time but periodically mews or whatever when someone walks in.  Cracks everyone up.  Anyway, I'd score it a win even if it wasn't always a hit.
Thank you so much for the comment, I felt really warm  and happy reading your experience with your mum. I will look into a technician that can come over, I think she would like that. I don't know that she could handle a class, but my mother's birthday is 5 days after and she might enjoy that instead!
Thats a nice idea, she's so stressed out by salons, but buying her an experience would be a brilliant idea. And then I can get the mani pedi after LOL
That's a great idea - whole family is excited by that prospect. We will get her some stained glass decals if we can find them, thank you!
I have an oculus, and we tried it with her and she enjoyed it for the most part, but kept thinking everything was real. Do you have any specific apps you use? I'd love to try out some relaxing ones with her, with no "creatures" in them
Good one! She does like to feel beautiful ü•∞
This is amazing; thank you so much
Thank you, she loves puzzles but really struggles with them, I didn't know there were dementia specific ones, thank you so much!
Flowers is a great idea that I can't believe I didn't think of haha. Def gotta make a gift basket of her fave treats too. Thank you
You can load it with her favourites. I also recommend adding some relaxing spa type music. It really does aid in a sense of calmness within the environment and helps people to settle.
When it comes to blankets, my aunt with dementia prefers the pretty, really, really soft lightweight ones. She no longer has the strength to lift a large blanket or a heavy blanket. When we watch tv together, I often see her ‚Äúkneading‚Äù or rubbing the soft blanket - much like a cat does.  My aunt also likes a box of special chocolates, the bird feeder I put up and the double wind spinner I bought her.
My mother loves her dog I believe I got through Alzheimer‚Äôs website!
What about putting out a post on FB or your local social media to have someone come to the house and do her nails?
Would she let a hair stylist come into her home? We did that for my grandmother when she was on hospice and I think it made her feel better
I researched programs at all he time but found that it was hit or miss. Google earth might be the safest‚Äî she can tour known neighborhoods, and fine with thinking they‚Äôre real

I like this idea a lot.
I think this could be a good idea. I think first and foremost it would be incredibly therapeutic for you. If you treat them just as stories and apply no pressure to your father to remember (or even want to hear them) I feel it could be comforting for him to hear of things that could give him a safe feeling of home.  

I see much of the uncomfortableness that comes with this disease as simply not knowing what is happening.  Being told something familiar, even if you can't put your finger on why it is familiar must be of some comfort.  
Just checking to see if you had a chance to try this yet and how it went?
Many of my residents with  Alzheimer's have had little books their families had made with their  life story in it  but told  from a first person  perspective  (I was a pilot in  World War 2. I had  5 children). But I think  a 3rd person  perspective would  work too (Jim was born in Milwaukee  in 1936 to Linda and Gary).  Dad might  not even realize the  story  is about  him  but it is a way to hold on to what great things he accomplished in his life.  And also will help him to share his story with others.

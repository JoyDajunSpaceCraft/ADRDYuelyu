Just give it a few days.  He will fixate in something different.   I’m going through the same thing with my dad.  Almost daily it’s something new that he gets fixated on and consistently worries about.
I am copying an article you might find helpful. The short of it is, you can't. My mom has some severe delusions that involve hearing and seeing things, she stays focused on the same general things, trying to tell her it is not real makes it worse. I try to not confirm, but not deny, her claims and move the conversation. For instance in the case you describe with your Dad, I'd probably say something like, "That doesn't sound nice, but I am sure you don't need to worry about that, Dad. How did \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ go today?" - and when he inevitably repeats, "Yes, I heard you, but I think you don't need to concern yourself with that, let's talk about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_." The article may be more helpful than my 2 cents. Good luck.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5977418/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5977418/)
Hi, thanks for your reply - this particular memory has been in his head around 10 months, even after hours of talking and comforting him, he rings me up often hours later.

We are even considering hypnotherapy.
Thank you! sorry forgot to check my throwaway :)
How do you think a fib would work?  Tell him you had the old friends phone number blocked and he will not be getting any more of these calls.

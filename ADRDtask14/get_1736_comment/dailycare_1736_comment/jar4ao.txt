There is vast array of emotional, thought-related and behavioral responses to loved ones dieing or getting issues. Numbness or indifference could be simply returned to being defence reaction or maybe just how your mind relates to things.

You can't pick the one you want and it is not maybe even beneficial to anyone. Go on and do what you believe to be Best.
Life isn't easy, and it's strange.  For me as you get older unfortunately you get used to people passing.  Some impact you more than others and you become surprised how some don't affect you as much as you think they should or would. My father passed away 5 years ago. My parents divorced when I was 7. While I was growing up as a kid we visited him once a year for a couple of years but after that it was relegated to phone calls on birth days, fathers day and christmas.  Even though he lived only 2 hrs away from us we didn't see each other very often.  

I arranged his funeral when he died, when the priest asked me for the list of people to speak at his funeral - I really tried to think of anything I could say about the man but he had been out my life most of my life and really didn't know him. Instead his step-son delivered the eulogy and I glad I didn't go up there because it was obvious he got to know my father better than I did and it would of been panful to every one there to put on display my fathers shortfalls. My mother and siblings were angry at the kid which I didn't understand, my father came into his life not the other way around. I hugged the kid after the funeral as he felt my fathers death more than I did, all I did was shed a tear or two at the funeral.  

I've always been close with my mother and see her regular ( who now has dementia) but her cat  passed away a year before my dad. A great cat that loved everyone and was entertaining. That cat's death affected me more than my fathers.  

Life is weird, don't be too hard on yourself for not feeling what you think you should be.

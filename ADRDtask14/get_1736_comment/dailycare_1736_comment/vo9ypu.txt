You might look at teleCalm, which specializes in phone service for seniors with dementia. Their solution prevents scam calls, repeat dialing and late-night calling issues as well as other phone related problems - https://youtu.be/h1Tu-Nv9_10
I just turned the ringer off on my mother's phone.
If you are open to a touch screen, Raz Mobility was great for my dad until he forgot how to use phones.

My mom blocks calls from unknown numbers.  Callers can still leave a voicemail message, but calls from fraudsters don't ring through.

We just turned on an old phone for me to use while home and got 25 calls from robodialers yesterday alone.  I don't know why no one in government has cracked down on this.  People are being seriously scammed.  Someone needs to put an end to it.
Iphones have a “do not disturb” feature which limits calls to contacts only.
Fuck I hate these people, because people with dementia are exactly who they hope answers the phone so they can easily steal from them.

Lowest of the low human beings, and wish them all to hell. 

I'm the live in caregiver for my mother and these parasites call all the time.  So I hate them with a passion.  I use to pick up, and troll them or *vent*.  But stop that now since it's only adding fuel to the fire and instead don't answer at all anymore, and check messages instead unless I recognize the caller ID.

Wish I had known about that phone a few years ago
Take his cards away, give him some of the ones that come in the mail as advertisements.

I thoroughly recommend TeleCalm, it has been great at limiting calls to (and from) my mom.
OP mentions elsewhere that he's stubbornly attached to flip phones.  A man after my own heart.
Yeah I don't think there's any other way. We had to cancel all our dad's cards.

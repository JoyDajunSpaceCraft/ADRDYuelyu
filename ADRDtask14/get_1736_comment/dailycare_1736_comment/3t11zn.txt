You may want to look for kids phones.[Migo](http://www.lg.com/us/support-mobile/lg-LGVX1000) is the best known phone for kids.


I installed the Android app [Big Launcher](https://biglauncher.com), paid version ($10). You can experiment plenty with the demo version, and for some folks the demo version  does the trick, but the paid version allows much more customization. It's not perfect...there's a lot more I wish it could/would do/customize, but it's still pretty amazing.

 I envy you, in being able to start implementing solutions while your stepmom is still fairly functional. My granddad, 94 (& grandmother nearing 95, and I guess my mom for that matter) were in denial about my grandmother's progressing dementia, and it took a broken hip & hospitalization to get it diagnosed and "treated." Even after that, he expected her to come home and carry on as before, but it was a disaster, and now she's in a nursing home, and he's at home but visiting most days. He says over and over that he's not cut out for this...he was a sergeant in the army (WWII) and is used to giving orders and moving quickly, not being patient, not trying to "interpret" or troubleshoot and not interested in any namby-pamby/touchy-feely solutions. 

I have to admit that the phone is still not in use, but in my case it's because the very concept of a cell phone is foreign to my grandmother (even though my granddad has had a flip phone for years), never mind one with a touch/swipe screen. She's gotten the hang of Big Launcher itself, but the steps of pushing a button and,swiping to start, swiping to answer (to add insult to injury, the phone I bought has a picky swipe screen and if she swipes in the wrong direction she ends up in the wrong place), tapping instead of pressing, and not wrapping her fingers onto the screen...(I recently bought a case that helps with the last problem, and I'm going to try outlining the "Back" button with nailpolish...). 

If anyone knows of an Android phone that doesn't require swiping... Or of a  normal-looking phone that can be plugged into/powered by a cell phone... (Say, one of those large-button corded phones where numbers have been replaced by photos/names, but connected to a cellphone instead of a wall jack... They've figured out how to connect keyboards, mice, game controllers to cell phones, so why not a telephone-shaped phone?

Anyway, hateboss, I hope that Big Launcher is a solution that works for you/your stepmom. 
Thanks a lot for your reply! We looked at the Jitterbug but it's still too much for her. She's at the point where dialing a number is easily confusing to her so programmable buttons are a must, but too many and she forgets which is which. Even 4 is a stretch, we had to get a phone at home with 2 large buttons, one to call my dad's mobile and the other to call his cell. This should be perfect.

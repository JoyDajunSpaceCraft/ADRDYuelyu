Will she remember? Or is it something that you will be telling her over and over? Maybe wait until you are showing so that she has a visual cue. Otherwise, you may be causing yourself more frustration if you have to keep breaking the news.
Having a sense of Purpose can be huge motivator and extender of abilities.  

Take some time to think of tasks she is able to help with NOW.  (Family History documentation for the child -- and names on photos).  and tasks for when the baby is young.  Does she knit or crochet? a baby blanket might be a very special momento.  My grandmother with dementia always got each child their first stuffed animal -- and it was a special choice.

Do NOT give her tasks like baby-sitting because most of us have a problem with distractions and focus, along with our brain goes empty when something unusual happens.
I think she will remember. That’s actually a reason TO tell her NOW. Before she might not. This is the saddest. It feels like I’ll be sad forever.

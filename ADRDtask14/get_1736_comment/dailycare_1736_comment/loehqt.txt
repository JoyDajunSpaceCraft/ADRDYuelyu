I like that you can print them!  Using family member names and old events could help spark memories as well.
This is so cool! My mother has always loved crossword puzzles
This is great! I will try to implement it with my client. The descriptions for the sample are def too hard but Iâ€™ll make my own. Thanks for this!!!
absolutely wonderful that she enjoyed that type of thing; some of us do ... and some dont (including me, LOL)
Such a great idea!
Years ago, I used to create word search puzzles for work using a similar site. I imagine it's still out there somewhere in the wilds of the internet.
Very nice!  I just spent too long thinking of a good puzzle for my grandma.  I was having difficulty at first getting it to fit all the words in, and then I realized the program won't match up capital letters and lowercase letters of the same type.  But it's helpful to get the program to make a different pattern.  Just capitalize one of the letters that link to get a new pattern with them not linked.
Exactly! Thank you for the comment! Also, figuring out the meaning of the clues has been fun and challenging for her. For example I used the word "fireplace" and gave the clue "A place in the home that radiates heat, uses natural gas, and people sometimes gather around it" and she was so excited to figure it out.

There are a lot of great sites out there.
I had a chance to search for it. I think it was this site:

The flippity site looks pretty cool, though.
This is awesome Ronin!  Thank you!!!

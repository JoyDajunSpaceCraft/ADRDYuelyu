We are in the process and we arr just going to tell gpa that they newd to monitor his heart for a little while. It sucks to lie but sometimes a little white lies the best way to go with dementia patients.
We just had to do this with my grandma, she was only diagnosed earlier this year but her dementia has worsened very quickly since then to the point where me and my mum could no longer care for her. We knew she wouldn’t take it well so we decided to tell her it would only be a temporary stay at the care home, two weeks. She’s been there almost a month now and during my mums last visit my grandma said she’d been living there for over a year. She still has her bad days and gets tearful when family visit but she’s settled in a lot better than we thought she would. 

To be honest I feel like my grandma has more freedom at the home than she ever did when she lived with us. When she lived at home spent all her time in her room and didn’t really have anyone to socialise with and was very depressed, whereas now she’s surrounded by others her own age and gets along really well with the carers. She’s safe and has all the care she needs to live out the rest of her life as peacefully as she can. I hope this helps and I’m sorry your having to go through this.
I agree.  I told my dad they had to do some work on his home.

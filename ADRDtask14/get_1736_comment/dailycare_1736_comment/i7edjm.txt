There are many different things needed to diagnose someone with dementia. It's not simply "forgetting" something. If you're worried, you can take her to her doctor or go with her to her next appointment, though I suggest reading up on dementia and it's symptoms beforehand. Sometimes we don't completely hear someone when in conversation and a detail slips.
Thank you

I am not sure if this will be helpful, but for my grandmother my dad asks [these exact questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hRBPrfDQVI) to see if her condition has gotten worse. We are not professionals in any shape or form, but these questions have definitely helped us in assessing her. 
Thanks! This is the kind of thing I was looking for actually. I just had to confirm that these kind of things are out there, if that makes sense?
There is. Search "dementia patient assessment" and try to use advice from authentic sources like: www.alz.org. 

Also, just as an fyi, not all dementias get worse with time. Some people do have good and bad days, like patients diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia, so if that's what your character is going through, make sure you do a bit more research on that too as some of the symptoms between the aforementioned diseases are quite different and sometimes even polar opposite.
Many thanks! I appreciate it.

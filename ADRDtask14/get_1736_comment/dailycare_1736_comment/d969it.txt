Rerouting all your calls to your cell is a great idea! We did that with my grandma in law, pretty much for the same reason. She was still able to make calls though and we left a sheet with friends and families numbers beside the phone. She needed help to use it though so it was usually an activity that her visitors could help her with.
Hey, is there a way to let "certain" numbers through? My Mom is going nuts this afternoon. Scammers keep calling but of course she doesn't think they are, they're checking to see she's home to come get her, they're this, they're that... the only problem with completely re-routing calls is she has family and friends that do call to drop by, or take her out for lunch etc., and would want her to get those. If anyone knows, would be grateful for the the answer.
I'm in Canada, so there wasn't really anything like that here. (At least that we could find at the time) But I think I remember seeing a TMobile plan or something that would only ring if certain numbers were calling. I don't know if it exists anymore though.
It depends on your phone and carrier. I'm using Comcast for a landline and you can block all or block up to 25 numbers total. Either or. We also use a free service to block spammers ([nomorobo.com](https://nomorobo.com)).

Cell phones (at least my iPhone) has the ability to block everyone except your Favorite contacts or your address book.
I kinda figured. It's a land line. She has a cell but was never very good at it and now forgets how to make a call on it at all most days. Blocking 25 numbers won't get rid of all the random spam calls they get on the landline. She really only can use land line handset these days, and struggles with that sometimes.

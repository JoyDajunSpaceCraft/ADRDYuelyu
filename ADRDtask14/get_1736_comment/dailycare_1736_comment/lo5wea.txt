I understand where you're coming from, and I admire your desire to keep up with your coworkers.  I will admit though, that I actually like the fact that you're slower than the other workers there.  

People with dementia aren't just people who forget things, **far to often, they are people who are forgotten!**  I think that the fact that you end up spending more time with them is a **good** thing.

I'm sorry that I'm not able to give you the answer that you want in regards to speed, but let me say "Thank You" for the care that you give the residents! You sound like a wonderful person, and a perfect employee!
You sound like a good-hearted person who cares about your charges. It's hard to hear 15 minutes is allocated for parts of care. On one hand it's understandable that a place has to be efficient. On the other hand it's sad that there has to be a bottom line all the way until the end of life. My aunt is in a board and care right now. The guy who showed me various places as I was looking for one, told me that in some of the nicest most expensive resort-like assisted living facilities, bedridden people needing skilled nursing sometimes lay in their pee for over 8 hours and that he would only put his relatives in a smaller board and care if possible. That 15 minutes from you is solid gold and I hope you continue to find ways of fitting compassion into the procedures.
Its just upsetting how coworkers will tell me how to do certain residents and how to "get out quickly", mostly about the residents who are very chatty and just need that extra 5 minutes to sit and chat with them. Its a tough situation, i cant seem to find the right balance of chat and work, that quick chat can be the difference between them having a good day or not but can also push for time, making me late and then coworkers being angry that im not done at the same time as them. Theres no "break" as in, the time we get for tasks is the bare minimum so its very rare we will finish what we are doing then have a little time to go round checking and catching up with residents. Getting them ready, for day or sleep, seems to be the only one on one time we get with them so, of course, they want to talk! They cant have "decent" conversations with the other residents as theyre all on different levels of "stability" so the staff are the only people they can really talk to ): definitely thinking of getting a job going to peoples houses as i got into this work to help the people. Either their mental health or just day to day tasks, at least with home visits there is that time to focus on one person and meet all their needs.

I really do try my best to give them as much freedom and independence as possible, i do not see them as a paycheck or a task that needs to be completed as fast as possible. Its just so hard to adhere to the house rules and schedule and provide the right person centered care ):

Also thank you, it really does mean a lot! Not enough carers are given the appreciation they deserve! (Not trying to sound entitled haha its just a hard job and the hard work is often overlooked sadly)
This!! Definitely look into smallers homes, not to say bigger homes lack in quality of care, but theres more time to give the right care for each residents needs. Some just want to get washed and dressed and go about their day,  yet others want to talk, to know who you are. I try thinking of myself in their position, waking up in a room you may have forgotten about only to then be undressed and washed by someone who youve completely forgotten. A few minutes to explain who you are, what youre doing, even where they are will build that little bit of trust to make them comfortable and happy for you to then undress and wash them and gives them a good start to the day.
Smaller homes definitely are the right move, more frequent pad checks, no rush which adds stress to you and residents and just a more relaxed, homely feel. I hope your aunt is doing well, must be really difficult during these times as visits have been stopped, im guessing in her home too. Lets hope this covid bs starts easing up, visiting someone in a home makes their day more than anyone would think!
If only there were more people just like you in this world.  If I ran or owned a care facility, I'd do everything in my power to hire people just like you.

Never let anything or anyone dampen your enthusiasm, kindness, and wonderful heart!
> You sound like a good-hearted person

Look at that unsolicited, independent assessment of your qualities. Doesn't get more real than that.
Sadly care jobs are always going and very easy to get, a lot of people do just do it for the money ): just hoping everyone who is a giving person and wants a job in care actually go for it, a lot of these homes are the final destinations for a lot of residents, they deserve to be cared for to the fullest in their final stretchðŸ’ž
> If only there were more people just like you in this world.

Haha look at this stuff, this is you xmcphe! Look at that respect!!!!!

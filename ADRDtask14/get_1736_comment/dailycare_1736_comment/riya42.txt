I’m trying to ask Mom to do more things for me as she’s been feeling like she’s useless. So when she offered to bring me a drink from the kitchen while she was getting hers, I asked her a glass of water. She asked if a bottle of water would work, and I said sure. 

It was a bottle of undyed hummingbird nectar.
You know how if you are a troublemaking teenager, the adults around you tell you that someday you will have a kid that will put you through the same stress? Well I've decided you just become a caregiver for your parents instead.
Yesterday we received a Christmas card from an elderly interstate relative who is also on the dementia slide - the envelope was addressed correctly, in her handwriting, to both of us, but when we opened the card, it is blank of any handwriting.  My mum, it didn't seem to even really register with her - she wanted to look at the picture on the front of the card again, and the addressed envelope, said "yes, that's us alright, it's her handwriting!" - didn't remark upon or say anything about the totally blank card, as if it was completely normal.  Wondered about the sweet birds depicted on the front of the card, if their little feet got cold in the snow.
My lovely partner of ~25 years, who seems clearly headed down this path (why I'm here): in response to orientation question "what month is it?", having just admired the doc's office Christmas decorations: "January??"
lmao i know the feeling. its the equivalent of a doc seeing someone with a gunshot wound and saying "well it looks like they've been injured"

thanks doc, your truly are doing impossible things lol
I’m late this week! My sister was over at my parents today helping them clean. While she was cleaning the bathroom, my mom kept trying to take the hairbrush. My sister kept asking her why and each time the answer was the same. “We have a lot of people coming in and they will try to steal it!” 
Except the people coming in are my kids, husband and I… and the last thing we’d do is even think about the hairbrush.
My mother was complaining since October why we don't have a Christmas tree, like there was one every year. Every day I got this question, multiple times. Seriously, it was like, I woke her up in the middle in the night to go to the toilet and the first thing she said "where is the Christmas tree".

Lo and behold the day had come, and we bought the Christmas trees for the family. My mother got a mini tree which we set up in her living room yesterday, which she can see from the bed.

It worked, no more stupid Christmas tree questions and when I brought her to bed today I couldn't believe what she was telling me >!"Can you please wake me up tonight for new years eve celebration" Good times ahead, sometimes I think she's trolling me !<

Other than that. My mother has her harmless* "conspiracy theories". When these theories get confronted she agrees in front of everyone that this is nonsense, but then again, when we're alone, she's like the salesman from sesame street, "sshh...come over here, I have something to [sale] tell you".

Her favorite one is, that my brother in law has an affair with their housemaid and is living separated from my sister for 3 years. To be honest this pisses me off, for all the effort and hardship he has to go through too, but this is another story.

A few weeks ago, when I wanted to bring her to bed we had this conversation.

Me: "It's bedtime, let me bring you"

She: "Did you bring the other one to bed too?"

Me: "Who?"

She: "The big one, the housemaid"

So here we go, now I have an affair with the housemaid and every time she visits I get lectured not to engage in certain activities. It's downright stupid but for me hilarious, especially when we get into a heated discussion about it and she's giggling like a wrinkled baby troll. Ahh... good times, in bad times.

*I wrote harmless, but I know stuff like this can and will hurt a lot of people. Fortunately these theories are kind of harmless and we all can (to a certain degree) accept them with humor.
Yesterday, I had a caregiver come over. My husband wanders in and asks if I need to put his patch on. I said “No, I do that every night”. 

The caregiver asks what the patch is for. “His memory” I replied. We both laughed.

He didn't eat breakfast this morning because he didn't know how many pairs of underwear he has. He says. 

"I was trying to get ahold of someone, but you have to have two pairs of pants to do that."

He just tried to screw the lid on his water bottle upside down. Y'know, with the foot long straw sticking straight up in the air.

And he keeps somehow taking apart the piece that goes in your mouth.  

"My water bottle doesn't work." And then I have to fix it.
My mom's handwriting is sometimes absolutely miniscule!  Like 6pt font at best.   
My sister and I sit with her while she writes out her checks which has been fine.  We hide the checkbook otherwise, but she was a bookkeeper so she likes the routine of doing this. 

But we let her address the envelopes, and I couldn't even read the address even with my cheaters on!!

I don't know know how is possible to even write that small. How could she even see it??
Lol there was an attempt
But I was a good teenager, no fair! 😭😡

I did have a tendency to wander off as a small child though, maybe it's karma for that 🤔
Aww that's adorable, her wondering if the birdies feet got cold.
To be fair, if that were my office, any month would probably be a legitimate answer. Well, maybe not November. I might get around to taking them down in November.
Ah, a fellow "keep *decorations (damn you auto correct) up until February" type, I see. 😅
Exactly! 😂 Your powers of deduction are truly beyond belief...
Don't you know it's a rare Maltease hairbrush? 🤣
Man, that housemaid is a busy gal! 🤣
Well I know I won't talk to anyone who isn't at least triple-bagging their nethers. 🤣
I have a photo of the Christmas tree still up in April. Only a few little bird decorations clinging to the dry branches, LOL.
Nicely played!
I'm sure as a young father he ran around the entire house opening and closing drawers, slamming closet doors, counting underwear before throwing himself into a chair at the breakfast table. (j/k)
Tenacious birds! My favorite kind.
This is a hilarious mental image

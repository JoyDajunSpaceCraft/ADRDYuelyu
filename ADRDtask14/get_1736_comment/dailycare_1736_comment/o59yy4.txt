In the hospital they always dosed my dad up with ativan until they gave enough to move up to haldol. Basically it's a patch, to put him to sleep and get out of their hair. For a daily medication I can't tell you what might help unfortunately. I'd recommend getting new doctors if his treatment isn't what you want. The whole healthcare system is fucked and there isnt a lot of help. (At least in Florida)

Follow a Mediterranean/"DASH" diet specifically (being at a healthy BMI decreases so many health issues; heart disease has been found in 80% of patients in autopsies), get regular sleep and go to bed at regular times, exercise, don't smoke, don't abuse alcohol, avoid any sort of contact sports/activity that have a significant risk of concussion, avoid driving at night, challenge your brain by trying to new language. Stay social! Age and genetics cannot be changed, so try not to focus about those :) Alz.org is a great resource! https://www.alz.org/

Your CD idea is an excellent one.  Most dementia sufferers come and go.  She may recognize you one minute and mistake you for someone else the next.  The best way to handle it is to just try to be with them in their world.  It's important to help them feel loved and secure.  I think you'll find that interacting with them is linear enough to worry about maintaining a false persona.  Listen to the music with her, hold her hand and talk to her about your life.  If she wants to talk, listen.  Don't try to correct her if she is wrong.  They have to live very much in the moment, so just try to make the moments as pleasant as possible.  If she does seem to not recognize you and be afraid, retreat for a few minutes.  It's hard, I know.  
Alude that you've known each other for years, but don't specify relationship if she doesn't seem to remember she has grandchildren. I'd go with that you're a dear friend. That way you're able to share affection without feeling awkward about lying about being her son etc.
If she talks about going home, redirect her by asking about something unrelated like her past. I often say, "we'll go after dinner, it'll be a bit of a trip. Did you travel a lot? Where to" or "I think the plan was to not go out just yet. While we wait why don't we listen to some music?" and bring out your cd. Remember, simple phrases, try to stick with more yes/no questions than open-ended (a good mixture to help the conversation flowing, adjust as your grandma needs.) You're doing a good thing by visiting, good luck.

 I can't even take the piss J. It sounds hard but you're doing the right thing and looking out for how to be a good grandson as sad as the situation is.

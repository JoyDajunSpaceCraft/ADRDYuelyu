At my mum's care home, if you can send someone to tip off staff that you're planning on heading out shortly, they'll send someone to distract her so you can step away without the fuss. Goodbyes almost never happen, but because they don't mum has an easier time. So... Maybe see if you can loop in the staff!
We just recently put my MIL in a memory unit. The staff there suggests just kinda waiting until he/she is engaged in a conversation or activity and just split without all the goodbyes and stuff. It feels weird to us but it’s better for all in the long run.
I would say that I'm going to the bathroom and I'll be back soon.
I'll check with the staff if they can do something similar for us, thanks!
Thanks, this may be a little difficult because if we're there he engages with us, but I may try if he gets distracted with something or someone else. Thank you for the input!
This could work better than saying I'm going away, thanks
Works for me too! I tell my Grandma I'm off to the toilet, or my Mum will says she's just going to the shop.

In either case, she's fine to let us go then soon forgets and gets distracted
Every person is different. My MIL is far enough along where she doesn’t ask questions about who, where, etc. So even if we do say we’re leaving she just says “ok.” I wonder if you could pretend you’re going to drop something off in his room or at the nurses station, if that would be enough for a quick get away? I feel terrible even saying it like that, but just something else to try. Often the staff at these facilities know the person well enough to offer advice. Also maybe you could see if they would be willing to engage him long enough to slip away. Best of luck to you. I hope you find something that works for your family.

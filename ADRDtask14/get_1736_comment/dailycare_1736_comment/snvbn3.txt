Meals -- any favourite / customary foods?  Especially breakfast.

This is something facilities sometimes ask, knowing it makes a difference to newcomers to see familiar food instead of totally strange offerings (on top of all else).

Sigh!  After a week or two, he'll be getting the same old slop everyone else gets.
Snacks, a lot of them!  And gifts abs visits as much as possible.  A lot of hugs for him and for you.
My mother was first moved to a large retirement complex with wide halls and lots of space. It confused her worse and she kept getting lost. We moved her to a smaller apartment with less hall space etc. It helped immensely. She's still upset that she isn't home and she insists that she's going to buy another car and drive again but she's less confused than she was with a "too spacious" facility. There's nothing you can really do to ease his fear (and yes he is afraid) except be there. We don't argue with Mom because it just doesn't work and it upsets her further. Remember that when it gets to that point they've lost everything and now they are losing their memories.

I think it’s ok to leave the tv on if she’s watching it.  Screen time is bad for development, but I assume your mom has advanced dementia and will not recover from that. 

My grandma likes stuffed animals and her current roommate has a life-like stuffed cat that purrs and meows. My grandma loves that cat and I’ll probably get her one. 

I’ve also heard some dementia patients like baby dolls, but my grandma never was much of a kid person, she seems to enjoy animals much more.
If she was big on housework, perhaps simple laundry tasks?  We found balling socks and folding cleaning cloths was a good distraction. We had a hamper full of white tube socks that we would just leave out, grandma would see it and immediately recognize that it was laundry time. We also had a stack of multicoloured microfibre cloths for cleaning that she could fold and sort by colour. Sometimes these tasks would frustrate her (she’d often ball 3 socks together or roll the cloths up like cigars instead of folding) but they were a good distraction that made her feel useful.
Coloring books? If she's not too shaky, you can find coloring books of all levels with more fine lines/imagery or larger lined images like for younger kids. There's so many fun ones that are nature based, or animals, or fairytale scenes, floral designs, so so many. 

It's something I used to get for my terminally ill friend who was deteriorating as well as a family member with dementia.   
Colored pencils or crayons are easy to use and they won't make much of a mess at all.  Put some music on in the background or TV like jeopardy or the price is right, and you've got a double distraction. They can take a break and look up or listen to what's on/playing and resume coloring whenever. 

Does she knit at all? That's another good one to reintroduce even if it's been a long time.  

Like another mentioned, leaving out laundry is great.  Put everyone's socks in a laundry basket and let her pair them up, or fold hand towels, etc.  It can make her feel like she's helping and being productive. 

Basic word search puzzles can be good. If those are too much these days, a work book for preschoolers/kindergarten prep may be better.  There's things like a set of 6 or 8 items/animals and it will say "circle all the things that start with a C" or a scene with a caterpillar, worm, and three butterflies and it will say something like "find the 3 butterflies  and color them purple."    It's simple enough to follow and just enough to be mildly stimulating for the brain.   It's not meant to be insulting or perceived that they're not smart (if they comment on it like that) it's just an easy way to keep their mind active and healthy.

I have heard of some who give their loved ones things to sort:  buttons, beads.  Sort by color or size.
Can you get her to do qigong ie oversimplified very soft tai chi?

After tonight's stupid bedtime (we have good ones too) experience* I will try the stuffed animals. Maybe it's too early, but how will I know if I do not try.

*TV got a little bit harder for a few days, as she sunk the remote and telephone in her water glass. I was angry first, but ~30 minutes later I can almost laugh about it:)
I was thinking about this in the past. I actually gave her a few items from the clothing line like a month ago, but it wasn't much, like two or three pieces.
I asked if she could do it and she said yes.

Most of the time there are only small batches of laundry, so I had forgotten about it and continued to do it myself.

I will not only keep this in mind, but will let her do everything from now on and see how it goes.

Thank you.
Something in me makes me reject coloring books, like admitting and accepting the fact she is indeed a 82 year 4 year old woman. On the other hand I was browsing amazon for stuffed animals an hour ago...

> Put some music on in the background or TV like jeopardy or the price is right, and you've got a double distraction. They can take a break and look up or listen to what's on/playing and resume coloring whenever.

What I take from all of you saying is that i.e. TV as a distraction is not necessarily bad, at least in later stages of dementia.
I noticed what you're saying, when she was folding something. The looking up thing. OT: I felt the Olympics were great for her and she was sometimes telling me about stuff that was going on.

> Does she knit at all? That's another good one to reintroduce even if it's been a long time.

She used decades ago. Eyes are bad and hands sometimes shake a little (Parkinson), but I might give crocheting (?) a try and if this doesn't work, she may sort or (un)ravel the yarn:)

Thinking about it I realize and this is probably making everything a bit harder in my mothers case - She didn't really have any hobbies in her life. Meeting people, talking for hours on the phone, visiting people, hosting coffee parties and doing the household. People, relationships, what was happening in other peoples life were her "hobbies", so not really something one can craft some busywork out of (besides the household).

Thank you.
> I want to second what another poster said about doing housework chores- that is a great option for her. Folding laundry, asking her to "polish" items, dust items, wiping the table down. Any repetitive but purposeful task will be great for her.

She did the laundry folding today, and I can confirm it worked out very well. Some frustration for larger parts everyone would struggle (a bit) with if you're sitting, where she complained that some pieces are hard to do, but she was occupied for like 4 hours, with large breaks, where she watched TV.

> Are there any TV shows or movies from her childhood that she likes?

I gathered that some specific quiz shows ("The Chase") are what she favours. As said before the olympics were great.
Overall I cannot really control the content with our local TV offerings or extreme technical measures that aren't worth it in my opinion. 90% of technical solution to a problem have failed or complicated things in the end:)

> I also urge you to engage her senses! Music is big in dementia care for many reasons, but it is a fantastic sensory tool to use.

She likes classic and at times singing along it:) I used youtube on the TV for it. But there is only so much good classic content, reviewing (not to add like a 3 minute extract, 240p on 4k etc.) all the pieces building playlists, which I didn't do in the end, made always the same videos pop up in the end and so on. So I didn't followed up on this. But, I will get back to this, this time differently. With a streaming radio, so other people can curate the content and that hopefully comes with a very simple remote (on/off).

> Explore aromatherapy if you can, there are different essential oils that have been studied to assist with dementia care (oils for promoting appetite, calming, sleep patterns, etc). Using the oils in conjunction with music from her era will provide a relaxing environment for her.

I will read up on this. Never thought of this.

Thank you:)
We bought socks and cloths just for her to use as busy-work. Also whenever there were towels to fold she was right on top of that.  We’d often have “several” loads of towels each day (just unfold out of sight back into the hamper!).
I have a soft spot for coloring books these days because they've become more acceptable and wide spread and proven to be much like a positive form of meditation.   I've used them personally as a distraction from my chronic pain.  When it's not too bad (the pain), coloring can be quite therapeutic.    I'd take a walk through one of the big craft stores and check out the different types of easy projects there are, maybe take her with you and she can see what interests her, if anything. 

I meant more crocheting rather than knitting, lol sorry, since it's something repetitive that she doesn't have to concentrate real hard on. 

I'm not sure about your area, but where I am there's a lot of retirement communities and before the pandemic there was quite a bit going on certain days of the week, whether it was bingo at one place, or a musician coming to play, or another sort of get together like a tea time. For the people that were more social like your Mom, something like this even once every week or two could be engaging and fun for her to talk to some other people. She may make a friend or two or find one that lives close enough that she can go have coffee or tea with a couple times a month.   

My grandma is 80 and is in the earlier stages of dementia so a lot of this stuff I've been doing for and with her.  We bring her over to stay a few nights every two weeks and she spends time with her great grandson who is almost 3 years old.  They say engagement with kids, especially family, is one of the best things for them. And she really does do so well with him, she remembers more and doesn't get so frustrated with herself when she can't remember things. 

Just wanted to throw out those last few things.  You're doing great. I'm sure just having you with her makes life better and less stressful on her and she can relax and enjoy things with you.    Take care!
This put a smile on my face thinking about it:)

I will start slow with what we have and see where it goes, but I went ahead and ordered 24 pairs of socks for myself, just in case.
> I'd take a walk through one of the big craft stores and check out the different types of easy projects there are, maybe take her with you and she can see what interests her, if anything.

I will and I have some ideas thinking about it. First time reading it I thought about the children paint books with comic like looking animals. But their is an interest in nature and old buildings.

The best thing would probably be a paint book of the old village she grew up in. We have lot's of photo books about the village and the surroundings.

I just checked my favorite search engine and found something like this https://mimi-panda.com/coloring-page-online/ which converts photos to paintable pictures. Not only specifically for my mothers case but in general I find this interesting. Have to see how well this works.

> I'm not sure about your area, but where I am there's a lot of retirement communities

We're actively looking for something like this, but the good ones have waiting lists. It's called a "daycare service" where I live. She would get picked up in the morning, spends here time with other people and activities, her needs are taken care of (food, toilet) and is brought back in the afternoon or evening. Some of her friends are already there:)
At this point something like this is mandatory, as personally I'm often at the end of my strength, doing daycare/nightcare and work (luckily home office with lots of support from my employer).

> They say engagement with kids, especially family, is one of the best things for them.

I noticed that too. My sister is visiting almost every one to two days and half of the time with the children or to pick her up. There a rare moments of real joy, but when the children are there, there is always joy, and she is talking about it for hours, sometimes even the next day.

We have to watch out, that my sister doesn't burn out. On the other hand these are hours of relief for myself, often used to find some uninterrupted sleep.

Thank you for your kind words

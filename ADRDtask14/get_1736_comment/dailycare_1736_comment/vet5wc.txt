There is indeed adult day care! And of course, your local senior center.
Also consider an Alexa or other smart speaker or device for answering 1000 questions!
Adult day centers are designed more for seniors like your mom. There's a schedule, activities, meals etc.
For the repeated questions you can get a digital clock with big numbers that tells the day of the week, the date, the time, and whether it is day or night.
My 80 year old mom lives with me, but is alone while I am away at work… and she complains about being “lonely” a lot lately…. Even though I am with her in the morning before work, in the evening after work, and on weekends. I feel that my mom might benefit from adult day care…. But I am scared of her contracting covid there. My mom is very high risk, even with a vaccine booster shot. She’s 90 lbs, with heart and lung problems. Plus my mom is more of a home body anyways. So I decided not to try her out in some sort of daycare. Instead, I am able to help her a bit with her loneliness by calling her a couple times per day while I am away at work. It seems to be working ok
Check out YMCAs, community recreation centers, houses of worship, libraries to see if they have senior events.
There are some events for people with dementia and their caregivers.. it’s a place set up like a cafe. Everyone there understands what you’re going through. You can meet other caregivers, and the loved one with dementia also gets to get out for a meal, mingling, dancing, etc. The caregivers usually end up meeting up and becoming supports to each other. Great concept.
Um dude?  I hope you are sitting down because I don't think you are going to be ready for this.  This senior park you have envisioned is not going to happen.  A memory care facility, which she will need to go to in my guess is within the next 12 months, do not take any insurance.  Or medicare, or medicaid, or VA benefits.  The prices are all pretty much the same.  Cheapest is a shared room with somebody.  It's a scam on a level I didn't know could legally exist in this country.  Cost is 7K a month and these are disgusting facilities, the staff are all fat lazy bitches, who bafflingly all work there despite their seemingly blatant hatred for the elderly, and express their contempt for their $12/hour wage by doing as little as possible, avoiding all the residents at all times to watch tv in their locked break room, and supplement their income by stealing from the residents.  Got a call from the nursing home again today to let me know the 8 pairs of pants I just bought my dad "went missing." AGAIN (his clothes started disappearing after his watch and valuables went missing).  

Your mom could live there for a long time.  A long, long, long time.  Her "retirement money" will run out.  The money you get for their house will run out.  Guess what happens then.  Long story but it ends with you and your sister's retirement money.  Or your kids' college funds, that type thing.  That's why they call dementia "the most expensive disease there is."
For the repeated questions, can you set up a whiteboard that reminds her of the day/date/year/planned activities/time/ etc?
The questions are hard. Assisted living will be good for her once you get her there.
A senior citizen center in your area? I live in a moderately sized city and there are at least 3.
My mum has had a stroke and is the same. My sister is a doctor and she calls it being "**disinhibited**" - lost ability to follow social rules like waiting your turn to speak or realising when you're talking too much. So talkative people will become VERY talkative. I've also heard doctors use the term "**impulsiveness**" - acting without thinking, which I think also ties into the constant flow of chatter, so they are literally just broadcasting whatever is on their mind like a river with the dam removed. This is in my mother's context of a stroke and not dementia (my mother doesn't repeat questions so your mother's issue is clearly on another level), but may help you to know. At least, know you're not alone in being driven crazy by this. It's a tough situation for carers.

If your mum has hobbies (e.g. knitting, book club, etc), then that would be a good starting point to get her along to senior social groups based on that hobby? Or something to distract her at home, e.g. favourite TV shows work pretty well on my mom a lot of the time. I'm sorry if I sound ignorant about dementia and she is unable to do these things. Let me know and I'll see if I can think of other ideas.

You must set boundaries for your own insanity too. It's not selfish, it's necessary. If you need to, take breaks. Remind yourself this is temporary. You're fortunate that your parents are going into assisted living (a bit envious to be honest as I wish my parents would).
What exactly is a senior center? Can anyone just go there?
Piggybacking on this, look into [PACE](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/long-term-services-supports/pace/programs-all-inclusive-care-elderly-benefits/index.html). Not sure if your mom would qualify, but many PACE services are (usually) delivered through senior centers and they can provide transportation back and forth as well.
The problem I see with Adult Day Care is that I would probably have to leave her there, and she would freak out. I totally wouldn’t mind hanging out with a bunch of seniors (I like them), and in that context, my mom talks to everyone and I get a little relief from the constant questions.
We have one and it was great for my grandma! 

She was also sneaky when the home health people would do assessments. They'd not realize she could see the clock with all of the info. When I caught her "cheating" we had a good giggle but I made sure to stand in front of the clock during assessments after, hah.
My mom doesn't always understand or "believe" her clock. Even seeing that it's Tuesday June whatever, she'll insist it's Sunday, Feb....
Sometimes churches might have volunteers who can come out and visit with her once a week or so. Might be worth sending out a few emails?
Good idea, but I tried it already. She then decides to confirm the information on the whiteboard. She also check the newspaper date, the check marks on the calendar, asks again for confirmation, and around and around we go.

Thanks for the suggestion though. :)
It's a community center just for seniors. Any decent-sized community should have one. They offer activities and usually have someone there to help with resources. There's usually a library and reading nook, bingo, lunches are served, outings planned, things like dance nights, etc. A place for seniors to go hang out and do stuff with other seniors, open to everyone!
I find that most senior centers are for seniors who don’t have dementia or cognitive issues, though.  Our town senior center is basically for Ladies Who Wear Purple types - retired bored ladies who like to play bridge and go on group trips.
Depending on how severe her dementia is it may not be safe for her to travel independently with PACE. 

PACE is great but she may end up more confused and distressed as generally the drivers are never the same and sometimes rides are shared.
That's fair.
I had exactly the same experience putting my child in preschool.  I hung around inside the parent participation preschool with her for several visits (like 10 or 15) then I sat in my car in the parking lot for a few...then I'd sometimes put her hand in the hand of the head preschool teacher and say "school refusal", and the teacher would take it from there.  I'm new to this sub, but think "child participation seniorschool" is a great idea. Good luck.
Hey, good for her!  It's a good strategy!
That's hard.  I think you just have to go with whatever she says, and maybe probe to find out the significance of whatever day she thinks it is.  I'm sure you know that trying to talk her out of it will only bring frustration.

Best wishes.
Do you have a smart speaker? She can ask Alexa too!
I’m already investiGoogling. Thanks…
Yeah, not gonna lie I was a bit impressed that she thought of it, haha.
There's also a "Guess that tune" game on Alexa, you can specify the genre or decade. My grandma always seemed to enjoy it, especially when it was an Elvis tune, haha.

hope you find out, I am planning a XC,bike ride across  America in 2022, The Magical Memory tour to commemorate  my ride of 50 years ago and to raise funds for alzheimers which didn't seem to be a big thing back then. but takes it horrendous toll now.
When you donate to an organization, you can usually say it's in memory of \_\_\_\_\_, or something; the organiztion can then notify the family.  You can also write a check to the organization, but send it to the surviving family member in a sympathy card.   Or you can simply tell the survivor that you did it, like you suggested.

As for choosing an organization, look at their website.  Do they stress how big they are in research?  Or is it more oriented to individual and family supports?  Personally I think both are equally important to progress.  You could also ask the surviving family member if they have a particular organization in mind.
That’s an amazing commitment. I wish you the best.
I really appreciate your advice, and will definitely use it. Thank you very much. 

I think I’ll ask them about an organization. I know there are many where the fees that don’t have to do with research or helping Alzheimer’s in general are way too high compared to the good they do.

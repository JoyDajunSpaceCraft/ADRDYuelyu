Chemo fog is a thing.  
This, and EVERY single symptom that she experiences during the treatment must be reported to the doctor. There are strategies and medications for dealing with them. 

Whether the treatment is worth for her, this is a pacient/family/doctor joint decision.
Hi, I just wanted to share something I was told. I’m caregiving for my MIL and she has mental illness. I was told that chemotherapy would cause her medications, for mental illness, to not work as effectively. Thats one reason we had to fight for her to get chemo. They didn’t want to. 

The theory stands correct in our case.
What do her doctors say?  Do other patients who encounter this recover?
That’s something that I never thought of, thank you for your response.
Her doctors do not think that the chemo is to blame.

My MIL (72) asks for beer every night. We bought non-alcoholic beer and she is none the wiser. I would say that she probably drinks for the same reason the rest of us do... to escape. Losing your mind must be awful. Add Covid-19 restrictions on top of being a caregiver... I know I have been drinking more too.
my MIL is an alcoholic and on opioid painkillers. I believe the alcohol mixed with the drugs may have been the reason for the dementia. My MIL used it as a pain killer.Problem is she is now hospitalized and probably going through withdrawal. I would take the booze away and replace with alcohol free beer/wine or dilute heavily with water.
She is visiting for July 4 and I told dad she either needs to bring her own beer or expect nonalcoholic beer. I drink more with her than anyone because she makes me feel bad if I donâ€™t want to drink with her, like it is an insult to her or I am judging her. I think somewhere inside she knows something is wrong and this gives her a reason to not remember something.

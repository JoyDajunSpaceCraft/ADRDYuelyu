The problem is that moving a person with dementia even once can lead to delirium that can certainly worsen agitation and even hallucinations. It is typically transient, but symptoms can be severe. 

The hallucinations she is having could be a normal sign of worsening dementia or again new onset delirium. Hopefully the hospital can rule out some easily treatable cause of delirium.

My mom hallucinates regularly. I finally accepted it and play along as best I can. Telling her people/things weren’t real just caused her to become horribly angry, then hurt, then loads of tears. She doesn’t have a physical problem, like a UTI - took her to the doctor and a neurologist - it’s just part of the dementia.
if this is dementia hallucinations, it is MORE likely to happen in unfamiliar places, but more likely that they will give her medication to counteract it (which, IF she has Lewy Body dementia in the mix can be dangerous or even fatal).  Check medications suggested on the LBDA website.

Talk to your doctor.  There are many more likely causes of this than dementia and most of them are treatable.  The general definition of dementia is; Dementia is a general term for loss of memory, language, problem-solving, and other thinking abilities that are severe enough to interfere with daily life.  Using this, ADHD, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, drug interactions, etc can all fall under that definition.  See a physician, follow their instructions.  Odds are excellent that you'll be fine.
Hello internet stranger.  

I want you to be weary of people claiming to be doctors or lawyers offering advice online.  Unless you sign a contract/paperwork with an office it is ILLEGAL for people (in the medical/legal field) to offer PROFESSIONAL advice/diagnoses when you are not a client.  This means when you go on subreddits and someone says "they know me here, I'm a (insert professional title here)" that they are either a) lying or b) sucked in their classes (aka "D's get degrees").

What this all really means is that you need to talk to your doctor about this.

There is also something called imagination. It can make us “see” things that are not there. When you are young, it can seem really vivid, especially when you are very stressed. I would talk to my doctor, or a counselor at school, if I were you. Ask the hard questions and be ready to hear the answers. I think you will be okay.
Not really hallucinations

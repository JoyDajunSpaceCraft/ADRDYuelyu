Yeah if you got the time and patience for it, its fine. No shame in needing a break from it or trying to mix it up a bit though, with your reactions, to see if some get a better response than others.  Like try diverting attention to something else or put on music, or prompt convo to a different direction if it doesn't bother them. If the repetition is making you bananas.

At this point it sounds like hes at the stage where you just try to keep them cheerful/avoid making them upset. You cant really "help" them more than that by trying to correct them.
My Grandpa also repeated himself many times. I call it 'looping'. If theres a break in the repeating try to change the subject to something different! Sometimes when my grandpa couldn't talk well or finish a sentence I would just sit next to him and talk about current events, other family members, etc and let him listen and laugh. During my rambles I would ask him a related question, something that could be answered yes/no if thats all he was up to.

Donâ€™t worry, the guy probably forgot about it all...
A very similar scenario also happened to me when I was around your age. My family was visiting my grandmother in a nursing home and I was walking into the building from the outside. An elderly man in a wheelchair asked me to hold the door open for him and I naively did, then he wheeled outside. He was not out there long and just stayed on the sidewalk before an aide saw him and wheeled him back inside. Later my mom told me that the patients are not supposed to be let outside unsupervised. I felt really stupid and embarassed at the time, but hey, I was a kid and did not know any better.

But anyways, you were just a kid and were naive, and if it makes you feel any better, you are not the only person who has done what you did.








Ha!
Duuuude

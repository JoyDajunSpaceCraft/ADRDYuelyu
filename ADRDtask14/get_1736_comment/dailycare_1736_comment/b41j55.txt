What about a hook and eye lock placed either high or very low on the door?
There are child locks for door knobs that work perfectly for your situation. There are different options for different types of knobs. Try a search on Amazon using the phrase “child safety latches”. They have options for cabinets and fridges too. 
You could try putting signs up. Something like “Do Not Use” on a closed toilet seat or a “Do Not Enter” on the outside of the door. Even just a red stop sign on the door might help, if he no longer reads. Best of luck! 
What about a Bluetooth smart Lock, or a knob that requires a code to get in. From a brief Google it looks like there's some good under 40 dollars options. Try one out on one door before fully investing and see you if they work
Ummm.... You might consider how much more messy would it be if he "needed" to go and found the doors all locked?  I totally understand the reason behind wanting to lock down all but one bathroom; I mop bathrooms first thing in the morning and last thing at night. And during the day. And, he sometimes can't find the bathroom and just uses the shower as a urinal or goes on the floor or on the carpet in the hall. BTW I'm on my 2nd carpet cleaner now and researching a new one. 
Bathroom should already have whats called a passage lock. On the outside there is a little slot that can be opened with any key or a coin. I have to lock the bedroom because my wife will go to bed at any time of the day and be up all night.
This worked well for us- it didn't occur to him to look for a secondary lock.  
A very low lock would probably work very well, thank you for the suggestion!
It's my bad for forgetting to add, I'm looking for a lock for a door knob. I've tried Amazon, and the only option I've really found is [this one](https://www.amazon.ca/Dreambaby-L908-Ezy-Fit-Door-Covers/dp/B00Y76H0YC/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1S5T6DIM1OC3F&keywords=child+proof+door+knob&qid=1553236127&s=gateway&sprefix=child+proof+door+%2Caps%2C213&sr=8-4), but it's a little too simplistic to work.
I'm an RN on an Alz unit.  That's what we use.  It works fairly well.  The only down side is that it occasionally comes apart when I use it.  I've never seen it come apart when a resident tries.
don't know what stage your grandfather is in but for my mom I simply just use a regular cabinet hook and when she tries to open it and it doesn't she moves on or back into bed, sadly it's a routine.  Good luck to you and your grandfather 
I actually bought them already and tried it out. Made this post mainly because they aren't enough to actually stop him if he keeps trying, and my grandfather is very persistent.

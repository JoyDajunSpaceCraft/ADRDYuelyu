We did something similar with smarties candies in a medicine bottle we repurposed. Anyone without dementia would know it was just candy. Worked very well.
Just dropping in to say I love smarties.
We did the same with breath mints and artifical sweetners. We had a client who was a former nurse and was constantly anxious about medications, always wanting pills to fix her tongue, toes, teeth, hearing aids etc. We had PRN clonazepam but it was only treating the behaviours and not the symptoms so the behaviours morphed over time into anything that worried her she wanted a pill to fix. A container of equal emptied into a pill jar and a packet of breath mints fixed it really quick. Discussed this with her GP and family first of course.

It's mostly has she gotten lost before I believe. Like did she walk out of the house and down the street without telling anyone
Absconding is another term. It’s always a matter of safety ie falls risks, wondering off and getting lost in the community, if she goes into other peoples rooms is there a risk to their property or privacy. She hasn’t lived in a home yet so don’t worry too much because you don’t actually know what she’ll be like yet. Also, wondering around is extremely normal for someone who’s expecting cognitive decline, they all do it if they can walk.
My dad absconded (they may be losing their minds but they're sneaky af) and we had to put special locks on the doors that he can't get off, though he's tried.

Edit to add: The final straw that led to the locks is he got away and went walking a few streets over. He was walking in the middle of the street and almost got hit. He's pretty deaf so he can't hear anything coming.

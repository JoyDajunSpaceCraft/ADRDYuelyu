"chemo brain" or "chemo fog" is a common side effect.  My wife had breast cancer years ago and she definitely says the "fog" is real.  It's gotten better over the years, but not a whole lot that can be done about it.
Thanks

I can't help but wonder if there are supplements or something that could help her start to restore her memory.  :/

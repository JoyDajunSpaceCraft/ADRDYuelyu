To minimize chances of getting bad actors (abuse, theft, etc) licensed & bonded agencies are a better bet than hiring unknown CNAs. To save $, MIL hired them herself to take care of Gma, only to discover valuables had been stolen while on vacation & the culprits stopped showing up for their shifts (a couple). Agencies vet employees & can also send replacements in case of illness of regular staff. I’d also hang around “working at home” for awhile at first to see/hear how they interact w/LO. Communication is key, so you’ll want to establish open dialog right from the start, often out of earshot of LO.

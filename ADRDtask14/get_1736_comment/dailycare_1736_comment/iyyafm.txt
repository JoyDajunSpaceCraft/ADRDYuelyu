My grandmother is constantly looking for little GoudaKayak. I'll say I'm right here and she will tell me not you, the other one. Or she gets frustrated and thinks I'm trying to trick her. 
The only child thing is interesting. Are you telling her "my mother is upstairs" or saying "Nancy is upstairs"? Maybe the difference in the way it is said. Sometimes my grandmother will say that my brother is her brother. Or refer to her deceased brother as having done something recently that my brother did.
The best I can understand it is that my mother has memories of people that are attached to years and times. So there's my daughter who is an adult, but she also spent a lot of time with my daughter when she was about two, and has clear memories of that person. 

I kind of get that, and I hope it's not a sign of my brain starting to split off, but there's this person, who I know rationally is my mother, who is 80 and in a wheelchair and has dementia. But there is that other person, my real mother, who I remember as being about 30, who raised animals and worked in the garden. They really do seem like two separate people.
This happens.  A trick that helped with my husband was wearing something easily seen for each visit.  Two friends that visited were often long lost people from his past.   I kept a large fake red Gerber daisy that was tucked into one friends hair and another got a very flash broach for each visit.  These were only used for them.  He would focus on the accessory. I would of course introduce them and use their names regularly when they were there.  Eventually it helped.  It wasnâ€™t foolproof but nothing is when it comes to AD.
As your Grandma loses her recent memories she also loses the connections to how your mum looks now in comparison to how she looks in grandmas memories. Hence why sons/daughters get mistaken for brothers/sisters etc. 

My dad knows who I am and who my husband is but doesn't always recognise my mum, his wife of almost 50 years, and has been known to ask me how my parents are. Its just another new normal to adapt to.
This is called Capgras delusion.  It is fairly uncommon.

Yes, if my experience with my wife is any indication. She thinks there are two of me and wants to be with the other one. She also gets confused about her daughter and calls her "that woman". It seems like the ALZ is cross-connecting her memory of identities and reassigning some people.

Get him a pro caregiver/memory care home immediately. For his, and your mothers safety.
This can and should be treated with medication whether he stays at home or goes to a facility.  If he acts violently in a facility they will either tell you he can't stay there or they will send him to a psych ward to be medicated and then give him another chance. While he's at home, have one "safe room" in the house that your Mom can go to. It should have a locked door and a phone. This does not change the fact that he has a violence issues that need to be addressed, but I'd also take a look at how your Mom is communicating with him and whether she could be escalating his anger instead of deescalating, avoiding, and redirecting. "Understanding the Dementia Experience" by Jennifer Ghent Fuller is a free booklet available online that might be helpful in this respect.

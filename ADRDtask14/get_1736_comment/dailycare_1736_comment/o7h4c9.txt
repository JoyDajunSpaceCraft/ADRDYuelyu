I would hate if my loved one asked me if I knew I was losing my mind during a moment of clarity. And I know when I confront my mom in a similar way she becomes defensive.

Maybe consider asking her about her past in those moments. What was her youth like? What were you grandparents like? Does she recall that special memory of a favorite birthday that you have? What's her favorite memory overall? Her wedding? A job promotion? Take these moments to use your mom's candor to learn about her.

Obviously, stick to positive conversation topics and watch for her becoming agitated. If you see any signs of her becoming frustrated abandon the topic and try discussing something else
Thank you. I wouldnt phase it so bluntly. I just really wonder how aware she is..
Good reply, good tactic! 

  OP, idk, if you really feel you need to, could perhaps refer to her "memory loss issues" but asking/telling her she's "losing / lost her mind"  that's rather confronting and at this point, a cruel way to phrase it.  I'm sure you don't intend to be mean.   

If she has moments of clarity though, for sure, ask about old times.  Try playing her old favourite music, people will very frequently have positive happy response to old familiar music, it's so evocative.   Check out dementia .org &/ alzheimers .org for excellent expert informative practical resources, tips, info, etc regarding care of & communication with the memory lossed.   best of luck!
Thank you.

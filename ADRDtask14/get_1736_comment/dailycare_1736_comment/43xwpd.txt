Wish I could help. Can't so can just make a suggestion. 

I know you say you are broke, but there are Non-profits out there for just about everything under the sun, and I imagine there is one related to head-trauma and the consequences of that on your life, that it's not going to charge you what you can't afford for the necessary therapy. So I'm suggesting maybe get someone to help you locate an Non-profit in your area that deals with the fallout from brain trauma. 

(I'd offer to help locate them, but I'm over in Africa and I'm assuming you are somewhere in the 1st world :)

Depends on what country you are in. Seeking out studies on closed head injury at local universities may be helpful.

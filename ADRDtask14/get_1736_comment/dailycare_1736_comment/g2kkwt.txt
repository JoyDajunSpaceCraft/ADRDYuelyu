Im in the EXACT same position.There's good and bad days. It's hard with this quarantine. Hang in there. It's okay to put yourself first sometimes. Try to do at least one thing for yourself every day. Read play video games art projects whatever you like
Cherishing the time you have to yourself will be your key to keeping your sanity! Even if its something small. Does your grandmother usually sleep throughout the night or does she wake up?
I had to laugh at your headline--so many of us can relate. You are awesome for finding a little fun in what is a really hard situation.
Three years of that with my dad, followed immediately by more of the same with my mom. Repeating everything three times, completely incomprehensible conversations. It makes me incredibly frustrated and lonely. Sad for mom, of course, yeah, I can relate to the exasperation!
I’m right there with you. I have my mom (86) here with me, my daughter and granddaughter. The house is not big enough for everyone to have their own room so she’s in my room with me. I haven’t seen my fiancé for over a month. I can’t have him over because we have no privacy. ( he’s been isolating at home) That’s what is so hard for me. I have no break. I’m trying to explain to mom that she can’t give me the virus over and over again- every day! Nothing I make for her to eat is good enough (I was a professional chef) This is almost unbearable.
Let your daughter take care of your mom for a while and go visit your fiance.  If he has been isolating it's all good.  Of course this depends on your iso procedures.
She’s so afraid that I will get it and give it to my mom that she won’t let me leave the house! I talked with our doctor and she said to have a small group that have been isolated to have as safe units of contacts. My health isn’t that good in the first place. But maybe I can do that next week. Thank you.

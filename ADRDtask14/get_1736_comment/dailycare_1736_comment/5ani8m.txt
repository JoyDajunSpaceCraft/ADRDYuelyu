Personality change was the big thing we noticed.  He was apathetic to everything. Next was his doing things wrong like trying to turn on the headlights in the car with his foot. 
He has a few of these, like forgetting small things and things on his phone a lot recently. He takes care of himself, and has a hard time sleeping. He sees us (his children) every other week, and he's pretty good about remembering, but in still concerned. Thanks, and I'll watch out for him. After my parents divorced he never remarried so I'm worried about him being alone.

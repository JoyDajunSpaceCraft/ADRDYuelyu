Lost my grand dad to dementia earlier this year. I just gonna day Cherish every moment
I totally understand.  

Don't be upset with yourself for your feelings your dad certainly wouldn't be.  

I've told my daughter that if it gets to that, she should put in a new diaper, put me in my wheelchair and push me in front of a bus.  She laughs but I'm serious.
Oh sweetheart...so sorry.  I feel your pain.  My father had alzheimer's and 3 weeks before he died my mom was diagnosed with Vascular dementia.  I handled all of their care and estate myself.  It is a brutal and wretched disease!  Feel free to reach out if you need to talk.  I get it!  Prayers and hugs!  :-)
That sucks man, mostly for your mom. Not sure where you live but in the US we really need better and cheaper care for seniors.
You are grieving and your feelings are very real and normal.  Take care of yourself...Eat...sleep and rest well.  And have some fun!  :D

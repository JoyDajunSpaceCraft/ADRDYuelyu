when she wants to prolong 








the conversation.
Was in the hospital visiting my dad yesterday. We chatted a bit then I told him I had a question for the nurse and he was quiet. So I went and asked the nurse something and came back to my dad and he was just yakking away. Guess I missed the secrets to life.
My FIL will speak in a normal voice when you are in the room one-on-one. The second you walk away then he is shouting your name to come back for something. 

He is hard of hearing, but often complains about how loud everyone else is talking. I think it's mainly because if more than one person is talking at a time (like a conversation in the room) he gets confused and can't understand so he gets frustrated.
My mom had vision issues and was in assisted living.  When I left her field of vision to do a chore like put away the laundry I had brought back, she would always ask questions about what I was doing until I sat down next to her again.
My mother is always puttering about everywhere, but the second you say you need to use the toilet, or you quietly sneak over and close the bathroom door, she is insistently in desperate need to use it, too, or just HAS to get something from the closet that very minute. Drives my daughter nuts because she likes to lock the bathroom door and my mother will just stand outside and pester until she can get in. And yes, there IS a second bathroom she could easily be using.
 The behaviour you described seemed awfully familiar, and then I realized I'd been married to someone who did the very same things. While in the 'thick of it' though, it hadn't occurred to me what was needed (and fk yeah, it was beyond annoying). And that meme... OH, if I had only had it in those days!

fyi...I have experienced living with someone with Alzheimer's... I wish you and your brother nothing more than some annoyances, as well as some loving laughter amidst the sadness. Take care of each other \~
My mom does this! I’m dying laughing now because I thought it was just her. Never imagined this was a thing. I’m not alone! Thanks for the laugh.
Okay, that's hilarious.
It's not. I have had to explain to my boss that I was 20 minutes late because my mom asked me to pick up dog food. . . and the question took 20 minutes, I didn't even have time to go get dog food.
Oh geeze.  I can't not hear this in Shatner's voice.

"N0_Tr3bbl3.... can I... ask you to.... please... pick up... some dog food"
*Of course*, it's not hilarious to you (she said, after recovering from a solid laugh out loud)...and I'm not trivializing the stress you experienced while getting to work late...

Look, real life is the biggest resource for the best laughs; certainly context matters, and one day, with enough distance, you'll see the humour in so many places where at the time there was none to be found. Finding the humour now, if/when possible, is one of the best ways to cope (nothing new). Take care of yourself, and try to have some laughs with your mom!
>Look, real life is the biggest resource for the best laughs;

Agreed... I laugh at everything. If I can laugh at it, it can't hurt me. 

>Of course, it's not hilarious to you

Nah, it actually is. Just not in the moment when I'm worried about being late.

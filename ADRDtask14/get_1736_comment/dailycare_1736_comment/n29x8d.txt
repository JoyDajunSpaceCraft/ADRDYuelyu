There's an app called 2 player pastimes by senior games.  My dad seems to like that one.

The company senior games makes other apps too that may be good but I like that one in particular.
My mom loves the paint by number app
Fortnite, that should do it





But now in all seriousness, that seems like a good one, there's also this one where you are a snake and u go left right up and down, as the game progresses it gets harder and when you eat the snake gets longer and that makes it harder too because its easier to touch the walls and lose

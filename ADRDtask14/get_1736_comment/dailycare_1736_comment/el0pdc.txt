Would he be willing to go to see the doctor for an MOT but you speak with the doctor first and get them to ask some diagnostic questions?
Pretend he is going in for a regular check up, or to get a flu shot.  Alert the docs that he needs the Alzheimer's test (they do simple things like ask you who the President is, to count backwards from 10, what is the year, about 10 questions like that).  Dementia patients struggle to find the answers.  You absolutely have to get a diagnosis.
Thank you for the advice. He is seeing his primary care doc for an evaluation, and my mother will be going with him to help corroborate his symptoms.

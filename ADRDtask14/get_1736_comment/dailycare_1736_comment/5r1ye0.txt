I have to admit I've been avoiding the subject, but your post prompted me to look up the [Stages of Alzheimers Disease](http://www.alzheimers.net/stages-of-alzheimers-disease).

I've been avoiding it because I guess I really didn't want to know what me and my wife's future looked like.

I'm sorta glad/not-glad that I did so. I see my wife as straddling Stage 5/Stage 6, and it frightens me to consider what the future holds.

I hope your mom has a moment of clarity and remembers you when you are there to see it.

Personal experience: My mother teared up and cried the last time I saw her alive. (I'm her only child.)

She was in a hospice facility. My wife and I drove the eight hours overnight after she was placed because my stepfather felt she was fading fast. We spent several days with her and other family in the facility. The entire time she was unresponsive to anyone. When my wife and I had to return to our lives (we had two very small children at the time, jobs, and other assorted responsibilities back home), I leaned over, kissed her cheek, and told her I was leaving. She immediately teared up, the corners of her lips curled downward, and she cried.

It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. She was discharged from hospice about a week later after improving physically  (Yes. It can and does happen.), but passed at home a couple weeks after the discharge.
I just wanted to reach out because my mom was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers 6 years ago. I had no idea there was such a rapidly progressing version and I am very sorry :(
My mother was in the same boat towards the end. She couldn't speak, walk, and had very little daily nutritional consumption. She lasted way longer than the doctors could have ever imagined. There were some days when I would go and see her and though she could not speak to me, when I would speak to her about certain things her body would react differently than other topics. 
I had just had a baby, and whenever I brought up the baby or asked her if she was happy that I had a baby she would smile a little or even make a noise. Now, I wasn't talking to her expecting a reply at that point, but sometimes she surprised me. 

My brother and I hadn't been on speaking terms for about six years and it bothered my mother deeply when she was aware of things. When she finally started to not eat as much the situation with my brother weighed heavy on me. On Easter day I decided It needed to stop and I spoke with my brother and we talked things over and settled things. I went upstairs to where my mothers room was and told her that me and my brother had finally worked things out and that we love each other and that she doesn't have to worry anymore. She died a few days later. 

I truly believe that me telling her that my brother and I had worked things out let her let go. 

The truth is we don't know what goes on in their minds. And we never will. But in my experience I truly believe that there is always something listening in there somewhere. 

I'm sorry this is happening to you and your family. 

-excuse the grammar, when I talk about this stuff I just have to talk to Siri and not go back to read it for errors. 

EDIT: Don't stop talking to her. Talk as if there were nothing wrong with her. 
I would tell her about my day, the weather, anything that would make her think that everything was Okay. 


Also the hospice nurse would commend us on our  having her nearby the family conversation. Even if she was in the other room she could hear us all talking and It would bring some sort of normalcy to her. 
Before it got really bad (when she wasn't talking much at all) sometimes she would be in the other room and heard us all laughing about something, and she would also start laughing, She would say nothing else even if prompted. Keep talking to her. 


Man that anecdote is deep.
I just cried reading that. Very beautiful, very sad. 
She may have had it sooner but we didn't know. But thank you. I wish you and your mom the best and I'm sorry. 
Yes, similar to you, I troubled my mom. My parents went through s brutally nasty divorce when I was in college and as a coping mechanism I just kind of backed away from my parents. I hurt my mom by doing that and I took her for granted. This last week as she was laying there I cried and cried to her and apologized. What gives me great agony and pain is I don't know if she could comprehend what I was telling her. I took her for granted and it'll give me great grief and shame for a long time to come. 
This is so very important to have said. Thank you for this.

While my wife still has the capacity to understand, her visitors don't often understand this. For example, her parents, when visiting, often talk around her as if she weren't there, and talk about her in the 3rd person. I do my best to look at her and try to involve her in the conversation, because I know for a fact she can follow along -- as long as she is addressed directly.

If she is 'talked around', then she seems to shut down.

Doctor visits are kinda weird, because I'll have to talk about her symptoms and behaviour as if she's not right there in the seat next to me -- but I want to be clear and honest with the doctor about what's been going on.

My wife has been estranged from her only sibling, a sister for years, but the sister has been sending small gifts to her over the past few months. I hope that the two can be reunited while my wife can still appreciate it -- and that they have a chance to truly talk with one another.

Anyhow, your emphasis on continuing to talk with the sufferer rings so true to me. Their minds may go into 'sleep mode' when not engaged, but that doesn't mean that they can not also boot up and pay attention when actively engaged.
I'm not saying this to make you feel better, but I truly believe that she heard you. The night that my mother died, my aunt had come to visit from Arizona specifically to see my mother. My aunt is the reason my mother was able to come to this country in the 60s. My aunt told me that she stayed up that night while her mother was sleeping, and stood by her bedside talking about when they were younger in the 60s and all sorts of families stories that she remembered. At the end of the conversation she told her mother that she had fought this disease for a long time and that she was strong but that it was Okay to let go.  She passed away a couple of hours after that conversation. The mother was an extremely strong person and came from a family of very strong peoplewhich is why she held on for so long despite what doctors said. I truly believe that conversation helped my mother finally let go. So don't let past mistakes weigh on you, somewhere inside of your mother she heard everything you said and it probably brought great relief to her.
Absolutely.  You brought up doctor visits and I'd like to mention that when hospice would come over the house and we would talk about my mother. We would do it in another room and whisper so that she would not hear us. We would do this even at the stage where she was no talking or walking or communicating, she had also gone blind at that point too. Very important to not talk about them as if they are not there, this could confuse them. 

(She was blind due to the disease, nothing was wrong with her eyes, it was the brain not receiving the message anymore. )
I'd value reading from you (and others) what your experience with late-stage Alzheimers looks like. Your last sentence astonished me, and made me think there are symptoms ahead of us that I've not even thought of.
Sorry, i didn't mean to scare you.  Everyone has different symptoms as there are many different types of dementia/alzheimer's.  My mom suffered for more than ten years that we know of, and that's not even including the amount of time she kept symptoms hidden from us.  I will try to make an accurate list of symptoms she had or you.


EARLY STAGE:

**-**She would do things like leaving the sponge in a glass she cleaned and when we questioned her about it she would say that one of my nieces probably did it. (nieces were toddlers at the time)

**-**Her handwriting became illegible. 

**-**She would come home from work with scratches on her car more and moe often and she would blame it on where she parked and people bumping the car.  

**-**She would get really aggravated and aggressive over stupid things. for example, asking her if she left a sponge in a glass, that wouldn't end well.  my father took the brunt of those types of things.  

**-**She would bring up things that happened between my father and mother in the 60's, 70's, 80's like it was still an issue and start fights with him about it. 

**-**She would ask me to pull the car out of the garage for her because it was too tight a space.  (it was a tight space but she had been doing it for a long time without issue.  (This is the start of her vision failing.  It started with her depth perception)


**MID STAGE:**

**-**Memory starts to get iffy.  (NOTE: My mother never really had the typical forgetting peoples names issue.  It was more like mixing events in her life up or when they happened)

--- **HALLUCINATIONS**.  This one was the worst to witness, and at first we handled it poorly.  I will describe the hallucinations first, and then explain how we handled it poorly and how we remedied our lack of understanding.  

One day I get a call from my father that my mother was at our long time neighbors house next door (our neighbor called my father, and he called me to go home and check things out as he was at work about 2 hours away).  I went and got her and we went home.  I asked her what was the matter and she hesitated to tell me that there were these men in the house that were harassing her and throwing water on her.  
A part of me died at that moment.  After a while of me explaining that nobody was there and nobody could have come into the house she got very angry with me.  she would say things like:

"You guys (me, my father, brother) don't care about me"

It's hard to explain the frustration, but when you are trying to explain to someone that they are seeing something that is not really there and it's all in their head and that person is looking at you like you are crazy... it's quite the feeling.  I punched a hole in an old wire reinforced horse hair plaster wall that day (not in front of her).  I decided to take video of this all one day so that i could show her neurologist at Mass General in Boston.  In this video I bring my mother around the house and i ask her to point out where she sees these guys that torment her.
She claims that workers that are doing construction next door (there are no workers or construction) are laughing at her and spraying her with water and the watch her when she goes to the bathroom.  I asked her to point to where she sees them or where they get into the house from, and she brings me to the bathroom.  She starts pointing to the upper corner of the bathroom.  I explain that it is the wall and ceiling but she just gets more angry.  I try to calm myself down and explain by actually touching the wall that it is not possible.  I say "ma, what am i touching? the wall right? so how can people come in from a wall?"  
She looks at me and says something like "do you think I'm stupid? no you and your father are the stupid ones"

She did this in every room in the house.  Always up in the corner.  One day my father caught her grabbing one of my nieces riding toys and yelling and threatening the wall with it.

I sent this video to the doctor and he explained that we can't handle it this way any longer.  

"Don't tell her what she is seeing isn't there, just say that you will call the police (which she told us to do many times) or that they can't hurt her."  Explaining to her that there was nothing there was only making things worse because to her...It was real life and this shit was really happening.  

She went on medication for the visions, that helped but made her groggy and lifeless.  

**-**Falling/more vision problems.  She would miss steps going up or down.  She would reach for a door handle on the wrong side of the door.  going down our stairs she would hold the wall instead of the railing on the other side of her.  At this point she became a danger to herself.  

**-**We started to have to feed her because of her poor dexterity.  She couldn't hold drinks without spilling as she would lean them too far over or start tipping them well before they were near her mouth.

**LATE STAGE EARLY:**  She got worse with all of the symptoms i mentioned but i will fast forward to the next major changes.

-She needed help eating.  She had trouble with forks and spoons.  We walked her places so she wouldn't trip and fall which she has done a few times.  brought in a live in helper to help with showering her and feeding her as my father was still looking for someone to buy his business so he could retire and take care of her.  


**LATE STAGE LATE:**  Again, I'm fast forwarding.

At this point she can't:
...walk at all and is bound to bed or a hospice wheel type chair that she could sleep and eat in and just stay around us.

...Eat solid foods (her diet was ensure and blended foods.

...Talking was at a minimum (the last month there was very little communication)

...see.  We think she could see light, but mainly moved to look to the sounds.

From here it was the end.  she was skin and bones, wouldn't drink or eat enough for her body.  That's usually how it happens.  Food and water.  Hospice was great and she didn't suffer.  Lots of meds. 

I hope this helps but i want to remind you it is totally different for others. It depends on what the person really has which is not always easy to tell.  


Thanks so much for your reply. I couldn't have been easy to relive and type out.

When my wife was initially diagnosed a few years ago, the doctors asked how long ago she had begun to show symptoms. My answer was always "2 years ago", because that's the earliest time I could identify certain behaviours that seemed relevant to the diagnosis. But now that I think on it, I believe the symptoms were there for me to see much earlier. 

She started a bitter family feud with her sister that might in fact have had no basis in reality. We're currently trying to get her sister to bury the hatchet and become friends with her again.

She attended a medical conference/tutorial where she was mocked for being stupid by the professor (my wife was a medical doctor). Of course at the time I was incensed and blamed it on sexism, which, admittedly, is rampant here in Argentina.

In retrospect, those and other things point the way toward her disease much earlier.

-----

These days, she'll often ask, when I serve dinner, where is the food for the kids, and I have to explain to her that the kids no longer live here. She's long since lost the ability to sign her name which is a huge pain in the ass when we have to go take money out of the bank. Last night I wanted her to read something, but she couldn't figure out how to put her glasses on. Every morning during our "Wake up & Dance", I certainly have to help her put on her clothes.

And yes, either I will take a shower with her, or our regular helper woman will bathe her, but she cannot do that task by herself. I've banished toilet paper from her bathroom, and instead have baby wipes for her to clean herself after she uses the toilet.

She's not really good with handling complicated food. Knives and Forks have recently started confusing her, as has eating wraps or burritos (well, fake non-picante Argentine pseudo-burritos, anyhow).

All of these seem minor inconveniences to me. 

It hadn't occurred to me that such basics as eyesight might be lost -- but upon reflection it makes perfect sense.

I'm in no position to be able to send her to a nursing home when she can no longer eat properly, so lordy lordy I have some thinking to do.
I'm sorry for what you are going through and god only knows I will never understand. What I went through was much different from what my father went through, and it took me a while to figure that out. He was there 24/7 and I wasn't. I was there very often but it's not the same. Sending my mother to a nursing home wasn't an option really. We knew she would want to be at home and even hospice and doctors told us that they live longer and happier at home. Not to mention the expense. 
Just hope for the best. I don't know how common loss of sight is but don't over worry about things yet. Spend good time with her, it's the best medicine.

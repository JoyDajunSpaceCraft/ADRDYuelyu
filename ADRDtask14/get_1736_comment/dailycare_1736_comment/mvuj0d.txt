Aricept should really only be used in early to moderate dementia. Sounds like it is working well for her. Recommend discuss the possible adverse reaction with her physician. Rhabdo can be ruled out with a blood test.
i have been on aricept almost 10 years now, (at ... years old ,can no longer subtract but i was born in 1957).  i have several hundred friends with dementia (because i blog and was Admin for Dementia Mentors).  Many friends have been taken off aricept in middle stages, then seen their cognitive abilities drastically decline immediately.  Very few were able to re-gain those abilities after they re-started aricept, but a couple (only 2 i can think of) bounced back up to their abilities from previous months.  Personally i have made it VERY clear to physicians that i will not willingly drop aricept.

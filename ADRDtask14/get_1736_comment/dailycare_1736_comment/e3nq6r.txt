Is Wifi available where your grandmother lives? If so I would recommend getting an Alexa from Amazon. It plays excellent music and no buttons. She would just say "Alexa play Christmas music". My mom has one and uses it for music. She had trouble remembering what station she liked so I put a sticky note by the Alexa that says "70's soft rock".

It also helps with other things, like lists, etc but my mom mainly asks about the weather and music. Also she asks what time it is a lot too.

not sure if this would work but have a look. Could also consider a device like Alexa, maybe a Christmas sale. You could set it up for her to just ask to play music. her voice has to be clear tho. My dad has PD and his voice fluctuates alot and his Alexa has a hard time with him. But you can even set her up an amazon prime acct and add her fav tunes to her playlist.
I'm sorry to hear that your grandma has trouble with radios. My grandpa is pretty much the same, except he has trouble with the TV. He doesn't like working with the remote because of...too many buttons. 

I was wondering if your grandma has a TV and has access to music channels. I think some music channels tune to Christmas music at this time of year. I have Comcast Xfinity and it offers a wide range of music channels called Music Choice. The channels are within the 400 range and I was able to locate Sounds of the Season on channel 441 (the channel plays music that goes with the season, such as Christmas as this time of year). Experiment with this with your grandma and see if she likes it. 

Hope this helps!
Hi, thank you for the advice. Unfortunately, she has a lot of trouble with names. She mixes things up a lot. For example, one of her favorite all time restaurant is called Domenic'sâ€¦ 2 years ago she started referring to it as Lorenzo's for some reason. She hasn't stopped calling it Lorenzo's. She does this with people's names too.

Keep it very simple. No passwords and simple labels for apps (as in, relabel "Gmail" to "email"). Consider usability, too. Lots of folks with dementia really struggle to learn new technologies. I got a tablet for my mum in her early stages, and at first she could only use it if I was with her. It was only a few months before she couldn't use it at all. She couldn't figure out how to charge it, even with labels stuck directly to the device explaining the procedure. I don't want to dissuade you completely, but please know that this is likely a very short term stop-gap solution.

Make sure you can troubleshoot. Remote access will go a somewhat long way. Maybe even wireless charging? Put a big sticker on the charging station, and something he knows nearby so you can direct him there over the phone.

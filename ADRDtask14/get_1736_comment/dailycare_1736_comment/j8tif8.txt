That is horrifying. Keep trying to get them on the phone and in the meantime can you get into her email and either block email from them or divert communication from them to your email address?
I have been in the same situation as your mother. Since the facility is uncooperative, see if your community has a department of aging with an ombudsman who will go there and communicate your concerns. My husband has a psychiatrist that found serious issues with his care so I moved my husband 6 weeks ago. Also, your parents have rights that the nursing home is to fulfill. They are in the contract . Take care.ðŸŒº
I would go there with a mask on and ask politely to speak to the manager.  There is no excuse for them not answering a damn phone at the care home.  Did you get all the contact info when he moved in?  We signed so many forms it was ridiculous.  You have to have something somewhere that sets out the terms of him living there.
Just wanted to say I am experiencing the same problem with the "care" facility my dad was placed in over the summer. If I call 10 times, they answer once. And the phone in his room has been out of service several times as well. I realize they aren't getting the help they once had from family members because of visitor restrictions and they have lost staff to Covid. But it is really frustrating to deal with. I'm sorry and hope it gets better for us both.

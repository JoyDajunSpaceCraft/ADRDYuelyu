Violence and delusions are unfortunately common symptoms of this disease.   Both can be managed with medications.  I don't know what you can do from 3 hours away, but his doctor can prescribe the necessary medications.  Could you talk to his doctor?  It would be really helpful if you had a recording of a violent outburst, or had the report from the elder services who witnessed it. 
It is usually better not to remind them they have dementia and just go along with whatever they say. They will usually forget in a bit and it avoids upsetting them. I would look into potentially getting your grandfather prescribed something to make him a little more calm. Unfortunately you are probably correct about having them put into a home sooner rather than later. Everyone can visit obviously, but it sounds like your family is getting tired and could finally take a bit of a breather and recoup.
I had to step in and remove my aunt from my mother's home because of the violence. You can try medication but start discussing where he can be placed. It's totally heart breaking but you have to be sure everyone is safe. I'm really sorry you're going through this but there are some hard decisions in the immediate future for your family

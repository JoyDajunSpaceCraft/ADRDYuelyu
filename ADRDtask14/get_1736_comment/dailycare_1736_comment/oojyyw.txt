You can apply on line for ssd and get a reply from them also if you need more documentation and if you do then get it or get a ssd lawyer
I would apply for it as soon as you can, and online, in my experience, was pretty straightforward. They do allow you time to get additional medical documentation if necessary. My husband has a brain injury but is still able to perform ADL's and can be left alone for periods of time, but was able to get SSD on the first attempt. If your Dad is not at retirement age, the application asks you to document how his condition prevents him from being employed. If head trauma and the additional issues are documented, it may be easier than you think to get him benefits.
Make dad a 'my social security' account. Apply online for both SSI and SSDI. If they reject dad for either they will tell you why and it'll help you understand how to reapply and get approved. PM me if you get stuck along the way I'm happy to try and troubleshoot since I did my father's applications for... well, everything.

Thank you so much for sharing your experience and advice with me. This helps a lot. I just didn't want to screw up the application without more info!
Thanks a lot! I've created a login but waiting on SSA to mail me a PIN (I think). It's been almost a month. Talked to them last week and they confirmed it was sent out 6/30 but still hasnt arrived. I'm just not used to the abysmal pace, I guess ðŸ™„
No problem Iâ€™m glad it was helpful.
They usually send that via text or email? Check the spam folder?
Yeah, I thought it was weird not to get it by email. SSA rep on the phone confirmed that it would come by mail due to security reasons.... I'm going to call again tomorrow just to check on it again.
I had to do the PIN by mail because I did not have my LO drivers license to upload it. It took a 3-4 weeks for pin to come.

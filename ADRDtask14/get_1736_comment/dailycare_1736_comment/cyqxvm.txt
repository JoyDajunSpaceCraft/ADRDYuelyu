I believe hallucinations are a symptom of Lewie body dementia. Hiding stuff...maybe paranoia of someone stealing their stuff?  I’ve seen that with non alzheimer dementia.
I’m sorry you’re starting this journey again. No one should have to be a caregiver to a dementia patient twice IMO. The advice below is assuming that your MIL’s issues are just starting.

I would make sure your MIL is supervised in the kitchen. Farther down the road, if she gets too bad, you may have to ban her completely. But, for now, just have someone there to make sure she doesn’t start a fire or blow up the microwave. You can always turn off the breaker to the kitchen if she would be in there solo. Best of luck.

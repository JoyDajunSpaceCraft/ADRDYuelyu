How old is your Mum?

My mum is almost 70. We started noticing things 4 years ago, she was diagnosed 2 years ago. We think she has Lewy Body dementia because she has a few indicators. She's had some mini strokes (TIAs), some apparent as she would be confused and some less so but they always effect her vision. After each one her dementia has progressed. Sometimes a little, sometimes hugely. She is still very much herself, just more limited due to the confines of dementia.
It started with getting confused in what she had asked and where she was going. The doctor recommended to quit smoking, lower her alcohol intake, increase exercise and to play board games, read and destress to help keep her mind active and under as little pressure as possible.
The GP can do, or refer your Mum, for some tests (simple tests like maths, sequencing, memory recall etc)

Wishing you the best.
So you are worried about your mother? Has she been like this before the fall? Or only recently after the fall? How old is she?

Home health care so you can take breaks? I respect the hell out of you.
Even small communities have home healthcare options.  DEFINITELY look into that.  Some can be costly, so talk to your mom about the costs and benefits, but if my family can do it in our little community (~1000 ppl), you can do it.  My grandpa is getting combative, so I know about the emotional issues as well. You are not alone, friend.
You are a great person. 
Make sure you have someone you can call on if you feel overwhelmed. Ideally someone who can come lend you a hand if needed. Even if you never need them, knowing that they are available can help you mentally.
I have to say I agree with all of the other suggestions to plan to ask for help. I would set up at least 4 times in the next 10 days to take a break. My first impulse was to deny all assistance. It was a HUGE mistake. You end up stressed which makes them stressed. Towards the end of the week your mother can sit with your father while you spend time doing something that genuinely makes you happy and call you if there is a problem. You need a break before then so ask a family member or close family friend to "stop by and chat" with your mom. This will give you an hour or two to bank a bit more happiness.

My father is in late stage vascular dementia.  I'm not sure he always knows who I am.  It hurts, but my mother says, "He didn't intend to forget you."  And it helps to know that he would never want to not know who I am.
I have dealt with my father who was diagnosed with early onset dementia in his early 50s. Vascular dementia. He’s in a nursing home now but it was a very difficult time when he lived with my boyfriend and I. 
Emotionally and physically it took a toll on me since I was his only caretaker. He declined rather quickly and watching him deteriorate the way he did week by week was heartbreaking. 
Unfortunately dementia takes the person you love and over time they lose all sense of themselves and what they know. 
All you can do really is make your grandmother comfortable, give her love, patience, and understanding. Keep her safe. No driving and pretty much adult/baby proof the house. Be aware that she may engage in behaviors and say things that will be completely out of her control. It’s part of the disease. Don’t take things personal if it’s negative. 
If you have help at home from family, that is a blessing. If not then don’t be afraid to ask for help, there are plenty of resources available. Also you have us here to vent. 
You kind of have to mentally prepare for the day when she will not longer recognize you. No one is ever ready for that though. My father doesn’t know my name and can’t really point out who I am if family is around. I just remind him who I am and talk about the good times that he is able to remember me from. 
You got this! I know it’s hard. You have support.
Don't worry about them, worry about yourself. Don't abandon them until you are unable to do the job yourself. It's sucks but that's life, some people go out fast with a heart attack, others go out slow.
 Take care of them because you love them but if you lose yourself you lose everything they worked thier whole life for.

Medications from the psychiatrist are your best option at this point IMO... they're the only thing that helped my mom. We tried CBD oil for a long time and didn't notice much of a difference.
Any type of medication or product would probably have to go through some doctor or specialist. 

Have you looked up any of the side effects? Does she take any other medication? Believe me, if you mix the wrong things together...you could ultimately make her emotions worse. 
We found a low dose of respiradone completely stopped the hostility/resistance/anger/explosive frustration.

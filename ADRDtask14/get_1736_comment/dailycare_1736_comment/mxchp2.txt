I overheard an interaction like this when my grandma was in rehab after breaking her hip. She accidentally dialed and I heard her shouting at the caregiver trying very hard to be nice to give her a bath. She claimed the caregiver was hitting her, but it clearly didn’t sound that way on the phone, they were begging her to cooperate. We told management to not punish the caregiver at all from the report, because my grandmother has a tendency to embellish and that we overheard the interaction and didn’t hear abuse happening. It’s not your fault.
We as caregivers have a duty to protect the Health and Safety of our clients. There is a line we have to respect, that they can refuse ALMOST anything.

Especially with dementia/memory care, and I/DD care, this can be very difficult. At my place of work, if they are Wet, we allow them to refuse a change for one hour. Then it's a Health and Safety risk and they must be changed. For Feces, it's 15 minutes. 

I find reminding them that I am trying to keep them safe and healthy SOMETIMES helps. It is a very difficult, often thankless job. The fact that you feel this way means you are a good caregiver, and very unlikely to cross that line. 

You did what you needed to to keep them safe and healthy. Remember that when it gets hard.
With Dementia, this is very common.  The thing to remember is that you are really dealing with a horrible disease and not the person anymore.  They will argue, scream, even become combative but again, this is part of the disease.

Just remember to chart their behaviors in case a change in meds or a new venue is required.

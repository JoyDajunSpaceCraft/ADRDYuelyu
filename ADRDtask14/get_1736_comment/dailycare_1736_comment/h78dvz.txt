I make a point of not thinking about things like that.  It does no one any good.
My in law is at a later stage of Parkinson’s. I don’t have a history of it in my family but I can’t help but think I could end up like her too.
Every human ages and gets disabilities. 100%. 

That is, unless they die before that :-)
Currently taking care of my girlfriend with cancer and I found a marble sized tumor in my leg. Looking it up on webmd didn’t help because it says it’s most likely a harmless type of fat tumor but there’s a one in a million chance it’s a sarcoma. Of course sarcoma is what my girlfriend has so knowing the low odds didn’t make me feel any better. I was crapping myself for a bit until I got it checked and they said it’s probably benign. I have nightmares about it all the time though
Most of health is luck. But we can do some things to improve our chances. Stay physically active, socially and cognitively engaged,  eat well, these things help
My family is not long lived so that may be a blessing for me.  My uncle, mother's brother had early onset Alzheimer's but that is the only one I know of.
Isn't everything on WebMD cancer?
My doctor says: " If you are 30 and in good health, thank vaccines.  If you are 50 and in good health, thank a rather stress free life.  If you are 70 and in good, thank your genes".

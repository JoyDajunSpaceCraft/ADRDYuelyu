My grandpa had a similar problem- he would forget that he had taken his meds and would take them again. There were multiple times where he overdosed and ended up in the hospital. I ended up getting him this dispenser and it has prevented overdoses for nearly 2 years. The lock is kind of a joke, but it's enough to convince grandpa that no one is taking his pills.

I use this one as well for a family member. The alarm stops when you turn it over and dump out that dose.  Now that things have progressed i still use it to ensure I remember to give meds at the appropriate times!

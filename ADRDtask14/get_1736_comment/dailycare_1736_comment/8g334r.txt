In the case of my mum, the lack of comprehension of what she is doing and physical/cognitive ability to still do it, have caused major issues and very dangerous situations. 

* She can still leave the house and use keys, but she struggles walking stairs without falling having resulted in falling and bruises.
* She still wants to cook but regularly chops food on plastic/wooden chopping boards on top of the stove which is hot (and before we switched to electric induction was still a life flame).
* She still joins my dad for activities like sailing but has fallen into the water 2 times in the last 2 years, and it's hard to help her out of the water in those situations. 

It's a constant fight with all involved to try to control the risks. She has light moments where she grasps her situation and is really sad when you deprive her of all this, but I somewhat expect that something like this could cause the ultimate end for her. 

Try to manage these risks, have a door alarm that will trigger for the carers, make sure she has no access to stairs if she is at risk of falling, make sure there are no ways she can exit the place without anyone noticing.

I’ve been thinking about doing this. How are you getting tested? Through something like 23andme?
You really should speak to a genetic counselor given the diagnosis of a directly family member of a condition like this - if it is confirmed. They can help you decide if a clinically validated test is warranted.

The raw data from direct-to-consumer tests generally test less than half of the known variants for any given condition, so while our Promethease reports will (usually) catch an important mutation if it's in your raw data, what was missed may be the important thing in your particular case. If your mother gets a genetic test and from that you learn of a specific mutation causing her condition, feel free to contact us privately (info@snpedia.com) and we can tell you which $99 company tests it (if any), but you'll still be best off with a clinically validated test sooner or later.
I’m gonna use AncestryDNA and then run the raw data through promethease.com and search from there. If I find anything of alarm I then plan to follow up with a geneticist or genetic counselor to ensure accuracy and to figure out what’s next. 
Like I said, that is why it’s kind of a starting point for me. I’m kinda hoping that once she is (most likely) diagnoses that she will go through genetic testing for both my and my sister’s sake
I did my testing at AncestryDNA and uploaded to Promethease. 
 Honestly, it was much more confusing than helpful.

My mom was diagnosed with early onset, and ever since she was I have been petrified that I'm on the same path.  I had hoped the testing would help give me something to talk to a doctor about, or to put my fears to rest.  
I hope my experience is better

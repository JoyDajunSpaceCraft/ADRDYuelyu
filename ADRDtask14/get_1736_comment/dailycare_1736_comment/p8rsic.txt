Even your husband has inklings that he doesn't want to share -- "My husband doesn’t feel comfortable “sharing his business” in detail with his sister because she tends to ramp up at every change"

And, on the other hand you're not his sister's caregiver -- "I’ve asked his sister to check on support groups for herself in the state she lives in but she doesn’t."

My 2 cents: emphasize honoring your husband's wishes, continue leaving your sister-in-law to her own devices.
You don’t have any kind of obligation to share anything, honestly, especially if it’s going to cause more stress for you, your husband, and kids. You all have enough on your plates without having to appease someone who is so far removed from the situation they have no idea what’s actually going on. 

It’s always so, so easy for someone to have the “magical cure” for someone that they don’t live with or speak to on a daily basis. 

If you *wanted* to play nice with his sister, you could always just thank her for the suggestions, ask her for resources, and tell her you’ll run it by his professional team to see what they think and just let it die there. Maybe it’ll help her feel better to think that she’s being helpful, and maybe it’ll cause less stress for the rest of you if you just pretend to go along with her “insight”.

* Her interference is only going to get worse.

* "We've got that covered." "That doesn't work for us." "Either support us with money or get out of the way."  (To buy respite care.) "His doctors are on it."
I am  caregiver to my wife and fully appreciate your stand.
No one understands this unless they are doing it. I’ve had friends tell me to “have patience,” or whatever, and I told them advice was not needed unless I asked (that will not happen). Told them to provide support or get back to me after my mom dies. 

Anyway, everyone is a lot more supportive now!

And FTD can go fuck itself. God, this disease is awful.
You owe her nothing. You need to do what is best for you and your husband. Tell her what you need to and move on. I’ve been known to just put the phone down and not listen to some and then pick up.  Most times they don’t notice but if they do just say you had to go help him with something and you have to go.  Best of luck, it’s a tough path for everyone.
This disease is so hard on the caregivers. You don’t owe anything to these backseat drivers. I’d start screening her calls.
She sounds like a "sister from California".

For anyone that offers suggestions to me on how to care for my husband I offer them the opportunity to come stay with him for awhile and  give me a break. For some reason that stops the suggestions! No one knows what this disease is like unless you’re living it. It’s hell.
I told myself this last week that I’m going to have to start screening calls and only take what I can without going nuts.
I do agree with the magical cure comment.   People tend to have a very small amount of knowledge about dementia but like to tell you what you should be doing.
Funny…. I’ve been grey rocking for five or more years and didn’t even know what it is called.  It is a very helpful skill to have
Yeah, I so much agree. I’ve posted before that one of his friends will talk to him for 20 minutes and say to me “wow he is doing really well” and what they don’t know is that the house has been in tears for two days because his behavior is so bad.  Through tears, I said to his sister on a bad day that things are so hard and she said “you have to remember that it is very hard for him too”.  That comment just deflated me even more.  He doesn’t have any awareness of how he is acting because of his lack of empathy. And he doesn’t live with the memories of the past behaviors before diagnosis that tore us all apart.  It is a sucky disease and a sucky spot to be in.  I don’t want sympathy or advice from her but it is irritating when everyone asks how HE is and not how I am.
God help me… this is how my brother and sister act toward my mother who I’m also the caregiver and DPOA for in a nursing home…. That is spot on!

I trust you, AMo2. Set boundaries, do what you can, be concrete when asking for help (tasks, food, items, time off). I believe in you. 

What a wild journey this is.
Thankfully my friends are really wonderful, but my sister just came in town for two months to take over and give me a rest, and she doesn’t have the same kind of friends. She’s so overwhelmed. She just had no idea. (She should probably tell them that, honestly.)

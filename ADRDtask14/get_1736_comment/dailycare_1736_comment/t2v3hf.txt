Going through a similar thing with a family member.  If it's the same GP who blew you off, I'd say, forget about the less and that s/he is an a$$.  I'm wondering if you can get a social worker or a therapist involved to help you get your parent to be a little more cooperative.
I am not sure what UK law is on this, but in the US, you can send that letter. Unless the patient has permitted the physician to speak to you about your parent then they cannot speak to you, but you can speak with them. As for pain, can she see an acupuncturist, chiropractor, or physical therapist? I would ask around your friends for recommendations for those services. Ask her if you could go for a massage together?
Here in the states I do family conferences. You all come into my exam room and we make a plan. Ask about Neuro Psych testing to get a bead on her mental status and have it documented. Start there.
This.  Is there a group in your area that works with the elderly?  There may also be a geriatric specialist you could contact at your health care provider.  That person could have access to your mom’s medical records.  I wish this sort of situation was easier.
She does see a physio and a chiropractor for the pain, and uses a TENS machine. It’s totally beyond all of that now, I don’t really know what else there is when your bones are just crumbling! Thanks for the advice, I think I will just send the letter and hope for the best!
There are drugs to maintain, but unfortunately nothing to my knowledge that really regrows bone to its former condition. I am really sorry.
Aye, pain management would be the only thing I’d expect them to explore I think!
I would still ask your own physician these questions. Explain it relates to your mother, and in a in general way because she is not their patient, what would they suggest if a patient presented with these factors. As for pain management, maybe medical marijuana would help her?

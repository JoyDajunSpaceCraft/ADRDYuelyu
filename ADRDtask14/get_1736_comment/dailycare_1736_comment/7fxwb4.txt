My family has the hereditary form of this terriable disease. Family members have excellent results self medicating with cannabis. The problems occur when they get arrested and sent to rehab in non legal states.
The earlier she starts the better. We just recently started giving my mother CBD in some form and while it doesn’t necessarily help, she’s not getting worse. I’d say it’s probably a touchy subject for some people so do your own research and if you and your mom think it’s a good treatment plan then do what’s best. If you’re in a legal state go to the dispensary and talk to them about it, good ones will have great information for you. Good luck!

I’m not 100% sure what form of dementia my father has exactly but marijuana has definitely helped sooth the anxiety that sparks in him. It makes him much more lively and inhibits his desire to sit in the basement and withdraw from all of us. 

I can’t speak to if it helps with the disease, my opinion is it doesn’t, but it helps my dad live a more normal life. 

Be careful when purchasing from a friend or dealer. Different strains do have different effects. Some batches make my dad really chatty and excited and can hinder his ability to relax and go to sleep. Others can really mellow him out and help him relax. Without knowing what type I am getting, every time I purchase any for my parents is a crap shoot. Until it becomes easier to purchase in NJ we are basically at he mercy of whatever is in the bag. 

Overall, I would recommend it. It really has helped my father. 

I hope this helps.

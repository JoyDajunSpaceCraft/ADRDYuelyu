There are permanent iron-on tags and permanent marker that can be used. I’ll see if I can find links.

Even better, you can order pre-printed labels to iron on.  I did a quick google search and got a few options, such as this link:  https://www.itsminelabels.com/product-category/iron-on-labels/


Edit to add link and preamble to link.
Avoid sharpie, it fades after multiple washes and I'm sure the facility will not wash the clothes gently. Use a fabric marker at minimum to mark the clothes. 

If you are looking for name tags read reviews from parents who send their kids to camp. When I worked as a counselor there were "good" iron on tags that stayed for 4 weeks and survived being wet and the washing and there were "bad" labels that kids could literally peel off with their fingers.
In the uk it’s very common to put a label in kids school uniform, given we have uniforms so every kid has the same jumper etc. you can easily buy online little labels (that you can have personalised) that you can sew in, or iron in although they aren’t as secure.

You can buy a laundry sharpie "rub a dub" which has worked really well on my kids school clothes
Thank you!
Good luck, I hope you find something. 
My grandmother (in law) had a similar labels ironed on to her clothing, and those things did not come off!

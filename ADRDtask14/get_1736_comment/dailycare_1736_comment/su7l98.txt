From what I have gathered, nursing homes are more concerned with assets than the ability to go into debt.
I've filled out applications for my grandmother for both skilled nursing and memory care. They do not care about the resident's credit score, only their assets and ability to pay. I wouldn't worry about his credit scores, but good job cancelling the cards. His son should also freeze his credit to prevent any further accounts being opened.
Credit scores are used to assess risk when taking out loans. Unless there is some sort of situation where they get something akin to a mortgage, credit scores should not be relevant to the process. If they were looking at assisted living, which sometimes has rental agreements similar to a standard apartment lease that might play a role. But nursing homes don't tend to work like that in my experience.
Check with an Elder care lawyer.
I advise you to post this question also in r/personalfinance . A lot of knowledgeable people there.

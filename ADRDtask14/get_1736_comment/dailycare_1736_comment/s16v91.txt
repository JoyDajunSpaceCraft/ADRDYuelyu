Yikes! Hang in there, this may be the hardest thing you ever do in your life that if you don’t guilt may kill you. (Or not how do I know….anyhoo)

is mom adverse to adult daycare? It would be nice if she agreed to try it for a week. She will be so worn out she will sleep like an exhausted puppy. (Totally in my head picturing seniors in a doggy daycare setting). It works for a reason

See if you can identify activities that she is either exoressed an interest or has an interest. Quilting, bingo, crafts, whatever. That may help. And if not honesty-mom I need you to give this a try.   


hang in. You are so young to be dealing w this. Adults twice your age would struggle too. If not making talk to her dr about sleeping medication for mom. You need to be rested to handle life.

Its perfectly natural, after someone close passes away it affects you, i learnt what death was when my bro passed, but didnt really know what death meant until he was lowered into his grave. Many years later my grandma and 3 close friends left this earth, it was devestating but it also desensitised me on  death. Sometimes, ill be low on cash and buy a cheap beer and remember arguing with one of my friends in rest, how he would want quantity over quality on alcohol, or how i my granny sowed my my clothes whenever i buy clothing at the mall, when i play with my children, i remember i promised my brother id play with him the same way if he got better, its like a sudden memory , and it hurts, but it doesnt help to dwell on the past
Thanks for responding so quickly. You're completely right that dwelling on the past is useless, but it happens sometimes despite my best efforts to not do so. Something as small as a similar facial expression or small habit triggers these memories and all I remember is the pain and the hopelessness of life in general.

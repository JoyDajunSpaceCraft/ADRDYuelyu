OMG yes! I have just gone through a hellish week of being accused of stealing my mother’s entire bank account because I am terrible with my own money and have accumulated horrendous debts - none of which is remotely true. The “expert advice” says you should just deflect from delusions and false accusations, but that doesn’t work with my mother (who has had vascular dementia for years now); she is terribly distressed by these beliefs, will not change the subject, and wants to be convinced they’re not real. But it is so very difficult because she “knows” they are true; her computer told her so! I can show her the real bank statement etc but she doesn’t understand what she’s seeing, and 2 minutes later she’s forgotten what I showed her anyway. When I finally do succeed in convincing her she has made a mistake, she relaxes, cries tears of relief and is happy again - only to forget the next day and start all over in a fury. It makes me crazy.
Good luck with your dad. Paranoid delusions are common in dementia. I wish there was an easy solution.
My mother in law was convinced I was trying to poison her for about a month.  She would not take medicine or food from me, and often tried to leave our house to get away from me.  It is very frustrating.  WE did end up putting her in a nursing home when she became too dangerous to keep at home, and she started trying to leave all the time at all hours of the day and night.
It’s so hard. My mom was regularly calling her sister to cry to her about how mean & abusive I was to her. All over not allowing her Tylenol because it was too soon (multiple times!) 

She would threaten to sell her house & move in to assisted living, which at that point sounded like a BRILLIANT idea. Unfortunately, she never wanted to follow through! 😂

Let me add, I was the one who had to dial her because she couldn’t figure out how to work her phone to do it. 🤦‍♀️
This is really common, unfortunately. My mother would tell people we were trying to kill her, that she hadn’t been fed, all kinds of things. It will pass but that too is an unfortunate sign as it generally means the person has lost more cognitive ability.
try to keep in mind that when they're at this stage they're like children and they're not responsible for their actions so don't take it personally others might have shared that advice  but it's an important thing to remember in your relationships with people with dementia.
My Dad was convinced the post office was stealing his mail.
Yes, but not that extreme. A few months before my grandmother went to a nursing home temporarily, she would randomly ask if we were trying to poison her when giving her morning medications. My mom mentioned it and because I never gave my grandmother meds, I didn't know. Fast forward to a day I had to stay home and sure enough, she holds the pills and says "Are you trying to overdose me?" I assured her no, and went through every pill and explained it to her and even told her that the pills would allow her to keep having candy (one was for diabetes and it was true). She took them and that was that. 

We never experienced anything like you OP but those small moments were noted.
This is where my mom is but no nursing homes are doing admissions right now. She's wearing my dad out being up all night talking and leaving the house.
How long did she last like that? Its daunting
How  long did  it last for you? Its daunting because we have family who is stupid and denial that he has dementia and is severe.
We are in the same situation stuck until May 15th minimum to get him admitted.
We put her on Aricept & it was a night and day difference. She’s doing so much better and we’re hoping to keep her at home as long as possible. 

My husband’s mother is in a memory care facility and his sister is the one who primarily deals with her and she’s been declining mentally & is at this stage of dementia where she thinks people are out to get her. 

MIL has had swollen feet, and in an effort to remedy it at the facility instead of going to the hospital with this pandemic, his sister has been rearranging her mom’s suite to help keep her moms feet up to reduce the swelling. His mom called my husband yesterday to complain that his sister had been messing with her furniture against her will. 🙄

My husband told her that she needed to be nice to his sister & that she was only  trying to keep her out of the hospital. Then his mom asked when we were coming to visit. 🤦‍♀️
I’m trying to remember - it was several years ago. I think it lasted t least 6 months and probably more like a year or so. To tell you the truth after a certain point it just all blurred so it is hard to say when specific milestones happened. But at some point she had another mini-stroke and cognitively shifted downward again. I completely understand about the denial - my father continues to think she is not nearly as bad as she is and has ever since this started. I’m sorry you have to deal with that! It is hard enough to deal with the person who has dementia, much less having to deal with people who are I. Denial and likely getting in the way of treatment or any necessary measures.
Same here & it seems like a long way off.
Well its june 1st thanks to ca governors

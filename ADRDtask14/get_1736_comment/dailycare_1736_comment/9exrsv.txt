There are many forms of dementia besides Alzheimers. Sounds like she's had some significant personality changes, which could be an early sign of some kind of dementia. It would be reasonable to have her checked out by a neurologist, if you can get her to go. 
Sounds like she at least needs to see a neurologist and have some testing done. It could be some form of dementia. 
Doesn't hurt to start with a physical, including complete bloodwork, and urinalysis.

(For those of us who've ever had a bladder infection, this is about as counter-intuitive as it gets, but older people can have a bladder infection without feeling any symptoms.  And the un-treated bladder infection brings on cognitive and memory issues that look just like alzheimer's.  You hear pretty regularly in dementia forums something along the lines of "Well, I thought she was "gone", she went down hill so fast, but then she got treated for a bladder infection, and lo and behold, she got ***way*** better again!"  Given that you've been noticing changes over a few years, bladder infection doesn't seem likely, but it's so easy to check, might as well, just in case.)

Also, undiagnosed depression is sometimes at the root of cognitive and memory changes in older people.  Ten-fifteen years ago, when my mom started going down hill, her primary care physician wanted to put her on anti-depressants, basically the thinking was "Let's see if anti-depressants help, if they do, then it's depression, not alzheimer's".

Given that your mil is in a long-term high-stress situation regarding the bil, depression seems worth investigating...

And if physical doesn't turn up any issues, her primary care physician could then refer to a neurologist...

Good luck!

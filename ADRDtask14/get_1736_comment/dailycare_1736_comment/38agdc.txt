We had this issue. He only qualified for 20 hours a week and she qualified for 40. She went into the hospital and her person wasn't there, so we had to take off and care for him. The insurance company had to reevaluate his condition before approving more time, which he should have been getting to begin with, but the process was slow. We ended up having to use his short term respite stay when our vacation time ran out. Which worked out as she was unable to return home and ended up discharging to the care home we chose for him. 

Once their initial eval and assessment is done, it takes forever to get a reassessment. 

FYI, if he was ever deployed to a combat zone, he likely qualifies for VA aid and attendance. It is a cash benefit that can help pay for a private caregiver if his insurance company won't approve more time. It takes a while to get, but it helped us tremendously. They'll also give a benefit for a disabled spouse of a veteran.

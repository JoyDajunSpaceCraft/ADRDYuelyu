From what I've read, one of the last things to go I appetite. It might only be days now, but I'm not 100% positive. If she's not already in a 24 hour assisted living, now is the time and maybe a nurse can help you through this. Sorry your family is going through this and good luck
Hard to say. Things sometimes go from worse to a new worse plateau unfortunately. Also, she may have a UTI or something else that’s bothering her that she cannot communicate. You said she likes to still eat an ice cream cone. She might have difficulty bow recognizing utensils.
Many people with dementia crave ice cream. I'm not sure why.
You may want to ask the hospice doctor to evaluate her again? The reason am asking is that   when my dad was admitted to hospice (in Texas) the only way he got in was by a doctor certifying his condition as within 18 months of death and he died 10 months later. 

Of course, it’s impossible to make an exact death prediction, but would expect that hospice can help with this request if y’all choose to do so.
Their minds are regressing to childhood stage? They may not recognize utensils or remember how to use them, but they haven't forgotten ice cream cones yet?

My mum did this. With affection, my husband and I called her a sheep dog because she'd round up anybody who left the room. In my mum's case, I think she was often trying to keep track of real people versus hallucinations. She could follow real people, but hallucinations would disappear. 

We never figured out a way to distract her, and to be honest we just got used to being followed and eventually started inviting her so we could manage her wardrobe. It was only a problem when we were using the bathroom. What did help was speaking to her doctor; we tweaked her medicine and she became considerably less anxious. With less anxiety, she didn't panic when people left the room. 

Solidarity, empathy, and hugs for you!
Thank you! I really appreciate this! 

We are working with the doc for a different dose of meds. She has taken to sneaking out of the house and sitting in a chair on the driveway waiting for her husband to return...a stressful dynamic which I'm sure you have some familiarity with!

Could a gate at the top of the stairs help?
We put a slide lock at the base of the door we could slide with our foot. Because it was at the floor dad never noticed it. Worked like a charm.

We tried one of those cheap alarms but it would scare the crap out of us because we would forget. Lol
Put a lock on the door that can be locked so she cant get out. But she will probably throw a fit about it.

I would probably recommend asking about increasing her antipsychotics (tranqs) to keep her more sedated and less likely to wander.

Its sad to drug up your loved ones, but its for her own good and safety.
Ive heard of giant door sized posters that look like bookshelves so they can't find the door anymore. 
Theres some door hider things (and other stuff) on here:

Here's also some lists about it. Wandering is a pretty common thing i think.

For my dad, we ended up putting up a perimeter chain link fence with a padlock on it. He did quite a bit of wandering before that though. Luckily he was always returned. He had a medical bracelet but he always took it off. My dementia grandma had a bracelet but never took it off. Everybody different :p
Thank you all for the suggestions. Ill put some of these to work immediately!

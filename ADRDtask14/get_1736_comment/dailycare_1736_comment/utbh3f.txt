I'm so sorry you're going through this with what seems to be no adult support. It is absolutely admirable that you're trying to help your grandparents, but you're at a critical time in your life and your grandma's condition will likely only require more and more time/resources, which you shouldn't have to give.

  
Are you in the US? If you are, since your grandpa is unwilling to get your grandma the care she needs (given she's barely eating, too nauseous to walk, etc), and your parents don't seem to be in the picture (?), it seems like you need to call Adult Protective Services (search that term and your state). APS investigates cases of elder abuse, neglect, and self-neglect. Don't be scared by the word "neglect," your grandpa almost certainly won't get in trouble. It's extremely common that family members get way over their head in terms of caring for their loved ones and/or are in denial about their loved ones' needs. APS will send an investigator to your grandparents' home to talk to them and check out their home. Since the adults in your life aren't hearing your concerns about your grandma, maybe APS can convince them.

We're not qualified to make a diagnosis but it sounds like it's time for her to see a doctor.

I am 64,  that is not normal.  Get a doctors appointment for her :)

Also make sure they check to see if she has a UTI :)
> Edit: I realize it is silly to ask reddit for a formal diagnosis, I mean  are these concerning signs that could mean anything and would need a  doctor’s help? 

Yes, they definitely are.  Write all this into an e-mail and send it to her doctor, along with any recordings you have of her lashing out.  She needs to know about these drastic behavioral changes, and can recommend next steps.
Yes, it sounds like a consult with a neurologist is in order.
Could also be hyperthyroidism. Usually one of the first things to be ruled out on the road to a diagnosis of dementia. She needs bloods done with thyroid levels requested.
yeah i realize it’s stupid to ask for a formal diagnosis but i just wanted advice on what to do really, i’ve never seen her like this
Teepa Snow is absolutely amazing
It could just be something out of whack like a nutritional thing or a UTI, which are correctable. I hope for her sake and yours that's all it is. Dementia in any form is horrible.

Apple TV can be controlled from a smart phone.  If it's a smart TV, you can open YouTube videos on your phone, and "cast" them to the TV. But your phone must remain open and on.  If that's inconvenient, any old iPad or iPhone on the house's wifi would work.
yeah there are several apps you can use, just type "universal remote." you can also cast media from your phone/laptop to her TV (assuming it's a smart TV), so you could set up a playlist and just hit "next" whenever she wants.
Install an app on your phone that is compatible with the Tv so you can change channels wirelessly.

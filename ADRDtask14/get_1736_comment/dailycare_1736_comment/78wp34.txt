I got some no lines, they're terrible. 

Maybe try different glasses, an old pair?

Cataracts?
It’s common for perception to be affected by dementia, whether it be spacial awareness or glossy surfaces appearing to be wet.
Vision can be affected in many ways and it is completely normal.
My grandfather has complained about his vision, but the doctor says his glasses prescription is perfectly fine and suited to his needs. 

I honestly believe it's just part of the disease.
I agree with the "spatial" vision problems; my grandmother has freaking 20/20 vision, but because of the dementia, will take about six tries to "find" something right in front of her. I've also read stories where peoples' family member reacted to different flooring styles; some people need a mat in the bathtub because without one the tub looks like a bottomless pit to them, or putting a rug in front of the inside of the front door kept the family member from going wandering because again, bottomless pit.
Cataract surgery last fall and new glasses since.  He's been wearing the new glasses and the old glasses at different times (both no-line bifocals), says the old glasses are better - more based on habit, I think, than anything else. With the macular degeneration in both eyes I don't know what he can see but reaching for something and not getting close is something I haven't noticed before.
This is my understanding as well.

It’s also worth mentioning that different types of dementia affect vision in different ways. For example, with vascular dementia, moving objects can appear to be broken up making it difficult to know exactly where they are.

Hope you’re all able to adjust, /u/MET1 and help him to live well with the disease.

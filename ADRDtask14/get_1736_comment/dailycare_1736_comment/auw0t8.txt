I worked in an alzheimers and dementia residency for my internship in college. Most families don't visit, for many reasons, usually because it's just too damn hard when your loved one can't remember you. But we did have one son who came and visited his mom 5 times a week. She didn't remember him, but he still came and told stories and talked to her like nothing changed.
I know it was difficult for him, but he loved her and did everything he could to help.

I hope you have someone in your life like her son.

What I recommend is having the conversation now with your loved ones about the possibility of it getting worse and what they should expect. Being reminded of things and talking like it's no big deal and nothing is wrong is really important.

Its going to be difficult, but stay strong and keep your loved ones close
I’m so sorry and can understand your fear. I hope your friends and family can understand and you have people who will be there for you. You will have people stand by you. Just try and live to the fullest while you can :)
How is your health overall? Are there any lifestyle changes you can make that can help improve memory? More exercise, better diet, etc. 
I experienced this and with Alz in my family was terrified. It turned out to be anxiety and ADHD. Don't leap to the worst possible conclusions. Get yourself a good psychiatrist and advocate for yourself until you have answers.
Is that possible to have alz at 29?
She has lesions on her brain, not anxiety and ADHD. They ruled out MS but don't know what is going on yet. She's been dealing with this since she was a teenager.
Apparently yes but very rare. There's also evidence that the disease sometimes begins decades before symptoms develop. I'm sure there's plenty of room for all kinds of situations, this would obviously be an outlier but still possible.
I didn’t say she did have those things, I said I did.

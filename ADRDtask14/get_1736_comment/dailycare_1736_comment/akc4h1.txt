You don't. Caregiving changes you in a fundamental way, and not always for the better.

There are ways to mitigate this, though. Take 'you' time regularly, have activities that take you away to recharge, and know when to walk away from the patient if needed, if only to recharge your own endurance. 

I do this when my wife is being unreasonable, and she accuses me of neglecting her. I simply let her do that, then come back when I've cooled off. 

Willpower is like a muscle -- stretch it beyond its limits, and it snaps. It's as much managing yourself as it is the people under your care.

All the best! 
Taking breaks and reminding myself to look forward and stay focused on my own intentions help me shake off bad feelings. I hope you find some strategies that work for you.
Every day
This is what I needed to hear today.

My wife has been incredibly sick this month, between my job and her I don't feel like I have time to even clean the house up. Dishes have piled up and I'm barely staying on top of laundry. Family lives to far away to help out right now and I'm just being overwhelmed. Every day I feel like I'm going to burst and yet I absolutely unequivocally love her and will tend to her... I just need like 2 or 3 hours and I can't find it.

But that's it, today, right after I hit submit, I'm going to check up on the wife and let her know I'm going to be in the living room playing some games and unless it's bathroom important I need this time. 
You're welcome! How did it go? 
Pretty okay, feeling a little bit easier at least.

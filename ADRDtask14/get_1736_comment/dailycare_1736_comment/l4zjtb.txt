There are a lot of reasons that someone could have memory issues. Not all, or even most, are dementia related. He should probably get checked out, it could be something as simple as stress or a nutritional deficiency. Don't borrow trouble until there's a reason. Robin Williams knew what was happening to him and knew the prognosis and chose to end his life rather than go through that and put his family through it.
Your dad needs to have a complete blood work up and see a neurologist.  My husband’s neurologist ordered a brain MRI first. 

My husband’s family ignored his early signs of dementia. It’s so important to treat it early to preserve brain function. First, the cause must be identified. 

My question is, do you think it’s possible that your dad was hinting he would kill himself if he suspects he has dementia? Ask him. Ask him if he had a plan. I just lost a friend to suicide. He didn’t have dementia. He had a different debilitating neurological disorder related to age. I’d do anything to have him back.

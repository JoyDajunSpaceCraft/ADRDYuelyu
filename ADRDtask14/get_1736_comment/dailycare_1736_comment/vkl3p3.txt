Find a new doctor. Call the state licensing board and file a complaint against the old one.
The hospital Dr ordered home health services; you don’t need to get the PCP involved. Call the hospital discharge planner (usually a social worker) and let them know what happened. If that doesn’t work, take your dad to the ER and say that you need to learn how to manage his suprapubic; the home health nurse didn’t come and you’re concerned that he doesn’t feel well. That will get the hospital’s social worker and Dr’s attention!; they don’t want a readmission!

Then get a new PCP.
Advocating for services is hard. I’d imagine he is on Medicare? Call the hospital and let them know he is at risk of readmission and needs services. They should help you coordinate. Don’t lol back at that POS PCP - just move forward asserting the follow up care you need.

FYI if he is readmitted within 30 days the hospital gets dinged. Don’t downplay his needs and highlight the complexity of his case.
what is a PCP?

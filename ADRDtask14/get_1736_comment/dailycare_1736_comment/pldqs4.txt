Believing things are stolen is a common issue with dementia patients. My mom blamed my dad and I frequently. Most of the literature and people I‚Äôve spoken with say it‚Äôs best to play along with it. You can‚Äôt reason with them and they‚Äôll never believe they are wrong. Maybe let the facility know you are having this issue and ask if you can ‚Äúfile a report‚Äù with them (not really, but pretend to put her at ease) or like you suggested, just commiserate. I know it probably goes against your nature, but LYING TO DEMENTIA PATIENTS IS OKAY. Anything you can do to help them stay calm, comfortable, and safe is okay.

Ask the facility‚Äôs therapist  what works best. Or even mom, how can I help.  Or I‚Äôm sorry that happened. Dementia is so cruel
This is so common.  Mom loses stuff and is convinced that people are stealing from her.  Nobody is going to steal your chapstick, Mom.  

Changing the subject is the only way I cope.  Commiserating feeds the fantasy, disproving it happens just makes her feel attacked.
Thanks, everyone, for your inputs. After I got home last night, mother called to ask that I bring her some bobby pins next time I come. I've taken her 4 cards of them in the last two months. She can't possibly have lost all of them yet. She hides things and then forgets where she put them (like M&Ms under the loveseat). Which feeds into her delusion about people stealing from her.

I guess I'll just commiserate unless the staff suggest another approach.
My father has Alzheimer's and he is convinced my mother and I are stealing his money. We just ignore him and change the subject because no one can tell him otherwise.
Check with the MD. I was told the antidepressants could make delusions worse due to increased seratonin. We stopped the antidepressants and moved to an antipsychotic (had an evolving cocktail which settled onto a single one) and that has helped tremendously with the delusions of theft and harm.

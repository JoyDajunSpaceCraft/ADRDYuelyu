I bought my dad this:  [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CRM84W8/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o09\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CRM84W8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 

It tells him if it's morning, afternoon, evening, etc. plus the day and date. It's even customizable for different languages.
You can get wall clocks specifically for people living with dementia that have the day and date on them. They are quite large so easy to read.

Otherwise have a look for an electronic calendar that changes itself.
I have seen the wall clocks work very well. 

For my Mam I used an app called RecallCue. 

I got a small android box for like 60 quid. And I plugged it into a spare tv in the kitchen. 

it has the day and date on it. But what I love is that from my phone no matter where I am I can push a message to it. For example you  could say "Take your tablets " or something else "did you eat today" For Mam I used to send photos of us to it, to give her a lift .

My mom has pieces of paper that she just swaps for the day. It's in big print and very easy to find out in the open.  That seems to help for her partner!
OP I hope you find something that helps. Best wishes to you and your family.

Get a couple of the electronic clocks, they have big numbers with day of week, month, year, etc, some talk back.

Put them where he will see them, in that sense I have failed with my mother in law, she dosen't notice the clock, but it doubles as a night light so that is something.
I’m sorry, but you are wasting your time and making him anxious with your demands that he LEARN.

He is in the forgetting phase of his life and CANNOT LEARN and retain.  

By hassling him about this, you create anxiety and new problems. Spend your energy finding a workaround rather than the useless approach of MAKING HIM LEARN AND COMPLY.
Maybe you could explain why it is important for your grandfather to remember what day it is? 

Then we can put our thinking caps on to help you to find a way to arrange things so that he doesn't have to remember what day it is. Because that's what it will take.
Thanks a lot, my mother and I were contemplating buying one of those. We will buy two of them so that there's one by his bedside and one where he sits all day. Apparently you can even put messages on some of them so we're thinking about planning messages with "Time to have lunch" at noon and "Time to get dinner" in the evening as he always forgets to eat.
I bought one and it took a couple of months of me pointing at it every time he asked the day.  I think he's got it now though.
Got one of those clocks for my father for this reason.
If they can’t relate the clock information to what that means.... 
People with ALZ cannot learn.
Thanks a lot it's a fantastic idea! We will definitely use it or something similar.
I like this idea a lot.  So are you using the Spare TV as the display and the android box for the app?  I'm probably answering my own question but I'd like to try this a solution for my Mom too.  I don't want to take over her TV but I 'think' I'd have to place a pretty large tablet somewhere where she can see it and then I can push message to it.  This would alleviate so many repeated phones calls throughout the day to remind her of things that come as a complete surprise no matter how many times/ways we say it.
They're looking for a work around - that's why this was posted. But, you should know there was a New York Times article a month or so ago that described some tests on how dementia patients CAN learn. There are a lot of conditions, of course, but that was interesting to read. I'll update with the link later
I agree with your point, but consider that your use of all caps makes your message come across as needlessly aggressive; OP has good intentions and that's why they're asking for help.
The OP does explain that; because he has different visitors/events each day.
This is specifically designed for dementia sufferers. It has large numbers/letters that give the day and date.

Reading the day is not a new skill. Some models have an audio that will say the day/date/time.

No new skills required.
exactly - a spare tv and an android box for the app. but you could totally use a tablet and just put it somewhere she walks by every day. Maybe clear all apps off the home page and just put one shortcut to this app for her, in case it ever closes down. 

Im sure you could even install a remote control app on the tablet to make sure the app is open and working for your mam, from your own phone.
Well, I’d be interested to see that.

The fact that the grandfather has different visitors/events each day doesn't explain why the grandfather has to remember that he does. Or, that he has to remember who will or even is visiting him. Or what they will be doing, or again, even what they are doing.
Fine.. old skills are being discard without warning.
I had an 
ALZ phone for my mother that was equipped with pictures.   A waste, she couldn’t manage it.  THOSE SKILLS WERE GONE and not coming back.
Dementia patients do learn their way around a nursing home, they learn familiar faces there, albeit slowly and they may have more trouble with names if they learn them at all. They learn how to use a walker. They learn differently and more slowly, but they can still learn.
Here it is -  [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/health/dementia-rehabilitation.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/health/dementia-rehabilitation.html)
Oh my goodness. Yes, I see I totally misread. You are definitely not aggressive at all. So sorry to besmirch your good name and mislabel your obviously sunny disposition!
Not sure why you are angry, OP was simply asking for some ideas to overcome a difficulty their loved one is having.

These people are still on their journey and every little hint or tip can make their lives a little easier.
None of this matches my experience with actual Alzheimer’s disease.  Not at all, and I don’t recognize it from the special ward we were in for 16 months.  People with Alzheimer’s DO NOT LEARN.  they are forgetting.

This jerk has repeatedly trolled /r/alzheimers in the [past](https://reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/b1rmkb/beyond_the_tide_a_short_film_i_directed_that/eio28o5/), hurling [abuse](https://reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/b1rmkb/beyond_the_tide_a_short_film_i_directed_that/eio07fk/) and even [gaslighting](http://reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dkxugi/how_to_make_someone_with_alzheimer_know_what_day/f4nspyb/).

What makes you think I'm angry? Is it the name-calling? The personal attacks? Oh wait, both of those are you. I simply criticized your tone in a perfectly reasonable way. In fact, I didn't even say you were necessarily *being* aggressive; I said you were *coming across* that way. You could've ignored me or simply commented that that wasn't how you intended it. Instead, you're lashing out quite childishly.
Why haven't the mods blocked him or at least removed the abusive comments if this is ongoing? I guess they must not be active. Too bad.
I have reported you. Absolutely disgraceful behaviour.
I love how triggered you are.  Please stay away from people with ALZ.  

They need calm loving people and you are merely a vituperative troll at this point.
What have I said that gives you the impression that I am not calm?
[removed]
I'm not sure what has set you off, but it's clearly not *actually* about me, since all I did to set off this bizarrely escalating set of personal attacks is say your tone came across badly.

ETA: I reported your subsequent rule-breaking comments (personal attacks), not your original comment.

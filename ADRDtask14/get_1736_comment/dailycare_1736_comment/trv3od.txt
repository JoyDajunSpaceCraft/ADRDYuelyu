Don't try and figure this out on your own.  Set up an appointment with an Elder Attorney who can explain all of this to you and assist in Medicaid Applications and VA info.  Good luck.
My mom was placed in a nursing home because my dad was unable to care for her at home. My sister and I did the financial aid paperwork and were given a priceless gift. My dad had opened a line of credit (not a good idea) to pay off my mother's credit card debt. When he did that, her name was not on the title or deed or loan, so she was able to get approved for Medicaid, so it turned worked out. The facility took her social security and and we had a set amount to pay from her pension each month.

Flip side, my dad developed dementia and the 5 of us decided that we were NOT going to place him, because we would have had to sell his home, use all his savings, take his pension, social security and the partial pension he was getting from mother's employer. I was his POA and we took care of him for 2 1/2 year 24/7 in his home until he died at home on hospice with his children, grands and great grands there, in June
Check with someone about this but I believe there is some sort of Medicaid rule that will let the spouse still live in the home. If that is correct, get him settled and IMMEDIATELY set up an "Irrevocable Trust " with an eldercare attorney and put the house in it!! Then, after 5 years, she will be able to get Medicaid and medicaid can't touch the house!
OP, do this. Medicaid varies by state. You need a local expert.
I second this.

An elder care attorney can help secure the house and advise on how to protect family assets.  You should also call Medicaid for help

Unfortunately that’s dementia. I’m surprised, is there no carers on the ward?
Maybe try xposting to /r/legaladviceuk...

Good luck.
Really sorry to hear this. Are there any security cameras installed? I would ask permission to get one in your gran's room, even if she is in her own private room. I think you need to be wary about the carers also - you just never know and most likely, elderly ladies are more vulnerable. It is reality. I absolutely applaud you for caring so much and if possible, try to figure out a way to keep her at home, with carers and her own nurse. This is probably going to cost upwards of 100k, but it is the best option, if you can afford it. I have been through this, you don't want to know the gory details, but this is some of my advice on the security end of things. This nightmare will only get worse otherwise. Also, sort out power of attorney just to be safe. 
The nursing staff were all at the nurse station while one young staff member tried to wrangle this wee man back to his bed.  It's truly terrifying as my gran is never ill so we don't know how to navigate this.
Thanks for the tip
Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate them 
Have u spoken with the nurses?
I voiced my concern along with my mum and we were brushed off, we were also the only relatives visiting someone so I think they're probably used to people not asking questions. We're trying to make an appt to speak with the consultant but her immediate safety is my concern first and foremost , its just so heartbreaking
I know it is, any chance u can bring grandma home?
That's what we're trying to navigate as we know what her usual baseline behaviours are like (this is a woman who usually attends a day club 5 days a week and interacts despite her dementia) but a doctor made a decision on her whilst she had an infection which contributed to her confusion and now we cant pin him down to have a meeting. Its like being in a nightmare and you can't wake up.

My dad took it for about 18 mos.  He was part of the original study.  While I can’t say how he would’ve been without it, he made remarkably slow progress in his disease during that time, and has declined quite a bit since then.  But, who knows how it would’ve been if he hadn’t started, or had stayed on (he couldn’t as the study was terminated prematurely).  He did have the brain bleed side effect, although it cleared up when he went off the meds for a month or two (so they could see if it would clear up).  He also had retinol bleeds.  While that is not a stated side effect, it does seem logical that it could be.  Once he was off the meds, his retinol bleeds ceased.
Thank you for replying KeekyPep. 

Sorry to hear your Dad is declining. 

How did you know he had the brain bleed?  Confusion?
No, when he was in the study they did regular MRIs to look for this as it was a known side effect

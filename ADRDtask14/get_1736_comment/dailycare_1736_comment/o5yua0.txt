I put an Apple air tag on my dog.  Works great if you’re already using find my phone app anyway.
You are super proactive and I admire you.
We use a tile and Fitbit; both with GPS tracking.
Hi u/Grets888 check out Tack GPS tracker,  
   
it has 30 days of battery life, so you don't have to keep charging it daily like those watch type of trackers.  
It has notification alert for tracker enter/leaving pre-set safe zone areas.   
It works indoors and outdoors  
It is also very small and light (30g), can be attach to belt or keychain.   
lastly the monthly cost is very low.

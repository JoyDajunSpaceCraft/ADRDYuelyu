Call your doctor. He or she should be able to prescribe something to help.
Hi I’ve been through this, I would definitely see about getting something to help her sleep. My gma takes trazadone and occasionally melatonin but we’re constantly having to change her doses up as after a while she seems to have reverse effects on one dose. I’m sorry you’re going through this it’s really hard and the longer they’re awake the more agitated everyone becomes.
My mom just went through that. As she also started flying into rages and attacking others, her memory care doctor prescribed trazadone. I've also heard of people having luck with melatonin or CBD. I'd definitely talk to her doctor.
having consulted with two doctors, one suggested 5htp, the other suggested melatonin. both are available over the counter. We have only used the melatonin (in liquid form but i know it's available in capsule as well) 30 minutes before bed.

other suggestions, get sun exposure before 10 AM avoid night time blue light (TV, cell phone...)
My grandma takes the gummy melatonin. I buy the lowest dose ones (I think 2 mg) and give her a few (usually 5 but the dosing depends on the brand). She thinks they taste pretty good so she looks forward to them at night. I'm also looking into CBD for her as well. Going to sleep is a tough time here.

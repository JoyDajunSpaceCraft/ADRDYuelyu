Greeat, thank you! I'll download it and go from there!
Thank you for doing this important work!  My friend is now in memory care.  A plan like your would have been so helpful.  Her cousin and I (both of us were her health care agents with Power of Attorney) had to make it up as we went along.
I wish someone would do this for the US. I could really use some guidance since I am the full time caretaker for both of my early stages of dementia parents. It is getting worse and I feel overwhelmed a lot of the time lately.
My dad was diagnosed December 2020.  Mom is still married to him so she is the primary caregiver. I do the doctor's appointments and help to navigate things that he would get mad at mom about. Willing to contribute any way I can.
Hmm… thank you u/BrandDC for pointing this out.

I had dome trouble with the answers since I don't live in Australia.  I'll circle back after my workday to try to fill it out. I don't have time to figure it out right at the moment.

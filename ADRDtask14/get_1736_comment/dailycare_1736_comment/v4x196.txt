Maybe have his cardiologist refer him to a neurologist? I don't know anything about the after effects of heart surgery.

My dad has cognitive decline, probable alzheimers. He confuses or forgets words often, has trouble communicating, and often puts together nonsensical sentences with missing context. Then when you ask him for context, he responds with a nonsense answer. "Dad, who is they?" "Yes, exactly!"
Sounds like it could be, but also could be other things. Best thing is to have him evaluated. Hopefully with you with him.
This sounds like post cardiac surgery symptoms. I’ve heard of this happening to people especially after major heart surgery like a bypass like the one you describe.
Thank you so much for your input. I’m sorry your Dad is also experiencing cognitive decline! :(
Thank you! Definitely will bring it up at an appointment soon.
Thank you! Hoping that’s all it is and will bring it up at an appointment soon.
I agree. I stayed with my uncle post heart surgery and he was in a fog a lot. Thought I was his cousin, not nephew. No sense of time, thought it was 20 years ago. He finally wound up in assisted living because he couldn’t manage living on his own (mostly mentally, i.e. managing meds etc.). After about 9 months he came out of the fog, moved back into his condo and has been doing fine. part of it was the post surgery meds, but part of it was brain fog from the ordeal or the ventilator.
After my cardiac ablation… and i’m healthy and in shape.. my brain didn’t work right for like 2 months.

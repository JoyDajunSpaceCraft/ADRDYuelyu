Get her to her doctor and get a referral for a neurologist.
I just had to break down in the regular Dr office, after my mom "passed" her dementia screening. It was a joke, designed to only confirm the obvious (you would have to be functioning very poorly indeed to "fail" it), altho I am guessing the creators were just locked in to a procedure and forgot how humans work. Insist on a neuro assessment, ours was sched through behavioral health, but I am sure there are other options. But don't be alarmed if she gets a great score on the dementia screening, if you think she needs more testing, push. I was actually relieved after my mom took her delusions to the actual pharmacy  - now I have allies there who are helping me and when the docs tried to shoo me away, I asked if they would speak to the Pharmacist. They will not, but it helped push the issue, and the pharmacy team is very concerned & will call doc themselves in the future.
Thank you, I appreciate that and I was actually thinking about contacting the doctors for that. I’ll give it a try tomorrow if the opportunity presents itself. 👍🏽🙂

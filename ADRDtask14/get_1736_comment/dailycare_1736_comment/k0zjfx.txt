Newer iphones with facial recognition could certainly be used to unlock different apps and protected Notes. If that is not an option I could build him an app for storing important items like passwords with an easy question to unlock access to them. I do this for free with a nonprofit Caring Hands Ministry. [www.caringhandsministry.com](https://www.caringhandsministry.com)  Let me know if interested.
If you can’t turn the password feature to the phone (I did this on my
Mom’s computer for the same reasons), I’d suggest using something stupid simple like the month/day or f his birthday. Or go with facial recognition. Otherwise, I use LastPass, an app/website which stores everything and has facial recognition if used on a phone. If you have the master password you can log into it too, and it has family sharing.
What! Are you serious? Absolutely!
Very much so. The created app is then sent by link to you to download. There is no downloading form an app store since it your app and secure data. Email me at rm@caringhandsministry.com. Will simply need a spreadsheet with data needed for the app along with the security question. Can create tabs based on types of data stored. Calendar for important events, important phone numbers with icon to call the number. You can also have remote access to edit and add information into the database.

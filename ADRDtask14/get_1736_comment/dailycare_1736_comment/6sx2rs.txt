Anger and stress are normal parts of dealing with dementia. There are a lot of places online that are very supportive - great for rants and advice. I'd be happy to PM you some groups that helped me if you like.

The hardest part of the entire thing is realising that it's the illness that is changing them. It can be incredibly frustrating dealing with it all. Local hospitals will put on training courses for families dealing with dementia that can be extremely helpful.

I understand about wanting to do these things alone. You are just a little bit younger than I was when my mother was diagnosed. I spent many years hiding how much it was affecting me, and now that it's over I wish I didn't. 

Would your grandmother be open to going to one of the courses? 
I'm sorry your going through this. I don't have any advice just read and felt for you. I hope all works out for the best.
I imagine my nieces and nephew feel the same way about my folks. I think mom's anger has to do with embarrassment. If so for your grandma maybe you could just ask her how you could help. Maybe agree to answer his questions all day or give a private word to the waitress that grpa cant order for himself. The more my mom can vent somewhere private from Dad the more patience she has when she goes back. I hope you find private safe communities in person where you are. Cd you ring his dr's office and ask them for supp group referrals on the down low that use 12 step meeting type confidentiality rules? The more support you get the better you will be able to help without suffering for it. My best to you.

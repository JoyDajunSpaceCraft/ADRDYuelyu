Give them a drink of water when they are sitting on the toilet. I was going to suggest the tap but the drink is my next go to trick.
This may seem weird but try a drop or two of peppermint essential oil in the toilet before you sit her down. It helps open mucus membranes and can help everything “relax”.  Just do me a favor and stay away from MLM oils like doTerra and Young Living as they are overpriced and their business practices are predatory at best.  A company like [Revive](https://www.revive-eo.com/product/certified-peppermint-essential-oils/) is better and cheaper (not an affiliate link.)

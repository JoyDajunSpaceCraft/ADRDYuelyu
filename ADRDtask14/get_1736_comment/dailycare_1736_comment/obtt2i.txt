Hi! I am so sorry you are experiencing this with your dad so early.  I am a Certified Dementia Practitioner  and it seems like your dad may be experiencing Frontal Temporal Dementia (FTD).  The onset for this type of Dementia starts at around 45.  However, I am by no means able to diagnose him with such a disorder.  I would highly recommend going to a Clinical Neuropsychologist so they can conduct an I.Q. Test and determine if he in fact does have FTD.
When you see the behavior start, try to record it without him seeing it happen. You can go with him to the doctor to replay it - not all behaviors present themselves in the office, so having backup/documentation can be helpful. Best of luck to you - definitely reach out to his PCP for a referral somewhere!
Take him to your family Dr., based on his symptoms he should be able to direct you accordingly.  He may feel safer with him and listen to him. I would not recommend googling anything, just get him help.
Good luck.
Iâ€™m not familiar with a certified dementia practitioner, what exactly is it?
It is a U.S. certification for professionals and possibly caregivers.  The NCCDP provides training and a combination of experience and education is required to be eligible to receive the certification.  You can cit out here: https://www.nccdp.org/

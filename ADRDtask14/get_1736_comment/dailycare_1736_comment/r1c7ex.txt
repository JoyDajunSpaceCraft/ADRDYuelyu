Our former cat was a big mushy love bug. He would lay on my mom’s lap and my mother-in-law lap, spending time with each when they were visiting. He was very social and was extremely gentle. Those would be the best cats for the elderly.

Our current cat will get there and end up as a good lap cat. He’s just a year old so still has lots of kitten to grow out of!

My mom loves our current (and former) cat so when her dementia gets worse I plan on buying one of those realistic robotic cats for her.
We have cats. My grandma adores her cat but sometimes I worry about her physical behavior towards it. She has occasionally grabbed at the cat's tail or done other things that we have had to correct her on. But she does love her and the cat sits in her lap and sleeps in her room. The cat definitely brings her comfort and makes her laugh.

This is a local one in my area that has a resident dog and cat. You may be able to reach out to someone there and get some perspective on how the residents interact with the cat.

When dealing with people with dementia, we need to remember they have lost their ability to reason and remember. Therefore you can NOT argue with them. The anger they have toward you, is the pain in dementia. People with cancer feel pain in a different way. So how do we diffuse the anger. Firstly, medications. Give her something for that anxiety. If she had back pain, we would give her a pain pill. Secondly, it’s all in your response. Validate her. Tell her you understand being there sucks and talk about some of the positive in their life. Perhaps this will help. Sending thoughts and prayers.
Following because I’m in a similar situation, but instead of assisted living, I bought her a house to live in. The irrational rage and paranoia is extremely hard to take.
I’d say: unblock and act like the rage is just background noise.

You must at least keep tap on her a bit.

It might fade out eventually.
Have her checked for a UTI. My friend just went through this and turns out it was a UTI and she couldn’t express how she was feeling and lashed out at everyone. They were told by the nurse that this happens a lot because they just can’t seem to understand or communicate the pain they are in and how they are feeling.
For us, this was a phase. My MIL was a raging B for a few years. Once we moved her in with us it started to settle down and then eventually her spunk just slowly faded in general. In a way it was “easier” when she was mean because I could justify not wanting to be around her. Now it’s just sad. 
I think it’s a final stand. A grasp at the feeling of control because they are losing control of everything. Being angry is a like a desperate attempt at power. 
But to answer your question, when she was being mean and angry we did only what was necessary to keep her safe and taken care of because the emotional abuse was too much. In our situation her thoughts and feelings were all genuine, but her filter was just gone. So it was a constant tirade of how we were disappointments.
>Is there a point where it’s all rage and I just have to cut contact?

There definitely is a point, but it is very hard to decide where that is.
Anti psychotic medication has helped my mother in law no end, her paranoia and agitation is much less now! She’s recently been put on anti depressants too, to lift her mood further! Wish we had done it sooner! Good luck helping your mum x
Yes, it's the disease.  Yes, you need to protect yourself.  Blocking her during attacks is perfectly okay.  If it *does* become all rage and hate then cutting contact will likely be your only option.  I'm sorry.
For what it's worth, it may fade, and faster than you might imagine. My dad was straight up mean to my mother and dead convinced she was poisoning him (with a little football, that has a flag that pops up when you throw it from the tunnel in the bedroom and releases poison gas), for all of a week, and it was quickly forgotten. Give it a bit and try contact again.

Agree with her, side with her.  

Teepa Snow has a training clip on how to de-escalate these situations by siding with her:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNznZ2MnV3I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNznZ2MnV3I)
Thank you.  My mom had always kind of focused on the negative things in life vs positive and it’s really exaggerated now.  Especially when feeling trapped in an assisted living community.
>we need to remember they have lost their ability to reason and remember.

Still scary.
Even though it’s tough, I do understand the rage is the disease.  In 40 years I’ve never hear her be so mean.  It just ruined my day and drained me so emotionally I couldn’t focus on work, so it’s not something I can manage in a healthy way for myself.
Yes thank you.  We checked recently and it might be worth checking again.

Funny. I was just thinking this today. Took my mom to a hearing appointment, she had said 1pm. They aid 1:30 and had another appt going on. She decided to get angry to the point of wanting to just leave, and its usually like that if any little thing doesnt go her way. And I was thinking she feels powerless and the anger gives her a sense of righteousness, so thats why she chooses that direction.
>My mom had always kind of focused on the negative things in life vs positive ...

I honestly wonder if this isn't an important problem.
Perhaps you could ask at the ALF if they could have her seen by psych. Perhaps a lil antidepressant will fix her right up.
I ear ya. My wife never met the fun, loving, easy going man, my father used to be.

Always whistling, or humming a cheesy country song. 
He’s got Frontenporal Dementia.

When my gf first met him, he was undiagnosed and she was like: « why is he so mean spirited? »

Anyway... he’s in the later stage of the disease now and i can confirm he’s super mellow now. Well, he’s super.... hate to say it but... i guess dumb. Like « putting his toast back into the toaster to melt the cold butter » dumb. 

For you, if your mom is surrounded by someone who look after her, there’s no harm in sitting this one out if it’s too much for you. It’s ok.

Just before the diagnosis, I’ve gotten angry at my dad a couple of times too.

Yeah... this disease suck.

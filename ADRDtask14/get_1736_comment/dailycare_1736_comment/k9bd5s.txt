Ask your job if they can train you (or have you trained). My last employer sent me to the Red Cross for CPR training. Checking around your area for CPR training would be a good idea, but find out if your employer will foot the bill, or reimburse you for the training BEFORE you spend your own money.

Accent shouldn't matter so long as you can be understood and you can understand everything that is being said. Become familiar with the lingo used around the workplace and make sure you clearly understand what it means.
Reach out to local hospitals. They frequently will have classes that teach basic skills needed by caregivers. Well at least they do before Covid :(
Don't be scared. Working with Dementia patient's takes patience and kindness. Just like your kids, make sure they are clean, well fed, take their medicine. Watch TV shows with them from their generation. I'm in the South, so "Bonanza" is usually a favorite lol . Or music they like.  Tell them funny stories or ask about their life, if you can. If something scares you about their health, call the Home Health nurse. Pretty sure you can get the CPR class on the net. Look into taking  a CNA class. It is a great job and we all gotta start somewhere!! Bless!!
Typically they won't hire you unless you provide confirmation you have those qualifications, or they plan on doing that training for you. There are several places you can get the information, but you should ask them if they partner with anyone, or recommend anything.
You should be apprehensive. As you are going into a job you have no idea what your responsibilities are going to entail. CPR training is great but even then I think you have to take a refresher course later. I would think if that was all you are required to have they want to hire you as a sitter. No hands on.

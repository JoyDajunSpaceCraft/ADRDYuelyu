Emma Rose Sparrow has a series of books for people with dementia. There are three levels- the most advanced are stories, but very simplified with simple language and short paragraphs. They worked really well for my mom when she couldn’t follow regular books (even familiar ones).  

The other levels are for those with more advanced dementia -  primarily pictures with a sentence or two. 

If the person you take care of can still follow regular books these may be too simple but if this is a long term thing you might want to have a couple things in reserve for when you need them as the disease progresses. 

Other things that worked well for us when my mom’s dementia was less progressed than it is now were things like photo albums or reminiscent books (lots of different types of these) made to spark memories and discussion/stories. 

There are also lots of simple crafts and things you can do depending on the person’s interests - just google some and you’ll find lots of resources. Good luck!
I’ve been reading and rereading some of the books mum loved when she was in her twenties. They are familiar already so she doesn’t have to work as hard to remember the characters. Seems pretty good so far
 I'll definitely be looking up Emma rose sparrows books, they sound exactly like what I've been looking for -- I really appreciate the tips!
Thanks, I'll ask her if she can remember any books that she's enjoyed in the past. My biggest concern is that she'll just be confused and not follow what is going on, so reading what's already familiar makes a lot of sense!

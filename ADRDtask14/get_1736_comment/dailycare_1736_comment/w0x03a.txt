Soft puddings and jello are two things that he may be able to handle.  Ditto ice cream or sherbet/sorbet, which would melt in his mouth.  You might even make the ice cream more special by making a small sundae out of it, adding a little chocolate or caramel syrup and a dollop of whipped cream.

The puddings and jellos can be purchased in little sealed cups that are shelf stable and don't require refrigeration unless opened.

Good luck.  I can feel your caring in the way you worded your question.
What about the puffie things for babies? They basically dissolve in their mouth.
Smoothies? Take his favorite cake and liquefy it?
Popsicles, puffy popcorn (looks like blown up cheerios but they're buttery - if you just let them sit on your mouth, they basically dissolve), pie filling (canned cherry filling, etc.), and maybe watermelon since it's easy to chew.
Mashed potatoes?
Look in the baby food aisle for easy to eat snacks. Not sure what savory choices are there.
Thanks so much for the tips. :) We have gave him ice cream before but I never thought to make a sundae. And will definitely get some pudding. I also just remembered he really loves sweet potatoes so currently looking for some.
Thanks for the tip , but they give him that all the time so Iâ€™d feel bad giving him some too. :(
My mom loved sweet potatoes. I used to make smoothies out of sweet potatoes. Add a little brown sugar and cinnamon, if he can have it, while cooking for flavor. Apple juice or carrot juice to thin it out a bit.

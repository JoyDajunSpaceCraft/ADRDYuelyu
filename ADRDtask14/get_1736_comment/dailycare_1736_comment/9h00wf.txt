Well the good news is with the advent of electric cars, hopefully outdoor air pollution will slowly decrease over time. For indoor air pollution, we need to ban flame retardants in furniture because everyone is being exposed to them. And also strict regulations need to be placed on "new car smell" because that's literally just poison gas of glue and plastic.

If you already live in a city, I think the best thing you can do to offset your risk is eat a healthy whole food plant based diet which lowers your risk of chronic diseases. Also be aware of other avoidable exposures, like choosing nontoxic paint, nontoxic detergent, etc.
Air pollutants increase oxidative stress and that is why they are linked not only to an increased risk for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, but also for dementia.  Here are some links which connects specific air pollutants with the production of the nitro-oxidant peroxynitrite.  Peroxynitrite is likely a key factor in Alzheimer's disease because it limits the synthesis and release of acetylcholine thus preventing the retrieval of short-term memory, inhibits the regeneration of neurons in the hippocampus, and leads to the death of neurons.

In this study, cocoa--a peroxynitrite scavenger--was used to improve cognition function of children exposed to high levels of air pollution in Mexico City.

Other peroxynitrite scavengers such as panax ginseng and ferulic acid in rice bran oil and Angelica archangelica have shown effectiveness in the treatment of dementia.

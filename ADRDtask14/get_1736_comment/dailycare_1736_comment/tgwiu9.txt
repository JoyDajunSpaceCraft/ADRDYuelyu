When you say he’s struggling with getting out of bed, do you mean he has difficulty getting out of bed independently or do you mean he is getting out of bed independently and you’re worried he will wander/fall/etc?
I got an adjustable bed right off the bat. I found a new one at a good discount. The only problem is that if his legs are elevated at night, you or he would have to use the remote to lower the legs or he will have trouble getting out of bed. Usually they are sold with a foam mattress. Get a thinner mattress, maybe 10”. My husband has trouble getting up onto a higher bed and crawls in on his hands and knees. This seems to be common among dementia patients. 

My friend who has a different issue installed a vertical grab pole to help him get up.  However your dad would need the upper body strength or assistance to use it. 

My dad had those guard rails and he could use them to pull himself up as well but he didn’t have dementia. 

TBH, I only buy adjustable beds. I like them myself.
I have one on my dads bed. He gives it 2 thumbs up. Has not fallen out of bed. Gives him so.ething to grab when he stands up and uses it to get to a sitting position
Both. We're concerned that he could fall, and he struggles to get out of bed independently as well. He needs lots of support to lift his upper body up. I know that on Amazon they sell these guard rails that you can install on a regular mattress, that both act as a barrier and also allows the individual to pull themselves up. But, I'm not sure that my dad can really pull himself up anymore. He has lost a lot of strength/dexterity I'm his grip.
I used one of those from Amazon and then later saw that it was recalled because the person can get trapped in between the mattress and the rail and suffocate. If you haven’t already, I suggest you talk to your dad’s PCP to request they order a home health physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluation. Occupational therapy especially might be useful to brainstorm ideas.

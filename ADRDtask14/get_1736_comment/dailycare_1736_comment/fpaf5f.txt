My grandma also has vascular dementia and a slew of other health issues wanted to visit her home in Mexico, but it’s about a 20+ hour drive and she can’t handle being in the car for that long so we consulted w her doctor to see if she would be able to fly and he said as long as she continued to take all of her medication like she was supposed to and everything was under control that she could. So we picked a flight time that wouldn’t interrupt her wake up/sleep time that would allow us to get her fed, changed and ready without rushing. This is a tip that a gate attendant told me after she upgraded my grandma and I for free, but if you can’t get front row seats, check with the gate attendant about possibly upgrading your mom and the person sitting with her, obv if it’s a full flight that might not be possible. They upgraded my grandma and myself to first class on our outgoing and return trip which really helped me out when she needed to go to the restroom. So again, as long as you make sure any other health issues your mom might have are under control and you give yourself enough to plan things, you should be fine! Fingers crossed!
Thanks so much! It’s good to know that flying shouldn’t be a problem.

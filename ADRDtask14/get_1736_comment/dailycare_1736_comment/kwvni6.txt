If they are indeed a loved one get them the vaccine ASAP.

People have been getting it since June with no problem.
Hi. I’m a medical scientist at a hospital. I have received the vaccine and had no notable side effects. It’s safe and effective. My father has dementia and I will attempt to make sure he gets it ASAP. Feel free to reach out to me if you have concerns about the vaccine. I have a strong background in virology.
My Nana just got her first dose and is doing just fine, we jumped on getting it for her right away. It's an important thing for their safety and the safety of those around them.
If you're unable to make a decision for your loved one that may save their life, find someone who can.
Hey theres some stuff in the news recently about the very frail and elderly dying shortly after getting it.  It seems that its not that the vaccine is especially bad, but expected side effects was just too much for them because they were so weak already, from whatever else was already making them sick.

Anyway, if you have doubts, I'd ask their doc.
We are getting her vaccinated as soon as possible. Covid kills, so far this vaccine hasn't, and likely won't.  There might be an immune response and there might not. But she would decline if she got covid and lived, but more than likely she would die, alone and in pain.

An incredibly stupid comment considering something like 40 million people have gotten it worldwide and zero deaths.

Just...no.
Two of my professors have died from Covid.  They were sprightly, incredibly learned people whom I still mourn today.   They died alone and terrified, suffering for every breath.  Their families weren't able to have funerals, couldn't grieve together.  And now the new strain(s) are even more infectious, will spread even faster. 

If your concern is a rough but survivable three-day immune response, you may need to adjust your concerns.

You're confused:

Virtue signaling would be like if I said that you're a bad person for not doing this.

I didn't.

I brought up a statistical argument as to why you're wrong. Which you are.
I checked your post history.  For someone who works in a hospital, you're pretty iffy on the whole vaccine thing.  When anyone pushes back against your scepticism/anti-vaxxerism in the same way, you act all affronted... for them, as if they can't speak up for themselves. 

"The side effects can be severe".  "Simply respect".  TWO OF MY FRIENDS DIED.  Dead.  They died HORRIBLY.  You gave me no respect for my "personal decision", no respect for my grief, emptiness, ongoing loss.  And yet you want anti-vaxx sentiment to be respected and considered. 

Covid is awful.  There is no good answer.  It is endemic, it will be here forever, everyone will either get the vaccine or they will be infected.  There is no other answer, no way to keep someone untouched.  Vaccinate or be infected, those are the only options.  To everyone, young and old.  And the older people have more chance of dying, by A LOT.  

You're thinking the choice is between possible side effects VS no side effects.  This is shortsighted and defeatist.  The true choice is between the vaccine or community-spread infection.  That you're even considering another argument  means you don't understand.  Framing it any other way is like worrying about the seat belts wrinkling your clothes, so we should "simply respect" someone considering to never wear seat belts. 

Elderly folks are VERY at-risk for death/serious illness with long-lasting "long haul" symptoms, especially the impaired folks like our elders.  Everyone everywhere will eventually be exposed to this horror.  Everyone. 

This isn't side effects VS no side effects.  This is infected and maybe dying vs vaccinated.

>No one has any right to judge another on this decision. 

Yeah, it's totally ok to not vaccinate.  There's no worry with that decision.  Nothing bad has ever come from not vaccinating.

Covid is literally a life-or-death situation for elderly people.  You're ignoring that, which is perilously close to anti-vaxx territory.  Reducing it to "don't shame" turns caregivers into the victim, and victims have no need to act nor change since they were wronged.

If u/davellie wants to tell me to turn it down I'll do so.  Do not attempt to downplay the severity of Covid by reducing caregivers to victims who don't need to make hard choices, and reducing the OP's role to a hapless bystander who needs you to come swooping to their rescue.

Forcing someone else into the victim role when we're all hurting every day, and then blaming me for it and trying to emotionally manipulate me with heavily biased and slanted language and red herrings, when nobody asked for you to step in, is really devious.  I'm done arguing with you on this and everything else.

I live in New York and my mom is in Arizona living in an assisted living facility.I have been calling her on a scheduled day every week at a time I know she is conscious.Her Dementia has gotten to the point where she can not communicate so I started to play music from her past and she actually remembers the songs,starts to sing and can articulate some words.It has helped both of us.Here is the movie link...Alive Inside that has inspired me to inspire my mom.Good Luck!http://www.aliveinside.us/#land

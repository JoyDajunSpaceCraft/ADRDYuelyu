I'd bet serious money that the lead played no factor.
Lead paint in the walls isn't necessarily a sign he would have it in his body unless he was ingesting it or the walls are deteriorating enough for it to become airborn. I've read theories that leaded gasoline could account for the increase in dementia cases in the baby boomer generation but that is by no means confirmed by science.
Haven't heard of it but it's possible I guess.  Did they not even hoard off the demolition areas and hvac with plastic?

My opinion is that a day or two of tearing out painted plaster is unlikely to cause lead poisoning, but a test will reveal lead levels in his blood.
  - 78 years old has lots of ways of having memory issues well outside of lead exposure
 - the direct way of having impact from lead is by ingestion and unless this person was eating profound amount of lead paint chips, its not anything to do with the lead
The walls were demolished without lead abatement to build two new rooms out of three.

Edit: while he was occupying the house.
It's not lead.

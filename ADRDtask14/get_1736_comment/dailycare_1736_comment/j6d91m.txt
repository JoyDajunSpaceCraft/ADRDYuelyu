Misfiring nerves/neurons can cause this.  An old-fashioned ice bag or a new refreezable cold pack might help.  Also good for strains and aging joints!
They make head shapes ice packs for migraines. You can find them on amazon. Maybe that will help him feel a litte better.
There are freezable eye masks. He could wear it on his head.
I wonder if its possible hes using the wrong word to describe some other discomfort. Like a headache, or confusion, or anxiety? And they are just using the word hot because aphasia from Alzheimer's. 

Or maybe its somatic?

I know for myself, when im really really acutely anxious i sort of *feel* like my head is hot, even though its not hot to the touch and i dont have a fever. 

My grandma used to complain of something similar but my mom thought it was dehydration. It did seem to go away on its own (the complaints anyway, the not drinking enough was an ongoing thing). She put a cool damp towel on her head to help. So if you got your doctors to eliminate any other ailments maybe this idea (or cool gel packs like others suggest) might be the best you can do. 

Sorry you guys going thru this. I know its tricky when you don't know if it's just Alzheimer's jibbajabba or Alzheimer's getting in the way of communicating something that maybe should be treated.
Amazon also has personal fans that hang around the neck with double fans that you can move around to focus on your temples or neck or whatever you need around your head
He's early enough in Alzheimer's that he can still accurately describe what he's feeling, so he is defintiely feeling heat in his head. Unfortunately, he is hyper-sensitive to moisture, so damp towels/washcloth don't help, but it's a great idea! I think it probably is anxiety related. Gel paks might be worth trying!

To-date no peer-reviewed studies show any benefit. A lot of pseudoscience out there making ridiculous claims, but more research is needed. 
Coconut oil is a source of medium chain triglycerides (MCTs).

If you do a "medium chain triglycerides" search on google, you'll get a lot of links discussing whether or not MCTs are helpful for various purposes.

"***Very*** small" means only 10 people.

Yes, there are no cures for Alzheimer's disease, but certain phenolic compounds may provide better treatments for the disease than current medications.  Whether coconut oil fits into this category is debatable.

First some of the positive evidence:

If one wished to try coconut oil as a health supplement, virgin (unrefined) coconut oil would be preferable since it contains higher levels of beneficial “polyphenols” (specifically, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid

Polyphenols in coconut oil could be potentially useful for Alzheimer’s (and other diseases) since they act as antioxidants. Antioxidants help temper the harmful effects of inflammation, e.g., free radical production, which causes so much damage in Alzheimer’s and other diseases involving tissue degeneration.

In summary, in addition to the polyphenols in coconut oil (acting as antioxidants), it is also possible that the ketone bodies (acting as an alternate energy source for the brain) could underlie the positive effects on Alzheimer’s disease reported by some users of coconut oil.

The high levels of saturated fats in coconut oil appear to make it an ineffective treatment for those with the Apoe4.

Another question is whether derivations of coconut oil such as the medical food Axona are more effective or just more expensive (I don't know the answer to this question).  This is the study done by the makers of Axona.

Alzheimer's disease is most likely caused by oxidation and nitration and the best way to treat the disease are with specific antioxidants called methoxyphenols.

One such methoxyphenol is ferulic acid which helps treat behavioral problems in dementia and slows the loss of cognition (or partially reverses it when used with other methoxyphenols).  It can be found not only in coconut oil but also in rice bran oil and Angelica archangelica (feruguard) and panax ginseng (which also contains another methoxyphenol syringic acid).

Another methoxyphenol--eugenol--also may modify the course of Alzheimer's disease.  Eugenol can be found in various essential oils such as rosemary, clove, bay laurel, and lemon balm and can be easily delivered to the brain via aromatherapy.

The only reason we hear of coconut oil is because Dr. Mary Newport saw some improvement in her husband using it and then relentlessly promoted it.  I try to do the same with aromatherapy and panax ginseng but there are may obstacles, including the following:

Any treatment with plant compounds is considered pseudoscience by many and any evidence to the contrary is dismissed as false, misleading, or insufficient.

If this worked why have not we heard of it before?

What is needed is larger studies on what has already worked in small-scale clinical trials.  



My mother and sister both have AD and are incredibly similar in their symptoms. About 4 years ago I started my mom on CO and for a while her symptoms seemed to have less of a negative impact on her than on my sister who was on similar meds but not CO. But, it did not seem to halt the inexorable march of the disease towards new symptoms, which seemed to hit both my mom and sister at the same time. 

So, I can't say one way or the other, unfortunately. 

Reasons I think it did make it easier for my mom as opposed to my sister who did not take it, are based on my own model of AD and I'd be run out of reddit if I started to espouse them here: There are so few good models of the mechanics of AD, that anything you try and think works, will be poo poo'ed from "where's your proof you gullible fool!" brigade. That includes CO :)

Ed: Just looking at /r/Lane-Simonian's reply to you, and would agree with most of it
Now there has been some real research done on this treatment. I just found this on PubMed, a database of studies that we used during my nursing course. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26667739

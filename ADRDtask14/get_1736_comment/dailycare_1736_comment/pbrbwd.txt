I see no reason to worry about a dream subject.
Visual hallucinations are often a sign of memory disorder, but dreams are different. Is she dreaming them or imagining them while awake? If she’s awake and seeing them, schedule a neurology appointment.
I often dream about bugs. They represent "what is bugging" the dreamer.
Nope. I’m sure she just remembers him “seeing “ them and it’s just in her mind. I wouldn’t worry at all if it’s a dream. If it’s delusions during day then that’s concerning only.
She dreams she sees them then wakes up panics that the bed was spiders but does not see them when awake.

It's not uncommon, they forget where they are and what they're doing sometimes. Dementia affects sleep in so many ways too. Anything in the brain really can be affected. He just can't be driving and needs assistance plain and simple, if a family member could move in or something along those lines.
Just FYI  "early onset Alzheimer's" means people who develop it in their 40-50s, I think you mean your Grandpa at 85 is in first stages of Alzheimer's. I'm not trying to be pedantic, just clarifying especially for future posts where it may cause more confusion if age isn't mentioned.

You need to call his doctor and inform them you need to speak to them on a matter where you fear your grandfather may be a danger to himself and others (otherwise without POA they can't legally discuss his health with you). You just need to say them everything you said in this post. If they can't get him into office to diagnose I believe there are other things they can do to make him re-test for his license. I know it's heartbreaking to deprive someone of their independence, but you'd feel worse if he killed someone.

As dementia progresses there's more and more symptoms that'll pop up, and everyone's dementia is unique. Best of luck
Itâ€™s a hard disease. But it sounds like your grandpa has a lot of good people looking out for him. Best of luck!

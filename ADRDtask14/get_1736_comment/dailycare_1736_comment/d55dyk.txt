What is going on to prevent her being kicked out? Are they evaluating/adjusting her meds? Is she being checked for UTI or dental or any other low-grade issues? Has there been a change in roommate or staff who she usually interacts with? Food changes? I would have to push back, drop in at unexpected times to observe. Edit: as a parent when I had kids in daycare there would sometimes be days when the staff in the baby room just were overwhelmed and they would claim the babies were all crying and had fevers etc and they could then leave work early as soon as the worried parents picked up their kids. Don't discount staff overload - have they been given recognition/thanks lately? And pay attention to changes in that area. And be the family who brings in cookies/Starbucks gift cards, a little cash in a birthday card...
Moved mom from memory care to a board and care home as memory care did not provide the personal care she required. The home we selected was one of the homes recommended by her hospice team. It's been wonderful. The care home only has between 6 and 10 residents. The staff are caring and sweet and call her "mom." She is always supervised and is assisted with meals and toileted regularly. Best decision we made for her.
Have her checked for a UTI immediately. My sister would be really mean and combative when she had UTI. Sitting around in wet pull ups definitely can cause UTIâ€™s. In men and women.
they said she is being confrontational, and that i believe..Refusing to go to bed ,etc.we'll need to adjust something....
Thanks. Is board and care more expensive than memory care?
I can understand confrontational could be a problem but sometimes that's due to anxiety or illness. Were the staff really not able to outwit her?
It is pretty much the same.

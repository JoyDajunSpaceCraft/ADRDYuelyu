Hi - Social contact helps me but it’s hard to make happen. I drank a lot in 2019 and 2020 but largely stopped in January of this year. First time I’d gone this long without drinking at least semi-regularly. Now I don’t enjoy it as much when I do it. Everyone different, just my experience. Will be honest that I crave it especially when stress spikes.
Having help is probably the main thing that helps me. It’s expensive and  will impact my retirement, assuming I make it that far (50 years old). But otherwise I’m on 24/7 which was really killing me. Still entirely burned out but better when I get regular time away from caregiving.
You mentioned pets. For me, 95% love having two dogs. Definitely work and the first year of a puppy can be stressful. Just getting the end of that year with dog 2 and they are wonderful positive family members. My wife is deep in dementia but pays some attention to the dogs. It’s a lot of work but the house would feel empty without them (and we have two young teenagers too). 
Getting out of the house is the other thing that helps me. A walk. A drive. Grocery shopping. Getting a coffee and sitting in a park. Anything. I’m still lonely as hell but trying to get out of the house. 
Oh, and exercise for stress. So easy for me to blow it off, but it makes a big difference for my mood, optimism, and stress management. 
Best of luck to you.

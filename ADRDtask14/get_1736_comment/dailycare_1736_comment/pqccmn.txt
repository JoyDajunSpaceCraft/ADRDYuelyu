Memeory care director, here...not a nurse, but I have seen this before.

Might be worth trying to take her get her ears are cleaned out, wax build up can sometimes come on suddenly. I have seen this happen so often with my residents, they come back and they are like a whole new person! 

She also might be a having a hard time comprehending what you are saying and cannot peice what your saying together, due to her diagnosis. 

Her hearing could simple just be declining over time.

Keep things simple, don't raise your voice, just lower your tone, and make sure you enunciate. A small white board is helpful if her sight is still good, just a nice small one to help with sentences, but also helping distinguish between letters that sound the same.

Hope this helps a bit! I wish you the best of luck, your grandmother is very lucky to have you by her side ‚ù§

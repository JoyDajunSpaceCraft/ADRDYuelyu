My uncle gave us a similar problem. It was obvious to all but my mother that he needed to be in Assisted Living, but no one had declared him incompetent yet. He then had an episode where we took him to the emergency room for a health reason that didn't turn out to be any big deal. But his confusion was very evident. We all made sure to bring the doctors notice to it and discussed very frankly with them the situation. They then declared him incompetent , which is what they use in my state as the term to mean that with  my power of attorney,  I would then take over making decisions for him. He had signed it previously. Make sure someonehas one of those for her. They kept him for a while in a rehab while I made arrangements to find a suitable safe place for him. The hardest part  was standing up to my mother about that decision. It made her very sad to see her little brother  in such a way . She didn't want it to be true.  And now she's  going the same way. Good luck with your relatives.
We had someone come out and evaluate my Dad to determine if he should be placed in the higher functioning and lower function part of the facility he was going to live in. I would first determine the facility you would like your grandmother to live in and from there I would call and see if they can assess where she would need to be placed. She may fight you on going and once she is there she will fight you on being placed. Just remember it will be better for her in the long run. I hope this helps.

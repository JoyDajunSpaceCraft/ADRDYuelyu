It does have information linked in the sidebar though?
Yes and no......anywhere else you might reasonably expect to get sent to the FAQ when you ask a common question. But in this case if we can manage it as a community I feel like getting a personal reply is potentially invaluable to the person asking the question. It reinforces the sense of not being alone which is just as important a part of this community as the information it provides.
Yes!

Commonly asked questions/needed answers:
Is this symptom dementia?
(,a lot that boil down to:) who is responsible for declining adult?
Tips on deal with the process: it's lots of grieving and loss. 
Resources on dealing with Alzheimer's 


And maybe a stickied post with everyone's solutions to common problems such as nightwalks, bathroom issues etc?
Granted, I’m here via ipad and an app, but I don’t see any info other than standard guidelines and stuff
Respectfully, I understand and appreciate that point of view. That said, I think equally important is just a ‘where to start’ (aka, FAQ). I would think that this sub gets a lot of newbies like myself who don’t even know what questions to ask or where to begin, thus a handy FAQ would really help.
Go to the 3 dots top right and then Community Info. It’s not a very extensive FAQ but it’s there.
Good point well made, I do agree. I think with hindsight I was pushing back against the borderline rude “read the faq” that you’ll get in other subs, which feels particularly inappropriate here.
Thanks. Found it! Yeah, it’s not much and not that prominent. Other subs have a sticky right at the top, which seems super-convenient and easy to find, especially for newbies like myself.
Maybe you can contribute, I don't think anyone would mind.

It’s like death (the character) taunting you. Giving you the middle finger and mooning you. Holidays are very difficult times to say the least. You can help by being there emotionally and listening to him if/when he decides to talk about the specifics. Listening I’ve learned to be a skill all on its own! Happy Easter and This post is very caring of you.

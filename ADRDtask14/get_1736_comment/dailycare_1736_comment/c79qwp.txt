Financial; what has he done?  Are you aware of some of the DA (Dopamine Agonist) issues? For me I went overboard with "buy it now" off eBay. $10,000 in machinist tools in a few months. Not good (thankfully I bought excellent tools and was able to resell).

&#x200B;

Has he started taking Aricept (Donepezil)?

Do have camera's front and rear installed into his car. If he does get into an accident, he and your insurance company will have the video recording. Often my wife makes comments when I am driving (they are distracting) so I will pull the recorded video and have them critique my driving.

I've gone out with driving instructors. It is good review of our skills and you learn tips on things. 

For road trips, I used google maps and have back up paper maps (helps to keep cognitive sharp). With Google Maps I use voice (turn in 500 ft) helps me to remember my turn is coming up.  Trick is to use my home computer then send route to my phone.

/r/Parkinsons for those with and family and friends. Yes, also Lewy Body.
My suggestion is make those discussions a priority today, and tell them you've spent a lifetime together and you want to be able to support them when there condition gets worse.  

It's important you have this discussion and then go to an attorney to get a POA for the finances. It sucks ☹️ that this is what you need to do but if you delay and the condition gets worse and they do some crazy impulse buy or something your SOA .  I mention this from experience, my uncle had LDB and they took too long and in the end it become super expensive to get a POA , because once the person is not in their right mind it becomes an expensive and you need to go to court for all this.

Again the key is try to take the emotion out of it and focus on the practical side.

If you donate to Alzheimer's research or something it will be a good act and will balance out whatever guilt you have about reading the private emails. 


Maybe you shouldn't alert them, so they aren't embarrassed that they accidentally sent private emails to a stranger.  If it was me- I'd rather not know.

You can have future emails automatically filed away, so you'll never see them again. Make sure you forget the password to the new folder, so you won't be tempted to look at them again.
When I read the title, I immediately wondered if you were talking about former Atlanta Falcons player Chris Chandler. Used to see him sometimes at Emory. Poor guy was so messed up he would look for a button to press at the bottom of the staircase until his wife led him to the elevator. She just looked so broken. Not sure if his is Alzheimer's or just post-concussive brain damage, though.

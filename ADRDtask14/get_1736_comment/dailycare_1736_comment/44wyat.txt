Costs can vary..Anywhere from $4000-7000/month.. It all depends on where she lives and what her care needs are.  

As for the costs, here's something about a VA Benefit: http://www.connectseniorliving.com/helping-veterans-pay-for-assisted-living/

You can also speak with the facility to see what they have as far as financial options.  What happens when mom runs out of money?  Do they have medicaid contracts?

It also wouldn't hurt touring a few other memory care communities just to get an idea of what else is out there and you can compare costs, care and activities.

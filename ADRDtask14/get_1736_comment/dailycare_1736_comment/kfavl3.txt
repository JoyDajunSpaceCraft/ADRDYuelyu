Let them know that she's sensitive to epinephrine.  My MIL had a panic attack during some routine dental care and they told me to tell them the next time so they could use an alternative local anesthetic.  General anesthesia is extremely hard on dementia sufferers but if they were planning to use that you would have been given specific instructions about food and drink.
My dad recently had a minor gallbladder stone removal procedure. He was not good in the days immediately following (many episodes, some very bad). But, as he healed he got MUCH better. It’s one of those situations where whatever is ailing them is probably making alz/dementia symptoms worse, so you have to determine if a temporary regression is worth the benefit of the procedure. In my dad’s case it definitely was. Tooth issues can cause a lot of systematic issues, so I’d venture to say (on very limited info) it’ll be worth it for your mom. I’d expect a spike in symptoms the few days following, but it should get better as she heals. Not just from the anesthesia, but the procedure. I’m basing this on general, not local anesthesia. Local anesthesia shouldn’t have much of an impact, if any.

WOW - that would be hard to handle both emotionally as well as physically.  My best advice would be to see if you could get him to use the toilet more often and on a routine basis to see if that helps cut down on the accidents.
As far as the agitation goes, see if you could figure out what is the root cause of it. Sometimes he may be uncomfortable or tired but can't express the reasons. Try keeping a log on what and when it happens - and maybe you will see a trigger that can be avoided or eliminated. 
Sorry if all that sounds hollow. I know from experience that when you are in the middle of it, it's hard to think things through. God bless your sister!  
Also, here's a good video that may help your sister.  The most pertinent part regarding toileting and changing his soiled clothes starts at 4:45 although the whole series would be valuable for her to watch.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCAAy53cZDQ



Speak to his physician -- they may be able to prescribe a low dose of Prozac or another med that will ease his angst and make him easier to manage. 
This would be really hard and I fear dealing with this behaviour. I can't comment on how to deal with it directly but we've had some success managing bowel incontinence with diet. It's taken many months of trial and error but adding probiotics and using psyllium husk as a bulking agent appear to have helped a lot. The more difficult part has been identifying agents that might contribute to loose bowel movements and we now avoid most spices alongside beans and specific fruit like pears and, of course, prunes. It's always a struggle to keep bowels moving but not too loose.

It's very unlikely to be LBD but it would be wise to see a neurologist to find out what *is* causing this.
I don't mean this to sound snarky or hateful, but most of us here are just people who have walked the dementia walk with loved ones. We don't have the medical training to answer your questions, but it does sound like your GP is kind of humoring you. You might want to think about seeing a specialist or getting a second opinion. There are tons of deleriums that mimic different forms of dementia and the likelihood that it's something treatable is much higher than the chances of LBD at your age.
See you GP about what medications you are taking that have side effects of tremors and forgetfulness. I am dealing with this currently (for a
Loved one) and the adjustment of some meds and addition of others have helped with tremors.

Good luck!
I think it's fair to say this is so unlikely it is one unit away from impossible.
Definitely

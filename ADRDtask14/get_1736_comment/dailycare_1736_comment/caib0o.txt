Im bad at explaining stuff but here's a TL:DR, old great grandma is paralized and with PSDem, i dont know how to help her.
I can only speak about the Alzheimer’s as I’m not familiar with Paralysis. 

The dementia makes your great grandmother accuse people of things. When they can’t figure things out or understand it is easiest for them to blame someone else rather than admit they don’t remember or understand. You need to remember that it is the disease being like. 

When they get in to an argument distract your great grandmother with something else. Ask her about things she likes to talk about. Listen to music. Or does she have any favorite tv shows?  Coloring is relaxing.

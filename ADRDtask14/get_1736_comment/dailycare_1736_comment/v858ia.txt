This is a terrible but fairly common situation.  Dementia is treated like a severe psychiatric disorder and patients are loaded up on haldol and depakote until they're basically zombies.

It stems for a mix of laziness, poor education, lack of enough staff, and minimal training.  Physicians that work in these facilities are bottom of the barrel and probably do more harm than good half the time.

The staff are underpaid and under trained.  The moment a patient disagrees or resists, they are deemed combative and treated medically because it's easier than having to deal with them.

I am pretty hesitant about any patients with dementia ever going to a psych facility because I anticipate they will come out worse than they went in.
ðŸ˜£ that is so sad. I understand they can't just go around hitting people but there has to be a better way than to just ship them off to get drugged into a living death.

Check out You Tube Teepa Snow. She has a lot of info about dementia and Alzheimer's. 
Someone can get dementia in their forties though it is unusual. Could you take your concerns to your mother or another trusted adult? Her seeing a doctor would be a good idea even if it's just for your piece of mind.

This is a lot for a s 17 year old to deal with, I hope things turn out for the best. Good luck.
thank you!
Iâ€™ve brought it up to my mother before. she gets VERY angry and extremely defensive. my dad & I talk about it on the regular. we both have the same opinion. thank you !

First of all, I'm sorry to be hear about your Grandma's health.  Alzheimer's is a tough disease for everyone involved.

My grandmother was diagnosed very early.  Every person is different and so every case of Alzheimer's is different, but we found that she forgot pretty early on that she was ever diagnosed.  I made the mistake of reminding her once in a while and it just seemed like it made her feel bad about herself.  Eventually, we/I realized the best thing for her was to go with the flow - or her flow more specifically - and to be a gentle guide to a calmer place when needed.  Sometimes she'd catch herself early on, but I think the nature of the disease prevented her from even recognizing the symptoms most of the time.  She'd forget where she's going, but wouldn't remember how many times she'd done so in the last week, so I don't think it came up much even early on.

I don't know how things will progress for your grandma, but I do know that there will be a point in the not-too-distant future where she won't be able to recognize her own symptoms.  I'd ask yourself if there is more opportunity to worry about what the diagnosis means in the meantime than to worry about the symptoms she's experiencing without explanation.  I think I'd prefer not to know after my experience with my grandmother.

I read recently that this is a topic of study now that testing has advanced to earlier diagnoses. You might do some reading to learn more about what the experts say.

Edit: I forgot my advice - learn to live in the moment when you're with your grandma.  She won't have a choice, so you'll best connect when you join her.  Distractions are more effective than rationalizations and the truth doesn't matter when you just forget it, so play along with the delusions and lie when you need to. It's often kinder and less unsettling for her than telling the truth.  For my Grandma it was always "The children are at school" or something similar, for example.
I don’t have a great answer but I can tell what we did with my mother. When she was diagnosed, my father decided it was in her best interest to tell her the diagnosis and that she hear it from a physician so that’s what was done. She handled it well but she hadn’t started to exhibit the symptoms of later stage Alzheimer’s like paranoia and temperament changes (she was just extremely forgetful). For a while she was depressed but she eventually forgot about the diagnosis and now her reality is that she’s always been like this (probably took about four years to get to this point). 

Every person is different in how they handle bad medical news and you can never truly prepare for it. My advice would be to let your “gut” tell you what’s right. Keep in mind she’ll likely also have more doctor visits with new providers and she’ll likely know enough to know that something has changed beyond just her medicine, at least until it becomes part of her new normal.
When my dad got his diagnosis it was the first time I had seen him truly upset in a while and he asked me if he was going to die. I'm not really sure if I would have told him had he not been in the room when the doctor said it. 

It hasn't been brought up again aside from him knowing he has "problems" and he knows to take his pills to help it. 

I dont know the best solution, but I will say there are going to be many times where you're going to have to keep things from her or straight up lie for her safety and benefit.
My mom was diagnosed early but already forgot within days . She understands she has memory issues but not why.

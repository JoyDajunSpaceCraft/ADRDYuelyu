A month is not very long to be off xanax after using it for years. Did you taper down when you quit? 

When I stopped taking benzos after only a year (taken as prescibed, but a hefty dose of klonopin daily) I had issues cognitively, with memory, and executive function, mental fog, teouble understanding what I was reading, trouble writing - and that stuff went on to a lesser degree for a couple of years before I felt remotely normal. (But, I went off cold turkey, so if you tapered down, you may fare better than I did). Point being, benzos can impact you advesely for a good while. There are tons of similar stories online, but doctors seem reluctant to acknowledge it, or perhaps they are just unaware.
The THC in cannabis is proven to worsen psychotic symptoms, including in bipolar disorder. (I'm a psychiatrist.)
If your doctor is truly going to examine you for dementia, one of the first questions he will ask is "What day is it today". Can you answer that question?
That's why we psychiatrists are reluctant to prescribe benzos for long-term use.

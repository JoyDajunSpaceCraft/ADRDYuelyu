I wouldn't force your mom into some kind of brain training. Better find some activity like memory, drawing or talking about old pictures and keep her entertained to give her some positive or rewarding experience.

My dad likes to color mandalas in a coloring book. The symmetry of the mandalas eases his mind and keeps him busy for maybe half an hour. He also likes to give them to family members as a present. It hurts my guts everytime he does this but i keep everyone of them and will put them in a frame.
thanks.. i haven't tried drawing yet.. she used to make clothes from a pattern maybe it'll trigger her creativity spot

You don't mention what country you live in, but as an American, I find that a great idea -- sometimes I have to backtrack on a piece of dialog to try to catch what is being said.
This alone - I wouldn't worry about.  If he suddenly lost interest in watching it without explanation - maybe that.  But if there is a history, keep an eye out for more of a pattern.  

I actually clicked on this thread because I thought you were asking about something I noticed with my mom...well, only in retrospect do I see this as part of the Alz coming on.  Not perceiving speed correctly, as well as distance/direction of other vehicles.  I was driving her through a city we were visiting and made a semi-fast but nowhere near dangerous left turn (everyone was going around 40mph maybe).  There was a car a safe distance away from us but approaching.  My mom had a very very out of proportion reaction: shouting, throwing her arms up in the air and lifting up her outside leg as if to try to avoid a massive impact.  We were, of course, always safe.
My mother has started doing this in the car also. We will be driving along safely, then out of nowhere she will scream loudly, and start bracing for impact. The first few times she did this, its a wonder I didn't have a heart attack.

With my MiL it was her complete lack of traffic/road safety awareness.

The first time we noticed it she just stepped into the road without looking, and was most annoyed when we grabbed her arm to stop her stepping in front of a car she hadn't seen.

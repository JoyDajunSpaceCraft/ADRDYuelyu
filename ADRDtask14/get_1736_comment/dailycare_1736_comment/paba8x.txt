Don’t get so ahead of yourself! It’s certainly possible, but A. You need to let him recover first! And B. There are plenty of dementia patients who are docile and non aggressive. Wait until he has some time to recuperate from what was likely an incredible assault on his body and mind.
Older folks on the verge of dementia often have it escalate after an illness or injury. Also, illnesses and injuries can cause some temporary dementia in older folks as well.
Hospital delirium is very common in older folks. He could be fine in 1-2 weeks, or this can be the start of a decline.
Yes delirium does occur post hospitalization. It may also be a step-wise decline in dementia. This is not that easy to determine and you should speak with geriatric specialist or psychiatrist.

Wait and see on aggression. If that does become a concern, act quickly to get him on the right meds (may take a few tries).
My elder had deep deep delrium  at  weeks long stay in the hospital. I couldn't visit him ( covid) and They refuse to give him his anti-anxiety and other medications that keep his mood stable. No joke it took 5 months for him to improve and a part of his mind just did not come back at all after he was discharged. I googled this alot and they say delrium can push someone into dementia..please take that with a grain of salt, and talk to a real doctor but hospital delerium was very detrimental in the long term to him.
Thank you ❤️❤️❤️
Wanted to add, have him tested for a UTI. And make sure they send it out for culture, not just take the results from a fast dip test.

Sometimes I feel like the only thing I can do that has any real value is listening to his old stories, or if he doesn’t talk much, telling old stories about how much your experiences with him have meant to you. “I remember when you taught me to stain a table. I just redid a dresser and thought of how you showed me” and to be honest, sometimes I embellish the truth a little too. “I always loved coming to your place” is not exactly true, but a small and inexpensive lie to tell if it brings a little comfort... I think it also shows him that he still has worth and has had an impact on the world, when he’s feeling pretty old and useless.  Good luck. This sucks.
I’m sorry your family is going through this. Many people with dementia enjoy hearing music from their younger days. Even if he didn’t regularly listen to music, you might try looking up songs from his teens, twenties & thirties, play a few for him and see how he responds. We wish you peace.

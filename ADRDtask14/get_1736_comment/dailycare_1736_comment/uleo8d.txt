I would also recommend interviewing at least 3 providers, even if from same agency. One candidate learned my mom had a cat, and that it would need to be locked in a separate room when she was there. Settled on one who had no issues with the cat, and provided loving care for my mom, fixing meals, putting together puzzles, and really made my momâ€™s last few months as good as they could be.
You have to set ground rules and enforce them; don't let ppl come back if you feel uneasy. Take a week off and supervise, then put cameras in everywhere.
How old is she?
Can you afford private care? Is she on Medicaid? Try your local department of aging..they may provide resources that your mom might qualify for depending on her financial situation
I went through and spoke with several agencies and found one that was locally owned and the owner actually spoke to me personally. They kept sending different caretakers and I finally found one that made my mom laugh. That's pretty tough most days. The problem is weekend care. The agency has yet to find me someone that will come consistently. It's hard to keep consistent weekend help.
She is 59 now. She was diagnosed at 58.

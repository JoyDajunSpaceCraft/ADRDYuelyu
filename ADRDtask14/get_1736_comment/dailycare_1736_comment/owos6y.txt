It's used for all sorts of cognitive awareness. Sometimes it will be given to persons with suspected concussions, for example.  But I don't think it's all that valuable a test.  Some people have great mathematical awareness, so counting back from 100 by 3s (97, 94, 91, 88..) is a breeze for them, even if they can't remember what they ate for lunch.  Others who are perfectly competent otherwise but have trouble with math might find it very challenging.  Or if you're fatigued, or if you're running a fever, or stressed... there are a lot of factors that might make counting backwards by 3s (or 7s, as sometimes used) difficult, but you're otherwise very competent in daily tasks and interactions.  I have trouble doing math after or during exercise, for example (counting laps or figuring out average pace is a PITA).  

So alone, I don't think it's a helpful metric.  I think more often it's one of several tests that help doctors to determine whether a patient has dementia.   There's also that "Person, woman, man, camera, television" test that assesses a patient's ability to recall a series of words in short-term memory and other tests when used together can help assess a patient's cognitive abilities.
Is it useful for individuals to do themselves as a training to check their memory?
I wouldn't say so.  Better activities may be  crossword and other puzzles and trivia quizzes, but I am not a gerontology or dementia specialist.

Please update your parents, i'm sure they are just as concerned as you are. I am no professional, but from what i've read, you need to try and distract her with something. perhaps a health snack of some sort. Also, tell her the children were lost and you told them to leave and not come back.
Also; it may be worth looking into her meds. If she's acting really OFF or WILD it could be a bladder infection (UTI) - very common w/elderly women who've had multiple children & also w/Dementia patients which can definitely cause visions, they are treatable within a week (need urine test) with antibiotics. Also; try to help by keeping her daily showered & underpants dry.
All the best, this must be very hard for you but It's amazing you're helping.
You need to wake your parents sweetie, it can take quite a while to settle someone who is having hallucinations ( she may need medical attention if she becomes more distressed).

You are doing fantastically well but your studies and a good nights rest are important too. I hope your Grandma settles soon.
This right here. OP, when someone has dementia, their hallucinations and delusions are real to them, and telling them that there are no children there will only make them more upset. You have to go along with their delusions, but pretend to solve whatever problem they think they're having.

My father has Parkinson’s and dementia.  Not remembering is an unfortunate part of this.  Like your grandad, my dad doesn’t remember who has passed on, people’s names and his relationship to them, and often brings up things from long ago as if they are a present reality.  I just hopped in here to encourage you to hang in there and be a support to other members of the family.  The advice I have for you is to go along with whatever he says.  It’s his reality.  Play along.  You won’t be lying.  You’ll be loving him in a time that his mind isn’t functioning as it used to.  Also, as often as you can, when you talk to him, address him by the name you call him.  Try doing that in place of “you” and use family names instead of pronouns, to cue him.  I don’t say, Daddy, do you remember me?”  I just constantly say “Daddy” when I’m talking to him.  I don’t quiz him or ask him if he remembers things.  

Be in the moment with your grandad.  I think it will help him from getting exasperated.  Love and care to you and your family.
I will keep caring for him no matter how far it develops. I think he has some awareness that is memory is going but I want him to live out the rest of his days enjoying them regardless of whether he remembers them later on. Thankyou for the kind words and love to your family too.

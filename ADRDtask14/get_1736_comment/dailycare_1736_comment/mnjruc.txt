Those are good steps - you ought to see her doctor privately and tell Dr your concerns about her, give him a heads-up for examination - if it's alzhms/dementia the sooner she is on medication for it the better!  Of course doesn't cure, but holds it off somewhat, no time to waste!

Laws differ state to state, some states you need also Power of Guardianship, so yes, consult w/ lawyer.

Research / connect her up with some in-home support - some wait lists are more than a year long.  Doctor/Dementia Australia can tell you about ACAT prerequisite for eligibility.  She'll likely spend less time socialising with friends, so find out about memory-lossed oldies social / outing / hobby groups she could join.

Contact Dementia Australia, they have tons of info & resources.

best of luck on the journey!
I’m in Australia have you called ACAT? Aged Care Assessment Service. That should be your first call. They are the body who assess a person for aged care. You cannot get your mother into any nursing home without a ACAT assessment. They will issue an ACAT score which is what you give over to all aged care homes when you enquire. They won’t even consider you without it 
  

Dementia Australia are also brilliant with general information

>Dementia   is essentially untreatable, irreversible, is a horrible thing to live   through, and ends in death.  There are a few drugs out there, but most   of them don't do much and the side-effects are worse than their   benefits.  There are a few Human Drug/Treatment Trials going on, but   they're few, far between, you have to live near a hospital that offers   them, many times they don't work, and anything they do find is years   away from being available to the public.

>24/7   in-home care becomes necessary or the patient needs to be admitted to a   Memory Care Facility.  This is a locked ward where trained   professionals deal with hallucinations, violent tendencies, etc.  This   step is usually triggered by a tragic incident, such as patient   wandering and being found by authorities, patient harming caregiver,   patient injuring self, etc.  Memory Care Facilities are not cheap, they   can run between $2,000 - $10,000+ a month.  << this is where   caregivers with insufficient preparation or insufficient healthcare   access burn out... badly.

>Patient  loses memories entirely, needs help with every daily activity.  This is  usually where a doctor issues a terminal diagnosis.  This diagnosis  means that you'll be able to access Hospice, which is paid for by  Medicaid.  Hospice's goal is to make the patient and family more  comfortable. They have access to meds that normal healthcare do not,  just to alleviate all pain and discomfort.  Some patients have Hospice  assistance for a few weeks, some for years.

in canada, are you paid as a caregiver if you quit the work you hold now?
what i will say is that your first instincts is to do as much as you can to keep her "present," cognizant, physically strong, as much as possible. i'm not going to discourage you from this but just know, that at some point, you will have to just embrace the fact that she will deteriorate to the point where you can't be upset with the "new" her: repeating herself, asking you the same question over and over, doing things that she has no control over and you can't teach her to not do it again (spilling/dropping things, shitting/pooping wherever and whenever, saying things normally not said in polite society, etc.).

just love her with every passing day and if you/she's able to, go out and enjoy the world as much as you can. keep her happy and you'll be happy. for real.

what the other commenter said too, re POA, and if you can have other ppl help (if they start off early in the habit of helping when it's not too difficult, maybe they'll be there for you when the going gets tougher).
Thank you so much for sharing this!
My family will be paying me to take on this role, but there in an EI Family Adult Caregiver Benefit I’m going to apply for.
Thank you for your response.  I helped her when my Grandma was in a care home and going through the end stages of LBD so I have an idea of what’s coming.  That’s a big part of why I want to spend as much time with her now, while she’s still “good” and understands what’s going on and she does, except for the hallucinations. 

I’ve been reassuring her that she’s not crazy or lying or making things up, and that I know she does see these things.

I’m hoping that being there will also allow for more mental stimulation for her, too. I love my dad, but he’s very much an “avoid uncomfortable things or deal with them by yelling” which is not helping my mum. 

I know this is beyond frightening for him and I’m also hoping I can be a bit of a “buffer” and maybe take at least a little bit of stress off him by shouldering day-to-day responsibility for my mum. Im trying to be as proactive as possible, including finding on-line and local caregiver support groups.

One of my brothers has been helping somewhat but neither of them visited my grandma when she was in the later stages because it was “too hard”. So it was basically me and my mum (my mum has two siblings but they live elsewhere, and her dad died before I was born).  

I know my mum is very frightened ands I just want to help her feel as safe and loved as possible during this.
I agree with all of it.  I work with Dementia patients as well.
that’s good. make sure you get the family agreement in writing, is all i will say from experience.
You're the best daughter ever; I hope your brothers don't react in the same way for your mom as they did with your grandma and come by more often to visit and interact with mom. I was never close to my dad so I'm not gonna be much help on any advice there other than to say hopefully he'll come around to being more interactive as well, that he'll see how fabulously you and Mom get along and maybe want to be a part of that. Stay strong and good luck. I'm afraid you'll need it…
Thank you. <3

My mum and I have always been close, and as “the reliable one” I always knew these kinds of things would be up to me.  I learned a lot from what she went through with my grandma so I know this’ll be tough. I just want to spend as much time with her as possible while she’s still relatively good, plus I don’t want her to be alone all day (she’s always been a SAHM and been the one to look after house and yard cleaning, maintenance and repairs, but she can’t do that to anywhere near the same degree). She knows I’m quitting my job to do this and she sounds relieved that I’ll be there.

My dad has always been an avoid-or-confront-by-arguing type (especially with anything emotional) and it’s gotten worse as he’s gotten older. We have a good relationship too, I’ve just been frustrated by his lack of action on behalf of my mum’s health.  I love them both very much and, while I know that’s how it is, I hate to see them getting older. :(

My uncle (my mum’s younger brother) has also been very supportive, which is good, but he lives out of town, as does my aunt (mum’s younger sister).
>I love them both very much and, while I know that’s how it is, I hate to see them getting older. :(

With each passing year, I understand why ppl from ancient times to the present time have searched far and wide for that elusive fountain of youth. Growing old sucks in so many ways. Cosmetic fixes don't cut it. Dementia, loss of physical strength, imminent health conditions, are definitely not things to look forward to but they're right up there with death and taxes... waah.

When COVID-19 retreats into the pages of history, your aunt and uncle, as well as other relatives/friends will probably come and visit with mom and that'll be nice for you all...

Normal doesnt exist anymore. In a couple of weeks i head out on vacation without my husband because that is where caretaking has left me or brought me. I will call in. I will miss him. This is my new NORMAL its awful.  
So sorry, Marcy. Even though my vacation high didn't last long, the 6 day break was super good for me. I hope you have an awesome time, and can enjoy yourself on vacation. You deserve to.

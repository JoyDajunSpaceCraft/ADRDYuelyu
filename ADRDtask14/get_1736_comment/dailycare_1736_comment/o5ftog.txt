You can’t. Money seems to be a major issues with dementia patients and anxiety pills from doctor can help. Getting them to ‘shut up’ isn’t the right thing to ever say.

My dad goes on and on about my spouse who steals everything (my husband has always helped and never has been near his money). It’s hard to hear but just ignore it and move on.

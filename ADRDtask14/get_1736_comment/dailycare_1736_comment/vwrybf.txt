I would think she is beyond feeling uncomfortable due to heat. It may hasten her death due to dehydration, which may be a relief for her although so sad for you and your family. Wishing you all peace.
My mom is in her final, final stage too. If your nan is uncomfortable you'll see it in her facial expressions. Brows furrowed, jaw clenched, etc... I check my mom's legs, hands, arms and cover/uncover as needed. My mom's body temps are all over the place. I wish you the best as your nan finishes her journey.
She probably won’t even feel the heat. My parents are constantly cold, even in the summer. We have to keep the house at 80 degrees F (26.6 C) all year round, which is sweltering if you’re doing work. Meanwhile, they’re wearing their sweat pants, long sleeved shirts, and warm socks.
Yes you're probably right to be honest. Thank you so much ❤️

Can you put the tile in the inner zippered pocket of the purse? it won't be obvious and I doubt she'd notice 

Does she have a cell phone? could you put a GPS app on there?
Have you looked into putting the Alzheimer’s locks on the doors leading outside? It’s what we’ve had to do with my grandmother because on her bad days she makes a beeline to the doors the minute I’m distracted.
My aunt bought my grandparents fitbits and made them seem like it was to track their health/exercise, etc. Didn't even tell them that it was possible to track. I'm not sure how much money you're willing to spend, and it may not be the best idea since it's something she could easily take off or could lose battery.
You can put a Tile in her purse. but you can also buy a Tile and get one of those pretty covers that has a bunch of your photographs on it, string it on a nice chain along with other charms and ask her to wear it.  
Other than that, you should look into seeing what memory care facilities are there, and what they cost. My neighbor moved into one, and  it was essential because her move from mild cognitive impairment to full blown dementia was swift. They sold her house, and that's how they've been able to afford the expense.
There are bracelets specifically for this. Difficult to take off, and has alarms if too far from home base

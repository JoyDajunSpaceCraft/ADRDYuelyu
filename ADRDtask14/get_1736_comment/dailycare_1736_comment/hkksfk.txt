You should look for an elder care attorney. They can make sure everything is in line for you guys.
Wow....this post sounds almost like my husband wrote it. We are in the same exact position. I totally understand. Curious how all this will all go down for mom. Sigh...
Ditto. Is your MIL on Medicare yet? They pretty much pay for the medical care. Especially when /if you get to the point of using hospice.
No, not yet. I think we'll need to either use up the money she has or work on a trust, first.
She could also "gift" her money to a family member. The other option is to get her on disability. They didn't even ask us about other funds. Just a thought

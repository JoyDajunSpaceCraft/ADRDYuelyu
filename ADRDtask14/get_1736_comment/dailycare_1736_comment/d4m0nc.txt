Only you and your family can answer that question, friend. Sending love and light in this difficult time.
Sounds to me like the situation is good for no one now. When you feel the people at home can't care for him anymore, I think it's safe to say he needs professionals. He will need to be medicated to calm him down if he is a danger to folks.

Sometimes it's hard to know what to do when you feel responsibility and guilt. What would you advise a friend in the same situation?
What does your mom think about him moving? How about adult day care, respite, or a home care service in the meantime?

That must be really difficult. I'm sorry you're going through this. Is there a social worker or a support group you can talk to about the resources available to you?
My wife went through a stage of getting very aggressive. Fortunately, she was weak enough that she couldn't hurt me, but it was still difficult to deal with.

There are meds to help with that, either at regular intervals or at the first signs of agitation. I believe the one my wife was on was called serophin. You should ask his doctor if it appropriate for him.

At one point my wife was asked not to return to the day program until she was on it.

Doctor. Its the best way. If she needs hearing aids the sooner the better. My father is too vain to consider that his hearing is not very good so he never got hearing aids - I don't think he would keep them in his ears if we tried to get him to use them now.
Thats kind of the way my mom is, you can talk right at her, she can be the only other person on the room but she has no idea you're talking to her. 
At a certain point it takes time for an Alzheimerâ€™s patient to absorb information. I have been deliberate in talking in short and to the point responses to my mom. She seems to respond a bit more.
I went through something similar. Since my dad's diagnosis a few years ago he has been unable to really process sensory information. He can hear us, but he can't "hear" us, same thing with seeing as well. I think the best way to describe it is that they are picking up information from their senses, but the brain will fail to communicate it to the correct areas along the way. My dad can hear us when we talk really quiet, I know because he will sometimes respond, other times we can talk loud and he won't be able to hear us. Sometimes he will look directly at us, but as soon as we move he acts surprised like there was no one there to begin with.

He was diagnosed with Early Onset about 4 or 5 years ago. He's stage 5 but recently we're afraid he's pushing into stage 6, severe decline. His behavior has gotten radically worse within the last week.

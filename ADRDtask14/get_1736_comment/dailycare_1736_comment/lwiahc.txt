Do you or your brother have Power of Attorney? Will her doctor confirm her diagnosis, in that she's not capable of making legal or financial decisions? 

At the end of the day you are dealing with an insurance company so it's not in their best interest to be forgiving. 

This really sucks and I feel so badly for you.
Fight it!
Also, all states have a Commissioner/Department of Insurance. Check with them even before paying an attorney
We both gained power of attorney a few weeks ago. Her neurologist could definitely confirm her condition. I'll probably talk to an attorney about it... Hopefully, there is some way around it.
Yes, an attorney would be a good idea. If you have PoA and her diagnosis was prior to the cancellation of the insurance then it should work out in the end. 

But jeez, I hate insurance companies, especially in situations like this.

Not super odd.  But repeated asking is not a great sign.
Itâ€™s called memory looping.  Agree with other comment that it could be an early sign of dementia.  How old is your FIL and has anyone else noticed other behaviors?
My grandma repeats herself about 20 or 30 times when she gets caught in a memory loop... every once in a while she'll realize she's done it, when I keep repeating the same answer in the same tone of voice... so you have that to look forward to.  

It's just that he can't remember what he said before, but the same stimuli (the actor) coming up again brings that same remark to his mind.  I dunno, my grandma does much better in conversation when we go out and talk with new people, but also it tires her, so sometimes we're just stuck watching TV and having the same conversation.
He is 72 and we have experienced other cognitive moments but nothing this specific

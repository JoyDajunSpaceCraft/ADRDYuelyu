I find talking about the cats works brilliantly in my animal loving grandmother. Oh look at how cute the cat is asleep on the couch. Or if they are not in sight I saw the cat outside under the jade bush fast asleep she does love fresh air. 

It backfired on me once as I pretended to talk for the cat next to her by saying "I love you. I love you. I must sleep next to you. She got upset because she had thought I was saying I loved her but was speaking for the cat. I tell her I love her a lot more often now. 
When my  mom didn't know who I was, and was living in a care facility, I would bring her her favorite candy. It was a bit selfish of me, because she wasn't excited to see me but was happy to have her candy...so we both won.

Yes please enjoy! Our lives will have to continue and going down with them is no good for them or the others in our lives. I remind myself of this daily!
Enjoy the mini vacation with SO.  Itâ€™s those small reprieves that fuel us with energy and determination to get through till the next one and help us not burn out.
It's important to take time for yourself, don't let anyone make you feel bad about that. It sounds like you're handling things as well as you can be. Be proud of that!

What kind of things is he struggling with specifically? LBD is pretty intense so it would be helpful if you can narrow it down a bit. 

In the meantime, I‚Äôve found the mayo clinic, levy body and Alzheimer‚Äôs websites extremely helpful as is reading through posts on this reddit and talking through my own journey.

To address the ‚Äúfeeling sick‚Äù... if it‚Äôs physically sick, like stomach issues that can be medication related. If it‚Äôs anxiety that‚Äôs normal and there are meds that help. Same for depression. 

Good luck and keep reaching out on this sub and find a support network for yourself. This is very hard on carers, and when it‚Äôs your partner that‚Äôs suffering you will grieve.
There are caretaker guidebooks available online which should be helpful. (the one I use is specific to the West Coast of BC, so there's probably one better suited to your area)
Is he being seen by an MDS (Movement Disorder Specialist).

I had a friend misdiagnosed as Lewy Body Dementia.  

I've had other people who just "shut down" after a diagnosis of Parkinson's.

The two are very closely related. Progression slow, nothing happens overnight.  Nothing. If he was seen in an Emergency Room there is no way the could give that diagnosis. Neurological Assessment takes six to twelve hours (I got to do that one, still surprised I forget the name of a Pelican).

A friend of mine diagnosed with Lewy Body is still going strong after six years. We go hiking. The funny part is we can get lost, but my Golden Retriever will take us back to the car! 

I realize you are both still struggling with such a diagnosis.   

[LBDA.org](https://LBDA.org) has great facts.
First trip was to PCP. Answers did not satisfy me. So I changed PCP and she did a test in her office. As I understand now it is a basic memory test. He passed every time. So, I began to think it was just me.  Nope as time passed I saw more changes. No one else seemed to believe me (adult children.) I was exhausted from trying to get someone to see what I was seeing. So, I called a neurologist and my help began.   He actually failed the in office testing and spoke of seeing people & objects that didn‚Äôt exist.  We were then sent to have him sit through 4 four hour days of testing. By the end of day 2 testing the therapist had reached out to the neurologist and made the recommendation that he not return to work.  He can no longer drive nor handle power tools.   Following directions is a real struggle for him.  He is at his happiest when our children are all here. But, come about 5pm and he is very grumpy toward me. I‚Äôm really struggling with this. Just as the therapist & neurologist said I would.  I spend most of my time taking care of him,  Where he was once a big help around the house and property. He basically does not contribute. Where he was once loving and attentive, he is short on temper, spends most of his time alone outside or in front of the tv. So, I question how will I ever get through this without being an emotional wreck.

Talk with his MDS (movement disorder specialist - A Neurologist who specializes) to find the medication that works best for him.   

Frustration is expected as his whole world changed and he doesn't know why.   

A friend of mine is the happiest hiking (lots of trails) or working out in our Parkinson's Boxing Classes.
Thank you for the info. I will  look into  the site. I would love to find him a hobby. üòä

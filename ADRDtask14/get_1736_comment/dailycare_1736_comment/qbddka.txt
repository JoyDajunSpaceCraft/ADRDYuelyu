Not quite the answer you are looking for, but a roku tv or stick/box is just about the easiest remote and GUI in the world. My mom also favors the “push a random button” method and gets herself stuck in MENU land, which results in temper tantrums... 

You load channels or apps onto the Roku device, and there are apps for BBC, YouTube, and even live local news/weather. The remote is extremely simple. I’m not sure how to use a VPN with it, but with the bbc channel loaded he shouldn’t need one?
You're right about the BBC iPlayer app, I've used several different VPN's over the last 5 years and it work for awhile and then just stop.

Definitely not a hands off solution to your problem.
What sort of content are you after for him? You can add the BritBox channel on Amazon Prime which has loads of old BBC content, plus our other broadcasters.

If he's a culture vulture then I'd recommend www.marquee.tv for plays, opera, etc.
This is an obvious solution, thank you. My inlaws have a roku and it does make things easier.
Yes, it seems to be a common issue, and a frustrating one.
Thanks for the input. So I'd have to pay for a Prime subscription, and then an additional $70 just for BritBox? The Premium would be cheaper at that rate. I'm trying to limit his expenses, while allowing him some small comforts. 

Also, the BritBox website is garbage. I find a lot of streaming services' sites are, but this one told me nothing about what sort of shows they offer.
I think I somehow thought you already had Prime.  You can also get it as a standalone via the BritBox site rather than as a Prime channel.  I think it's just a little cheaper via Prime, but only if you're already using that main service.

I don't know about US pricing, but it's in the region of £5-6/month here.  They probably offer a one-week free trial to see if it's worth it.

There's a list of the shows they carry here: https://www.justwatch.com/us/provider/britbox

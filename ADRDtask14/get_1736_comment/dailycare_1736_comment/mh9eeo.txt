My Mom has had Alzheimer's since 2013 but sundowning didn't begin until last year, usually in the early afternoon, characterized by heightened anxiety and confusion that cannot be reasoned with.

Perhaps your wife's struggle is menopause-related? My ex had some pretty concerning memory lapses at ages 49-50 during menopause.

Did your wife change any medications recently?

From your description it sounds concerning enough that I would encourage her to see a doctor for a blood panel. Or maybe couples counseling?
First of all, don't try and diagnose your wife based on a DNA test. 

Secondly, she's in her 50's? 

Menopause would be my guess.
Has she had these symptoms since you met her?  If not, can't be bpd.
She's always had a lot of (BPD-ish) anger outbursts for the years I've known her. Likewise, the covert NPD was always there too, but I've only recently known what it is and how to identify it. But these late night episodes have been increasing in the last decade or so.
I'm not a dr. Just as a disclaimer.   My dad though I strongly believe is an overt npd and has alzheimers

I'd get her to a doctor to diagnose the dementia.  If she has dementia there will be symptoms not associated with npd or bpd.  Like the forgetfulness did not pop up in my dad until later in life.  

The getting worse at night may or might not be sundowning.  I know my adhd symptoms get worse at night now for me simply cause I'm more tired in the evenings these days as I get older.  I think you just lose more control of yourself when you are tired or upset.

I think dementia has made it harder for my dad to mask his npd so his symptoms are stronger.  And his behaviors are worse at sundown I think both cause of his dementia alo e and dementia exacerbating his npd. 

I always read how people here have experienced their loved ones turning into someone else.  But with my dad, it seems to me like his true self is just showing more these days.

Won't hurt to try as long as you start with a small dose. Weed is a sedative, so if you want her to be calmer it might help, also with the mean spiritedness.  

In my experience the right amount makes anxiety go away. The wrong amount enhances it. 
I have a related question. At what point in our loved-one's journey is CBD etc most useful? 

My wife has occasional anxiety attacks, but otherwise knows who I am and can most times feed herself.

What are the symptoms that CBD would help with? "Simple" anxiety, or something more? I don't discount the fact that feeding my wife CBD will most likely alleviate my anxiety as well, and also that I don't have to feed her klonepin. 

But does an enumerated list of symptoms exist that I could look at to alleviate any guilt or anxiety on my part?
Thanks

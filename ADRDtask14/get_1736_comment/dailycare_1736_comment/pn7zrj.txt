Something that worked for us were to put signs on doors that said "STOP" or "Restricted Area" - sounds silly, but you'd be surprised how well they worked. We also put up signs that would help him to find the bathroom. We also had a whiteboard that was very prominent near his door on which we wrote down basic information, like where he was, who he lived with, that he was retired and didn't have to go to work and other things he seemed to be focused on at the time - that also helped. Finally, we got these things which went over the door knobs that you had to squeeze the sides of in order to actually turn the knob. We put these on the doors of rooms we didn't want him to go into. The other thing I would suggest you do is take the knobs off of your stove - we just put them in a bucket near the stove and even though he saw us take them out thousands of times, he never once got them out himself and reinstalled them.
It’s not hard to install a lock on the inside of your bedroom door (like a hotel door lock). That will stop him from opening it, but it won’t stop him from knocking on your door when he finds it locked. Take a look at this webpage for other suggestions:

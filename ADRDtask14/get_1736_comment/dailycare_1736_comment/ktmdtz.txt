Just be patient with him and when he asks be honest with him. With early dementia this response to major life events is common.
I am currently experiencing this situation with my mom. I have gotten great input and support from the hospice social worker and now, mom's counselor. I have put things in the environment to help mom remember that dad is gone because she would get as stressed out looking for him or worrying about where he was going to sleep since his bed is gone. When she remembers he has passed and she is sad or angry, I just sit with her. Other times, I distract her. For example, where is dad going to sleep? I redirect to another topic that gives her happy thoughts, like the dog.  Basically, do the best you can. We are human and there is not a right way all the time.
I’m so sorry to hear about your loss, I too lost my mother 11 months ago. I am in the exact situation as yourself. In the early days my father kept on asking where’s mum and what’s happened. I was open and honest about mother’s passing. Answered all of my fathers concerns and questions. I felt it was the ‘right’ and ‘moral’ thing to do. But I would just use your discretion and gauge how your father is feeling. 

The best thing we can do is to be present with them. Show them love, understanding and compassion. I try and spend as much time as I can with my father, I ask questions like - is there anything you’d like to talk about, how are you feeling about mum, is there anything you will like to know...and I also reassure him as best I can. You will have your own process with grief as will your father, being sympathetic and empathetic towards his own individual process is key. 

Take one day at a time, be kind to yourself and take some time out for yourself too. You will find a way to navigate through this - together.

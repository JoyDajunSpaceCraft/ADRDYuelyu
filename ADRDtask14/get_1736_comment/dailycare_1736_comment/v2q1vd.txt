He needs to man up and get a diagnosis from his doctor. Then he can take active measures to protect himself (and others) from his condition as it advances. And, if he does that now, he could have decades of happy life ahead of his with proper treatment and medication.

Denying it just ensures the disease will set the pace of his decline, instead of him having any control over it.
Time for full physical doctors appointment,  hopefully with you along. 
There are other things that can show the same early symptoms of dementia. If it turns out to be something else it is probably reversible. If not it is really in everyones interests to find out now. 
There is a simple form you can both sign at the doctors office so that they can release/talk to you about his medical diagnosis. Hopefully he agrees to let you. My dad (who was my mom's primary caregiver until he unexpectedly died) sucked at asking his doctor questions, asking information about his heart, rememberimg what the doctor said, wearing his hearing aids so he could hear what the doctor said etc etc.
He rocked at taking over my mom's care but not his own
Yes, it will be uncomfortable for both of you, but definitely press for an initial doctor visit. It very well could be early onset Alzheimerâ€™s/Dementia or something else entirely. You need to know in order to proceed accordingly.

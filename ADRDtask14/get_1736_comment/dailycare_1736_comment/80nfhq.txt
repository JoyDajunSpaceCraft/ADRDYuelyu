That’s a tough one. If you’re unable to ask her who she would like in it, it will be up to you to decide. You could leave out your grandfather for now if the pain is still fresh, but leave some blank pages with pretty photos of places/things she likes (her favorite city, park etc) which could be later substituted out for people. Unfortunately she will eventually forget who everyone is in photos. I printed out a lot of photos for my mother - family members and herself, and she no longer even recognize herself in them. She asked me to write the names on every photo of who they are, which I have done. 
This is a tough one- I’ve had a similar request from my sister-in-law to make one for my MIL, since my husband and I are storing the family pictures. For her, she had tension with various family members over her lifetime, and I don’t know what people or events trigger negative memories or associations.

Maybe in your case, if you think there are particular people whose loss trigger her, you can leave them out? You could tell her that you’re working on putting more together soon, and just direct her back to looking at the photos that are there? I’m not sure. 
Absolutely do this. Be prepared for her to be triggered but it will also really help keep her grounded. This a great way for her to feel connected to world she's becoming increasingly disconnected from. As my dad's dementia grew he would spend an enormous amount of time going through, arranging, rearranging and fiddling with family photos. 
Put one together with removable pages.  Take out the pages with the bad memories when she no longer remembers them.  Everything else can stay: "Oh, he's out getting dinner" is an acceptable response when she asks where a loved one is who's passed on.

This is how my mom was.  She stopped going in to work, and eventually got fired because of it.  She just kept saying she was tired.  We all thought she had a nervous breakdown, but it was the dementia starting. 

As it progressed she stopped doing anything, stopped reading, stopped cooking, stopped taking care of the house.  
My uncle has mid-to-end stage Lewy Body Dementia and he's often apathetic and non-responsive. Even just asking if he wants option A or B is like pulling teeth. He's even quit caring what's on t.v. (which was never the case in days past)

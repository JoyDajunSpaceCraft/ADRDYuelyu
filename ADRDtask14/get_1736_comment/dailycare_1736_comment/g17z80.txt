We JUST moved my Mom, after a 2.5 month hospitalization, into a Memory Care Unit a few weeks before the Pandemic hit Canada in earnest, so your questions dont really pertain to my current situation. However, I wanted to say Thank You for caring enough to ask these questions & for looking to find a way to make this time even a tiny but easier on the elderly &/infirm & their Caregivers. I wish you every bit of luck necessary to get this project off the ground. Xo
This app is a great idea. Thanks for doing this work.
Thank you, and I hope you and your family stay safe and well! All the best
Same to you & yours. Xo

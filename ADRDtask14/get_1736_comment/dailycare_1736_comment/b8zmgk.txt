I haven’t had any experience with this specifically, but it sounds like she has become obsessed with the idea that there’s something wrong with her hair. There will be no talking her out of it, you’ll just have to wait until the obsession passes. In the meantime though, I would also hide all of the knives - she may try to use them next, if she is that determined.  
My mom has logopenic PPA. She doesn’t do anything to her hair, but she does pick at/scoop up imaginary objects (dad thinks they’re plants or animals that she’s taking care of). Nursing staff hasn’t seen anything else like it before.

It may just be a part of the dementia that can’t be changed.  My Mama had dementia, caused by two devastating strokes.  Because of the strokes, she couldn’t walk or feed herself, so she was in a nursing home.  My Papa went to see her twice every day (45 min. each way).  She complained that her Husband never came to see her. We couldn’t convince her otherwise. We finally figured it out.  She said her Husband never visited, but the man she was dating visited faithfully twice a day :)  And she was mad at her husband, the dirty dog, he must have a girlfriend, that’s why he was too busy to come see her. OMG.

Ha! Gotta laugh when you can. My sister lived with my mom before she went into a care facility. My mom absolutely hated the woman who "moved in upstairs without even asking" but adored my sister. The woman upstairs \*was\* my sister. We laughed a lot about that. Poor Sis had many conversations with Mom about the nasty woman upstairs, always playing along with her reality.
I always say "Hi dad - it's your favorite daughter Katie".  He replies - yes you are, who ever is with me is my favorite.  I thought that was pretty sweet and very diplomatic.  He still has that!  He pretty much always thinks my husband is his son (and I think my husband is really his favorite) and he tells him when he walks in the door he knows he is going to have some fun.  Mainly because my husband is willing and able to get him in and out of the car so when he comes we get to go on an outing. 
Great story!
Right!  One of my sisters is living with my mom and mom would tell her that “the people here are mean to me”. My sister would laugh.  I feel like she has a thicker skin than i do but mine is getting thicker
Thanks lol. For a moment I felt special lol
Haaa. My fIL lives with Lewy Body Dementia in our home. My wife is his primary caregiver and he regularly refers to her as Ali--her sister's name. She reacts with grace and humor. Sounds like you do too. All the best to you and your family.
Thanks!  Though she did once call me Betty Jo who I later discovered was a cousin who was a bully and who she hated lol

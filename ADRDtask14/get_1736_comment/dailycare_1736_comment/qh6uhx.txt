0 to 100 over night is almost always related to acute changes like UTI, dehydration, fracture, etc.  Most commonly UTI is the culprit.  Be sure to have him checked for that at least!
Thanks! He fell a couple of times and got taken into hospital, so I think they checked for fractures/breaks but I will ask about UTI.

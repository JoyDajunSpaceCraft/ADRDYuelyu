He goes to concert
It's not lying.  It's trying to make sense of a world that they can't understand anymore.  Several forms of dementia have the fun side effect of hallucinations as well.  My father insisted that he was visited nightly by sexy space aliens who tried to lure him onto their ship as well as people coming into his home and having parties.  It sounds funny now, but it was distressing for all of us.  
I have seen this with my dad too. The prior advice is good. Consult the drs about the med issue. You may be able to administer another way....
You reminded me of a pretty funny anectode a teacher once told us. She said that her mother had to go to the hospital for an operation, and the nurses told her that she acts like she has dementia. Which she thought was pretty strange, because her mother was completly fine right before the hospital stay.

When she visited her mother, she told her how the nurses had wild parties at night, drank and had orgies.  Since she never halluzinated before or had this kind of behaviour, she was really confused, but since she was a nurse herself, she wanted to understand what was happening.

It took a couple of das, but she finally figured it out: The noises of the night staff preparing everything for the day shift sounded like a party: Glasses rattle from the infusions that were kept in glass bottles back then, and the exhausted nurses at 3 a.m. telling each other stupid jokes and lauhing to keep them awake. So since her mother couldn't see what was going on, only hear, she made up an explanation that was the most logical for her in that situation, no dementia involved.

I think that shows pretty well how it is only human to come up with theories about things we can't understand. And since people with dementia have a lot of things they can't understand anymore, they come up with more strange explanations than other people. It's not lying, just the attempt to find logic in a world that gets less and less logcal for them.

I bought one of the cheaper leg wraps on Amazon for about 100. They go a bit above the knee and it also heats up.

Imo you should try it first. The highest setting has a lot of of pressure and that could be confusing on some days, especially if it is uncomfortable fornthem. It depends on the day really when it comes to the power setting.

The remote from the cheaper models is huge and heavy. Be wary.

It also makes a lot of noise and that could be an issue.

Idk if my nerves in my legs are that bad but the heat aspect is lacking.

ETA: it uses Velcro and it kills my soul and getting it set up is a task in itself.

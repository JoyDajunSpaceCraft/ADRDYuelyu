Correcting will likely lead to more agitation. Id say "oh she is at the store, she'll be back soon" and, if he insists, yes, calling from the other room might be a good option.
More elaborate charade is what my sister and I do with my mother.  ANY attempt to argue ‘reality’ goes nowhere.  And, when the moment is over, she doesn’t remember the incidents.  So....lie with benevolence.
I have done a MOOC (massive online open course) from the university of Tasmania on understanding dementia a few years ago. 

I’m currently doing it again (it’s free, online and frequent) to help me with my nursing and effectively communicating with a family member. 

Other than that, UCLA has heaps of informative content on caring for loved ones with Alzheimers, with videos and examples. 

So much love for you and your family on this journey 💜
I really hope your mom can get some respite care so she can have a break. 

Here, either one we go with for mom does not work. If her parents are alive ("we'll go see them some other time," etc), we're bad people for not letting her see them right away. If they are dead, we are bad people for lying to her because, "My parents are alive and you're a stupid idiot." I think with some dementia sufferers, therapeutic lying just does not work. It's upsetting because I see videos of other caregivers using the technique and it works like a charm. Sigh. My mom is one of the ones where it does not work at all. We try to distract her, etc. 

She doesn't have any hobbies or interests (even before dementia she didn't do much), so she fixates on what she knows. And she is an angry, aggressive person a lot, so we get told off no matter what we say.

I really hope one of your option works for you. It's really great that you're trying to find a solution.
This is very common.  And it is something some of us living with dementia have thought about.  i wrote about it at >> [https://truthfulkindness.com/2021/02/07/lying/](https://truthfulkindness.com/2021/02/07/lying/) .
She could call & say she is at the store buying groceries & needs his help to remind her his favorite snack or soft drink. A call might ease his mind.
That’s been my thinking. But he continues to fixate on ideas like ... where is she; she probably hates me and has left town; please try to teach her and tell her that I want to see her.  “And let me know as soon as you hear from her.”
Appreciate that perspective.  Tonight she said that he lamented that "[my wife] must have just run off.  I don't think she's coming back."

She told me then he starting flirting with her ... whom he thinks is his nurse.  Thankfully, she got a good laugh out of that.

I told her that she has an out.  She can always say that she's a married woman.  ;-)

If I look at older photos of my mom, like her holding my oldest (who's now nine), she looks like my mom. More recent photos, and definitely by the time my youngest was born (she's three), there's this sort of vague, distracted look to her face. I can see her going from my mom to my-mom-now, who is not the same woman.

She's only been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, not dementia (yet). She's always, my entire life, been a bit scatterbrained, so when did it go from mom-being-mom to... This? I don't know, either.
It is unfortunately impossible to retroactively determine when it started, however any medical setback can exacerbate the existing disease. My mother had a seizure related to low sodium which quickly made things much worse. She had "quirks" beforehand, but after that it was a steady decline. Sorry to hear about your situation.
I had a very similar situation occur, but over the course of about a year. Looking back especially with the age of social media I see it everywhere-in pictures, in texts, in trips we went on.  My dad was not the man who I grew up with in small ways-from getting unreasonably angry in public situations, to forgetting I was going away for a weekend for a school trip. Now looking back it’s so difficult to know what was the disease and what wasn’t, but I think for me the biggest factor was when he started excessively watching tv for hours and his hearing issues-when watching tv it was as if he had earplugs in. But obviously it might be different for everyone. I think back constantly to random memories and ponder if it was my dad or his disease. In the end I blame the disease for the bad moments of the past few years, but know even to this day he has moments of “clarity” and I know those are my dad, and not the disease. 
I think my sister had Alzheimer's for several years before it was diagnosed, and then she had a rapid decline. I still feel bad that I just thought she was getting weird and didn't realize it was the disease.

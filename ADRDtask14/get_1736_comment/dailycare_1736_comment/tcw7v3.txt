Hate to break it to you, but if your family is actually accepting the "plant tomatoes in January, they'll grow fine" statements, you've got more problems with dementia than with dad.

They may not want to nay-say his obvious inversions of the laws of nature to avoid confrontation. Okay, that makes more sense. After all, the tomato fantasy hurts no one. (And I can even sympathizeâ€”who wouldn't want a fresh garden-ripened tomato in February or March?)

Maybe everyone's playing a game of "chicken": who can hold out longest before voicing the obvious, that dad is now a few fries short of a Happy Meal, and it's only going to be so long before he's missing beef and bun into the bargain (likely to cause harm to self and others)?

It sounds like you may need to be the one to break the ice. And I don't expect they'll be happy to hear it, as then you'll have to *do* something about it, at the very least planning for the future. And probably as Patriarch, it was always his job to plan for the future. It's scary.

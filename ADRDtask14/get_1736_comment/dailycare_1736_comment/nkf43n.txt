My mother does the same thing - she’s in a home and she re-folds every paper napkin into a neat folded stack. I think she tears off the part that is dirty from use and then folders the remaining part

She also flattened and folded down paper lunch bags. I’m talking over 100 of them, flattened by her hand one by one then placed neatly in stacks them in a shopping bag and gave it to me saying they were for my dog. 🤷🏽‍♀️ 

It seems like a common dementia behaviour sorting things out in piles and types of categories etc. 

Why? No real idea
Yeah, my mom is likewise obsessed with paper products. She'll spend as much as allowed folding napkins, toilet paper, etc. She'll also tear them neatly in half before folding and will tear off used parts of napkins, folding and saving the unsoiled sections. And, for some reason, she thinks that wrapping uneaten food in napkins somehow preserves it.
My mom does this too with napkins (and some the pandemic masks) and recipes. No clue why.
It would be worth looking into behaviours around "fixation."  Expressing hoarding or OCD tendencies can be common with people living with dementia.   


I think it's great you just let her be, as it's serving some purpose for her. It could be a way for someone to feel like they have control over their situation or she could think she's keeping things safe by doing this.   


One suggestion, is that you could see if she would like to help with little chores, such as folding clothes if she is able to do so.
It’s so weird, my mom is at least moderate and can’t be left alone, yet she sings every word to songs on the radio. Music has always been her thing so I try to have it on all the time.
Yes mine too, she’ll neatly tear a used napkin in half and fold neatly the clean side and put it aside. 

Also will put bananas in her room in a cupboard and complain about fruit fly’s without believing there’s a link. She is considered mild to moderate deters in her dementia.

You can’t guess where their cognition will show up.
Every now and then, I'll find half of a sandwich that I made for her, some time ago, in a random drawer in her bedroom all moldy inside the ziplock bag.
🥴 I remember fluffing my mothers scatter cushions and a boiled egg fell out. She leaves sandwiches in paper bags scattered around her room. Sometimes puts them in containers in closest. Cockroach infestation happened and she said confidently “no no it’s not the sandwiches they’re not interested in those”

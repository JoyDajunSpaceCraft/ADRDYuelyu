Yea, my dad can turn on someone in a split second. I'm the only female and we decided that I'm not to be alone with him ever. Before he got worse, he's accused me of stealing money, lying about stuff ect... Then when my turn was over, it was one of the boys. Always just "said" stuff. Recently he apparently made some serious threats against me and my brother said the way he said was just different, weird and eery. So just to be safe, I am not around him alone.
My grandma is very similar. She constantly accuses her full time caregiver of theft. Every other day she would rampage through the caregiver’s closet and claim that it was stolen from her.   
We tried everything from showing her video feeds (obviously logical explanations don’t work), telling her we will buy her new clothes (bribery also didn’t work..), and finally medicating her.   
Unfortunately, it still happens pretty frequently and her tantrums haven’t stopped.
Could be dementia hallucinations.
We got a formal diagnosis of vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s earlier this month. Dad has declined steadily since last April.   He worries where I am and when I’ll be home. Up until recently he would just head off to bed.  Now he sits close to me and I suggest bed time.  He watched 60 minutes about the Havana syndrome and joked maybe that was his problem.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."

"Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Yes, that reminds me that he got really upset with my daughter after calling her often over an 18 month period prior to us learning he was slipping. In this case we guess he could be missing the caregiver. Before he was medicated he obsessed about money too.  Routine seemed to help and that has been hard to maintain with different caregivers coming and going.

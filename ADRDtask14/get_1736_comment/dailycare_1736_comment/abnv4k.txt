May she rest in peace, she\`s been through a lot. 
I didn’t cry when my dads parents passed away, but that’s because they were abusive pieces of shit that the rest of his family placed on a pedestal.

However, if you didn’t have a close relationship with her, I can understand why you wouldn’t exactly feel sad. Just be there for your mom, that’s what she needs right now. Let her cry it out if she needs, talk about fond memories, or just offer her a hug. It’s the little things that’ll help, and it’ll make you feel better about it probably.
Shame upon you. Your sadness should be for your mother who lost a parent. Shame on you. Comfort your mother be there for her. 
Thank you for the advice, sorry to hear you had abusive parents.

It was my dads parents actually. Thanks to them, my dad was the greatest dad I could have had.

But hope I could help with the advice. Good luck, and condolences to your mom.
Thank you, I also felt relieved when I found out my grand grandmother died because she wasnt living she was just alive.

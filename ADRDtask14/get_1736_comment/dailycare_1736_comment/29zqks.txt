That's creepy if you did it on purpose.

You're clearly harbouring deep-set sexual feelings for your grandma. I would suggest gathering *all* of your family, neighbours and friends together in a room and then telling them. They will all support you and you will be applauded for your honesty.
Me and my sister were visiting my mother once. When we were saying our goodbyes my sister went to kiss my mom on the cheek. Mom turned her head, opened her mouth, and proceeded to French my sister for a split second. Was one of the funniest, most disgusting things I've ever seen. And I once told a coworker that I loved him after saying goodbye. Shit happens when you're running on autopilot without knowing it. Hopefully she realizes it was an accident!!
Um...
Mate we've all done it. I'm guessing you're a 15 year old bag of horny.

Next time go for third base.
This is what I love about the net, the fiction is so varied.
Of course not! It was reflexive. I'd been staying with my girlfriend a few days prior, it was muscle memory.
Thanks for the tip, Dr. Freud.
I've said "I love you" to my boss on the phone by mistake. She didn't care, I've said weirder things to her because she knows waking mr means having to deal with my weird hypnopompic speech.
Mate, only you and OP have done that. 
I'm 22...
Not fiction. I'd have written something far more exciting, given a choice.
Then what was with the tongue? That's a lot for muscle memory o-e
I 100% believe the OP on this. Back in my slutty days before I was married, I just barely missed doing this myself to various relatives, etc. 

Be thankful she's not lucid and use this as a cautionary tale for the future. 


Exciting, maybe, more weird, maybe not! Lol
It all happened rather quickly as one fluid motion, but it felt like it was longer due to the sheer awkwardness.

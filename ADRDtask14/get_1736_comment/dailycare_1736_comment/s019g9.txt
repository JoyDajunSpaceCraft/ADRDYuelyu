They can either step up or shut up.  This is a common lament in caregiver groups.  If you are taking out the trash, you can throw up all you want.  If they are the ones, wiping ass and taking out the trash, then you shut up.

The last thing lone caregivers need is a "bit of friendly advice".
Write this down and put it in your pocket: **"Help, pay, or get out of the way"**

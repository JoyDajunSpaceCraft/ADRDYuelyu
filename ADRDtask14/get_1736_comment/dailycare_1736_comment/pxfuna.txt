I would never let my husband try this.  The thing with cognitive impairment is that the person is very easily confused.  Once confused things can go bad pretty quickly.  I know once my husband gets confused he starts making bad decisions because he's confused. They can't seem to correct an error such as turning in the wrong direction. They don't have the ability to stop and think that all they need to do is turn back the way they came. My husband once left a building, turned the wrong way and just started walking. He had no idea where he was going and finally called me to ask where I was.  He was several blocks away and would have continued walking if he didn't have a phone with him. I understand your father wanting to get out on his own, but he is 82 and impaired.  He could get lost, he could fall, he could forget where he lives.  Can you find him a companion to go along on the bus trips?
My mom travelled to adult center daily with MCI. Took a number of times to teach her how to take the bus and where to get off but once she got it she had no issues. Where it gets tricky is monitoring the disease as once it progresses to dementia it becomes close to impossible to achieve these tasks.

Edit: the other factor was that the bus picked up in front of the building and the destination was the last stop so it limited the amount of error. I had gps tracking on her phone in case something went wrong. She progressed to not being able to manage this and dementia diagnosis within 1.5 years of MCI diagnosis.
Where (approximately) do you live? Sounds like you may live in a US based, East coast city?
I'm going to go with other posters and say it's really risky. All it takes is a bad cognition day and he'll get lost, or if something happens he won't know how to react. The only thing I can think of is to either have someone go with him OR find out who to contact at the transit authority. Since you say it's a small town with limited bus service, can you speak to the bus drivers and ask them to keep an eye out for him? Are there staff or volunteers who help disabled or elderly riders? If you can rely on the village to keep an eye on him, maybe it'll work, but only if he gets to and from the bus stop OK. You still wouldn't have his route to and from the house or shops covered.
Losing your drivers license can be very stressful for our loved ones.  But there are many options when you ask a parent to stop driving. Health issues such as hearing or vision impairment, or slowing down of reflexes will creep in. It’s a hard conversation. Alternatives to keep active will need to be discussed, so they won’t feel isolated. Seniors need to be driven to appointments or errands, yet hardly anyone has the time. Thankfully, there are alternatives like public transit or on-demand ride services.  
  
Then, if your senior family member needs to be accompanied by a Caregiver, you can book transportation assistance with any combination of home care services like Companionship through WeBookCare.

I would consider getting an air tag or other tracking device for your dad. It’ll give you more peace of mind when he goes on his walks. I don’t think using public transit with cognitive impairment is a good idea either. He could easily get confused and off at the wrong stop. I think a walking partner and outing partner would be beneficial for everyone. Is there any respite care or senior helpers in your area?
I am engaged in research to support drug development to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. I may use some of the conversations in aggregate to help support these clinical research efforts.

We appreciate your added insights to help give us a better understanding of the disease. What your experience has been like? What were some early symptoms that you noticed?
Thank you for your reply. 
You have definitely articulated what I am concerned about.  He has also left his cellphone at home on numerous walks so I can’t rely on that if he gets lost.  Currently he walks the same route everyday twice a day which we had concerns about initially but realized we wouldn’t be able to stop him.  We don’t have a companion at this point but can continue to offer to take him places to run his errands in town. 
Thank you again for your reply.

Thank you for your reply.  I will keep this in mind if we decide to pursue transit in the future.  I think for now we can utilize the pandemic as the reason we don’t want him on transit.

I live in Ontario, Canada.  We are in a small town with limited bus service.  The bus is every 30 minutes into downtown.  However our downtown is pretty derelict as things have shifted to big box stores.
Thank you for your reply.  I found what you said very helpful about the bad cognition days.  As we do have some days like that at home where we can manage it.  But as he is very routine oriented and can’t judge his own cognition I do fear he could end up taking the bus because that’s his routine vs feeling like he was having a good day.

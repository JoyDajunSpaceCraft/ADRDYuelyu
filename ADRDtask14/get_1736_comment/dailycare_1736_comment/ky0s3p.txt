Usually, ALF's have somewhere you can drop off items to be delivered to the residents.  Call them and ask what the protocols for gifts are.
That’s beautiful. Dolls can be very comforting for people in assisted living and long term care. If you are looking for help with a therapeutic introduction to the doll, I suggest contacting the facility’s Activities or Rec Therapy or Quality of Life department (different places have different names for the service). Their specialty is nonpharmacological supports just like this. They might even be willing to record it, or do a Zoom call with you so you can be part of the introduction. Congratulations!
Luves.  What a wonderful typo!

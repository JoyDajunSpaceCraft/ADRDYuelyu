Oh I'm glad to find this post!
My mother (58) also has early onset Alzheimer's. I've been trying to find games she can play that aren't over complicated or overwhelming, but also not so childish/simple it's insulting or boring.
I considered Qwirkle, but I think all the different shapes would overwhelm her.
I got her this book https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1500664685/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 she said she liked it but it didn't seem like she could follow it.
So far the best entertainment I e found is hidden object books.
There are some examples of modifying the Quirkle game for dementia patients on Youtube and Pinterest.     I think you may have to have an account on Pinterest which is a free site filled with ideas and information.  I liked "Match the Shapes for People with Dementia."  The YouTube author is "Keeping Busy | Montessori-Based Activities for Dementia."  The link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-Z0rdRWOgg  I hope this post is helpful to you.  
   


Hey, That's what I was thinking about qwirkle, but wasn't sure, it seems complicated ( I had to watch the video twice!! LOL ) Not sure where you are but I went with this http://www.activitiestoshare.co.uk/watercolour-paint-by-numbers-kit-makes-36  mum was never really into painting before, but she has done a few of these types of things now. I guess the concentration is to pick the right colour based on the number. Thanks for telling me about the books, mum was never a big reader, but it might interest her. Does your mum have an iphone or an ipad ? We got a brilliant app, it was pricey, but she always uses it and it helps. 
I love pinterest :) It practically planned my wedding :)

Thank you so much for this insight. It's a great idea. 
My mom doesn't technology well lol. She can barely use her flip phone and gets upset at Netflix.

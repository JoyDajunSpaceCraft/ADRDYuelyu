She needs a daily check list. My Father managed his early dementia for 9 years until he had a stroke.

Repeating questions is completely normal dementia symptoms. My Father now ask me what time is it every 10mins.

If possible make a video of her daily routines so she can watch and follow along. 

Good luck and Godspeed
My advice. Get a clear big clock with the date, time & month on it . Get a pill box which will allow you to separate the pills into each day & ask her if she has a power of attorney in place. Things can get more complicated if there’s no POA (making medical decisions & sorting out finances). If there isn’t one, speak to your parents & get it sorted. Also maybe get a big chalk board, put it in your kitchen & write out the weeks worth of appointments, meetings etc clearly 

All of the above helped my mom
Is she able to use an Alexa or similar device? Medication boxes with digital alarms are also helpful. Encourage her to have a single binder for all things important (phone numbers, an envelope for receipts, things like that), a single large wall calendar for appointments. Have her set up a health care proxy NOW.
I'll create a daily checklist for her to use. Thanks for recommending it.
The clock and chalkboard are a great idea, I'll buy them for her. She already has a pillbox separated into days, but I'll get her one with an alarm as someone else suggested. Parents are dead so me and my SO are going to be dealing with this directly so I'll find a lawyer and sort out POA. Thank you for your advice, its really useful.
She isn't good with technology so I don't think she could handle Alexa. But I'll get her the medication box with an alarm, that sounds like it could really help her. I'll also buy a few binders and a big calendar so she can organize herself better. Thanks for your help

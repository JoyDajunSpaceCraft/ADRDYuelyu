It's time to bring in a caregiver and explore behavior mitigation options with his doctor. In addition your family should be active in getting support in learning mitigation techniques.
Back seat, like all 2-year-olds. He's lost his higher cognitive functions and he's responding to impulse and appetite. Can't modulate for socially appropriate behavior.
Absolutely seek out advice, support and medication in with that. I echo above suggestion - put him in the back seat because he doesn't understand societal norms anymore. He is acting on impulse and wants, just like a two year old as you say. 

Once they become violent and aggressive it is definitely time for care but I do realise that in some countries care just isn't that easy. (I am so grateful I live in New Zealand) So seek out in-home support to give you a break. Medication does help reduce some of it but be prepared because other things will come up and they are never easy - just different. Sigh...not fun is it.
Dementia Careblazers channel on YouTube has helpful advice and tips. Itâ€™s a great resource! (helps keep my sanity)
What is behavior mitigation? This is kinda new to me despite my other Grandpa(who passed a year ago) having dementia too . I helped with my other Grandpa briefly but it was never like this . Vascular dementia is another kind of hell !
Vascular is very tough, I understand for sure. A good doctor will help find a combination of medications, diet, etc. That can help lessen the issues. There is no perfect solution and some require tough decisions and experimentation.

Loved your description of being in the kitchen - hell, I’ve lived it!  Had me snort laughing!  Thanks!
You got a favorite kitchen memory? Mine was a couple years ago when I had just chopped up all the veggies for a soup, turned my back for a few minutes, and within that short span of time she "cleaned up" the counter by throwing them all off the back balcony into the yard! Oh, Dementia, such a stinker. 

Thanks for reading!
Dad was “helping” me with dinner.  We were having leftovers, so I had something in the oven, as well as a saucepan on the stove.  I heard him moving around the kitchen (it was huge).  Went back to what I was doing, then I heard a huge zzzzzz and the microwave started smoking.  He’d put a aluminum foil wrapped baked potato in there to reheat.  Blew the damn thing up.  Had to go to Walmart after dinner for a new one (just had to, couldn’t wait). He went on to blow up two more before Mom learned to keep them unplugged.  God luv him!
I suspect you and I could spend a month of isolation trading kitchen stories!

A couple of months ago I had was preheating the oven while preparing dinner.  A few minutes went by and I could smell something burning but I brushed it off as probably some drippings from a previous meal stuck to the bottom of the oven. 

A few more minutes go by and smoke starts seeping out of the oven door. I open it to find out that Mom has decided that hand towels now go IN THE OVEN as opposed to being on the kitchen counters where people can use them. 

With a little bit of salt and pepper that towel was delicious. ;)
And people wonder why we’re not quite sane any longer!

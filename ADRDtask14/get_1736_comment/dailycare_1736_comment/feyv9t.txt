Yeah my dad was similar with aricept...and this was in the early 2000's. We also stopped it for him. He was also more weak as well with it.
Mom was on aricept for a good number of years, but it was so long ago, I don't remember what that was like. We stopped it after some time, because it didn't seem to do anything. It's hard to tell whether it worked or not. I think the big change for all of us was to just accept the disease and go with the flow. A lot less stress all around. Just enjoy life to the fullest with the living being that continues to experience emotions enveloped in the body of your parent.

Mom was on an anti-anxiety med also a long time ago, but it totally zombied her out so that was stopped quite early on. She's so far along in her dementia that she's no longer as anxious as she was before, so strange as it seems for me to say this, but sometimes dementia is not such a bad thing.
Didn't slow my mom's Alzheimers. Her progression through all the stages of it were tragically fast, though it didn't feel fast at the time.

In hindsight, I guess the speed of it was a blessing for her.
My mom got extremely agitated and angry for several weeks when she started on Namenda. She settled down after that but I'm not sure it helped her dementia at all. It didn't seem like it slowed anything.
My mother's behavior was worse on Namenda. I know for sure we stopped giving it to her. It seemed to increase her confusion and the amount of hallucinations that she saw. She seemed to tolerate Aricept well, but I'm not sure how much it helped her.

There are definitely reversible clothes out there. I have a number of yoga and stretch pants that would qualify. Also tank tops. Some sweaters. The important part went dressing my mom is remembering to remove any tags that would reveal their inside out. It's quite a hoot just suddenly discover a white tag after we've been out all day!
We're currently having trouble getting my sister to even wear clothes. I know there are some adaptive-type clothing but haven't heard of this style. The only thing I can suggest is cutting off the tags or labels inside so they aren't as obvious. 
If you put the clothes on the hanger inside out, would she flip them right side in?
I usually try not to confront my mil, if she wants to wear her pants inside out then that is what happens.   In the end does it really matter?
I buy my grandmother’s clothing from Silverts, they’re not reverseable but they are adapted to be easier to put on herself and for the person who is dressing her.   She doesn’t have to lift her arms as high for the tops, the pants do up on the side and are very elastic. Bras have snaps in the front.  
She may be turning them inside out because the seams, much like in sensory processing disorder, cause her discomfort. 
You might try clothing shops that cater to elders, like Buck & Buck.  I don't know about reversible fabrics too much, but it helps with some of the other needs.

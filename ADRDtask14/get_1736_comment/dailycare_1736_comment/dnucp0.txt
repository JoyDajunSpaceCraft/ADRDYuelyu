I think Teepa Snow's presentations on video are fantastic. She is marvelous! Your mom is in the early stages so might not be going through much of this yet, but the disease has a predictable progression and it's good to start learning about it. This presentation in 14 parts is focused on caregivers who are dealing with patients further along in their disease. There are also other Teepa Snow videos on Youtube, some of which give a detailed outline of the disease's progression and symptoms.

Depending where you live, your state or county may have an office of aging or elderly affairs.. Sometimes they have divisions for dementia and Alzheimer's, info about grants, facilities and resources near you.. You might have to go to the place to make the most of it, but im sure you could at least find a phone number online to get you started. Knowing your local resources is great. 

Your local Alzheimer's assoc or similar organization should also help.

Online info is useful but when it gets down to it knowing whats in your area is also important.
I'd call the Alzheimer's Association helpline, 1-800-272-3900. I used when my family was working through a diagnosis and it was incredible for helping connect us to local resources and answering questions.

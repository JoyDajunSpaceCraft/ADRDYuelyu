Once he has dols in place, has he have power of attorney? If not this needs to be done ASAP. He should have a social worker assigned to him, what are they looking to do? Are u guys looking in to care?
Make sure you talk to the social worker assigned to him and tell them about finances and ask what resources they have to help you. My family didnâ€™t get much help from anyone and dealing with her was unbearable at times and the fact that no one seems to want to help or know anything was very frustrating.

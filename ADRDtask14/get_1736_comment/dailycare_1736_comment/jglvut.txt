Hi George,

Sorry to hear you're struggling. You're doing the right thing to talk to your doctor, though! Nobody here can give you a diagnosis, so it's important that you work with the medical professionals that you can access!

That said, you're very very young to have anything like dementia. It is unlikely that this is what you are facing.

I hope you get answers quickly!

Good luck!
If you are on meds, it could be a side effect. Itâ€™s not dementia. Talk to a doctor.

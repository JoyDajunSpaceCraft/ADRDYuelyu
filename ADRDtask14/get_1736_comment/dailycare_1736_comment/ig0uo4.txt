I was very close to my dad and I had the sense that when he became aggressive it was a reaction to the utter horror of finding himself so completely confused. I practically lived there at the end as a caregiver/coordinator/daughter and I saw him go from innocuously bewildered earlier on to maddeningly unable you make sense of things one after the other as time progressed. It was terribly frightening to him to suddenly (to him) be in this shockingly unfamiliar territory and I believe his angry outbursts were no different than how a person might react in any terrifying situation. Fight. I never took it personally because he was a loving father and husband and friend did my whole life so I knew this was broken links. When he would say something hurtful or rude, I used to say “you’re lucky I know you don’t mean that, mister,” and give him a big smile and blow a kiss. That often relaxed him. I can’t know for sure, or speak to the situation for other people with dementia, of course, but this was my theory. Dementia seems to suck really, really hard.

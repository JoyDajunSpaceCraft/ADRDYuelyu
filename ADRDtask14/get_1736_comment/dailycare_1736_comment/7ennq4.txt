I feel yea 
Iâ€™m the same way sometimes. I was like that for years and recently about 2 months ago I started to care 
Do you want to care? If so i suggest volunteering somewhere to jump start your empathy :) 
So it seems like you are coming to the point of self-actualization that happens in every sociopaths life. This is a very misunderstood term and I suggest you do your own research. They have online tests and such. So check it out and learn how to function within society. I have met other sociopaths who are totally fine people and contribute to the world and have families and everything. It does NOT at all mean you have a tendency towards harm.

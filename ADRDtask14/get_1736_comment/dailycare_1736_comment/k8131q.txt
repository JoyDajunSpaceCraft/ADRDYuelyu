She needs steady in-home help. The occasional church group won’t suffice. Start making phone calls to companies and arranging for a permanent solution. She won’t recognize them, but you need paid help there to monitor her. Period. 

If all else fails, you need to pack up and get to Poland. Grandmother cannot be left to her own devices anymore. It can be unsafe.
I’m in a bit of the same boat. I send my dad photo books; large print, familiar faces, easy to read. I’ve recently heard about a company that has a cloud service which sends pictures from your phone or device to a wireless photo frame that your loved one can receive. 

I’m going to look for the link.

If you plan on moving her in, be prepared to have to change every aspect of your life. I had to install locks on everything, cameras in the house. They can become aggressive when their routines are bothered and leave incomplete tasks scattered through the house.  For safety reasons I would not move my small children into a house with a family member with dementia.
My prayers go out to you and her. I don't know much of Poland. I wonder if they have something like our Social Services. Can she get a caregiver to come in, even if just an hour a day or every other day? Make sure she's ok and fix meals. If they can fix meals for her can she heat them up, maybe a microwave? they could also get the Skype running so you folks can talk. 

Things to consider. Does she still drive? Can she get groceries delivered instead? Can all her bills be set up on auto withdrawal and her income on auto deposit? What about her meds? Does she have access to a doctor? Can they be set up to be autopay and delivered? What about her taxes? 

Basically sit down and go over her life. Whatever you can automate and make easier do so. While she may still remember talk to her about her assets and the house and any debt. My dad is 94 and he can't remember things anymore.  So anything I can't see papers on don't exist. 

Is there anyone at her Church who can help? Try Social Services. I dont know who or what organisation in Poland you would go to for help but try asking our consulate service etc or the consulate service of Poland here. Try inquiring of Polish govt with your problem. Or if they have elderly advocacy groups then perhaps someone can help.

There look to be some resources here. I posted the search instead of posting many results. For me I think if you can get one or two people so that she gets to know and recognize them. talk to her and explain whats theyre doing and that she can trust them.  And tell her that they can set up Skype so when they visit you folks can see and talk. And have those people bring some flowers and say theyre from you. That will brighten her day. If she's at all like my dad he doesnt want help. But he needs it. just keep giving her love and keep working on her. 

Best of luck.
Thank you for your reply, we really appreciate it!
Just an afterthought, your kids need to Skype with her and she with them. Have a Merry Christmas my friend.
Hope you and your family have a Merry Christmas also x

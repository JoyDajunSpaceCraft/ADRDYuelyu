Moving a patient with an advanced rate of dementia is very rarely in their best interest. If your permission is needed, don't give it.
The contract for admission will tell you if the care home is within their rights to move residents. Unfortunately most contracts favor the care home. There are rights of residents included in many agreements so I would look in her paperwork.
I went in to see the public relations face of the home and told her 'i don't think it's in her best interests'. Got an email the next day saying she would remain where she is for now. Thank you. I've built up a relationship with a few other residents on her ward since the admission. EDIT 5 min ago I found out they are wanting to move her again oh god.

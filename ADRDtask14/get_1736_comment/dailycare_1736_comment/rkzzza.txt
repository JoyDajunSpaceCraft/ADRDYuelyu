It’s so hard. I’m not in my 20s anymore, but I was when I found out about my dads diagnosis. I had no idea what I was in for and it’s been so sad growing up and loosing him at the same time. All my achievements after finishing my studies, I wasn’t able to show him and make him feel proud. 

I cry lying in the room next to him, I have dreams about him wishing he was still here. Like you said, no one I know has lost a parent, so I had no support. 

Then there’s the fear and anxiety that you may suffer the same fate, but I’m slowly processing and accepting that I should just enjoy life and live every moment doing only things that I love. It’s because of this I’m slowly pulling away from my profession and pursuing language studies. It’s something that I’ve always wanted to do, so that’s one really positive thing I’ve learnt from this experience. 

And lastly, I was reading an ama from a dementia researcher. He said something like “ you have a 3% risk of developing Alzheimer’s, but if you have a parent or aunt/uncle with it, your risk jumps to 6-12% “. The good news is, exercise and a good diet can bring that risk down significantly (as much as 50%). So we’re fortunate that we’ve learnt this at a young age - as hard as it is, we have our whole life ahead of us to eat good food and talk long walks 😌
My dad was diagnosed 3 years ago, I was only 24. I was so scared in that time...now I am late 20's..still...young to deal with this stage of aging parent. It might sound weird but kind better sooner than later. Imagine having to deal with a job and my own family such as lil kids and with both old parents that need care? Sounds exhausting and so stressful
Hi, my dad was diagnosed 3years ago at age 62. I was 24, my brother 22 and my sister 17. It has definitely been the worst thing to ever happen and it’s very lonely and isolating given the fact that no one I know is dealing with anything even remotely similar. I miss my dad so much and how are family used to be. I’ve achieved so much that my dad always said I would but I can’t tell him because he can’t comprehend. Watching my mom lose her husband is so heartbreaking. But, I try to think of all the other good things I have in life. I have gone to counseling and am taking better care of myself and my mental health. I eat better, exercise regularly and spend lots of time with my loved ones. I am also more mindful of how I speak to people and realize it’s so important to be kind because people go through so much. I know this is so hard but have patience, maybe there’s a greater good to all of this. Take care of yourself. If you would like to talk, please feel free to dm me ❤️

Hi. My mom is 58, I’m 26. She started showing signs when I was 24. I live in LA and she lives in NorCal with my dad. I spent this past year living between LA and my parents house. It’s like I live two different lives. I agree, it’s very very hard for people to “get it,” especially at our ages. 

My mom isn’t diagnosed yet. She actually has an MRI this week to diagnose her. Talk about a happy Christmas! She seems to be in the mid stage now and is still in such frustrating denial. The whole family walks on eggshells around her to try not to react to her meaningless behavior or else she’ll get incredibly angry. I can’t be around her much anymore because it makes me so mad that she’s doing this to us. 

Sending well wishes, especially during the holiday season. I’ve found this one to be pretty tough myself
I’m 24 and my 58 yr old mom most likely has dementia. It’s been tough. I miss the old her. She’s not completely gone, but she just doesn’t comprehend anything / can’t engage in normal convos. I basically can’t have a meaningful conversation w her. It’s frustrating. Im also scared for my future. I don’t want to end up like her. I try to read bunch of articles on dementia and watch videos, so that i can start doing as much as i can to not get dementia at such a young age.
Not my parent but my grandma. My mom died so I’m the only one really to be looking out for her (she has my grandpa but he is obviously v old too). I have 2 preschoolers. It is so difficult being squeezed between two dependent generations.
My mom has been showing symptoms for the past 4 years or so and was officially diagnosed 2 months ago  just after I turned 22. It’s been very hard and I think not having many who truly understand what I’m going through can make it so much worse at times :/ would love to talk about anything and everything
I’m 30 and dad was diagnosed last year but looking back he probably had it during my teenage years etc as he had a lil stroke that when I was about 8. We have only just found out that it caused scarring on his brain earlier this year. I remember being about 12-13 and everything feeling ‘off’ but not sure what exactly So I’m not quite in a boat as hard as yours but I get it, kind of. I just didn’t really realise how lost I am until his diagnosis really so I was probably just oblivious to a lot
Yeah I get how hard it is to not have a parent around for major milestones. I wish I had had my mom around for my college graduation. At least I can be happy knowing she was there for my high school graduation at least (she didn’t really understand what was going on but was happy to see me on stage nonetheless)

That part about inheritance and likelihood is interesting! I wonder if it’s the same for semantic dementia.
I guess you’re right. I also had the blessing of having a dad and grandparents to help. (I felt especially bad for my grandparents though. Who prepares you for having a *child* with dementia?)
That’s good she came and that her smiling face is something you’ll remember. 
I’m not familiar with semantic dementia, I did a quick google and it’s similar symptoms to what my dad had but he was diagnosed with Posterior Cortical Atrophy. So did your mum have Aphasia?

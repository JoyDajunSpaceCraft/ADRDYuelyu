Well you can apply to have her officially under your care. Like a dependent on taxes. Then also apply to see if she qualifies for Medicare/Medicaid or Social Security. (I’m not sure if she’s a US citizen or not). Those can help financially. It will also help you to make choices for power of attorney in case anything happens to her where major choices need to be made. 

I wouldn’t rely on your aunts, they don’t seem reliable. I would lean in and find programs that will help give her the supportive care with out leaving you broke or unable to focus on the priorities you have in your own life. 

This stuff is straight up hard. My mom had FTD, and my dad has leaned on me a lot to help watch her. Thankfully her siblings are helpful as well. 

Either way, if you need someone to vent to I’m here and the community is here. You don’t have to go it alone <3
This is hard work to do and if you need to sell your grandmothers' property to help make sure she is cared for then I say do it. There is no way to force the children to take a part in looking after a parent. And not selling the house so there is a financial legacy would be hard for me to accept if it meant a miserable life for your grandmother and your mother. That money should be spent for her.

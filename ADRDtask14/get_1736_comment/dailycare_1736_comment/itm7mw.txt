A bird feeder set up in the garden, to watch the birds?   Some roughly cut out wooden kids toys that need sanding / finishing, for grandkids or a local shelter or differently-abled kids facility?   good luck!
What hobbies has your dad had in the past and what did he do for work?

Yeey!  Around where I am, some community "Mens Shed" have specific programs for retired &/ memory lossed dudes, to keep them happily busy - they've teemed up with some kids facilities that are in need of toys, or simple repairs / restoration of small wooden equipment eg chairs, wheely-riding-horse thingy... Win/win for both parties.
Sorry to be so late in replying, didn't see this at the time. If he was a teacher could you take him some worksheets for him to mark, but make it into him being useful. Say its for the local school and they need help with marking the children's work?

Try and find something that he would enjoy doing or that would take him back to his younger years, and that would make him feel useful. 

Could you take him pieces of farm equipment (could be smaller parts used in an engine etc.) that he may be familiar with and ask him to fix it/put it back together?

Are you asking from a preventive aspect or a treatment aspect? Fasting has solid health benefits all around. There is an incredible amount of science to read up on. People like Dr. Rhonda Patrick, Dr. Satchin Panda, Valter Longo etc. are good resources. 

I think you’ll find this sub mostly populated by caregivers and early diagnosed patients. So if you’re researching fasting you may want to head over to the respective sub’s related to it.
I'm just asking because I want to know if I should try it. I've fasted in the past, when I was healthy. I know each time I did, my mind felt clearer.
I don’t really know what this has to do with dementia. There will be more people who are experienced with fasting in a sub centered around fasting.
It has to do with dementia, because I want to know if anyone with dementia has tried it.
Jumping in to say that "water fasting" would just mean that you're dehydrating yourself, which for most folks can create dementia-like symptoms. Also... Your body really can't go very long at all without hydration. Maybe talk to your doc if you're keen on exploring this route, but from my seat I'm not sure it would do anything positive for you... Good luck!
I meant doing a fast where you don't eat but can drink water
Oh - my bad! I was low key worried about you. Thanks for the clarification. Regrettably I don't have any advice regarding fasting and dementia.

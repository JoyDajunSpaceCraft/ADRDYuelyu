Here’s the big thing. If you call adult protective services in they don’t remove one of them from the home. They send a counselor to the home to help both parties. I know this from an incident with a family member and my Mom who has dementia. The big advantage to this is that not only does your dad get help but so does your mother. They will also give you a list of resources for help in your area.

Calling in Adult Protective Services could help everyone involved.
You should call. It’s anonymous and they will never definitively know that you called. Anyone could have - a neighbor, a friend, etc. It’s okay to lie to your parents and tell them you didn’t call - from recent personal experience. My anonymous call and phone interview got the ball rolling that eventually put both in separate assisted living situations but it took patience on my part.
Are you a legal adult?  If so, would your mom be able to figure out you're the one that reported her and kick you out of the home?

I think you should definitely do something but you should also know what may happen to you depending on your actions.

That said, if it's only verbal abuse, I do think that other person is right that no one will be removed so maybe your mom won't be as pissed and kick you out?
Yeah, go ahead and call.
Yes call. Abusing someone while they are suffering from dementia is extremely cruel.
Go to your states website for Office of Aging and Disability .gov It of course has the info for APS but also Crises Prevention, Home and Community Based Services, and more, Also even mentioning it to your fathers physician could help.

I'm fairly sure that depends on where you live and the specific laws of your country/state. If you're in the US you could ask r/legaladvice .
There's no regulation prohibiting it but you would want any relative to be very familiar w the routine.
We (my family) use 3 shifts of CNAs and one retired RN. I am nearing 60 and have it myself despite my ability to communicate. I don't help anymore, but my elderly parents have that level of care. Before I was diagnosed.
If you were doing it hands on training by you is all that is required by law, BUT you need to have serious ability to communicate during the times he/she is there. Also the ability to do the job. My father would not listen to much at all being his son. In fact he punched me a few times one day when he was stuck between the bathroom and bed. I turned my head and took it but had to pick him up and put him in the bed. He almost immediately forgot it and settled back into his state. While I'm just a guy on the net (older) I would run it my his MD.

You gotta do what you gotta do, just be sure you trust this person enough to know you have a camera in the house. I'm lucky enough to have far to much insight into my own disease that I no longer help as it freaks me out.
Good luck

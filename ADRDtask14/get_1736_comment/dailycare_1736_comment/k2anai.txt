Flowers is what I give my grandmother. Admittedly she liked flowers before but they remain a good gift as she can look at them and enjoy them no matter how she is that day.
We did flowers and a photo album a couple years ago for my Nana in law.
Comfortable pillow is what I always got my dad. Every year a new pillow to keep him comfortable.
If she doesn’t have a digital photo frame, it can be a great gift. You can load pictures of the family or from her life.
so far the winners here (she's in her own home) are:
1. flowers
2. solar powered christmas lights
3. paint by numbers painting
4. a little light up ball to kick around (but that's with us, not sure how that would work in a care home)
5. a fluffy, warm nightgown.
Socks. Underwear. Toothbrush. Hairbrush. Slip on shoes/running shoes with velcro. 

My loved one often loses these items/ other residents take them/ they get soiled quickly. 

Comfortable slippers. Bath robe. Framed photographs of loved ones. Large print word search book.
A nice fake flower arrangement  (not cheap crappy garish unrealistic coloured one) with small card/label attached "from Mabel & Harry". 

 Large size photo of them waving merry Christmas to mum (with their names clearly written eg Sister, Janette & husband John; niece Susan).

Old-style decorative lavender sachet for undies drawers / putting on shelf / table.

Poster of flowers / outdoors / cute animals / whatever interest plus a packet of blue-tak & request staff to put it up somewhere mum can see it.

A nice silky neckscarf.

good luck!
Depending what stage she is at, simple jigsaw puzzles or word find books, colorful coffee table books about favorite subjects. My mom also likes light scented bath soaps.
No food at all? Or will they allow packaged snacks? My mom loves salty/sweet soft granola bars, Oreo cookies and M&M’s!

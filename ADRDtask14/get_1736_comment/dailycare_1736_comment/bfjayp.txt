You pretty much got it already. It's getting near the end. Try and keep him as comfortable as possible. Depending on his will and guidance you go from here. 

I have it so my dad receives nothing to extend his life but gets anything to  keep comfortable. Just spend some time with him is about all there is now.
Have a hospice company come out and evaluate him   Hospice doesnâ€™t always mean people are dying that day. They are also brought in for quality of life towards the end.
When you say he's lost mobility, does that mean he's bed-ridden or does he simply need to use a wheelchair to get around?  My grandfather uses a wheelchair because his body is just giving out and he's not strong enough, even with all the physical therapy he's been getting.  Honestly, I consider my family lucky that he isn't able to walk.  I've read stories others have posted here about their loved one that can still wander and get into serious trouble because they are still able to walk.  I don't really have any advice to give, other than to say this might be more of a blessing than you think.  That probably does sound harsh, but that's dementia.  :/

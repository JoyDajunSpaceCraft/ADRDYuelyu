Call a family meeting and express your concerns. Your family may have to hire a caregiver when you leave for College.
>How do you deal with it?

First you talk with your family.  Your healthcare may have a Memory Care or Elder Care group that can help you understand what's going on and what's going to happen.  There will be a lot of very difficult questions, such as "what can we do" and "what's the cure", because those answers are "take care of her until she dies" and "there isn't one." So having someone else answer those questions is usually a lot easier.

Then you look around for what help is available where you are.  You go to [alz.org](https://alz.org) and use their resources.  Out where I am we have a lot of local resources for home care and supplemental care, I hope you have the same or better.

Then you start looking at where she is in the progression of the disease and make plans for the NEXT step.  Not planning for the future is the biggest mistake most families make.  They're so incredibly busy just barely taking care of today's needs that they're not ready for the next step.  My aunt was literally hoisting my grandmother onto her back to get her from her bedroom to her chair in the front room, and then took care of her during the day... and that was all she could do.  When Grandma caught a cold, the coughing kept her from holding onto Auntie's shoulders so she couldn't get out of bed.  That led to the beginning of bedsores, so she had to go to the hospital.  Instead of letting it get to that point Auntie should have had in-home carers, lifts, equipment, supportive mattresses... so many things would have made life easier for both of them.  But Auntie was too busy -- or overwhelmed -- with the massive job of caregiving.

To avoid this, plan ahead.  Apply for in-home caring now, because by the time your requests are approved, she'll probably need them.  Apply for a place at the best memory care facility you can find now, because you can decline over and over and over, and just be put back at the head of the list for the next available spot.  Talk to your mom and get recordings of her voice.  Get tapes of all the family histories and stories you'll ever want to hear.  Get her involved in alz groups as an aid or an assistant so when she's a participant she'll still want to be there.  Find out what her favorite music is, download it onto an easy-to-play format for when/if she has bad days.

So you have things you can do.  I do these things because not doing them is a bad idea, and they help me work through the grief.  Activity helps dispel fear.

Here, figure out where your mom is:

ETA: Thank you for the gold, compassionate stranger.  It's nice to think I've helped someone.
You talking to your family is a great start.  Hang in there!!!!
Your dad may also being a workaholic to avoid dealing with your mothers issues.  You are not responsible for her welfare.  That is your father job.  Don’t let this issue go because at 16 you are too young to be your mothers caregiver.  You need to enjoy yourself because it drives me nuts and I am 60 years old.  It will become to stressful and you and it’s not fair to be burdened that way.  Your mother would not want that for you.
OP, read this comment, save it, screenshot it, and then start your To-do list. This is the advice I wish I'd received 15 years ago.

Two things I'll add: 

1. Ask your mother how she wants you and your family to talk about it with other people. Let her decide how her story gets written, to the degree she can. This includes discussing milestones like "when  does she stop driving" and hand-off plans for any family stuff she's responsible for.

2. Start your own journal. Write about the things that make her special, moments you feel happy together, the little idiosyncrasies that make her unique, the parts of your personality that come from her. It is so easy to get wrapped up in the chaos of what is happening, lose track of time, and forget to help yourself remember the small things.

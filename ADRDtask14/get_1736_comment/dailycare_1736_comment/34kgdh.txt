It's possible you'll find something she likes there. If her dementia is still not too bad, then maybe you'll have some success with gifts she's enjoyed in the past. My FIL has it, and he's getting worse so gift-giving is getting more difficult. A lot of time we go for clothes: fun socks with bright patterns, or a nice shirt or PJ's. 
Also, consider something personal... framed pics of herself in better times or a scrapbook to help her remember herself with people closest to her. When the disease progresses, it's good to go through the photos with her to remind her of the different things she has accomplished in life.
Does she drink? For x-mas for a few years I was getting my grandpa a wine-of-the-month thing. He loved that. She won't lose it, and will know what to do with it. And it will be used fairly quickly. 

Thank you!  I'm saving this website. I've been meaning to make a scrapbook! I haven't had the time to get into storage yet.
Sadly, she doesn't drink. Thanks for the idea though! I might just get that for myself!

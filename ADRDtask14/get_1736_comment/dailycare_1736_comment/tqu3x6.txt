Honestly, sounds more like a substance abuse issue, but there’s no way to determine if she has dementia until she stops drinking and popping unprescribed meds. Is she diagnosed bipolar that’s she’s on prescription meds for mania?  Or is she self-medicating? I mean, there’s a lot to unpack here.
Glinda has a good point.  

But does your mom: 
•repeat herself (memory looping) several times within minutes?
•frequently misplace things like car keys?
•have trouble with her finances (balancing checkbook, missing payments)?
•is she buying the same things over and over again
•getting lost in familiar places?
•is her personal hygiene getting bad?

The above things are some of the behaviors my late mom exhibited.

Alcoholism and drug abuse can cause dementia. 

She needs to go see a doctor and they can evaluate her.  

In the meantime, start making sure she has a designated Power of Attorney, Advanced Healthcare/Medical Directive in place.  If she has her own bank  account (separate from her husband), have a trusted family member added to it so they can track her finances when she can’t anymore.
Have her checked for a UTI or any other infection. It can heighten confusion. And the cold meds are probably not helping you could get basically drunk on them at a certain point. Is it true that the women in her family have had mental health problems? Getting checked for whatever they had might be good too. But it also sounds like she is afraid of having her mind go. I’d check depression and anxiety too. Just ask her GP to run a whole screen.
This doesn’t really sound like dementia, but it’s hard to say. Polypharmacy, especially in older adults, can cause confusion. I think a great first step for your family would be for her to see her PCP with you (or another family member) present.
Most over the counter cough syrups contain Dextromethorphan which shouldn’t be taken with alcohol because it exacerbates side effects. Google regular side effects, then Google effects when someone abuses. I’m not a doctor but it seems like many of her symptoms are related to her addiction to cough syrups. Talk to your pharmacist and doctor to see how to safely wean her off of them. Your pharmacist may be able to provide you with some placebo “sugar pills” for her to take instead of the Dextromethorphan.

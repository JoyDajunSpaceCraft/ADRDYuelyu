I have not but hope this is the case for your Mom!  My mother and aunt are/were both very smart, but they feared dementia because so many in their families had (including their father).  The solution for one was to totally ignore and the other to try to plan.  In the end, others were making this decision because they would not allow until they were really incapable.  I am so sorry and am going your mom has made this plan!

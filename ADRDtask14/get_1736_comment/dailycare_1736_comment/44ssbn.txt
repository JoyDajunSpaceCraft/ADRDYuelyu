I would think there is some type of parental controls for his phone. If not, get him a similar model that does. 

Anyway, talk to the assisted living staff. I'm sure they have seen this before. They will probably have some good suggestions.
Is this a smartphone or cellphone (I'm guessing it's not landline, since you mentioned giving it to the staff)? If it's smartphone, none of the parenting apps, like PhoneSheriff, work to fill your needs?
It's just a flip phone.  A smart phone is way beyond his ability, at this point.  He was never real tech-savvy to begin with.  
Not to beat a dead horse, but would your dad be able to understand touching the phone icon, touching the graphic numeric buttons on a touch screen to enter a phone number, and then touching the phone icon, again, to place a call? Or, would he be hung up on physical buttons? If video buttons are the deal-breaker, I just found a [November 2015 article](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/110739/20151125/microsoft-unveils-nokia-230-dual-sim-smartphones-physical-buttons-touchscreen.htm) about Microsoft, via Nokia, making a smartphone with physical buttons. Besides that, my only other suggestion is to use a blacklist app, where you'd have to diligently block and unblock his number during certain points in the day, maybe in tandem with an app like Virtual Voicemail that would alert you when a call to your phone has been made but not answered.

The (UK) Alzheimer's Society has a [sub-forum](http://forum.alzheimers.org.uk/forumdisplay.php?56-I-have-dementia&s=0dea9fc12f8affd578a9d3816282e375) for people with dementia.
I don't know if the Lewy Body Dementia Association might be able to help?
https://www.lbda.org

I looked at their support link and it looks like its mostly for caregivers and family but perhaps they have another source.  The National Parkinson's Foundation might have some info too?  Since the two diseases are linked, I think they help people with LBD too.

Good luck finding a group.  I am glad you are doing this.  
I don't have direct information on support groups, but here's a good resource https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/publication/lewy-body-dementia/resources,  I agree that the LBDA has some very good information. /jh
So sorry about your diagnosis. Mdjunction.com has a number of support groups, none spececfically for LBD, but there is definitely one for dementia of all kinds:

I like MDJ because it is a very positive and supportive place. There are many other groups you could post in there for support as well. Some boards are more active then others. Wishing you all the best.

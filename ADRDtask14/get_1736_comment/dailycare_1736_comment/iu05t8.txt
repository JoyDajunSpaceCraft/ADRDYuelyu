An occupational therapist can assess his living situation.
Thank you. Iâ€™m feeling a lot of things; mostly unsure. You are really kind.
People in early dementia with a robust support network do best if left in place with their own routines.  When we moved my dad out of his home (unavoidable due to a fire) it exposed how bad his dementia was and he was unable to build new routines.  If we could have left him in place with caregivers coming in to support him I believe he would have lasted much longer.
I really appreciate this. Thank you!

This is very common.  As one ages, muscle fibers shorten and tendons become less elastic.   The lower lumbar region is a complex highway of nerves so it hurts right away.  The elderly also tend to just sit and watch TV endlessly.  This is very bad for them.

After she has been seen by a physician, see if she is eligible for physical therapy.  Some PTs can come to the house.  She needs to start moving.  Just 10 minutes a day can help.

I do a lot of chair yoga with patients.  Check out chair yoga videos on YouTube.  Find one that is her speed.
We used to go to outpatient PT but the therapist discharged her and politely said she was no longer a good candidate for PT. We can see about in house PT but I'm worried it will be the same. I try to 'exercise' her every few hours, but she's losing the cognitive element to do a full routine, or even a full range of motion. At home we do a small floor-bicycle, some resistance band exercises, and stretch her neck and arms for her. Plus dancing. She does do a lot of the sit and watch TV endlessly :/ 

I'll look up the chair yoga and see what I can get her to do. Thank you!
Even if you can get her outside in the sun, to do a 5 minute walk, it will help.  She may need a walker or a cane but that is fine.

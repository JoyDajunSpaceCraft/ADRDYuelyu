My father is on the verge of being diagnosed with lewy body dementia, so I understand what your husband is going through. I'm very much like your husband, more of a "keep it to myself" kinda gal. I don't like showing too much emotion in front of others. The best thing that my husband does is to be available to listen when I want to talk about it. He doesn't have to say much, just a listening ear is helpful. Sometimes he asks how my dad is doing out of the blue, and I kinda wish he hadn't, because then it makes me sad again. Luckily, he doesn't do that too much. :)

One thing I found really helpful was to attend a dementia support group for caregivers. They provide lots of good resources, and I've learned a lot about the disease from them. If there's one nearby, I suggest your husband go. It's very therapeutic talking with people who are going through it all, too.

And, of course, I am now worried about my own future and the potential for developing lewy body dementia myself... I suppose that is the case for anyone with a parent that develops any type of health problem, whether it's heart disease, high cholesterol, etc. I definitely explored lifestyle changes to improve my chances of a long, happy, healthy life. If your husband starts developing an interest in these types of lifestyle changes, try to be supportive, even if it means you have to sometimes change what you cook / eat! My husband has, slightly begrudgingly, given up on a lot of carbs... :)

I don’t know much about how all this works, but could you contact the American Embassy and ask for a welfare check? Explain the situation to them and that you’re afraid he’s been abandoned or needs help? I believe that is a service they provide.  Best of luck.
Yes good suggestion. Definitely contact US embassy in Brazil and ask for a welfare check on your father who has dementia and is being taken advantage of. They should be able to help you. So sorry you’re dealing with this, wish you all the best.
We did this recently actually, they were able to confirm that he is living, but couldn’t tell us where he is living etc, because of privacy law.  
So it didn’t really help us much.

Private investigator?

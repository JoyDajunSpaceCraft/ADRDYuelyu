A friend of mine sent her husband 2-3 days a week for half a day to be able to get out and do things she needed to do that took three times as long when he was with her. She'd be able to grocery shop, have an early lunch with a friend and then pick him up and go about her day at home, for instance. It was a godsend for her and he seemed to do a bit better with interaction, although he believed he was going to work and filled her in on what everyone was up to when she came to pick him up.
I haven't done it yet cause covid shut every single one down in my area and I think they may have just opened up again.

I thought I'd share with you that if the day care doesn't already have transportation which many of them do, then there is a free program for pick up and drop off service for senior and disabled where I live.  Transit companies also have disabled door to door service though those cost money in my area.

Just mentioning as it feels so much better when I really do have a full day off instead of having to drive at the beginning and end as well.
Thank you for sharing!
Thanks for that. The program does have a transportation option but my dad still says he’ll be on a “time clock” because he knows he’ll have to be present for when the car picks up and drops her off. I just don’t see how he can possibly get around that.
Honestly, your dad wants way too much.  I'd tell him to just try it and see how it goes.  He can schedule a later pickup time if needed so he doesn't feel rushed in the morning.

The other option is to hire a caregiver that comes to your house.  All he has to do is just answer the door.  They can still be wearing pajamas even in that situation.
Yeah. He’s very protective of my mom - which he should be. He struggles to ask for help and perhaps also he may be afraid of life without my mom/as a caregiver? I know I can’t force him to do anything but he’s complained enough that he’s not able to do anything with my mom around. *sigh* thanks for your insight!

Your mum would never hate you for this. Please don’t be so hard on yourself, you were coping and you still are. 

You knew you were losing her and you desperately needed to keep yourself from watching it happen. That’s okay, and it always will be. 

I hope someday you will overcome the guilt, she would want that for you. Remember your mother fondly, love her forever, and if given the chance try talking to your brothers about how you felt and why you didn’t go. You were afraid, you were coping. They may have been able to handle it but that doesn’t mean you could. 

I don’t think they will resent you after opening up about it. It’s very clearly weighing you down.

Chin up bby, i’m sorry for your loss. Live your best life for her.

Honestly it looks like she’s nearing the end.  If she can’t eat she will need specialized care.  Either a feeding tube, skilled nursing or hospice.  Her doctor should be made aware of the new developments so they can make the call.
Are you family or friend?  If friend, you need to contact any relatives, if you can.  If you are a friend, you are somewhat of a disinterested party and you should called the Office of Aging and ask for an evaluation.

Just last week, I requested an evaluation for placement for an elderly lady who is failing fast.  She has no one and only gets 20 hours a week from the state for me.  It's time.
Thank you for your post!  I’ve been searching how to get my grandma adequate care and kept coming up empty.  Did a quick search and found resources in my area.  None of my google searches came up with the office of aging but once I googled that specific term I found what I was looking for.  Thank you!
Sometimes they call it different things: office, department, administration, Social Services, etc.  Good Luck.

For my father it was not a big deal. When he was on his own he was forgetting to pay bills and had his electricity cut off a few times. It (bill paying) was not missed by him at all.
I would be very surprised if it's ever an issue past maybe a couple of days. If that.
Dementia is still a mostly unsolved puzzle. She can get or miss mental stimulation and her disease will progress on, more rapidly if she doesn't have food or medication support.

Avoid blaming your actions for her decline. Shore up your potential support avenues, like the POA suggestion in this thread.

I'm up to my neck in this; not only from a caretakers view but now as a patient. This is the way to go. Be prepared and it eventually will go away as a problem. Losing your autonomy is a terrible thought but I'm one of a small group and can see it coming soon to my house.

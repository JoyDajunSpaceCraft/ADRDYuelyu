This is a symptom of dementia called anosognosia. It’s hard when people have this symptom because they don’t think they need help with daily tasks and may even be offended that people are helping. It is something they truly can’t help. On the other hand, people who know what is happening to them are often more anxious and upset about having dementia and the changes they are noticing. It sounds like her lack of insight into her impairment may be more upsetting to family members than it is to her. I know this is hard, but it’s best to just go with and live in her reality. You can say things like “I know you don’t need help with this, but…” or “I know, these silly people are just fussing over you” she doesn’t have to know people coming in are hospice.
If she is taken care of I don't see what the problem is. You might want to continue the check-ins but ask that the people pretend to be from another type of agency like senior services or a church if that would make her feel better. If the boyfriend is the main cartaker, talk with him and see what support he needs.

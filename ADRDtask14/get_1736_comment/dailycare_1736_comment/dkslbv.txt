I don’t think what you did was wrong, at most it was a moment of mental weakness which happens to us all.
I can’t imagine how going through something like that can be for your family but you can try to explain the situation and let your father know that you support him and stand by him always. I hope the two of you can find a way to mend things.
I might come across as a lil bit insensitive here but a hug is a hug, not a support to a wrong act. Your uncle is not his wrong act (proven by his care to his grandma), he’s brainwashed and believed his niece more than his in law, which is understandable in times of confusion. 

Moreover if your dad truly has forgiven him he’d and should understand
I did try to explain it to him, and hopefully he realizes that's all it was.

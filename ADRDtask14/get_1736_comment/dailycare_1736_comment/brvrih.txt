My mom got a jitterbug smart phone. She can't use it. That said, the woman with two master's degree doesn't understand her email account anymore, and she's been using it for probably 17 years. So, if your mom had dementia, be prepared that even if she can use it now, she won't be able to for any length of time. I'm sorry.
We use one of those gizmo watches. She can call up to 5 people and we can all call her. It works really well, tracks her locations, and there is even a todo list area, my mom can no longer use that function but the other function work great.
My mom has mentioned getting a jitterbug, but never by name, because, well, she can't flocking remember!
They will go down to the Verizon store and some shithead will sell her an upgraded smart phone.
They are adults, so I cannot intervene, and she seems ok to strangers most of the time, but I could really just strangle the sales people selling her new phones! It's killing me!
Hi and thanks for your reply. I totally get that her ability to use the phone is temporary. However, since she still can and still enjoys calling her family and friends I would like to get her another one. I understand that this could change tomorrow or next week or next year. I’m just trying to give her something that works in the moment.
Thanks!
If Jitterbug sells flip phones, then, it's worth a try. I can't remember if she would get locked into a contract, maybe not.

My mom never had a smart phone, but as her sort of adult reasoning skills started to go, she saw that we all had one, so she wanted on, "to be like everyone else." Had she stayed with a flip phone, she'd probably still be able to use it. As it is, she never uses her smart phone.

Good luck with your decision!
Yes, my mom wants a smart phone too, but I know she can’t use one and will lose it quickly, so I never gave oh. We burn through at least 3 flips a year.

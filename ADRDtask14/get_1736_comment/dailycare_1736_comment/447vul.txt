Let me tell you my story". My dad met a lovely lady when his dementia was moderate but not crippling.  Though he continued to degrade, she supported him a lot and it was hard to tell how bad he'd become.  She went into the hospital and was there for about a week before she died.  We took him to visit her daily, but he'd forget.  The day she died was a nightmare.  I told him and he collapsed with grief.  I held him while he cried and he slowly recovered, then looked at me and said,"Something awful has happened but I can't remember what it is."  This repeated throughout the day.  It was a nightmare.  The next day, I quietly removed all the reminders of her and redirected him every time he brought up feeling sad, or where she was or anything that could even lead to discussions about her.  After about a week, he wasn't even sure who she was anymore.    

Honestly, If I were you, I'd keep information to a minimum.  
That seems like the general advice I've been hearing from people I've asked in person. I just feel bad sweeping him under the rug like that. I guess it's best for her. It's weird that in some ways I'm grieving him more permanently than she is.

She could be really dangerous around small kids. When I was five my grandfather turned around and broke my jaw when I tugged on his trouser leg and asked if I could feed the goldfish. The fish food was up on the counter by his elbow. What has memory care suggested about medication to control the violent behavior?
If nothing else works and she canâ€™t afford 1 on 1 care, they will chemically restrain her. Sad but true. 
You might try asking over at FTD Support Forum. It's private and moderated, but there are soooo many people there who have been where you are right now with these questions.

They don't chemically restrain them, but if they can't restrain themselves they toss them out? That is quite the catch-22.

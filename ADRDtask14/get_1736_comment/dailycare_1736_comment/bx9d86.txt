This is normal,...good days and bad days.  I have found much depends upon sleep patterns.
Tuesday my father gets a B12 shot.  Wednesday home care says he's a little bit more confused than usual.  I wonder if the shot messed his sleep up.
Good question.  I'm afraid my nursing knowledge is not able to answer this one.  Maybe ask a doctor.  Best to you.

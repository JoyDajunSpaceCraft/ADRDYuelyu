(Conflicted)
I am literally writing this after hours of flights today to be at the funeral of my grandmother who passed this week in the same mindset. 

It is totally ok to feel the way you are,  I know that today talking with my family there was a sense of relief in a way, of her passing. As dear and close as we all were to her she will be missed deeply, as I’m sure yours will as well, but I understand where you are coming from. You’re not alone. 
Like dont get me wrong I love her with all my heart and I love all my time with her. I just hate seeing her fall farther and farther away. Every time I see her, she’s worse off. It’s only a matter of time. I’d rather lose her while she still remembers everything. 
I totally understand. I wish you and your family the best in these tough times. Hold strong and value all of the memories, even the tough ones.

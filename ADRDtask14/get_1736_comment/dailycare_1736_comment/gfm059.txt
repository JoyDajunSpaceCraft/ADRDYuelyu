The best plan is to engage him in something he already likes to do.  Does he like puzzles?  Reading the paper?  Phoning a friend?  Adult coloring books?  

Could he be given some simple chores to do?  (setting the table, folding laundry)

Some dementia patients still like to exercise, for instance treadmill or exercise bike, so that is another avenue.  Hope this gave you some ideas.
It's also common for someone with alzheimers to wander and be restless, walking around can relieve anxiety and stress.  Do they have a pet? Maybe some furry companionship would help? My mom can still play solitaire sometimes it's odd what they can still do and what they can't, best to you
I wish I had some suggestions for you; I have the same issue with my dad. The problem is my dad used to be really good at taking things apart and fixing them but now he takes apart things that aren't broken and breaks them. I need to find a way to give him something to take apart that doesn't matter and will hold his attention. I wish I had some ideas for you, sorry!
My mum loves painting old furniture.. anything really...keeps her focused for ages,and added bonus...she dot smoke as much!
he likes to read magazines - or look at the photos - maybe i'll order some new magazines for him...thanks for the ideas.
i bring my dog over to visit my parents and they like that. i agree about pets.
You could go to Goodwill and buy some small appliances there.  Cheap and he can do whatever he wants to them.  OP, this might be an idea for your Dad too if heâ€™s handy with this kind of thing.
Sorry, I don't have good suggestions but walking/wandering in itself is sometimes therapeutic. Would he be interested in a winding yarn, rain sticks, or stacking blocks? My mom does janga
great idea!

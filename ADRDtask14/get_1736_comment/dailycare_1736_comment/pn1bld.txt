You could check with your local public library, they may have some children’s books that deal with the topic. 
I’m sorry to hear about your ggma.

My son's mother died of cancer when he was almost 3. Now we are caring for my father and he will be front and center when his grandfather dies.
 My advice is, don't worry about it. Kids can figure things out and cope way better than any old person. Just make sure you handle it in the way you want them to handle it when it's your turn to go.
One of my kids was around that age when their great grandfather passed. This won’t apply to everyone but we celebrated his life and talked about all the love he had in his life and how grateful we were to have had our time with him. We left an open line of communication too so my kid knew they could come me at any time and share their feelings about it with me. I would just listen to them talk about feeling sad and validate their feelings, not try to fix them. They were sad for a while but I think they learned how to feel it in a healthy way.

I hope you are able to find something that works for your family!

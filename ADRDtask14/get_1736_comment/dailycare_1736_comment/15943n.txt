No. DNR means do not resuscitate. It only means no CPR, no intubation. If someone's heart stops or they stop breathing, they are not to be resuscitated.
Thank you for responding.

As an addendum:  would it be considered neglect to deny a person in this situation something like Ensure for nutrition?  I have heard that in MN, the care that individuals in care facilities who are also on hospice care receive is no longer in the jurisdiction of the state health dept. but under the discretion of the supervising physician.  Any knowledge on whether or not this is true?

I am wondering this, at heart, because I feel there may be an issue of neglect happening here and I am wondering if I should report it.

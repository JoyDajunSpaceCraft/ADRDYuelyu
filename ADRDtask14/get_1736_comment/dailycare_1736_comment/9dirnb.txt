Ok, going to need a bit more information on your situation. 

First, I need a location (county/state should be enough if in the USA) to see if there are any caregiver stipends provided by your county government. - you can search this yourself by going to your county website and looking up "health and human services" ,"disability and Aging services" something along those lines. 

PM me the location if you'd like to keep ot private.

2nd, have your father call their health insurance, and see what they offer as far as caregiving goes. 

Are either one of them veterans? 

That will get me a bit closer to helping you find an answer.
I don't know the specifics on this, but my mom has Medicare and at DJFS they told us that if a family member is legally your caregiver they can get paid for the work they do to help you. Not sure if that helps, but good luck!
My county administers a federal government grant that gives me $1000/year that has to be used for respite care or adult daycare.
The best part is that they connect me with the agencies that provide care.

It does. Both of my grandparents are considered dependent now and my dad is required to live with them so he canâ€™t work. This should help tons hopefully when I get the chance I will see about what I need to do through our social services dep.

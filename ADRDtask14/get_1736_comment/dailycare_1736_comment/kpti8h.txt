LOL!  My father (82) walked up behind some ladies at Costco and put his chin on on of the ladies shoulder from behind 😳. Told him that's not a good idea in a pandemic.  They do some crazy stuff!
Never fun. Have patience. Who gives a flying shit what people think? If they are wondering. Tell them flat out he is suffering from Dementia. 9.5/10 people will understand.
I'm so sorry that must have been so embarrassing for you.  Did he calm down after that?
Sorry you had that happen. Never know what's going to happen next.
Keep your chin up and a smile on your face. You will never see those people again.
We used to have cards we’d give people since referencing my mom’s Alzheimer’s in front of her would *not* go well. So we always had cards to discreetly pass to the person. Helped a LOT.
I picture him quietly saying “Hello!”
It’s not about the other people, it’s the illogical nature of his behaviour. Regardless of the fact that I know his brain isn’t functioning correctly anymore, it reminds me so much of a toddler having a meltdown over literally nothing.

I have massive patience issues with that kind of thing so I really feel the pressure to not look at him with disgust at his actions.

*Big inhale/big exhale* “I’m just moving over Dad, so that I’m not in the way”

“Well yes, don’t be in the way!”
Not as much about the embarrassment, I have trouble with the illogical nature of the behaviour. He’s just so much like an out-of-control toddler, and I hate those kinds of behaviours. The ones where it’s just such a massive over-reaction to nothing. 

The aggression, no biggie.

The repetition, no biggie.

The threats to his landlord that I have to hear over and over, no biggie.

But the overly-emotional reactions to situations that don’t call for it, that is what tries my patience over everything else.
Oh, it wasn’t about the embarrassment, it’s the illogical freak outs. I get that his brain is turning to rice pudding but I still get annoyed.
Good idea!
LOL!!!  He said "your in my way". Then my wife grabbed him and apologized...
I understand completely. Hang in there. All the best to you and You're Dad.
This is how I feel with my mother as well! The reactions to simple things that she never would have given a second thought before, getting angry so quickly and yelling at me or breaking down crying for god know what... that shit sucks. Patience feels impossible sometimes.

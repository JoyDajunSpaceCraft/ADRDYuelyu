Tell him his phone is broken and you need to get a new one.  I did this so my husband would not call people and bother them . One day an old friend showed up concerned about him and I had to explain his situation. he really didnâ€™t use his phone much so he soon forgot about it.
This is all part of the grand game of what my siblings and I called "Kick the Can Down the Road" when we were dealing with my mom. She'd want X, we knew X wasn't possible so we'd come up with some plausible reason for a short period of denial of X, she'd bring it up, we'd tell her we're still trying to figure out how to get it back AKA stall, she'd get mad but not at us because we always made sure it was some nameless, faceless not real person who was to blame for not getting whatever until she forgot to keep asking. 

We used it for:
Taking her keys,  taking a cat she was unintentionally hurting, putting her in a nursing home, not taking her home, lots of other little things along the way.
Yep, we call it whack a mole. Thanks.

Sorting socks, folding wash cloths, jigsaw puzzles, or sorting buttons, sorting playing cards or index cards by color, sorting or looking at photos. Good luck.
Colouring books were our saviour, with different ink gel pens and pencils.  We also had a soft ribbon around her waist and chair to minimize the risk of falling. She would pick at it every once in a while then lose interest. Stay well through this journey.
My mom’s hearing was not the best either. I used my over the ear headphones and it helped.
Coloring books?
Lacing activities
Puzzles! My grandmother loves them.
Your Grandma can still feel textures! Out & about there are small blankets, balls etc. That have different textures, ribbons! It might hold some interest as being new! 

Dose she like to sing? What are some of the the old songs she remembers or could teach you? 
These are a few things my mom who was going deaf and blind in one eye! 

Oh, another thing we gave her a medium size doll of which she would show off to anyone that would take a look - she would say "isn't she cuuuute?" Wow, good memories!

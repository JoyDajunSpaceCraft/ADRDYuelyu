Yes, I'd stress the need to determine a "baseline".
My dad has has a lot of feelings about being a “fuckup”, like this is somehow his fault. 

I’ve started saying things like, “The situation is X (and that’s not your fault, you didn’t do anything wrong), so we’re going to do Y as a response.”

He’s remembering feeling bad, more than he remembers what was said or the situations, so I try to tamp down on the bad feelings before they get blown up into something memorable.
People seem to feel more at ease when I tell them it's like taking their blood pressure or their temperature, it's a measurement at a point in time. Plus as previous poster said, establishing a baseline is important for later.

Friend moved away. Far, far away. Repeat every time. That's how we handle a similar thing.
Agree with having a easy go-to answer, also if your grandmother has another favorite topic that you like too, you could switch to that one. 

My mom had repeat topics for particular moods, I think. When she was feeling down and pushing for hope or interest, I believe that's when she would say things like 'the daffodils will come up.'

Easier said than done with repetition, but maybe in this case your grandmother would be equally happy to talk about any topic that could end up along the lines of "you were right about that" or "you know this part of me well."
My mom had dementia. She asked a lot of questions repeatedly. But sometimes, you need to lie nicely just to satisfy them. But remember what you said, and keep repeating it as necessary. But as far as your ex-friendship goes, it's not like you're seeing this ex-friend. Just say that they're doing great and let it go. I do know how hard it is, but by making it easier for them, it will make it easier for you as well.

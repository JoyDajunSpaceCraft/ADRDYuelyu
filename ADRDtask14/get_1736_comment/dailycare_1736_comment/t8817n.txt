This might actually be a good thing... You do not want her in a place that has all these issues... That's a joke. You 100% right, dementia sufferers take ages to adjust to anything new. It's literally took my mum so long to settle into her care home. Two weeks until she stopped having meltdowns and two months until her mood finally lifted completely. Sometimes it even unsettles her for an afternoon if I've had her out and she forgets where she lives now. If they can't cope, it's not a safe environment for your mum. It's a desaster waiting to happen. It's embarrassing for them to have to do that to your family. The situation is definitely something that needs to be flagged to the care inspectorate that covers your city.
This is outrageous. Can you report them to the CQC? That's the Care Quality Commission who regulates care services in the UK and gives them their license..I feel like they should know about this.
Let me get this straight...A facility that specializes in dementia care seriously thinks that 10 individuals with advanced cognitive impairments are going to sleep throughout the night? 

Having worked on memory care units for the last two decades I seriously have to ask.....Are they high?  

It should just be expected that half or more of them could be unsettled and wandering at any given time. THIS IS WHY THEY ARE THERE!!!!!!
Unfortunately, staffing is a huge problem all over the UK. It’s not safe at all but it’s happening everywhere. You are correct that only having one care worker on shift isn’t safe. One person alone can’t reposition someone in bed or assist with toileting safely in many cases. I’m sorry that staffing issues are having such a huge impact on you.

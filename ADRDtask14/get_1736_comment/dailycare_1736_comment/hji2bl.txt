Cannabis had been linked to increased psychosis in people who already have or are at risk of psychosis. So I'd tread VERY carefully here. It might help, might not. Maybe check with the doctor, if your region has legal weed?
We enquired about it for my father (LBD / FTD) the doctor STRONGLY advised against it (not from the legal standpoint but the mental standpoint)  as apparently it can contribute to psychosis and make things worse.

LBD is horrible, and apart from outright sedation there doesn't appear to be a lot you can do that doesn't have drastic negative effects. 

I feel for you, it's horrible to watch. My dad passed almost 12 months ago. I wouldn't wish LBD on anyone.
My dad passed away from LBD 6 months ago. He suffered from night terrors and violent hallucinations every night. I eventually tried giving him some weed and it helped him stay asleep throughout the night. Every case of LBD is so different though so the effect cannabis will have on the person varies. It’s honestly worth trying it out. We tried everything you could think of to help my dad live as comfortably as possible. It’s a really slow and heartbreaking process. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. Wishing you the best.
My memory is getting worse (sigh) not sure if you have stopped into /r/Parkinsons but it's a sub for Parkinson's and Lewy Body. 

Cannabis is not good for hallucinations.  When I wake in the middle of the night my dogs are there to reassure me. Separate bedroom from my wife so she can get her rest.

 Just a little background.

Parkinson's Disease with Dementia  (movement disorder started first) and Lewy Body Dementia (Cognitive issues occurs first) are the same. Hence our medications are critial "On  time, every time".

HALDOL  should never be administered (It blocks dopamine, and can be fatal for  someone with Parkinson's or Lewy Body. Some nurses call it "Vitamin H"  great for Alzhiemers.

Recently  memory is difficult, but memories when 20 years old can be activated by  music from that time person. If the person was born in 1950, you have  some great 1970s music to hear.

Do  remember with Alzheimer's it is like the pages in a book are blank.  With PDD or LBD, the pages are still there, but often harder to recall.

Hallucinations: Those bunny rabbits are real!  Don't argue, but just ask "oh, how did they get in here again".
Don't.

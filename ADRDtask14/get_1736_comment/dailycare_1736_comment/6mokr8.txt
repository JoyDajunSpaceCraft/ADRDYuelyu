I've been taking my mom to Bingo the past few months.  It gets her brain working and it's something to do. I see a lot of solo people there
My dad's memory care supplies woodworking projects that were simple and only required minimal effort.  They were left in a workshop area where people could put in a couple of screw, sand or paint them.  They put together quite a few wooden cars that were donated to the local children's hospital and some birdhouses and feeders that were placed out in the garden. 
I have been scanning family pictures into the computer and then my dad really has fun labeling them. My mother who's got Alzheimer's also gets in on the act by writing notes when she looks at the physical pictures. She's not so good on the computer always touches something she shouldn't.
Still looking for more ideas if anyone has any! 
Thanks for the idea! I think he might like this. I probably should have noted that he really shouldn't drive, but this is a good idea for one of us to take him to. 
This sounds fun and like it would be productive and enjoyable for him. Thank you!

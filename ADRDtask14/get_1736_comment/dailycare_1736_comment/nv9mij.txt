“Hi, Great Grandma, it’s Jimmy (or whatever your name is, of course), and I’m here to visit you. Would it be ok if I gave you a hug?” And then take her cues from there. I try to use complete thoughts in each sentence, because it helps the person re-orient in the here and now. If she does not know who you are and denies you are related to her, just say something like, well I am someone who cares about you and wanted to spend some time visiting. Then suggest an activity that she might enjoy. Her full-time caregivers may have a an idea of what that could be. Or you may try playing some music she used to like, Or have some pictures to show her, etc.
One thing I'm learning with my mom, whose dementia is moderate, is not to go in with any expectations but to have several loose plans ready depending on what kind of day she's having. Is she up for a walk? Yay, let's go for a walk! No walk? Okay, how about an activity she might enjoy? That has to be flexible too, because as she loses memory and cognitive skills, her range of activities she can genuinely enjoy goes down. So, no more jigsaw puzzles, but I can sort things with her or ask her to read an article from Reader's Digest or do some chores like folding laundry. How about out for lunch? These days, it's not that she's avoiding social interactions, but her appetite is so poor, she has no interest in food. And if none of that works, let's put on a British mystery series like Father Brown or Poirot.

Play it loose, and remember, it's okay if you stumble. Managing a neutral or positive reaction when your loved one shows a deficit you weren't expecting is hard. Be kind to yourself as much as you are kind to her. Even if she doesn't know who you are, you clearly love her.
Thank you so much!
Thank you very much my friend
I hope you’re ok and that the visit went as well as it could. You don’t have to respond. I understand how hard these things can be.

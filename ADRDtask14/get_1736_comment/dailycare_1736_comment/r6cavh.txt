When you first see him, if he doesn’t recognize you, don’t say things like “remember me? I’m your grandchild, Kelly. You know, Bill’s child?  Remember?”  The patient just gets more frustrated that they can’t remember.

Introduce yourselves as his grandchildren  (and he might actually remember you, perhaps not at first, but maybe after a while) but don’t do the “you remember me?”  thing. 

And the more you visit, the more familiar you will be to him.  Perhaps bring some photos of yourselves and put your names and relationship to him with the pics.  

When my mom stopped knowing us as her kids, every now and then she DID know us for a moment, and it was such a gift!
I wonder if you could approach him without the expectation that he will recognise you. Perhaps try just being people who are walking by and wanted to say hello. Like volunteers 

Walk in his room and just say hi, try to point out something in his room and ask him about it - a photo, something on TV what his favourite food is - just to get him talking and see?

It’s completely understandable that you’re scared but try to pair back your expectations and see it as saying hello to a grandfather who may love a friendly face whether he remembers you or not. Don’t place too much on the first visit maybe subsequent visits will prove to be very different 

Dementia can be very unpredictable
Thank you for letting me know this helps a lot
Yeah I've been told to expect that he won't remember.  I'm tryna prepare myself as much as I can. Thank you

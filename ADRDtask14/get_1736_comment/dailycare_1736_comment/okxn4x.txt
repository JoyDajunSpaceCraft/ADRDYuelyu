It would be something I would mention to his doctor and push for further testing.
We don’t share the same doctor, and I feel like he wouldn’t listen to his doctor and get furious at me for this.
He doesn’t need to know you talked to his doctor. Find out who is doctor is and give the office a call. Let the doctor know the behaviors you’ve witnessed. And really, if your dad gets furious, that’s okay. He needs to get this checked out. He was getting pretty mad thinking TSA and gas station attendants were messing with his stuff, right? This is just one more aggravation for your dad, but at least this one could lead to better medical and personal care.
Okay. I know who his doctor is, just I’m probably the only person who knows him well enough to describe all this stuff to his doctor so he’d know it’s me
He will have to get mad then. You can alway plead ignorance. He may think TSA reported him. Lol 

Seriously, though. It sucks having to do this. I had to do it with my 50 year old husband. The doctor didn’t see any reason to think it was Alzheimer’s. And it wasn’t. It’s the beginning of a different type of dementia. Two years later, I went back to the doctor with my husband and the doctor could then see enough of what I was seeing to justify sending him to a neurologist. If nothing comes of this now, but you continue to see increasing reasons to worry, check back with the doctor.

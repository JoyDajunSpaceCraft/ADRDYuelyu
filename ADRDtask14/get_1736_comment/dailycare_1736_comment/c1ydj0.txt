Abernathy Laurels in Newton on Hwy 16. I believe that they have a memory care unit.
Did you call the local Area Agency on Aging?  They should have information on that kind of facility.
I used A Place For Mom to help place my father. They do not charge anything for their service and they can connect you with all of the resources.
I haven't lived in Charlotte for nearly 2 years now, but I remember just before I left, they were about to open a brand new Memory Care facility in Northlake.
My mother-in-law and late father-in-law were very happy at the Pines in Davidson.  You should probably take a tour and ask to see the dementia area specifically.

e:  My in-laws remained very socially active at the Pines.  There's a book club and various other mixing opportunities.
Thanks. This is where he ended up. We'd heard of it already, but it was helpful to get some corroboration.

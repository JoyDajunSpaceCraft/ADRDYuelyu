If you're in the US, reach out to your local Agency on Aging - they have a TON of resources.
Where do you live? What type of insurance? If you have the resources, hire a geriatric care manager

For people who are downvoting this, why?  Is this not a good resource?
Iâ€™m curious too lol. My family member in theory qualified for a subsidized caregiver through the local Area Agency on Agency but they pay the caregivers so little that there was a huge shortage.

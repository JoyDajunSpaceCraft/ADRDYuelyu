Dementia care home worker here. We use the brand 'ID form' in their largest size for our severely incontinent residents. I'm not sure what their availability is like elsewhere in the world (I'm in the UK), but the largest size (green) holds an astonishing amount of fluid.

Also if you haven't already spoken to a doctor about her incontinence, I'd recommend doing so. Not only can they potentially prescribe pads that aren't usually in shops, but they can also recommend creams to stop her skin becoming damaged from wetness. Hope this helps!
I know you said you tried everything, but juuuust in case - I only found one diaper that works for my Mom.  Good news - they're the cheap brand!  


Equate Assurance Unisex Overnight Underwear.  It's like they put a twin mattress in them!

I buy them at Walmart and they'll ship.  [Here](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Assurance-Unisex-Overnight-Underwear-L-XL-56-Count/403003054) there are. 

Good luck.
New meds Rx'd to my partner by her gyno: Gemtesa (vibegron). Class: selective beta-3 adrenergic 
agonist. Other classes of incontinence medication can add to brainfog; this one has few side effects. I confirmed this online in "notes for prescribers." One other in the same class, Myrbetriq (mirabegro).  Both brought to market 2020-ish, so no generics, pricey, $400-500 list price.

I'm not a medical doctor. I don't know whether incontinence is too far gone for this to work. For my partner with dementia, not a miracle; still uses Depends. But for past week, haven't woken up swimming in a puddle, and brainfog none the worse. YMMV.
I'm not sure if waking her sooner is an option. In our case, if she is up by 6 she is usually still dry (not leaked through her overnight). I have not progressed to waking her every morning, but if she is up early I take her to the bathroom and change her. Then she typically goes back to sleep sitting in her spot in the living room later.
Does she possibly have diabetes?

Is she on any medications such as diuretics?

Honestly, the patients I work with often have catheters at this point. If that's an option, it can be extremely practical.
Lay down washable waterproof underpads below her hips and chest so that you don't have to strip and wash the fitted sheets at least. They sell these on amazon etc. And then Prevail brand overnight diapers, with two booster pads stuck on the inside.

You may also consider the Purewick, but they are very expensive.
There are a bevy of superior products that you can only get online.  In the US I would recommend calling Northshore Care and talking to their customer support about the free sample program they have, but I'm not sure if that's available in Canada.  I would recommend Betterdry diapers if you can get them.  Northshore makes an entire line of great products, but are somewhat pricier.

Try reasking this question at r/adultbedwetting.  Some of our Canadian folks can probably help you out.
Thank you for the advice. I'll see if it's available here (Canada). I believe our family doctor is already aware of her incontinence but I'll speak to her again.

Thanks again!
Thank you so much for the recommendation. I'll see if this brand is available where I am.

Thanks again!
We used to do this exactly, but now she can barely walk and getting her to the bathroom groggy is a huge challenge.
Yes she does have diabetes and is on medication (don't know if its diuretic though, will have to check). A catheter isn't a bad idea, though I think it's a bit early in my grandmother's case.
I didn't realize there was a subreddit for that. Thanks for the help!
We have the same problem with my mom, and after experimenting with various pads and underwear we just gave up and bought large-sized pee pads - 36" x 54" - and put one of them in the bed *over* the sheets. She still needs to be cleaned up in the mornings, and the pad obviously goes in the laundry asap, but it saves having to do all the sheets. It's been a lifesaver.
Understandable. I hope some of the other suggestions work for you.
Diabetes typically leads to increased urination and thirst, especially if it's not well controlled (it's often hard to control it in the elderly, and especially if dementia is involved). 

If she has some heart issues she might very well be on a diuretic medication as well (to decrease the load on her heart from too much fluid in her body).

Honestly, I would discuss the situation with her doctor - I work with several patients who have barely developed dementia who prefer a bag to having issues with excess urination/incontinence. It might seem a little dramatic, but it's usually well tolerated, so it's something to discuss. Urine against the skin is not good for anyone.

Best of luck. :)

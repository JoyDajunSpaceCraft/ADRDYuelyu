I find Kid N Pets to work well with any biological messes, and borax is great for such things, too.
They are not alone in their bathroom issues. I deal with it every day and it sucks. But I know they can't help it anymore and they need my help. If money is not an issue a cleaner would be a huge help. If they came in once a week they could address the problem. If it's really bad maybe twice a week? Unfortunately I think cleaners get exposed to lots of unpleasant things but you could help prepare them by telling them the reality of the situation.
There are companies who clean up the most disgusting things you can imagine.  That is more expensive than a regular maid service.  But if your elderly client continues to do this from time to time, it would not be a one-time thing.  Maybe long enough to get the landlord off the case, but it would be a continuing issue.

Servpro cleans up after catastrophes such as floods and fires, so you could start by calling them.  Or you could phone a local nursing home to find out a company they might recommend (though they may  have staff on hand who do it).  Realtors sometimes have to arrange major cleaning, you could try contacting one of them and asking.

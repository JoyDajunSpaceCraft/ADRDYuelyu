I did this for my dad.  He kept giving the money in his wallet away (or losing it, who knows?) So I got some fake money to fill his wallet with.  It kept him happy and since he was in memory care where he never needed it we weren't risking getting him into trouble.
One thing with people with dementia is: Play along with them, accept THEIR reality. It's the only one **they** can accept. 

So your plan has a good chance to work out. Give it a try.
I'm so glad my grandma thinks she has no money and is fine with it. Sometimes she worries that she will starve at her assisted living facility because she doesn't have money to pay for food, but then we remind her that it's already paid for and she seems pleasantly surprised and accepts it.
Speaking as person living with dementia symptoms, This is what WE did >> “Money Control with Dementia” by Truthful Kindness at https://truthfulkindness.com/2021/04/18/money-dementia/ ;
My mom has paranoid delusions of theft, among others. She used to withdraw all her pension payments from the ATM and hide the cash. Then she would forget the hiding places and accuse my father or my son of stealing the money. When I got tired of searching for the money, I reminded her that bank deposit is not only the safest place, but also generates interest. We did an extensive search together, found much more than she and I expected, we went to the bank together, though I have the POA. I made sure the bank visit is memorable and chose the VIP branch. They listened to me and agreed to serve us. She still remembers the visit to the bank and the nice young people there who served her coffee and cookies. She has a deposit in this bank, so we justed topped it up, but they brought her a lot of forms to sign so it took time. She chatted to several girls and she put the cash into ATM with a help of one of them.  

She doesn't like to feell that she has no cash though. So I changed larger bills into smaller ones and hid them so that she could find them easier. She lost the track of prices, so she thinks she is still in possession of some good amount of cash. I also hid a sum equal to her monthly pension just in case her memory improves and she understands that what she has in her purse is nothing. In this case I would tell her to look under the carpet.

My friend uses fake money for her mom. Mine still can go shopping with my dad, so fake bills are not an option, yet.
MyFIL does this sometimes and also has pretty bed eye sight… why not just give her a few ones and fives to hang onto? 

My FIL has poor eyesight but he knows about money feel and face of a bill..

Hugs!!
Is it Monopoly money or does it look real?
I'm gonna give it a try. If it doesn't work for some reason, she'll forget about it in a few minutes anyway, but if it works it could be a good way of helping everyone cope.
It's so hard to come to grips with that particular realization. My parents (who deal with her a lot more than I do) still struggle with the fact that logic and reason don't really work anymore.
It's nice on the rare occasions the confusion doesn't end in anxiety. Giving my grandma a Christmas present was like giving her ten presents because she forgot I gave it to her and every time she realized, she got happy and thanked me again.
I can relate to that! One of the reasons the situation is frustrating to my parents is, my grandmother often accuses my brother of stealing money from her (which he would never do). She also hides money (and bags of chips?) all over her room, which my dad has to routinely check to make sure nothing really gets lost.
That might work too, although when she does get her hands on money, she stashes it around her room and forgets she took it out of her wallet. Worth considering if she notices the fake money though.

Hugs back at ya, thanks for the suggestion!
It looks [pretty real](https://smile.amazon.com/RUVINCE-Money-Looks-Dollar-Cinema/dp/B0881WHZHM/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=3315KS6X82ESA&keywords=fake+money&qid=1640670014&sprefix=fake+money%2Caps%2C111&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFIU1dHUDI3SFNQME8mZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0NTY4OTlaUjVNRTlFMlJGOUwmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDM3MTg5MktQWEVRNDdOQzY3TyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=).
I'm in a trainee program to become a caregiver for dementia people. That's not  nursing, but just care giving. Think you have this in America and elsewhere too, even if it's fairly new.

As a start, I did some volunteering in a home for elder people, in a residential grouo for people with dementia.

There was one man for a short time support, sort of holiday (for the relatives).

He was caught in some sort of time loop. 

He constantly was walking up and down the corridor in search of the exit. He needed to go to his car. First, we tried to ask him to check for his keys, which he hadn't. They were with his wife, who wasn't available, so we told him. That only worked for a few days. Then he came up with the idea that he hadn't locked his car and the keys were in his car. 

Nothing worked. His wife didn't have the key. They were in the car. Things like that. He didn't believe that our parking area was monitored, nothing.

So one day I hooked him at the elbow, took his hand, which I knew he would allow and told him: 

"Let's go!"

"To where?"

He was puzzled.

"To your car! We're going to check it and lock it."

He realized that something was wrong. But he came with me, when I led him to the elevator.

"See, I don't know where you have parked your car, And I don't know it. You have to show it to me! Is this OK?"

He nodded, but his body language clearly showed that he knew something was very wrong. We took the elevator, one floor down, to the lobby. We took some steps towards the exit. Then he stopped and looked at the door. 

"We go?"

He shook his head. Then he looked towards the plush chairs sitting in the lobby. We walked over there, and the next few minutes he just sat there, holding my hands and was sad. This was the hardest part. He escaped his time loop, and realized that there was no car. His sadness made me sad, too. 

Moments like that are hard, they are a part of working and living with  persons with dementia. After some time, he looked at the elevators and asked me, without saying a word, if we could go back. I helped him up (He wasn't too good at walking and needed a cane) and we returned to the "living room".

I had broken the time loop, because I had played along and accepted his reality.

This is not easy, but it is the only way. Because it's part of dementia, especially Alzheimer, that people live in their own world, which they **can** not leave. So the solution to communicate with them is to enter their reality. And to accept this reality! Not question the person, why he sees things the way he sees. He will not explain it. He CAN not explain it.

It's hard, as you write, but it's worth it, because if you do accept THEIR reality, you can still have some more time with them. It's easier if those persons are strangers, but can work with relatives.
This has been the worst part of mom's dementia so far. The accusations. Hard for her, because this is her reality. Hard for the accused as it hurts a lot. Hard for me, because they all are my loved ones and I feel so sorry, so hurt, my heart breaks every time and I was on day tranquilizer, on and off. And had several major meltdowns.
That looks great. Thanks for the link.
Nice! Doing this!!
First, thanks for doing what you do. I'm sure it means the world to the people you're helping and to their families.

Second, you make a really interesting point about why your interaction worked. In my grandmother's case, one recent attempt by my dad was to secure her purse in a sort of locked container as a way of proving to her (when she inevitably went into her loop) that no one could have taken her money, but your story makes me realize that this depends on being able to prove her *wrong* instead of validating hey reality. It's almost like we'd have more luck faking a phone call to the police and telling her to wait because they're on their way.

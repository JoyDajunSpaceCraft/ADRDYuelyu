Hey I’m 17 and have been caring for my dad for over 4 years now. Who knows what I will be like in the future but now I feel a lot of the things you mentioned. My anxiety goes through the roof when we have to go out in public as people stare as they can see he isn’t all there. I get really moody when I’m trying to get him to do simple things and I can go from 0-100 in seconds but I don’t let it show. I have less and less motivation each and everyday as I know it’s only getting worse. I can’t really answer your question as I haven’t grown into an adult but I guess I’m half experiencing it

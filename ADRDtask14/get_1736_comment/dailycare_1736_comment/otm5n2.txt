There’s this weird artistic experimental album by an artist called “the caretaker” that kinda shows the progression of dementia through a 6 hour long musical number. It’s broken up into 6 stages but it’s very cathartic to just have on in the background. My dad got diagnosed 3 or 4 years back and I’ve been his caretaker since then, the album really exemplifies the progression and helps me cope. It’s not for everyone as it’s a super weird piece, but I think the artist does a good job of showing the decline of mental faculties and distortion of what the afflicted perceives.
When my dad had Alzheimer’s he would focus on some random thing for weeks, then he’d just move on to some other issue. I’m sure she doesn’t understand what it’s doing to you-and maybe she will fixate on something or someone else. Good luck and stay strong.
Thanks for the suggestion!

Here's the one I've been looking at -- founded and run by a Brit and his Thai wife. There's another one run someone else that's Swiss/German (we don't speak German so that one's out). They have graduated care, a 1:1 caregiver:patient ratio, and believe in involving patients with "home skills" like setting napkins at a table to keep "family normalcy" as much as possible. 

Downsides: it's a 20 hour flight (at least from Seattle, where we are). My partner is...somewhat distant...from life and craves hot/humid so for him it's a potential good fit. We're going over in the next few months to check it out. He's excited about the possibility. 

PS: Care costs are half of comparable care in the US. 
I have not heard of this. Elaborate! Can we send our demented loved ones to Thailand?! Honestly if someone is going to Thailand id like it to be me!

I highly recommend the Alzheimer's Association www.alz.org for your Mom and family members. There is a wealth of information there, support groups for Mom, caregiver support groups for family members, educational info, testing opportunities, and a 24 hour hotline. Best of luck to you.
If you're looking for Alzheimer's Association support groups, the best way to go about it is to call the 24/7 Helpline at 800-272-3900. Live clinicians answer the calls (they are also great to talk to about any and all concerns of dementia, like behaviors or any other resource help!). You tell them where you're located and they get you in contact with your local chapter. All of their support groups across the country are virtual right now through Zoom. Tell the clinician you're looking for Early Stage programming or early stage support groups/social engagement in your local chapter! You can also explain any other issues that you're concerned about with your mom even without the proper diagnosis.

You can also find it by going to [alz.org](https://alz.org) \> Your Chapter/Find your Local Chapter > and put in where you are by zip code. Once you do that, navigate to the "Your Chapter" tab on the home page > Helping You > Support Groups. I always say though that the 24/7 Helpline is best because some local chapters may not update their pages consistently, so that is the straightest way to get in touch with a staff person.
Thank you so much!
Thank you for the advice! I came across this website but only saw caregiver support groups in my state, so I should probably call the helpline.

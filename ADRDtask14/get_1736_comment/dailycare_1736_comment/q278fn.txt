Get legal documents in order ASAP!
There needs to be more concrete evidence.

For example: 
-Why is he an “irrational asshole”?

In my case, I have noticed my closest relatives get very angry when corrected and it’s clearly there is something wrong:

- forgetting to take their medicine, eat, pay bills
- misplacing their glasses, wallet, phone, keys, etc. in weird places
- forgetting to turn off the stove, close the door
- lack of confidence driving, ordering from a menu (when they use to do it all the time)
- being more gullible to spam calls and solicitors 

Take a mental and written notes on their behavior, routines, and habits.  Date when it occurred and how often it happened.

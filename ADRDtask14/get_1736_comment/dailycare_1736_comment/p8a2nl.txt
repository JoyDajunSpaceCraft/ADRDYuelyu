Unfortunately, I don’t think there’s anything promising on the horizon that would be a true game changer.

Acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and glutamate modulators are fine treatments that do help slow disease, but aren’t next level therapies.

Aduhelm is a really new monoclonal antibody treatment, and the neurologist I’ve spoken with don’t sound enthused by it. Time will tell, but benefit over a placebo was hardly noticeable.

Cerebrolysin is another treatment I’ve been reading about that’s also used for stroke patients. Again, minimal to moderate effects at best and nothing game changing.

Sadly, this is where we’re at. As a physician whose mom is suffering from dementia, I can tell you honestly there’s no drug out there that brings me significant hope at the moment.
There is nothing promising on the horizon.  The new drug, Aduhelm, is nothing to be excited about. It doesn't work and carries very serious risks. If there was an effective treatment for dementia or a near-cure, people would be yelling it from the rooftops and you wouldn't have to search for it.

Very specific mutation and not something I would get excited about for dementia as a whole.

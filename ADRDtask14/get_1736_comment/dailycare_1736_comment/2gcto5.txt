You need therapy for anger management. 

Holy fuck your poor grandmother. I understand dealing with very ill people is beyond difficult, but that's so extreme. 

Also, even though your post says remorse, you don't sound all too remorseful. 
Don't breed. 
are you actually remorseful at all? it does not look like it. you hurt another human being that had NO idea why it was happening. consistently.  YOU PUSHED HER DOWN THE STAIRS. during her final years on this earth. you probably made her afraid of whoever takes care of her currently. YOU, and you alone. i dont care if you didn't put [tough love] in the beginning. if you actually said anything to show you were remorseful i wouldn't have typed any of this.
Asshat. 
Damn. Three of my aunts have had Alzheimers and if anyone did any of those things to them, I would end them, no questions asked. 

They're helpless in that state, AND elderly- what would have you done if she had broken something? How would you have explained it? And if she already had bruises on her, from you abusing her before, how would you explain that?  It's a horrible situation.

Please get help for your anger. It's imperative, so it won't happen again.
Speechless. 
Please, please, please get help. You need to figure better ways to deal with your feelings of frustation and anger. 
I don't know how you live with that. I hope that now you know what a big problem you have you won't ever have pets or children. people like you are dangerous because you do awful things to people who can't defend themselves. seriously, how could you do that?
You might not want to tell him to "holy fuck your poor grandmother."
Or ever have a relationship

Ew

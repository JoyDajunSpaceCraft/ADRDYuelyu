You're a good kid. 

If she lives on her own, she has mild to moderate, not mid to late stage -- mid stagers can't get through a day on their own, late stage patients don't remember how to talk, much less care for themselves.

You would probably benefit from reaching out to her county's Aid to Aging website, and the city's, and the state's.  Also contact the hospital's aging nurses/social workers, she's going to need all the help she can get.  I hope lots of other people chime in with suggestions.
Hello. My Mom passed in May after 83 days in hospice due to advanced Parkinson’s Plus Syndrome where the “plus” is dementia.  One thing that my significant other recognized early on that really helped our relationship was the fact that my Mom only had a short time left and he fully supported my becoming her primary care giver.  She was 81 when she passed. I don’t know how much time your Mom has left and I really hope for the best for all of you.  Hospice services can begin when someone has an estimated six months left.  Doesn’t sound like your ready for that stage just yet but when it comes I recommend shopping around for different companies.  I really like the one we chose and bless their caring team!  Sounds like you got some other really good suggestions here too - just tacking this on for one day down the road.
I just googled “ help for elderly in California “. There’s actually a “California department of aging”, “California Office on Agjng” and several other resources you could check out. 

Good luck!
Was your mom in the military or your dad? She may be eligible for money for aid & attendance.  Not sure about the rules in ca. Call your local senior helpers office to ask them what is available in your state
Contact your local Alzheimer’s Association. They are incredibly helpful.
Elderly Services thru County Community Services where I live.  They've been great.
Also, retired teachers get coverage.  

Ive been going through this too.   As far as I know MediCal could kick in when she needs full time Memory Care, as long as you can prove she has not other sources of income?   Until then, you may need to figure something out and the options arent great if youre low income Im afraid to say.     But Im not an expert.
Get on the internet and search work independently.   for aging services in your community, county, state.  Look at the websites for government offices.  Look for social workers: some work free lance.  

The court system may help. There are attorneys who specialize in senior issues.  There are advocates who look after the financial affairs of people who are disabled or may n some way not able to do it themselves. They receive payment for this and be careful but start gathering information.

Look into small group housing for seniors.
Thank you all for the advice. I found some local aging agencies I will contact, as well as the Alzheimer's organization. I tend to have a preconceived notion that it will just be uncaring bureaucracies but I have faith there are people out there who care and will help.
Thanks, that link is helpful. Part of the stress is the uncertainty. She couldn't live on her own without the in-home support. She can't cook for herself or safely bathe herself, absolutely couldn't handle any financial issues or anything date or time related. She hallucinates people living in her apartment with her and is paranoid that voices out in the hall are plotting against her.
Thank you. Yes, not ready for hospice yet. In some ways that would be a relief because at least there would be a defined path. I will remember your advice to shop around when the time comes.

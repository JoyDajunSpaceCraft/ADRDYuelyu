Antipsychotics may help her, talk with a Geriatrician.
As much as you can, try not to argue with her. You will never be able to convince her that you are right and she is wrong about something, so your best skill here is to agree as much as you can, and re-direct the conversation/her attention elsewhere. I know it feels wrong, but it’s called “therapeutic lying” because it’s good for everyone.
seroquel and Lorazapm 

It’s not the magic cure, there’s really no coping with it, my great grandma is 91 late stages too, still a wanderer at night and likes to jump over her bed rails 
It works but to an extent 
And unless your family is able to stop arguing you won’t find peace, because to a certain degree there isn’t any way to reason at late stage dementia and just causes more toxicity because we get frustrated at there behavior
Not gonna lie, it’s hard. Therapeutic lying and redirecting help, but sometimes they get fixated on the delusion or hallucination, so then it’s more difficult. I have moved a gorilla out of her bedroom and chased two small girls out my kitchen today. Hopefully the antipsychotic medication will kick in soon. I think the hardest part is dealing with family that just doesn’t/can’t understand and think your exaggerating. Or they do see it and make excuses. It’s exhausting on all kinds of levels. So many people just don’t understand.
We do a lot of that, we’ll try as much as possible. Like asking if she’s home we say yes, she’d be in a panic if she knew her old house we sold.

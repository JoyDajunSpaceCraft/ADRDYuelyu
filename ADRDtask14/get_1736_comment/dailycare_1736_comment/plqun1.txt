i feel similar as you do and my mom is like your dad; pleasant 99% of the time, can still bath/change clothes fine and easy to keep happy.  but like you i also wake up each morning a bit tired and defeated at times. i think about how life appears to be passing me by in my 40s and how my career path has been put on hold (worked in IT, progressing very well in my career) and my finances/savings/retirement accounts keep getting smaller....

but then i remember.. i knew this wasn't going to be easy and that this would be the sacrifice i would be making.  also i realize how much my mom had done for me throughout life (i'm adopted) and the love / support she has given me my whole life.  

its still hard but these little tidbits help me get out of my funk but each of us is different.

just remember this; you are an amazing person and this is a job that most can't do or would choose to do. society fails to see the sacrifices us care givers make but us here we do and hopefully can help support each other.

again, you are beautiful in what you are doing and your dad if he could say it would say he loves you and appreciates everything you do.
Don't feel bad for feeling the way you do. My fiance's brother is going to be living with us very soon and, though he's capable of most ADL's, it's still quite a burden to put on anyone. Honestly, just having someone else in your home and having to consider someone else when you want to do *anything* is hard on anyone. Feel free to vent anytime you need to.
You aren't alone.

Every evening I watch the clock until it's officially time for totally dependent relative to go to sleep for the night.....by then I'm so tired and constantly stressed either I sleep right away or stay wide awake all night. 

Then in the morning my tension builds as I watch the clock waiting for my name to be called. Just dreading it.

My life is over...as you said he could live on like this forever. 

People that haven't hit this in life have no idea whats waiting for them..... no idea.
I’m right there with you except my dad is difficult to deal with 99% of the time. No matter what we do or buy it’s not right. I gave up a career too to care for my dad. But I would not have changed anything. It took me a long time to come this point. Don’t feel guilty for having those feelings sometimes. It’s normal.
Get some respite care in.  As much as you can arrange/afford.
Just keep moving. ❤ from one tired caretaker to another.
I totally feel you ! I feel my life is gone as well!

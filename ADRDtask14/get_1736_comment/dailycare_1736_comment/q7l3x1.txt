Depends.  When I worked in an SNF, we often told "the kids" "Oh, this isn't for him/her.  This is for you.".  That seemed to make the guilt easier to live with.  It was probably the first good night's sleep they had in ages.

We also requested that "the kids" not visit for the first 2 weeks.  This gave mom or dad time to acclimatize to their new surroundings.  Very often, they thrived being once again with other people.
Is there any way you could arrange for her to have an aide* with her a few hours a day for the first week or so? Someone that can make sure she is learning her way around the new facility, making sure she is seated next to lively looking folks, going with her to any games or social times and introducing her around until she is known by others and feels comfortable. Also to record/make sure she’s hydrating enough, preferably earlier in the day so she doesn’t have to pee so much at night alone. For nights, ask the nurses, waking in a strange place in the dark will be hard, at least make sure there’s a prominent note to leave her bathroom light on all night. *or you hire a babysitter so you can do this 

May I ask how you got the LBD diagnosis? I thought that wasn’t something that was definitively diagnosed until brain examined after death?

ETA: I think your grandma will get the best care when staff knows you are keeping a good eye on her. If an aide, someone with a good personality that won’t let your grandma stay in her room. If you, random short visits various times of day and check her for bruises, meds taken, bathing schedule and listen to your grandma. I pray her new home is happy! And of course make sure you have health care proxy and POA before she goes in.

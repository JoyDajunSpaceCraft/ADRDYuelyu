That’s called theft you should be ashamed
Trolliollio
God i hope you are trolling us. This is sooooo disrespectful and awful if true.
But you are stealing. Wtf man, how can you have such a corrupted logic?
Best thing I’ve learned is do what you have to do to do what you love. Not love what you do. Get a job no matter what it is. If you are young that where you start out. Having income is better than no income. 
Spend your time with your mom. You’ll regret it the day she forgets who you are. Even after you remind her and she knows who your are it will still hurt.
Get a job you fuckin bum

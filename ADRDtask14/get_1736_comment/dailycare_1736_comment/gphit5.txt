My grandma went through much of the same. It was compounded by the fact that she lost her eyesight in the same timeframe. 

She constantly had the urge to pace but because of her lack of sight and her LBD hallucinations this meant that someone almost always had to walk with her to ensure her safety.

We did what we could by clearing as many hazards as possible from her walkways, but ultimately it was like bailing out a sinking boat.

My deepest sympathies and condolences go out to you and your family. You are not alone in your experience and there is healing after the grief.

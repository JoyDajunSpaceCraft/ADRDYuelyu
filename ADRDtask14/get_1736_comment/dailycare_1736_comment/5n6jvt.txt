If he wears a belt look the bracelet around the back so it's connected to the belt but not visible to him. 
Sew it in a pocket, if the resident's clothes allow for it ? 
If they wear pants with a belt, it can be adhered there too. Or if he has glasses, add a necklace/drawstring/lanyard to it and attach the wander guard to it.
There is only one device per resident. They are probably about $200 a piece, so it wouldn't be practical to sew it into one piece of clothing when they have so many changes of clothes.

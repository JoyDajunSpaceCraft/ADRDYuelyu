Sorry to hear about your loved ones.

Loss of internal filter is 100% a symptom of Alzheimers.  

It looks like there are some assessment quizes online you could administer yourself if you're able to convince your grandmother to take them:

Otherwise, you could call her primary doctor and request/advise that a dementia/cognetive assesment be done at her next appointment (or schedule one for her at that time).
I would recommend calling the Alzheimer's Association helpline. They are great help and really kind. They have given me great info and will have ideas on how to talk to your family. I am sorry about your grandparents health. Those definitely sound like symptoms of dementia. Being in mid80s is not "early onset" that term refers to when people develop Alzhemiers/Dementia the ages of 40, 50 to 65 years old. Specifically diagnosed before the age of 65. Wishing you the best.

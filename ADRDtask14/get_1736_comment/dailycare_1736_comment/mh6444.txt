The caregivers need to take action. I know it’s a difficult conversation but like you said, there are children around. They take the priority over your neighbors indignity. Not wanting to wear clothing is very common for later stage dementia patients. He isn’t being perverse or doing it on purpose, I can almost guarantee that. They get too confused and troubled trying to get dressed. You sound like a caring neighbor and I’d be more than willing to bet the caregivers are aware of this issue already. It is worth letting them know, regardless. They will understand and likely increase the level of care or find additional help to keep your neighbor dressed and comfortable.

Like the old adage, it takes a village.

Best of luck, thank you for caring for your neighbors. I wish I had neighbors that supported my SO and myself about my family members’ behavior regarding dementia manifestations. 

You are sparing this older man of a lot of indignity by notifying the proper caregivers of his situation. He might just be having trouble getting dressed or it might be a memory issue. Either way, he is not doing it intentionally.

✌️❤️
The carers may have less education about this, it’s different everywhere. Maybe ask their company name and call and speak to a case manager. He may need further evaluation
sometimes its better not to say anything :)
Thank you so much for responding! I have no doubt that he's not doing it intentionally, dementia makes me so sad and frustrated for them. I will bring it up to his carers again when I catch them, though I imagine there won't be a lot they can do about it. I feel like it's only a matter of time before he might end up going to live in an elderly care home, I know he's had multiple falls and there was an incident where he left his gas on 😖 he doesn't have any family around, sad!
My loved one is unfortunately at about the same stage as your neighbor, maybe a little worse.. I am a live in caregiver, my father, and I tried my best to keep my him out of assisted living as long as possible, but unfortunately he’s suffered many falls and struggles with daily tasks to such a degree he requires around the clock care and has serious mental health issues from losing his independence. His memory is stuck in 1999 and he can’t dress himself. He will struggle for hours to get dressed and is too ashamed to ask, and sometimes if they are not helped they just give up and go with what clothes they can get on.


Him leaving the gas on is so dangerous, that would scare me enough to make the move into assisted living. 
You are a very caring neighbor trying to help and understand the situation. What I would give to have someone like you next door not being hard on me and shunning me and well as him, for having to live the caregiver life and them hearing my dad sundowning

. . It’s easy to shun dementia patients and pretend they aren’t struggling when you aren’t directly involved. What’s difficult is *to* look, try and understand, to care. You are the best fricking neighbor ever.

Edit: you’re gonna make a great nurse. You chose the right profession. I can tell you are a compassionate and attentive person. You fit the role of Nurse like (pardon the pun) a glove.🙂
I'm so sorry, you're a wonderful person for taking care of him! It's an important but difficult thing you do and I know it's not something that everyone can take on. It's a cruel disease and it really does affect the whole family. 

Sadly many people don't understand dementia, and they are shunned from society. When I was little I thought my great grandmother was mad, I didn't understand at the time but she had Alzheimer's. 

Thank you that's really kind of you to say! What I do is honestly a gift to me because it makes me look at people and to try and really understand them. My job gives me a lot of insight that most people don't get, it's humbling but also terrifying and heartbreaking to see what people go through, my patients and their loved ones.

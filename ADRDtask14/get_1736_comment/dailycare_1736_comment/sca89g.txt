Dying this way is not at all specific to those with dementia. My grandmother, who didn't have dementia, fell over dead walking out of a room with my mother with no immediate indication anything was amiss. Could be a half dozen different things - stroke, heart attack, ruptured aneurism, etc. People just die suddenly sometimes and their cognitive state may not figure into it at all.
Sorry for your loss , this must have been really tough for your friend to deal with by herself.

It appears to have been a heart attack that your friend suffered.
It sounds like a ruptured aneurysm. I'm sorry to hear about your loss.
Most dementia patients starve to death. Sounds like it was an aneurysm or cardiac event.

I use an Alexa so I can talk to her directly in her room. It has helped a lot. You can get one with a camera that lets you see each other if you wish. It’s been very helpful.
I don’t have any ideas for amplifying the ringer, but consider getting a device that would allow you to peek in and speak to her via a speaker, such as a ring camera. I’m sure there are other options, but I’m most familiar with Ring.
Does she have a smart TV or cable? What worked for my parents was to have their home phone ring to their television as well, we set that up through Comcast who is their phone and cable provider. We had their cell phones forward to the home phone when they didn't answer in time, and then it showed up as caller ID on their TV. 

Another option would be to get her a smart watch which would also alert her when the cell rings. 

If it is a smart TV, you could pair it with her cell. 

There is another option I can think of. It is an RF-200 cell/phone ringer/flasher which is a signaling device for both landlines and mobile phones. Google "cool ring alerted for your cell phone " for more information.  Similar is "CentralAlert cell phone ringer - flasher".
Another thing you could search are phone ringing alerts for hearing impaired. I’ve worked with people who have lights the blink when they’re getting a phone call
Just got this for my dad. You can connect cellphone and the ringer is LOUD! VTech DS6621-2 DECT 6.0 Expandable Cordless Phone with Bluetooth Connect... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KJJCL9K/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_api_glt_fabc_FM7VMRK5YKNGDN5KTDZ6
Yes, we are thinking about an echo8
Also, Google download "loud ringtones for hard of hearing" and also "Bluetooth cell phone flashing ring signaler."
Thank you! She does have a smart tv. She has an Apple Watch, but sometimes forgets to wear it.
Oh lord, that would be even less effective! Lol.
Haha fair enough!

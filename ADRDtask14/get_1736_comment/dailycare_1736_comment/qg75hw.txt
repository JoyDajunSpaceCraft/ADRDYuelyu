I'm going to guess it'll be simpler to wait until there's an actual baby, and give her a picture then.

A very simple card might be all right. I don't know a way that will make it personal enough for her without upsetting her, though. Since she does not always remember who you are, I'd be cautious with something like "You Are Going to Be A Great-Grandma!" My mom sometimes remembers who I am and sometimes not, and when I used to try and remind her, telling her that I was her daughter was sometimes distressing for her, because she couldn't remember me and/or because it implied so much about her life that she didn't know. Maybe you could just send another version of the wedding photo along with the words "We're expecting a baby!"
I saw a video of a woman and her mother (or maybe grandmother?) with dementia. The video was a series of clips of the older woman seeing the pregnant belly and discovering anew that her daughter was pregnant. She was ecstatic each and every time. It was the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen.

I don’t see any harm in showing her your ultrasound each time you visit and letting her be excited anew each time. If you see it disturbs her in any way, you don’t want to continue to do that, of course. Once you are showing, she can marvel at your belly. A keepsake may be too much because she may wonder who it was from and what it means. Let your visits be her reminder, that way you can be there to see the joy each time.

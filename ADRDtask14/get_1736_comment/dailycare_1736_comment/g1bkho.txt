I think you need training for this. Maybe ask in the nursing subreddit or similar medical, because you want to make sure you are confident and are doing it in a safe way that protects you and them. Good luck, thank you for doing what you do.
Have you ever been to the hospital, or cared for professionally? Just do that. Maintain a polite and professional decorum, and try to be empathetic. It can be very hard for someone to accept that they are no longer capable of basic tasks, like restroom stuff, so try to remember that you are there to help them and not to be judgy. It can be difficult on everyone involved but it’s important to be kind. It’s tough work.
These are more specific subReddits.

I would hesitate to take this job without training. Check the technical schools in your area and I'm sure you will find one. You are looking for HHA (home health aid) or CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant). The training doesn't take long and will be a big benefit to you and the person you are caring for. You will learn proper lifting and assisting techniques and will be made aware of all of the unforeseen circumstances that will arise. My husband and I cared for 3 of our parents and it is a big job. Do yourself and employer a favor and be properly prepared. Also, make sure that there is insurance in place in case you get injured while working and that they are paying employment taxes for you. If they don't you have to do that yourself. Best of luck to you!
I second some kind of training. There were people whose weight I needed to help them support during transfers to and from as well as wiping. This was problematic without training.
That is a great idea. You may also call big nursing homes-- sometimes they offer training with the hope of hiring later. Also community colleges have programs often.

Couple of things to consider:

As the person with a working brain and good judgment, you are now in the same position a parent is in with a child: it's your job to protect someone in your care who can't defend themselves and can't manage their emotions in a proportional or productive way.

You also have no way to control your Aunt's behavior.

Past behavior is a predictor of future performance in people.  A variation of this is: When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.

My expectations here are that your Aunt will do the same thing she always does.  When she does the Thing, it will be a pain in the ass for you, true, but it will probably be extremely hurtful for your Grandma.

Telling your Aunt "no" seems like the hard thing right now, but that's the situation SHE created.  She'll probably throw a tantrum, perhaps she'll tell everyone she knows how "awful" you are (and leave out all of her own horrible behavior), and she may hold a grudge against you for the rest of her life.  But you are your Grandma's guardian.  Not your Aunt's.  I think your duty to protect your Grandma is the important thing to remember.  And your Grandma won't be able to cope with your Aunt's bullshit.

A crappy compromise for this crappy situation (the situation your Aunt created, not you) would be to wait until your Grandmother's short-term memory is worse and she won't be able to remember the visit afterward - then let your Aunt see her.

That's my opinion and I could see how other people might choose differently.
wow...that's rough. Is your Aunt at all reasonable....like can you sit down with her and get her to understand that your grandma can't handle her coming and going and if she isn't going to stick around then it would be best to not visit her at all? the other issue is can you actually prevent her from visiting?

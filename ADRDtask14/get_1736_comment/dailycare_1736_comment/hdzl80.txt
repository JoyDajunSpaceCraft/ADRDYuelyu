Sure! We have dementia upswings in our household too. I follow several people living with dementia on Twitter and came across a really good explanation from one of them as to how dementia feels in their brain concerning the loss of an ability and then suddenly it's back for a time.

In our dementia household the upswings are emotional, not so much skills coming back, but happiness and less anxiety and anguish for a period. I hope you take plenty of time to enjoy  this upswing  your dad!
Absolutely going to enjoy the good days!  Thanks!

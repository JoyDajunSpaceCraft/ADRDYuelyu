Perhaps she would listen to someone else with influence in her life, such as a close friend, pastor or other relative. Sometimes though it can come down to the sister with the POAs  may have to make the decision for your sister when her safety or health becomes imperiled. Preferably you will be involved as well in this decision. It may be rough going for a while but better to be proactive than reactive. I wish you the best.
Could you try “We can do this in a planned manner now and you will have control over where you go. Or you can wait until there is a crisis and the hospital discharges you into the first available spot no matter how you feel about it”
As things are, it may well come down to a crisis situation. Hopefully not. Appreciate your thoughts. 
That has merit. And so true. Thanks!
You're very welcome. I might add below is a link to a website authored by a geriatric doctor who specializes in dementia and related disorders. She is very thorough on many topics and most importantly will reply to any specific questions you may have. She is most helpful and truly a lifeline.

Will be looking into that website. This disease is so very tricky when it comes to helping to maintain the honor and dignity of those afflicted. Thanks so much!

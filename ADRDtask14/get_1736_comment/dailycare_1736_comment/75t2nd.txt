Call your local area agency on living. They should be able to get you a list. 
As suggested above, you'll want to try contacting your local area agency on aging, they should be able to help with locating facilities. To find one that serves your area, visit http://www.n4a.org. Through this sure, you can search by zip code to find your local office and their contact information. They can help with applying for Medicaid as well as state Medicaid waivers (waivers extend the coverage of Medicaid; Medicaid typically doesn't pay for care in facilities, but the waivers can).

A few things you'll want to know about Medicaid as you get started: there can be a waiting list at facilities for using Medicaid waiver funds to help pay for care; these funds may not cover all costs of care and facility residents or their families will be responsible for the difference; and there may also be waiting lists for assistance through Medicaid and the waivers.

I wish you and your family the best of luck through this process!
Don't know anything about the area, but when I was looking in my area for AL that took Medicaid I was told there weren't any.  Had to be at a skilled nursing level to  get Medicaid.  Completely ridiculous system,  hope you find a good fit.

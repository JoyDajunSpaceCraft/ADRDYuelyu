My mom was much the same. We ended up using trickery, hired someone she knew but not well. The lady came over for a "visit", visited, did a few things for her, then left. Mom didn't make a connection that she was coming every day and no one would spend that much time if it wasn't a job. 

Sometimes you can frame it as there doing the hired person a favor by letting them come. That's what we did with the aide before the last one. "Oh, she needs the work experience and to earn some money".
My dad objected to one of his carers because she was so young.  We told him she was a student and he was a "practice patient".  He loved giving her feedback and giving her a grade after every session.  Luckily, she thought this was a great idea and played along, even telling him that he was such a great teacher that she was getting an "A".
You can take my advice it’s on you. A pill I used to help my family with dementia. It worked. I got chemist to combine psilocybin ,CBD , coconut oil, THC.  The CBD I assumed help with swelling and psilocybin helped firing those dead nerves. It has worked on person n second person is recovering. I don’t want to make money just give help because I went thru with a lot of trouble with grandma with dementia
I don't know your dad, but I wouldn't assume narcissism in a case like this. It sounds to me like basic frustration at losing control of your life. Like a typical man who has been capable of doing things for himself and making his own decisions all his life, and now others are taking over and he doesn't understand why so it seems like a hostile intrusion. I think the smarter & more capable and "in charge" one has been, the harder it would be to go through this. I can even see wanting to be dead rather than being treated like a feeble old man. It's just super hard for everyone. Lots and lots of compassion and love and patience are needed. Humor, deflection, distraction, use any tactic you can think of to keep him calm. Best of luck to you and your mum.
Think about what is required in "getting ready for the day".

Speaking as a Person Living with Dementia symptoms.  Most all of us HATE (absolute abhor and would choose suicide if it is an option) over the idea of someone bathing us or supplying our intimate needs .  Of course he is upset.  Wouldn't YOU feel violated in that intimate setting???  My husband will be right over there tomorrow morning to give YOU a shower and touch YOUR body.  ... Your father is angry and he has a right to feel angry, but ... these things NEED done (which he no longer understands the need).  ... and yes he is angry that he no longer is able to do the activities that he wants to be able to do !  That is very normal ... and healthy even.

This sounds like a very normal part of loss and grief, a process that each of you will be going thru, because your father is in the process of terminal brain failure.  He is losing every activity, and every person that is of value to him ... for ever.  His wife and YOU yourself are losing the relationship you have always had with your father, and temporarily will have your world turned upside-down for a certain amount of time.

... \*\*\*  ...

pulled this from blog entry i hope to have finished mid-month.

If I was the person with extra folks repeatedly in my house, I would like you to:

* **Research** if there is something specific that is bothering me ??– is care-provider playing music, or wanting the TV on, when it is not my normal procedure ?? ((After all, it is MY home too)).  Are they touching me, or moving things around from where i was previously able to find the items ?  ?For me, i am a strong introvert; i get energy when i am ALONE, and time with others COSTS energy.  The more intimate the contact, then the more it drains my energy.  Please consider those needs to be alone, or you will find i have no energy tank for dealing with the frustrations of growing disAbilities and frustrations of communication symptoms.  This will probably be reflected in failing relationship with YOU.  Am I  (is your father) worried about other privacy issues – or cost ??
* **Do not lie to me**, but it is okay to SUGGEST then DISTRACT . I very much want to supply needs for others, so I might suggest that you tell me Emily would like to learn more about dementia, so will be spending some time here this WEEK (without mentioning any further time than that, unless it is a relief instead of stressor) to help me with meals.  Let me be a PARTNER in my care, as much as possible, and it would be great if “Emily” really IS interested in learning about dementia !  —There are times that i have forgotten i have dementia symptoms, in which case she can be interested in learning something else that i have knowledge of.
* **Then immediately distract me** with other (positive) in-the-moment type things, instead of letting me focus on future worry.
I don’t think that will work with my dad as we don’t know anyone that would be able or willing to care for him in the mornings that he knows. All the people
He knows are older then him and most have their own medical issues and aren’t suitable to be looking after someone with dementia. Plus my dad can not remember conversations so you will still have to keep telling him why everyday when he gets angry about it as he will forget and he likes to argue and the conversation just goes around in circles.
Is the dead nerves thing why my dad complains of his skin burning ? And his feet swelling
Unfortunately he retired much earlier  then the average person due to other health problems. He hasn’t worked for a decade at least. My mum has been the one working for  the past 20 years I think.My dad has always had quite a controlling personality due to the fact he used to be a boss so it’s hard for him as he has no control over anyone anymore and he doesn’t like being told to get in the bath etc cuz he feels like he is being bossed around and he don’t understand why he needs to have personal hygiene.  I try to show him empathy and compassion it’s just he shouts and gets angry and nasty and says nasty things about people and really puts me or my mother down.  I understand what your saying however, he takes out all his problems on everyone else so most people don’t want to be near him
Did he get angry and shout a lot before, or is this new with the dementia?
No it’s not new he has been angry and shouty  for years now but he has had alzheimer's for years now to. when he has been very bad he has smashed things but he doesn’t do that when my mums around as he behaves a lot more when my mums at home. He has calming pills one that works very quickly and one that works slowly but I think he needed them before cuz when I was younger and left with him I remember him getting very angry and throwing a phone across the room over something very minor and one time when I was left alone with him and my sister he started kicking my door and swearing at me and get very angry, I was just trying to do my homework lol. I don’t even remember why now but i know I hadn’t done anything.  My dad has been this way for all of my teenage years but I can’t remember much before that other then him being nasty to me like making fun of me or just picking on me. Tbh my mum was just as bad as she would always be on his side when he was making fun of me and even to this day when I try to talk to her about it she will make Some excuse for him like I did something wrong not him lol. I think she was in denial for so long and I think she still is sometimes. I have tried to ask her if she thinks he has some kind of mental health issue but she just says it’s his illness.
I'm so sorry. It sounds like he's always been difficult, to say the least. It's hard to be loving and compassionate in a case like that. Hopefully you and your mom can hang in there. Can he be put on any medication to calm him, or is he already?
He is all ready on calming pills, two different types but he is having a lot more recently and thank you
It’s just I really think he needs to be in a care home at this point as my mother works full time and doesn’t have the time to look after him and even if she did she couldn’t care for him as she struggles.  How can you get your mum to accept that he needs a care home or at least a  full time carer ?

If denying her fears doesn't work, maybe tell her that yes, you understand, yes this sounds horrible, so you're going to look into it /do something about it, take her home etc. For my grandma, reasoning or trying to convince her of something doesn't work anymore, so I just tell her I completely understand her fears and will do something about it.
Thank you, it's really hard to know whats best and not to let my own life emotions get in the way too much. Thank you :)))
There's no perfect solution for everything, so don't let that pull you down :) it's really a lot trial and error, I wish you the best on your journey!

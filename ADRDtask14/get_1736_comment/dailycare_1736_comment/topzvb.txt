I feel she should have told you if a particular item was important to her and she had the opportunity to do so. I’m sorry she’s giving you a hard time.
This is true, this a new symptom from her. Before that it was repeating stories literally right after she said the story.
I agree , and even better should’ve stayed with me and put those particular items aside . She has the mentality of I don’t want anything , donate everything or sell. Pretty sad
My grandmother repeated things a lot when she was having strokes, and she does so now with her dementia, so it sounds like something may be up with her brain.
Apathy after the loss of a loved one was a sign in my mom. I didn’t realize it at the time but it’s crystal clear now.
My aunt was stone cold at the funeral , she was the only sibling that didn’t want to talk, I get that people grieve differently but she was opposite and had zero kindness .. pretty wild

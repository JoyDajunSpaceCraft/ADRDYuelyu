A pulmonologist would be more familiar with the symptoms  you are describing. Its amazing how many specialists you can rack up just trying to sort out a simple symptom in dementia. And when you're through with that they get a rash. Disordered breathing may cause c02 levels to increase, but if he was OK at the ER who knows. I hope you can find out soon, breathing abnormalities can be frightening for the caregivers, if not the patient.
My FIL had a similar symptom.  His O2 levels would bottom out for no particular reason.
Thank you for the feedback. I will make the suggestion to my mother to see a pulmonologist.
We took Dad to a pulmonologist today.  Absolutely nothing wrong from that perspective.  She said that it the symptoms are likely due to the effects of the dementia on that part of the brain. She said that it is not uncommon in patients with Vascular Dementia and that it does not always worsen.

I am causiously optomistic on that oulook though.  We have already seen it worsen.... more to watch and worry about.....
Mom did the same thing, its like she would "forget" to breathe and then pant to catch up.
Its really hard to stop worrying and accept that some distressing (to the observer) symptoms are part of the process but it can help to know that your Dad is not suffering during these attacks.

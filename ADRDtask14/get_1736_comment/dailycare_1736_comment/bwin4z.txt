I would look into Diabetes. This is what my dad was like before he got his diagnosis. (Dad doesn't have dementia, he is just a diabetic) 

If he isn't diabetic. >.> I'm not sure

Edit-grammar
Many thx
I get the bathroom issues and certainly see if there is an underlying medical issue but barring that drinking water is a godsend. 

Drinking liquids will soon diminish which will then present dehydration and UTI problems. I continually struggle to get fluids in my mom.
It may also be becoming unmoored to time and insomnia.  

I personally seem to drink more water than a lot of other people during the day (my lungs dry out kinda easily which is no bueno).  I drink substantially less at night, but I still drink.  But I could imagine that if I lost orientation to time I might treat night like day.  With you dad's  wandering I wonder if he just forgets it is time to sleep.

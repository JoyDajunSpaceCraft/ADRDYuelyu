Don't know about remote/access programming, but they make these [types of remotes](https://www.amazon.ca/Flipper-Big-Button-Remote-Seniors/dp/B002GR1YZ0/ref=asc_df_B002GR1YZ0/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=292996106289&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6399161702626108746&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9000636&hvtargid=pla-320338877473&psc=1). Can maybe hire his cable co to come in and set it up for him. 

For my mom, I just went low-tech and just taped everything except the volume, power, and channel buttons otherwise she kept on disabling the tv.
You could ask the care aides to turn the TV on and to a certain channel in the mornings.
I work in care homes and a lot of families ask us to do this.
You want to find a TV that has "Alexa" built in to it which means just about everything can be voiced controlled.

I do that with Chromecast with Google tv. The one with the remote. 

With Google home app I can control the tv, lights, vacuum, cameras, thermostat, speakers, fans etc. From anywhere. 

Pretty awesome!

I also set up routines/schedules that detect presence either with motion sensing (thermostat) or device sensing.

I also like that I can broadcast messages to all or select speakers saying things like "on our way home" or "don't forget to drink your juice".

Duo calling worked for a while after regular phones were too hard. Just say "hey Google call (my name)" in any room with a smart speaker. Sadly those days have passed now too.

Only main complaint is there is no "drop in" feature for video calls. I do two way voice through the cameras instead.
A good thought but he doesn’t have the dexterity/clarity to push any kind of button with any intentionality.
We have that remote for my dad and have done the same thing.  He can hit “on” or “off” and “channel up/down)buttons, but that’s it.  When he turns it on, the tv is programmed to go to a particular channel that he likes.  Since he lives with my sister and her family, he has to ask them if he wants something different.  Usually he doesn’t really care what’s on as long as it is not sports (sidebar:  how can he possibly detest sports so much when all of his kids and grandkids are fanatics of some sport or another?). We have bought the series “Golden Girls” (streaming) and often put that on for him.  Unfortunately, my dad is losing his ability to even use this remote in its limited capacity so, more often, we just find something that he is likely to enjoy (news shows, classic sitcoms or Dateline-type stories) and put that on.
we were going to try this, but trying to explain to my wife's grandmother that she can talk to the tv to tell it what to do & have her remember was futile.
I wonder if we could vid-call him on one Alexa and then talk to the Alexa TV for him. Change the keyword to avoid confusion… it just might work!
Good luck!
Cool, thanks for the idea!
Well, I can understand that is quite the obstacle.  I don't know what else you can use then.  Sorry.
Yeah he def wouldn’t be able to speak to Alexa himself.
That is worth a try. Good luck.

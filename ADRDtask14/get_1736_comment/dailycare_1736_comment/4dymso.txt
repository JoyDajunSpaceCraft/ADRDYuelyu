Looking back the first signs were when my mom stopped wanting to drive. She had always been so active and on the go all her life and she just started telling us she did not want to drive anymore except to the grocery store, or to get her hair done, or to go to church. Places close to her house. So when she wanted to visit relatives from out-of-town, we would drive her and pick her up. When she went to see my sister, which lives 5 hours away, she took the train. At this point in time we absolutely had no idea that she was developing Alzheimer. Just thought it was natural ageing. But looking back, this was the first obvious sign. That was about 8 years ago. She then slowly started not wanting to participate simple activities she had always loved. At this point, I think she started to realize something was wrong, but kept it to herself. She started not keeping the house or yard up anymore which was completely out of character for her. She stopped getting dressed, she would stay in her PJ's all day. She stopped showering and taking care of her personal hygiene. My sister had to start helping her pay her bills. This is when we realized she was having memory issues, but she hid this as much as possible. This is also when we finally realized something was wrong, and took her to see her doctor. The doctor started wanting to see her every three months to evaluate her. While seeing the doctor she kept declining and had a brain scan and her doctor's determined she had Alzheimer disease. It seems that everyone that has Alzheimer presents symptoms in different ways. Presently my mom is going through some pretty bad things, and it will only continue to get worse. But anyway, those were a lot of the first symptoms I noticed, but I was not living with her so I'm sure there were some more obvious symptoms that we just did not notice. Mom as well as most people who get Alzheimer will hide their initial symptoms and deny they have a problem for as long as possible.

Anyway, a few months ago I was chatting with a lady about how she finally convinced her mom to see a doctor. I wish we had thought of this. This is what she said, "We told my Mom that it doesn't hurt to have a baseline evaluation of your memory for later on. We told her that sometimes people have trouble with their memory that can be helped with vitamins. Like a vitamin D deficiency. Not true in her case but less scary to say and for her to hear. When she was diagnosed, it was easier coming directly from the doctor." 

Hope this helps some 
Junk mail. She started sending money to every charity, PAC, and unfortunately scams that was in her mailbox. Once you start sending money to them you are put on every mailing list possible. She was getting 20-30 pieces of mail a day. It was the red flag my family didn't see until it was to late.
**Bad driving**
All elders in my family who later developed dementia drove bad first.  Many old people just drive bad due to mobility and vision reasons too, but it's often a sign of dementia.

For the elder that lived in my town I personally witnessed some of it.  It started with mild stuff.  Say they were making a right turn from one not busy road to another, maybe they swung wide going partially into the oncoming lane.  They'd *deny or brush off* the mistake, like they didn't realize it happened.  This sign came about 8 years before the formal dementia diagnosis.  Gradually family members and friends started chauffeuring them more to be "nice" but really out of concern out of poor driving habits.  We couldn't get them to give up the keys till a fender-bender that could have been much worse.

**Trouble writing checks** 
Occasionally mixing up the "pay to the order of" and "dollars" lines.  Or writing kind of cockeyed above the lines.  

**Misdialed phone numbers**
I didn't actually notice this one until I took over finances and looked through old phone bills, but it was interesting.  Their phone company records all long-distance calls by number.  So say my elder's sister's number was 1-555-555-5556, you'd maybe see a 1-minute hang up call or misdial charge for 1-555-555-5565.  Everyone does that.  But what happened around the time the dementia kicked on was that it went from maybe one of these calls every other bill to 3 or 4 on the same monthly statement.

**Paranoia**
For the elder with suspected Lewy Body dementia there was a noticeable increase in paranoia and a sense that the world was going down the tubes.  Increasingly distrustful of others.

**Inappropriate social behavior**
Being openly racist or saying off-color remarks.  What had previously maybe been thought but not said became said.

My grandmother(75) has some form of dementia but not necessarily Alzheimers. She's waiting for assessment on Tuesday next week after which we're hoping that she'll get a spot in a nursing home or at least a home nurse. 

It started with forgetfulness: Having to double, triple or quadruple check that she has everything(Keys, wallet etc)with her. Not remembering what she had for breakfast or what day she did a certain activity. It's was very mild stuff at first, not debilitating at all and it could very well be attributed to her age. But this forgetfulness increased in severity overtime until she no longer remembered to pay bills, can't recall her pin code, phone numbers, asks the same question several times in the span of a few minutes etc. She was still very clear in her mind at this point, just extremely forgetful.

After around a year of this extreme forgetfulness something in her mind just broke, almost immediately. Went from being clear in the head to no longer having a grasp of reality, all in a matter of weeks. On a good day it ranges from conversations with photographs, telling stories that never happened, not understanding the reason for paying bills, asking why she can't find the battery hatch on her oven etc. She can be "fun" on those days and during her moments of clarity she can even laugh at herself. On a bad day she's accusing people of stealing stuff that she misplaced, visiting her neighbors in the middle of the night asking them to help her find her imaginary friends, trying to discuss ridiculous conspiracy theories, her favorite one is how her landlord moved her apartment to another building during the night. Basically full psychosis. And when she's like this it's rather painful for her because in her mind all this makes sense, she doesn't understand that there is a void of logic that we(her family) can't follow. I assume that it's extremely frustrating and hurtful to her that her own family doesn't understand things which to her is both logical and clear as day.

I'm a bit ignorant of dementia(which is why I came to this sub today looking for answers) so I don't know for sure if that initial forgetfulness was the start or if what we're experiencing now is the start. I assume we'll get answers to that once a professional has assessed her situation. But perhaps you can see some likeness in the behavior of my grandmother and your mother.
My Grandpa stopped hanging out with his best friend and neighbor. Got in to a big verbal argument with him and told him to never bother him again. Next big one was my Grandma (also had dementia) asked my mom to hmget spaghetti noodles. My mom gets them and opens cabinet and finds about 15 boxes of them.
My Ex developed Dementia symptoms that I noticed at 54 yrs., 6 months after a Quadruple Bypass. He had 8 different medications That he took through out the day. I would remind him to take his meds and he would sort through his bottles and take them with no difficulty or assistance. Suddenly, He couldn't do it. One day ,  I realized I was going to have to give him his meds. , because this was just too confusing. He may have had milder symptoms that were masked by illness. But, that was the first for me.
I saw it first hand where family was saying she was "crazy" yet no one could pin point it to being ill. While visiting my grandmother I watched her put a pot of water on about 2am. She then went right to bed turning off the light and fell asleep. I waited to see if she was going to come back and she didn't. If I hadn't been there it is likely the apartment would have burnt down. Apparently other relatives had observed her do this a couple times over.

For years grandma would accuse everyone and anyone that someone came up in her apartment and stole her money or jewelry. She even changed the bolt lock she had on her bed room door but according to her she felt her things were still being stolen. It was her forgetting that she hid something in her underwear drawer or wrapped money in toilet paper and put it in a magazine.

Paper was a HUGE issue as well. She'd take tons of toilet paper to wipe herself in the bathroom and throw it in the garbage not flushing it, wrap chewed food up in paper and put it in a pocket or drawer...she'd use toilet paper to wipe her face then the counters. 

We did not know about her work issues because no one called us. She was not able to do her CNA duties and could get other CNAs to do them for her (lift patients, clean them, etc.). She would go to work on the wrong days as well.

When we moved her into my parents home we noticed that she'd refuse to shower. She would also pee on the floor though the bathroom was just a couple of steps away, not more than 10 from her bed.

Cooking would be a long arduous task as she would as the same question six or seven times within five minutes time frame.

I am going to say that those with dementia many times do not acknowledge that something is wrong. I chalked it up to pride, "No I didn't pee on the floor. It was someone else!" However, in actuality, it is truth to them. They do not recall doing such a thing and so to them it did not happen. At all. 

I say write down the peculiar things you observe her do. When you go to one of her doctor's appointment, bring it up. See what they say. Don't take "oh she is getting old" as the brush off answer. Medicine is at the point where it isn't just senility--they can see if there are issuing going on in the brain and check if hormones are way off.

I send you my hugs and the Best.
The first signs I remember clearly was writing everything down, in multiple places. Reminders like "take the trash out Tuesday" would be in six places.
With my mother it was hard because she already had a lifetime of other psychiatric symptoms due to emotional problems and personality disorders. The first symptom I noticed was blunted/flattened affect and general disinterest in other people she might normally be interested in. It took the rest of my family about 5 more years to notice the more classic things like short term memory issues. 
I can see that some irritating behavior about 12 years ago was the start of it.  At the time, it just felt like the most negative parts of her personality intensified here and there.  

For example, my very independent head strong LO, lectured me on the importance of being with family at Christmas (we had recently decided to stop dragging our kids around the country for holidays).  Since she was in good health and traveled extensively, I invited her to my home for Christmas (to be with family, ya know).  Instead, she accepted an invite from a friend across the country to spend Christmas together.   When I reminded her of her lecture to me and asked why she turned down my invite in order to spend Christmss with her friend, she was dumbfounded and said,"I don't know".   That was clue #1 that something was wrong in her brain but we didn't pick up on it. 
Aw sorry, this happened exactly to my grandma too. She also became obsessed with sweepstakes, and these shady contests were calling her constantly. 
I read a bunch of them. I sill can't figure out what magic words they wrote in those letters that caused her to send money to them.

>these shady contests were calling her constantly.

Her phone wouldn't stop ringing. So they unplugged the phone.

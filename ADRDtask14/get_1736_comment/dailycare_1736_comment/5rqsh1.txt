Those articles all compare late vs early AD, though none tackle the progression question.  I think rate of progression varies greatly between patients and is dependant on many other factors, like education level, presence of other diseases (like diabetes) and lifestyle habits.  Highly educated people can resist the presence of disease for a while, but when the disease gets worse, and they can no longer compensate, it appears to progress quickly.  
I'm watching this space because it's of vital interest to me too.

I only know my own experience. In my mind, I'm stretching back into the past to try to understand when the symptoms actually had started. 

Right now, there's only the eternal present, where *normal* is constantly being redefined.

I'm still trying to come to grips over the phrase *life expectancy* when it comes to Alzheimers -- especially early-onset.
You could try to search in Google Scholar, look at the medical literature, if you haven't already.
Do you know if by early onset you're talking about any rare/ familial Alzheimer's? Alzheimer's caused by a deterministic and inherited gene (like in the movie Still Alice"?  Or are you taking early onset (aged 40 to 60) without a deterministic gene?

Would assumption be that there really is no way to tell at this time how long an early onset diagnosis gives the person to live?
I have thanks. Just haven't found anything yet. 
  I am talking about early onset as in before the age of 64.
I honestly have no idea. There are stats on life expectancy from time of diagnosis.

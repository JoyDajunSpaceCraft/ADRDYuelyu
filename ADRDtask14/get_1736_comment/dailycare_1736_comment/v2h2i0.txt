Did your wife call and report mom as a missing person/kidnapped?
That's fucked.  Try r/legaladvice
How long has she been in Denmark? Does she actually have bank accounts there? It’s one of the hardest and most complicated countries when it comes to inheritance.
I would imagine that your MIL is unhappy with her daughter that tried to gain guardianship over her. Why would your wife do this for a woman with "slight dementia"?  That's enough to ruin the relationship right there and may have more to do with the loss of the relationship than the move to Denmark. Is your brother-in-law not speaking to your wife either?  Your Mom chose to give them the money and a court ruled that she is competent to do so. Unless the loan was secured with something like real estate in the US, it would be very difficult to collect if she were still in the US. I don't see how that's much different from Denmark, especially since your MIL is not even considered a resident of Denmark at this point.
Actually, someone else called police. They called not the old mother, but the sisters husband, didnt try to find or drive by . . .! He said all is fine, and the police said all is fine. No one cares about old people. no one.
A month. guess she will get. Point is to make sure she is regarded as resident when she dies, I guess . . . OK, so why is Denmark complicated for inheritance? Would love to know more. . . .
I think your wife needs to call them and report her as a missing person as step one.
Becoming a resident takes at minimum 4 years, so their plan is not really great. Get a lawyer. Seriously. Get a lawyer. 

As for why inheritance is complicated… Banking and money in general there is extremely complicated.

Studies have shown that the problem with most senior's lack of appetite is lack of saliva.  Without saliva, the tastebuds don't work, so nothing tastes good.  Stimulating saliva is done through umami foods, foods with glutamates.  Glutamates are in meat, mushrooms, broths... savory things. 

Seniors who are given foods high in glutamates, including MSG (No it's not bad for you) maintain a more regular caloric intake and BMI.  A bowl of miso soup, or some teriyaki, or a nice stew, or anything along those lines will stimulate saliva which will make things taste better in a few minutes.  So try to give her something with glutamates when she's hangry, and she'll probably take a little and then reject it... and then she'll be hangry again in a few minutes and THEN things will taste better.  So small things that are easy to make and then she can push away, like a few cubes of heated up risotto, or cheese and crackers, or a slice of meat. 

On the other hand, if her appetite is suppressed because of neurological damage, then maybe it's time to try cannabis edibles.  Check with the doc to make sure it doesn't interact badly with any of her meds, then try 1/4 of an edible.  Chocolate is nice.  It might stimulate her appetite... and make her happier and nicer to be around!
Although I agree with everything the other post said from what you've written it sounds like she may have an issue with texture. You said she will eat yoghurt, milkshakes, and fruit. All of which are soft and somewhat sweet. You may just want to try expanding on things in those categories, like smoothies (you can sneak whatever you want in them as long as they taste good.) or similar things like soup.
My grandma was also a foodie her whole life so when she got to this point it was rough. We just gave into the sweets. We did get some sugar-free Jello puddings as well for sweet taste without the sugar spike. Be aware though that having a lot of sugar-free foods can lead to diarrhea. 

Sweet tastebuds are the last to be affected so a lot of dementia patients have this issue. My philosophy was that she already had a terminal disease that was progressing faster than the diabetes, so not to fight too hard to make her eat "real" food.
Kind of like a toddler. Smoothies help sometimes itâ€™s just to hard to eat anymore. They canâ€™t tell you why so they just stop.
Maybe try Glucerna?
Add Collagen Protein Powder to her smoothies. I like Great Lakes Collagen powder in the green can. It has no taste and can be added to things hot or cold. That stuff saved me when I was pregnant and had no appetite.
If she's mostly defaulting to liquid foods you might consider nutritional drinks and broths for her to sip on.  She might be having pain when chewing or insufficient saliva.  Perhaps giving her some sort of sour snack before she eats.
Iâ€™m working on a project creating video programming designed for people living with dementia and their caregivers. One of the memory care facilities we work with asked us to build content that could help stimulate appetites. Maybe you would find our â€˜Letâ€™s Eat Lunchâ€™ video to be helpful. You can find it on Zinniatv.com/watch.
Is she having swallowing problems?  It can be easier to swallow thickened liquids (yogurt, milkshake) than water (too thin) or solid foods.   Ask the doctor if she needs to see a speech therapist to figure out if she needs stuff at a certain texture.

Have you tried Ensure?  It's sweet and thickened liquid but has protein and calories.

What about her teeth or dentures?  Are they fitting right so it doesn't hurt to bite down on solid food?

Preferring sweet foods is a dementia thing, so it might just be what it is.
We made milkshakes for my Dad using Ensure or Boost - plus milk, ice cream, plus whatever fruit or flavor he wanted.  One favorite was peanut butter powder, so thatâ€™s a protein win.  His doctor said that at a certain point in their lives any calorie is a good calorie, just get them to eat anything (but he didnâ€™t have diabetes).
Most foods we give her are pretty umami (mainly cuz we kinda like umami foods, too), but I'll definitely try small portioned savory snacks. She gets snackos and I get to buy charcuterie; win-win!

I'll also have my mom bring up the appetite at her upcoming appointment and discuss possibilities of...alternative foods ðŸ˜‰

Thanks for replying!
That's the thing, she will DEMOLISH our spaghetti with meat sauce and other things with more texture and yogurt will be like *HSSSS*, then yogurt will be her jam and nothing else matters. I'm gonna try soups and stuff
We've been incorporating more smoothies into her diet lately (and milkshakes since she likes those). We also give her pretty soft foods regularly, since we noticed she picked the skin off of Popeye's chicken
NO. nonononono. She disliked Glucerna pre-dementia, now she hates it with a burning passion ðŸ˜‚
I will keep this in mind, thank you! (For her and for me lolz)
Maybe so! Per the advice of another comment, I am gonna try to get her some nice smooth soups. Like I said in another comment, I'll have my mom bring this up at the upcoming doctor's appointment

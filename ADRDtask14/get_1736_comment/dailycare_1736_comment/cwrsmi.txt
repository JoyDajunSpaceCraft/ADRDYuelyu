Better safe than sorry love. An awkward conversation now could make a difference. I would mention it and maybe see a dr if she feels a similar concern. Sorry you've been through the death of a loved one. It could be fatigue and stress related but it's always good to check. Is there a history of dementia in your family?
Lewy body isn't necessarily hereditary especially at the age on of early to mod sixties.

  But back to your question. I would recommend some actual neurological testing to establish a baseline and then repeat that test some time down the road, at that point you'll have a clearer understanding of the progression.  

If there is progression and the neurologist can narrow down the cause to dementia then unfortunately it's time to have the hard conversations about how to handle it.
Contact your Primary Care Doctor and have him or her look at your Mon.

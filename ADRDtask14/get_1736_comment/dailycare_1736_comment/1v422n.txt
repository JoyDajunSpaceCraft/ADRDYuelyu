Are you saying your husband has threatened to leave you or just that you fear the possibility? You should talk to him obviously. It does sound like you've taken a lot onto your plate. As for the cat and the music those sound like the two *best* things you could be doing. Music is one of the *last* things to go with this disease.
Oh no, he hasn't I just worry about the stress getting to him
Well, if you *weren't* taking his feelings into consideration I'd be worried but you really seem to have a grip on the situation.

That is rough. I don't know what the best course of action is going to be. If you move on without her, it will just "prove" to her that you don't like her. If you stay and try to help her see the truth, it is probably a waste of time since she won't believe you or remember anyway.
My heart feels for you.
The only thing I can say is that you're not alone. This is a common problem on some level with many Alzheimer's patients. The good news for you is that your dad is still alive and at least, I assume, helping her with the basics of food. As long as he is taking care of the basics, I would encourage you to pull back a little for your own soul's sake. There is absolutely nothing you can do do affect how she thinks of you --- disease and mental illness won't allow that. Make sure you are taking care of yourself, when you do see her tell her you love her even though she will deny it and be rude, and know that the disease is the problem. I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. 
Definitely sounds like beginning of dementia of some sort. This is a really tough spot. Read the book: Take my Parents...Please!   I canâ€™t remember the author.  It could also be a chronic urinary infection they can cause outright psychosis.  If your dad keeps her safe then just take care of yourself and make preparations for when she gets worse. Sorry but it probably will.  Try to find someone to ask questions such as someone from Adult Protective Services or Eldercare just to get ideas for how to cope.

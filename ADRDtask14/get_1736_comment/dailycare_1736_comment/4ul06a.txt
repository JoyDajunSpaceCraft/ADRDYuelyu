I know it's worrisome, and I'm sorry you have to deal with this. If you've always stumbled over words that is not necessarily dementia or anything to worry about. I would do whatever you can to keep your brain active. You may describe yourself as uneducated but that doesn't mean you can't do things to learn and keep your brain active. Also, if your father has issues with alcohol that may have a lot to do with his symptoms. 

Keep yourself healthy, eat right, exercise your brain. Good luck!

Call the local Office of Aging and tell them your story.  They will tell you the next steps.
You can call Adult Protective Services if he is of danger to himself or others. If his lease has been terminated, then his behavior is so extreme, that getting a case worker on your side is a good idea. 

Has he had an evaluation for dementia already? If he has, then tell this to APS when you make your report.
Yes. He has had been diagnosed with dementia. His lease isnâ€™t terminated, but the lease will not be renewed after the remaining few months.

I do not believe he is in danger of himself or others, but he is causing complaints from neighbors. Do you still suggest contacting APS?
Yes, the complaints from neighbors is enough. He's definitely not safe by himself, and his unpredictable behavior is what's drawing an end to his lease. 
Just call APS and tell your story. They'll advise you as far as the next steps.

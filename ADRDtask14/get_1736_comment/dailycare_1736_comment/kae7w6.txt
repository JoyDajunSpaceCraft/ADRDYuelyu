I don’t know how helpful this will be but here’s my 2 cents 

You need to move that camera - whatever it is giving off, maybe shadows, maybe some sort of red light - it needs to go. 
If you need to have it is there a way of placing somewhere that it’s hidden?

Have you spoken to her medical team about the hallucinations/delusions? She may need her meds adjusted. Also UTIs are a common reason for some of these behaviours so ask her GP to check for that 

What I’ve learnt most is - don’t ague or correct a dementia sufferer. In their mind they are 100% right, if there is a yeti in their closet - that’s what they see.
Usually negative behavior and hallucinations are a sign of negative feelings which can be due to internal issues (digestive, urinary, back pain etc) or outside stimuli (scary red light on camera, weird smells or sounds, etc). Having a schedule is also helpful in regulating these things if it is exacerbated by sleep. Try a diffuser with her favorite scent, her favorite music(preferably calming), regular schedule (sleep hours, meals at the table, entertainment/visit time), and health check.
There is medication for LBD. Is she on a medication for the hallucinations?
In addition to moving or changing the camera if that seems to be a trigger, there are specific anti psychotics which are tolerated by people with Lewy Body. My dad, who has LB and went through a period of very scary paranoid delusions and aggression, has been on Seroquel and Nuplazid. The latter has quieted down the delusions a lot: he's still delusional, but the delusions are "nicer" and don't cause the same agitation. Just be very, very careful to work with a specialist to find the right med, and don't put her on a typical anti psychotic, as those can actually lead to greater psychosis in LBD patients.

Will she wear sound-cancelling headphones or earplugs? Can she watch music videos while the roomba is running? If you say, we need to vacuum now and I need your help (involve her), maybe that will do it.
She wonâ€™t wear head phones but she may wear ear plugs . Maybe asking her to help would work ! Thanks for the suggestion!
Hey just wanted to tell you I had to vacuum today and I asked her if she would mind staying outside in the back yard with my dog because the noise scared him . Her face lit up with purpose and she grabbed a dog ice cream to distract the dog (which in turn distracted her ) I got the whole downstairs vacuumed !! Thanks for the suggestion
Brilliant! Really good idea - thanks for posting; it could help someone else.

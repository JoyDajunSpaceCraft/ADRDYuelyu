Not exactly, but it does bum me out that I picked up crochet around the same time my grandma was diagnosed. She was once an avid crocheter and made so many beautiful things. Once, before she was too far gone, I was crocheting around her and she looked at me and asked where I learned it. I told her that I learned from watching her and from the computer. I asked if she wanted yarn and a hook and her eyes lit up. When I handed them to her, she couldnâ€™t get past the initial chain. That was pretty heartbreaking for me that she could no longer craft. 

***I just remembered, before she was too far gone, she would just write her name over and over, like she knew that she was losing her abilities. Now it makes me sad.
I have a few things written by mom, particularly a recipe book she created for herself. All our favourite things for special occasions are now being photocopied for the grandchildren. We are so thrilled she wrote them out rather than cutting out clips from magazines or typing them. Itâ€™s a little piece of her to cherish.
Oh yes! I cherish these two birthday cards she wrote me when she was still Able to write. Iâ€™ve saved voice mails and even text message conversations. Like you, I took it for granted at the time.
Very much yes. The sneaky hits find me when I'm writing and catch some of my letters looking like hers.
Do you have some much loved pieces that were made by her? It could be a comfort to both of you! I know I have a number of pieces from my Grandma that I cherish and brings great comfort to me! Just a thought ðŸ˜Š
There are a few pieces at my momâ€™s house, but a lot of her mainstay pieces are gone with time or to other family members. I have a baby blanket she made my daughter when she was born, but thatâ€™s it.

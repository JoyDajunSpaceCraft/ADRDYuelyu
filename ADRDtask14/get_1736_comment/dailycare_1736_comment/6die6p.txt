A number of questions come to mind.

1. How old is your mother?
2. Is there any history of dementia in her family?
3. Does she take prescription medications? If so, has she started taking a new one recently?

If this happened suddenly, it could be something as simple as an upper urinary tract infection, which causes strange symptoms like cognitive decline.

Bottom line, your mother needs to see a doctor to figure our what's happening.
You might need to be sneaky if she's suspicious. Find a way to check her prescription bottles. Does she have any friends you can recruit to help? They may have noticed her behaviour as well and she might be more receptive to them. 


I will try this, thanks for your advice :)

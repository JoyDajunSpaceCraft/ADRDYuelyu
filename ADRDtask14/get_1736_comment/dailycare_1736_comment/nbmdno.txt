Lying in bed with no energy or drive to do things can also be caused by depression. I don't know enough about you, though.
I agree this sounds like depression/anxiety. I have been exactly where you are. First step is to talk to a professional. I know that sounds daunting but many places do “virtual” visits these days. Very easy.
Sounds like depression to me, too.

I think pre-planning is a good idea. Even with donating her body, you would likely still want to have some sort of memorial service or life celebration, right? No body is required. However, and this is an important oneâ€”do not prepay anything. You can pre-plan the funeral, but do not pre-pay it. If paying for it at the time will be a problem, start setting aside money now in savings to cover the costs.
I was told to pre plan for my aunt and I just paid for a funeral so I am aware of the costs. When I went to talk to the funeral director for a simple mass, no wake and the burial of a urn,.it was as much as the full wake and funeral I just paid for and I was very put off. I am also not pre paying for a funeral for my elder.because if it is in pandemic winter time, we will probably not hold a public event so...why pay for such a big unknown?
Thanks for the advice about not pre-paying. Appreciate it!!

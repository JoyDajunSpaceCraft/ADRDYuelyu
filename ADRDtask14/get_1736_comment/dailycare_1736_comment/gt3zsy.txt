My first suggestion whenever someone starts acting suddenly erratic at that age is for a UTI test. Start by ruling that out, because it can have bizarre and extreme symptoms that sometimes mirror dementia. It also wouldn’t hurt to start journaling any behavioral changes, so that if you do end up looking for a diagnosis you can go in with some data on potential decline already.
First thought is take her to the doc and get some tests run. UTI can do weird stuff, could be something else but if it is some form of dementia etc maybe they can help with medication. My dad went thru a couple weeks where he had either or hallucinations and lucid dreaming. He saw a 8 year old girl run thru the room in a nightie, people stood by his bed and stared and there were a couple times he was talking to someone. he also chewed me out because I supposedly came home after going out one night and didnt tell him I was back. I never go out at night. If im going out these days its running an errand for him and I always talk to him as soon as I get back. After a few cycles of good/bad he has changed. Either the dreams,hallucinations have passed or he just doesnt tell me. he is stronger and sleeping better.

Def have her checked out. If she isnt on any alzheimers meds maybe something will help. if she has trouble sleeping let her doc know that as well.  Make sure shes getting plenty of water also. maybe she having lucid dreams, or her mind is processing fears and anxiety. 

Hang in there, I know its disturbing to you, be strong.
**What are the early stages of dementia?**

Hi, I am a nursing student, currently off my clinical site due to COVID-19 Imposed social isolation. I have researched your concern and here is my advice:

In the early stages of dementia, a person’s symptoms will be noticeable and will affect their day-to-day life. However, someone in the early stages of dementia will be fairly independent and should be able to do most things with a little help, or perhaps a little differently.

Everyone with dementia is different. The way dementia affects people in the **early stages will depend on the type of dementia they have.** Other factors like their personality, environment and the support they receive will also affect their experience of dementia.

· Types of dementia include:

· Alzheimer’s disease

· Vascular dementia

· Lewy body dementia

· Frontotemporal dementia

· Mixed dementia

**Early signs of dementia may include:**

· Simple forgetfulness

· Losing items

· Problems performing tasks or activities that were previously done without effort.

· Difficulty with learning new material is frequently one of the earliest signs of dementia.

**The stages of dementia are used when a progressive dementia has been diagnosed. The stages include:**

Stage 1: No impairment. The patient has no problems.

Stage 2: Questionable impairment. The patient begins to have some difficulty but can still function independently.

Stage 3: Mild impairment. The patient has obvious, but still mild difficulty with daily activities.

Stage 4: Moderate impairment. The patient needs help with caring for him or herself as well as with carrying out daily activities.

Stage 5: Moderate to severe impairment

Stage 6: Severe Impairment; patients are unable to function independently.

Stage 7: Very severe impairment. Body and mental functions begin to fail.

**When to see a doctor**

See a doctor if you or a loved one has memory problems or other dementia symptoms. Some treatable medical conditions can cause dementia symptoms, so it's important to determine the underlying cause.

**NOTE** that whatever stage your loved one is at, it is **very important you seek medical treatment**. There are medications/treatment and cognitive therapy that can slow the progression of dementia

Yes this yes this! 

My mom has multiple sclerosis and she’s in her 70s and when she has a UTI she sees people. She hears people. And the minute that I get her on antibiotics everything goes back to normal and her brain functions at a high-level once again. She gets them often enough that she has an at home test and is always given antibiotics that stay in our medicine cabinet... just in case. 

You can talk to your doctor about that too.
Is it only women who get these bizarre symptoms, or do elderly men also? I know UTIs are rarer in men, but wondering if the effects are the same.
Thanks yes good point about the UTI. My dad got really confused & paranoid when he had one. She seems compos mentis this morning but I’ll keep a note of the erratic behaviour
THIS!! My mama, God rest her sweet soul, did the CRAZIEST things when she had a UTI. The first couple we’re incredibly frightening. And she had no recollection of the events.

Making note of the behavioral changes in a diary is also a great idea. Sometimes early episodes are far enough apart that you lose track of what happened and when.

If you continue seeing these kinds of behaviors, a neuropsych evil is called for.
Thank you very much for this. I’d say mum is stage one at the moment. She has some difficulty with some tasks but this is due to a broken ankle. I will speak to her dr & go from there
Thank you. She’s seems compos mentis this morning so will keep an eye things & speak to the dr
Same for all. And anyone with a chronic catheter is vulnerable a lot.
Men get it too. We went through this with my dad when he was alive, he got really confused & was paranoid about everything

**All submissions *must* be a confession!**

* A confession is a statement acknowledging some personal fact that you would ostensibly prefer to keep hidden. The term presumes that you are providing information that you believe other people in your life are not aware of, and is frequently associated with an admission of a moral or legal wrong. Posts that do not express malicious intent will be removed.

* If your submission does not contain a confession it will be removed.

* An unpopular opinion is not a confession. 

    * Regardless of whatever unpopular opinion you hold, it doesn't classify here as a confession. You haven't done anything wrong, so to speak, so it isn't technically a confession. Better subreddits for this would be /r/offmychest, /r/TrueOffMyChest, /r/rant, or in some cases, /r/relationships.

* Your sexual exploration is not a confession; it's a part of finding out who you are. 

    * /r/confession is not a place for submissions that read like pornography. Despite our confessional theme, we don't find consensual sexual exploits sinful. /r/gonewildstories would be a better place to share.
Poor kid only wanted to talk to you.
Fuck, OP. Highschool sucks for everyone, you don't have to be a cunt to someone trying to make friends!
Go and apologize. God, teenagers are so shitty to each other. Dude probably needs friends, especially right now.
Maybe you should talk to him and tell him you didn't mean to be such a dick
Jesus Christ OP the kid just wanted to be friends
What the fuck dude?!
First off stop with this "autopilot" bullshit. We all know that is some shitty excuse you're trying to use to distance yourself from your actions so you don't feel personally responsible for it. 

Chances are you aren't "known for your dark sense of humor", you're probably known for being an edgy asshole.

Learn from this. Think before you speak, because it turns out your words have consequences.

YES YOU DID you might have regretted it directly afterwards but it was still your choice to say it and you weren’t exactly in an stressful situation so you had time to think about what came out of your mouth.

I’m not saying that you did an unforgivable crime but fucking admit that what you did was wrong FULLY and apologize

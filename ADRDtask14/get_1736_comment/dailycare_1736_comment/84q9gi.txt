I think it would be a great idea!!! Each person with dementia is different as has different triggers. I would just make sure there is plenty of space and accessible seating for wheelchairs and walkers. 
They can be relaxing- and there are fountain designs out there that don't have any pooling water.  They have one at my mom's place- it looks like a very tall ceramic pot with a flat top with a hole on top where the water bubbles up, flows down the pot and the basin where the water is caught and recirculated is under mesh, hidden with rocks.  
I think it’d be a great idea. We have one at the community I work at and a lot of our higher functioning residents love it. Weather permitting they sit out in our courtyard and watch birds and talk about the garden. And for some reason it’s the only water related feature we have that doesn’t make them think they’re on a cruise ... 
Great idea! Everyone with Alzheimer’s is different, but generally fountains have a nice white noise to them and should be a gentle sensory experience. Good luck with your project. 
Lovely idea!

You might consider something raised, at table height, both so that wheelchair bound residents, and ambulatory residents can interact with it.  Also, Alz patients often have impaired balance, so you probably don't want a feature they'll be tempted to bend down to.
I know it's only anecdotal but here's what I got:  my mom has become much more appreciative of nature whereas before she was almost dismissive.  She's mostly into animals, but vegetation and sunsets also bring her peace.

**tl;dr** - this is a great idea and you're a good person
Thank you very much for the response!
I wanted to add that this kind of design is also toddler safe.  It attracts birds, too, which is always a joy for the seniors.   Yours is a good question- I think adding anything that would enhance being outside in a natural setting is calming and would be of benefit.  Let us know how it turns out.
Do you know what type of fountain it is? I'm still trying to decide which type or model would be best to use for the project.
Thank you!
Thank you very much for the information!
Ok, I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you!
Thank you for the input! 
Thank you both for the ideas, I appreciate it.
Would you know what type of fountain this is or have a picture of the type for my reference? It sounds like a nice addition to have one that attracts birds.
It’s a fairly large three tiered fountain so even if they can’t see it they can hear it throughout our courtyard. Looks like the picture. All I know. But our residents can’t access it. Which is very important. It sits in a raised garden they can’t climb into. So maybe work with the staff and the possible location of the fountain to find the best options.  https://i.imgur.com/pRmFKOy.jpg 
I know my great aunt and others in her facility loved sitting in the lobby watching the birds.  There was a huge bird cage with about a dozen birds.  The five or six chairs around the bird cage were always fought over.

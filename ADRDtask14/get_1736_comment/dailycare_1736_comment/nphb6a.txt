There's no one solution. You'll need to go with your gut and find what works for you. Our kids and I tried to get DW to go to the doctor willingly and she refused. So I had to trick her and tell her she was accompanying me to my appointment. One part of this disease you can take advantage of is someone with this disease usually doesn't remember. Not in this case. DW still remembers "my appointment" and blames me for "trying to have her committed." But, I'd do it again without hesitation. Your family needs reliable information about what's going on. Hopefully, you have a doctor with some experience.  If not, find another. Have a phone call or conversation with him/her in advance. 

Sometimes people are unable to accept their situation.  Maybe it's fear or embarrassment or disappointment.  Whatever. You can't win an argument with someone who's in another zone.
My grandma is the same way. Is there a doctor he’s been to and feels comfortable? We could tell my grandma that there’s a storm outside and she wouldn’t believe us but coming from her doctor she takes their word literally. 

I’d phrase it as a routine check up and just expect him to be agitated later. Just remind him that he hasn’t gone for awhile and just want to make sure he is healthy. If you have the diagnosis already, I’d also recommend that the doctor tells him or guides him to the next step to get diagnosed; or to even rule out that it’s dementia.
Reading your post, I'd say routine checkup so that you are sure you can get him there.  Otherwise, there is risk he won't go.   I'd tell his Dr. In advance of your concerns but be aware the Dr. Might tell your dad you spoke with him.

When they refuse to go, it becomes a huge problem so I'd not risk it.

My own experience is that when my aunt with developed dementia is that she did well in AI for about six months because of the schedule they had her on. She still couldn't do things like take the AI community van to the doctor or store by herself  because she'd get lost in the building and wander around.  But based on her feeling better, and the support structure she had at AI, at one point, she also felt that she was ready to 'go back home.' (She couldn't. We sold her house that was in an advanced state of disrepair in order to pay for AI). At the end of her first year, we moved her into memory care.

When she was moved into AI, is it a place where she has her own stuff? Or is this AI more of a skilled nursing facility?
She was able to have some of her things there.  It’s basically one room that is about 350 Sq. Feet big.  I do believe the structure there helps her a lot.  However, she now feels that there is “no one here to socialize with” as everyone is in a noticeable state of more advanced dementia.  

She’s also a retired nurse, so that means she knows “everything.”  LOL. 

It just feels like the home health nurses that are coming in to do PT, ST and OT seem to be completely ignoring the fact that the DPOAH has actually be activated.  When I ask for updates, I’m met with comments like, “Do you want to know every single detail?” And when I question the reversal of it, I am met with “Just because she’s making a choice that you don’t agree with doesn’t mean its a cognitive deficit.”   :|
Have you had a meeting with the director?  
Do you think she has the intent to leave AI and move back home?
I think she intends to find a different AL facility… and she has told me that she plans to have the DPOAH reversed.  At this point, I am practicing a lot of blind faith… what will be, will be.

Apple Watch 7 to pair with his phone? (You can also add a line so it works even when his phone isn’t in range.)
If you are in Los Angeles County and willing to be put on a waiting list(or pay $358) then the tracker they provide will enable police to assist if they are lost: https://lafound.lacounty.gov/tracking-technology/
My sister put a GPS chip on her dog. Maybe there’s something you could affix it to on your dad? My dad doesn’t want an Apple Watch (and doesn’t wear a watch) and does periodically forget his phone. Is there something your father has that is always on him? Perhaps he has a limited number of shoes he wears?
Apple trackers are about $30 and you can get a waterproof holder. Clip it into his clothes every day. You can track it with your phone.
Clip  a tracker to his shoes or something he will always take.
This is going to be so much easier when we lose our minds because we are so attached to our tech already.

With my dad, a GPS watch was out because he never wore a digital watch a day in his life, he wouldn't have remembered to put it on a charger because he always wound his watch (which created a whole other set of issues when he decided the battery operated watch needed to be wound).  There were some trackers that could have been hidden in his shoe laces, but he wore sandals 50% of the time.  The apple tracker would probably be the best if you are an I person but we are not.
I'm not either, but my sister's family is so we may consider it. Getting it attacked to him everyday might be an issue but we may have to figure it out. We are thinking of getting some respite care for my mom a couple/few days a week so there's that too.

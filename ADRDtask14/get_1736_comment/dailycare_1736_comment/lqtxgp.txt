It's normal to experience some memory loss or word finding difficulty as we age. That being said, these symptoms your mom is experiencing can be something more serious.  I would encourage your mom to see her primary care physician to help determine what could be causing her symptoms. Vitamin deficiencies, blood clots, thyroid levels are some examples of common treatable conditions that can cause memory loss.
Short term memory loss is usually the first signs. My dad would repeat a lot of things and forget things. For years they told him It was just age memory loss. But he knew something else was wrong. Eventually they diagnosed him a few years later.
Thanks for the answer. She took a blood test and saw her physician 2 months ago and everything was fine.  And she'll never take an appointment  to tell him that her son feels concerned about her memory since she thinks there's no problem (and I hope she's right).
Sorry for your dad :/ What does short term memory includes exactly ? Events that occurred the same day or minutes/hours ago or also weeks/months ago ? Your dad repeated things he said the same day ?
Short term memory loss is forgetting thing that happened recently. He could tell a story from his childhood, but he didn’t remember he saw someone the day before. At the very beginning he would just repeat a lot.  Where he would say a story and then 10 mins later repeat the same exactly story word for word.  I would just have your mom see a neurologist just in case if you’re noticing these things with her
Thanks for the explanation. I'll wait a bit and see if I notice other warning signs.

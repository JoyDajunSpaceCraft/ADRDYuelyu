Ignore and deflect and change the subject. Walk a bit away. We started taking my father in law to malls with food courts instead of restaurants. He was quieter there than in a comfy restaurant.   Eventually it was just too much to take him out with his behavior. He was quite abusive. You have to take care of yourself and I know I will be down voted for this, but being abused for whatever the underlying issue is isn't acceptable. 
It's hard.  I've never found something I could do to consistently avoid feeling really hurt.  Some days it bounces off, some days it is deeply hurtful.  Your story sounds similar to mine.  I'm sorry you're going through this.  Best I can echo is to take care of yourself.  Somedays that may mean taking care of him, other days maybe cutting the visit short and get out.
I don't think you'll get downvotes for this--not from me, anyway.  I was proud of myself last night because I actually pushed back and told him how he had behaved badly and why he had no right to do so.  I never used to do that; I'd just suck it up and hurt on the inside.  (And to be clear, this was a behavior he had WELL in advance of any dementia diagnosis.  He's been awful for my whole life and beyond.)  It's not so much that his dementia is an underlying issue, but more that it is one facet of the larger problem of TBI.  Henry VIII had traumatic brain injury, but that doesn't make his behaviors excusable.

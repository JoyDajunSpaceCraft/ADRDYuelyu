If he has a violent outburst again you need to call 911 tell the operator it is a psychiatric emergency so they will send an ambulance and the police won’t treat it like a domestic violence attack.  Once your dad is in the emergency room he will be sedated (this is not a long term solution) tell the emergency doctor that he needs to be admitted to a geriatric psychiatric ward(or hospital). Once in the gero-psych they can figure out the best way to manage his behavior. 

If there is not another outburst you should contact his doctor (general practitioner or neurologist) and tell them he needs to be admitted to a gero-psych ASAP
As already mentioned, please call an ambulance.  This is a geriatric emergency and is absolutely treatable, but is at a point that it needs urgent care.
This is not right. You shouldn’t be living like this and you shouldn’t have to put up with it. As mentioned by other commenters, call emergency services and explain that your dad is experiencing psychiatric issues. When he is in hospital, explain the situation. Please do this for your own safety. I’m sorry you’re experiencing this, I can’t imagine how stressed you must be. Hoping your dad gets the care he needs, best wishes.
There are some medications that can help some people, but it is quite a bit of trial and error to find the one that works best.

And you may have to sneak the meds into food. We do that here.

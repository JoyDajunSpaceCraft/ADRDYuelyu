Start with the alz.org site and look at the resources available in your area. Your state or county may have a Senior Services department or a division of aging services. Those would be good places to start. The issue you may run into is that they will very likely want to work directly with your aunt and uncle and not want to include you (unless you have POA or guardianship). 
Look up your areas council on aging.  Let them know that you know seniors that need a check/ assistance.  You can find links on our sidebar.  Iâ€™m sorry you and your family are going through this.  It is a horrible disease.  
If you are in tye USA, she needs to he diagnosed by a neurologist.

Then she will be assigned a case worker. That case worker will help you sort through your options.

Additionally, once you have a diagnosis, you can also call your county senior services line. They may he able to help you with some free services or at least a list of services available in your county.
Thank you. I should have been able to find it, but was drawing a blank.

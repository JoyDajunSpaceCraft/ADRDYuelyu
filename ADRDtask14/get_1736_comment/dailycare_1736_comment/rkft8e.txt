We went through that exact same thing. A bunch of vitamins and depression meds later we finally got a CT Scan. It was shocking. I think most doctors start there because it's the lesser evil... but I would have preferred to know years earlier my father has early onset.
Itâ€™s definitely a possibility. Because of her poor nutrition she could have vitamin B12 deficiency which can cause cognitive impairment, however there would be other neurological symptoms. A simple blood test can rule this out. It would be great though if you could ask for a cognitive test to rule out any other suspicions.
Whenever I hear of someone getting blood tests to see if poor nutrition/ malabsorption is the root of their cognitive issues, I think "well, maybe, but everyone gets checked for that soon after expressing concern and it's seldom the issue--most people's bloodwork comes back fine/normal. "  BUT--people who've had gastric bypass are KNOWN for being B12 deficient and B12 deficiency is linked to cognitive impairment 'big time.'  Wouldn't it be wonderful if she's one of the few for whom it really IS a nutritional issue. (Hope you'll keep us posted.)
i mean hyponatremia is a real thing. if it shows in the labs it could be the deal
Fight for it if you think its it. You are the their biggest support.
Are you familiar with what specific cognitive test(s) might indicate dementia or rule out that her cognitive issues are due to nutritional deficits? (Not taking yours as medical advice but want to get more familiar with which tests do what). Thank you!
Hi yeah sure. In specialist clinics, they usually do the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) as initial assessments to confirm the diagnosis of a cognitive impairment.

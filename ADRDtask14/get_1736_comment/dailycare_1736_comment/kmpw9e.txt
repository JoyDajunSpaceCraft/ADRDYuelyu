I don't have any insurance advice, but I found Caitlin Doughty to be very helpful in dealing with end of life planning. Knowing your rights and your options is important, and funeral homes will often try to make you spend more than you need. For example, we used grocery store flower arrangements for my Nana in law's funeral last year, instead of the very pricey funeral home option. 





Caitlin's YouTube channel has a great video on affordable funeral options.

So sorry you're going through this.
Shop around.  There are more affordable options than your local funeral home.  [Here's an option for $875](http://www.marylandcremationservices.com/) which is likely less than you'd pay for insurance.
Thank you!
Thank you!

You can never prepare for it. And yes it's heart breaking. My wife's father went through it. It broke my wifes heart when he didn't remember her. Sometimes he got mean too. I wish i could offer some comfort. 

Dementia is very scary.. What I’ve learned over the years is that even though they may not always know WHO you are, if they recognize you as someone that brings them happiness, comfort and love, that’s a good thing.. and if he’s talking about your mom but doesn’t happen to know she’s standing in the room.. ask him about his daughter.. he may share memories from years ago... or simply tell you her name or say he loves her etc.. sometimes the facts are wrong but the intention and the love is there... just a little lost... I’m really sorry for you and your family going through this. 
My grandmother is going through dementia so I know how it feels. If you ever need someone to talk to, you can always  pm me

I'm so sorry you and your family are going through this. I'm sorry I'm absolutely no help but you're not to blame, you getting angry is in the past so don't be mad at yourself for it. Just love him and be patient and kind which I'm certain you are doing. Wish I could help. Xxx
Hands across the internet to you my friend.  What you should do call for help.  There must be some Cerebral Palsy and Dementia support charities that will be able to listen, advise and provide support.  The UK Alzheimers Society have been absolutely outstanding for us.  The Australia version is tel:1800100500  Let us know how you get on.

I am so so sad at the thought of what he and your entire family are going through. Every one of us has regrets of how we've acted in the past, but those regrets are worthless since they accomplish nothing. All you can do is move forward from here loving and helping him. I wish you and your family moments of peace, hope, and love amid all the pain.
I’m sorry that must be heartbreaking. I can’t imagine watching someone so young go through that. My mom was diagnosed with dementia at 55 and it is the hardest thing I’ve gone through. There’s nothing easy about this journey. I just want to encourage you to be patient and try to find joy and happiness with your brother, as I have found that has had a positive impact on my mom and her journey through such an awful disease! Again I’m so sorry this has happened to you and your family :( 
I’m so very sorry. Hugs
So sorry! Be strong and anything you do is good! Your brother needs you.
He loves you so much, dont forget that. 

So sorry for your situation - Hope your parents are helping you 
I am so sorry this happening. Your parents getting a divorce is probably adding even more stress on you.  Everything must feel upside down. 
We all have regrets, we can’t go backwards. Do what you can to show him your love for him.

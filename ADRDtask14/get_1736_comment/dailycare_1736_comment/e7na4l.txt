I think in the US, diagnosis of Alzheimer's involves eliminating of other causes of dementia. Definitive diagnosis (that is available to the public) would be just autopsy. Theres biomarkers but i think they are primarily reserved for research. 

 I recommend you see if you can get a referral to a neurologist for MIL. Some dementia causes cant be stopped or reversed, like Alzheimer's, but other causes can be. Sooner is better too, in case its something that can get worse, but isnt reversible.

Like someone else mentioned: neurologist is a good Idea. With my mum, she eventually got sent to the Alzheimer center in Amsterdam (vumc) for a second opinion. They do loads of tests, including brainscan, eeg, bloodtests etc.
We are now waiting for a call from a "casemanager" to see what we can do to start making life easier.
Could be Parkinson’s Lewy body which involves a drop in dopamine levels. Or a mix of Alzheimer’s & Parkinson’s- which is very common, but not spoken of often!  

They’re both caused by very different protein build ups and are prescribed very different meds to manage the protein build up. 

Exercise is good in both cases!! It relieves anxiety, builds muscle and stability needed to prevent falls, Replenishes Lewy body starved dopamine levels, & keeps Alzheimer’s tau & tangles from building as quickly in the brain. 

There’s a necessity of exercise for all! None of which our lazy pill popping family believes. Instead of a happily ending life once filled with a daily 1 mile walk w/ the family dog for exercise, it’s a ghastly ending for a mixed dementia relative who fell while high on benzo anxiety drugs, broke her hip and waited in excruciating pain for a week to be seen by an MD and hospitalized for a palliative pain freeing hip replacement. 

It’s a Tragic story caused by unempathetic psychopath family members who think drugs are the answer, even when they have full knowledge that the benzo anxiety drugs they recently demanded are causing daily dangerous harmful falls, that necessitated a hip replacement, that family tried to outright refuse. WTH?! Medieval Madness!!

Thank you.
This is the challenge. But we’ll keep pushing.
She doesn’t have any physical symptoms at this time. It’s all behavioral. She goes to a fitness class which is good!

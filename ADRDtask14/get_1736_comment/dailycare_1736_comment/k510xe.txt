You are a human. Give yourself grace. Remember the accusations arenâ€™t personal even though they feel like it. Deep calming breaths. Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re upset with yourself, but try and be kind to you too.
Having been solo caregiver for my mom for three years, I can say with certainty, no, it is not possible to have 24/7 patience. {{hugs}} Take it easy on yourself, and just do the best you can. And get somebody to help, if you can.
It happens and theyâ€™re going to forget it anyway.
I understand. It happens. Keep her busy and get a routine. And take time for urself. Donâ€™t give her time for her mind to wonder. Painting, coloring, knitting, reading, you know... things she likes. Iâ€™ve noticed it helps with my 90 yr old grandmother who lives with me.
No, honestly did this for months and should have had respite - definitely find this support out there. I will never forget going through this and that we should have placed my mom in nursing care so much sooner.  The complete introvert and hermit my whole life is now the life of the party and everyone loves her!!!
I yell all of the time. I canâ€™t help it. Iâ€™m not one of those special people who can handle this shit, Iâ€™m human. This disease has made me hate her. I know itâ€™s not her, but I donâ€™t have the tools to deal with it. I didnâ€™t sign up to work in a nursing home, because I know I wouldnâ€™t be good there, yet here we are.
As a 16 year old care taker absolutely not but what is possible is for us to look and see that being angry is ok weâ€™re juts as much human as they are and yeah itâ€™s very annoying when they think they know something when itâ€™s the exact opposite I completely understand your frustration but if your able to get anytime at all to yourself use it go for walks or take some time off if possible and go enjoy your day if not play some soft music or something she enjoys to ease the mood and instead of always telling her sheâ€™s wrong try to distract her attention away from what ever it is sheâ€™s fixated on sorry if I wasnâ€™t able to help I hope everything gets better!
the only thing that helps me when I lose my temper is the hope that this is one of the times that she'll forget. At least she blames ghosts. Could you make up names for different ghosts and give them personalities? maybe the fiction will help you keep your sanity
I feel bad for you because maybe you have a hard time dealing with someone with this disease. Maybe it's your first time? It's hard to deal with dementia if you have no prior knowledge and experience dealing with someone with the disease. 

I underwent grief when I witnessed my grandma succumb to the disease. But after scouring through the internet and through being educated by someone who has the disease like u/MeandLewy, my mindset shifted and I'm treating my grandma the same way as I did before. She's the same person. Her body just can't let her express the things she once did. If one has dementia, they have a hard time forming new memories. I guess that's why you're continuously being accused of moving stuff around.

You're also with them 24/7 so it must be tough on you taking care of them.

But please, have more patience with someone who has dementia. Never ever succumb to anger and lash back at them. Empathize what they're going through because they can't help being that way. The disease controls them sometimes.

I advise you watch u/MeandLewy's videos on YouTube so you can understand what it's like having dementia. Her videos are very insightful.

Some people with dementia see visual hallucinations. My grandma has dementia (late stage) and she's pretty scared sometimes because she seemed to see things that we can't see. She can't speak anymore but my uncle told us that he asked grandma if she saw the ghost of our recently deceased grandpa. She nodded in agreement.

24/7 patience? I doubt that's even possible. You should have a partner/companion/helper. My aunt, uncle, and relative take turns when taking care of my grandma. If you're alone, then it'll be really exhausting on your part.

Never walk on this journey alone. Find someone who can help you, if you must. ðŸ˜Š
My husband used to yell at his mom.  Sometimes it made me feel uncomfortable to hear him do that.   She was so repetitive.  So clingy.  He was the only one stuck taking care of her because his sister who lived two streets over couldn't be bothered to help at all (AT ALL! NOT ONE BIT!) and didn't speak to her mom for 10 years over MONEY.   So this of course frustrated him.  We were jailed inside his mother's home.  He has a brother who lives in California and what much could he do from where he was at the time?

He would yell at her to "Go watch TV! Leave me alone!", He would tell her to "Stop asking me the same thing over and over!"

He loved his mom so much.  I knew this.  But I didn't understand at the time what was going on.  He was burnt out.  Almost completely.  

When she died he was shattered and felt all kinds of guilt for feeling both relieved she was gone and regretful of his actions.   

Relieved because he just couldn't see her like that anymore, and guilty because he wished he had more patience.  I told him not to have any regrets because in the end, he stuck it out.  

This is normal.   You are human.  You aren't a robot.  Take care of yourself.  You need to be the best version of yourself you can be, and there will be times that you won't be.  But you're *persevering*.  Remember that.
Yes. It is. You are able to do this. If you need help message me. It can get better... but it is up to you to be the guide.
They say the most ruthless shit. The most targeted, personal attacks I've ever dealt with. They become bully comedians and their own audiences, when my grandma laughs it actually scares me now.
Itâ€™s so so so so very hard. Iâ€™m getting better. And determined to be grateful for the tkme I have left with her. And thanks to Covid I have nowhere to be but with her currently.
Thank you very much. My patience is growing and I know Iâ€™m doing more than a ton of daughters would do. Iâ€™m doing everything in my power to be here for her and more comfortable....while I can.

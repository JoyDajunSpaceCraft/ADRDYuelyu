I'd talk to his current doctor and tell him/her the situation. Perhaps they could provide some guidance or maybe a benzo of some sort. Also alerting the airlines before the flight might be a good idea. Crews prefer knowing beforehand if they have passengers with physical or mental problems on-board and all are trained to handle "situations." This is a very nice thing you are doing for your in-laws even if it does feel like it's being dumped in your lap. Hope all goes well.
I agree with the above comment about talking to his doctor. Or therapist, nurse, anyone professional who works with him. Also family members that spend a lot of time with him. Every person with dementia is different and has their own comforts and triggers. Good luck :)

Thanks.  We spoke to the doctor and he prescribed him alprazolam for use if he gets super agitated.  Upon your recommendation we also spoke to the airline and they're ready for us.  Thanks for the advice.

From an outsider's point of view  it does seem like this got dumped on my lap and I admit being resentful of my sisters-in-law for seemingly not stepping up.  But I've come to the realization that I have to do as much as I can for my in-laws for two major reasons: 1) I love my wife and I can't let her shoulder the burden alone and 2) my father-in-law is/was a good man.  For all that he's done for others in his life, this is the least I could do for him.
Thank you.  I've got his favorite music set up on my kindle fire and I've scanned some old family pictures he might be interested in browsing while on the trip.

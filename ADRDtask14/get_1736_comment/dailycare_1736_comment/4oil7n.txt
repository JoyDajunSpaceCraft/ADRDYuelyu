You can't really see plaques on a CT or even an MRI, you can only image them reliably on an Amyloid SPECT scan or detect them using lumbar puncture (amyloid / tau ratio) or through a brain biopsy.

Presence of amyloid is part of the Alzheimer's process but you can see amyloid in normal petiole too so we would only use the above techniques (depending on local availability) if there was a question around the clinical diagnosis. The vast majority of diagnoses have a CT/MRI to rule out very rare causes not to diagnose dementia where they are often normal.

Hope that's helpful
The only thing you would see from MRI/CT scan would be brain shrinkage in the effected areas. Like others have said you would not see the plaques with out specific amyloid pet imaging. It is also important that many types of dementia have similar memory loss symptoms with diverse pathologies. 
From what I've heard, confirming certain types of dementia is difficult without an autopsy. There are so many types, so MDs have to use what tools they have to deduce the type based on patient characteristics, family reports, observations, cognitive testing, etc. Some cognitive characteristics are similar (memory problems) but there are key distinguishing features. Here is a chart that describes types of dementias: http://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Clinical-Topics/Dementia/Common-Dementias/


It could be the case that you are dealing with a case of vascular dementia or the cumulative symptoms of several "mini-strokes" which don't necessarily cause shrinkage or plaque formation in the same way that AD does.
Very helpful, thank you!

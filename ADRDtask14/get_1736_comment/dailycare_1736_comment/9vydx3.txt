My advice is go the doctor early! A lot of medications to slow the progress of dementia are most effective in earlier stages.

Another reason to go to the dr. early - Dementia causing conditions (alzheimers, parkinson's ftd) are not the *only* things that can go wrong with the brain.

It's well worth getting thoroughly checked out in case what's causing this is some *other* condition that's treatable.

For me, the forgetting names of people is more concerning than misplacing stuff.  I misplace stuff all the time.  Someone once explained: losing your keys isn't a problem, it's when you forget what keys are.

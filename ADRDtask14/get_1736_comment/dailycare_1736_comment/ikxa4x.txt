So much for you to get your head around here. Coping is the best most of us do but you really need to get some outside help. Seek out counselling or Alzheimers associations because they can put you in touch with some one. 

First and foremost you absolutely must look after yourself because if you fall aside or become ill yourself then you are no help to your Mum. Look after number 1 so you are there for numbers 2 and 3 and more! I had 8.5 years of it and I totally understand what you are saying but sadly there is no magic answer. Come here to talk and do try to see the good things and not focus on the bad or sad things.

My sincerest apologies. I am wrong. Sorry. Just trying to tell you what I did but I was out of line.

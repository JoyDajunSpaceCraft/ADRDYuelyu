If your MIL needs to go to rehab after her hospital stay, be sure the rehab facility has a dementia unit. They may just transfer into that unit and from there take her in as a full time resident. This is how we got our father into the place he is in now. 
Good luck. It is a tough period.
Did you ask the patient advocates at the hospital? Presumably they should know something.
Are there any residential hospice options?  If she isn't receiving hospice care already, ask her doctor for a referral.  The hospice you choose may be able to help you find a place if they don't offer residential care.

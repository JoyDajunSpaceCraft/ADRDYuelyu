I don't think the sign would work after a while because it might become part of your mom's "background" like anything else hung on the wall. The automatic pill dispenser that [u/Myfeelingsarehurt](https://www.reddit.com/user/Myfeelingsarehurt) sounds a little complicated for a dementia patient, but maybe your dad could help. Otherwise, I'd go there once a week and load a regular pill minder, then phone your parents twice a day to remind them about dosages due. Just verify that your mom actually took her meds before any chatting. I have a friend who does this with her mom. Ironically she sets reminders on her smart phone to call her mom. It's not easy when memory breaks down.
We use one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FL620B0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_jnucAbSV2WABZ) for my partners meds. In the beginning it helped him to remember to take them.  As the disease progressed and his meds increased I took over the job of actually giving the meds to him as he would become distracted half way through and leave the mess on the counter. I still use that thing though as it keeps me from forgetting and keeps them on a schedule.  At the programmed time it rotates to the next slot and beeps and flashes until you turn it upside down to dump the pills out.  You can also see missed doses really easily.  
Current approach: call twice a day “Mom its time for your meds. That’s ok I’ll wait. You took it? Good, now go mark it on the calendar by the back door.”
Seeing small threads of recollection come back, and she seems more herself, less “in a fog”.
Baby steps, but grateful for them.

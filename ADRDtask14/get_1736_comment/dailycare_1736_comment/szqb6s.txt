Have an electronic copy in your email. When my mom had to go into the hospital or see a new dr, being able to email the POA right then and there so they had proof I could make decisions made everything a lot easier.
Varies by state. What you need to do is get an attorney involved to ensure the paperwork is correct and will hold up and they'll let you know where it needs to go.
Make sure that the places you will need to use it, such as her bank, will accept it.
Usually there's two poas signed in front of two witnesses...that's how my Dad did his. It was in his lawyers office and they stamped the back of every page - as photocopies will not be accepted by some...notably his bank.
Social security does not accept POA, so there is another process there.  Bless you for taking care of her.

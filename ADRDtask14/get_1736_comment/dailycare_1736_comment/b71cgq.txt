You are not being a big baby at all. This is about what works for her. Maybe try “losing” the regular ones for a few days to see if that takes care of the transition? Best of luck to her and you! 
Yeah just gradually reduce so there’s a transition maybe she needs to just get used to seeing them there. 
I would try just replacing all underwear with disposables and also talking with her physician about bladder control issues. 
I second losing her regular pants and seeing if that works. If not, you can always bring them back.

This happened with my dad. He was wearing 3 pairs of underwear, and leaking all the time, on the bed, in the chair,etc. he would not change to “pull Ups” finally we took all his underwear away and replaced them with disposables. It worked.
Good luck, everyone is different.

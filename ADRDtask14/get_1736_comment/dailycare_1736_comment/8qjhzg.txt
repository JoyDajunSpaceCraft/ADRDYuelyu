I had to grind my grandpa 's pills and stir them into pudding. I checked with his pharmacist first about all the different pills.

Only issue then was that he didn't like to eat without everyone else having some too, so whenever he needed his meds we all had a pudding cup with him. I ate soo much pudding that year. ðŸ˜›
I have found a spoonful of applesauce with a few pills in it works well.  You have to work a bit to get the ratio right.  Their mouth works to swallow the applesauce and the pills go down too.  Too many pills and they start to try to chew, so start with one and work up.  
Ask the pharmacist if you can grind them up and put them in a fruit drink
For us it's the combination of something soft and something chunky. Like, yogurt with granola or crumbled cookies mixed in, or oatmeal with nuts.

If your mom will let you feed her, the best way to manage it is to put the food on the spoon and then put the pill (or pill piece, we break up the bigger pills) on the tip of the spoon. That way the pill is closest to the back of her tongue and she'll be more likely to swallow it.
I have to grind them up or sheâ€™ll pocket them. Usually applesauce or pudding. 
Give her a sip of something she likes to drink before giving her the pills.  I try to get my father to drink something before taking the pills - I figure the pills will slide down a little easier if his mouth isn't very dry.  Unfortunately he thinks *he* does not need anything to help take his pills and every time there are pills sort of stuck to his tongue while I try to get him to drink some more to help get them swallowed. (and have to be careful so I don't find slightly dissolved pills on the floor by the bed later on).  He prefers sweetened iced tea so that's always handy. 
This is how they administer meds at my mother's care facility. Everyone looooves pudding.

I'm sorry. I hope someone here can have some good advice for you. Some good words. If I were there, I'd buy you a cup of coffee and let you talk.
I have heard many palliative care experts say that by the time most people start considering hospice, it’s already been overdue for some time. 

It sounds to me like you’re in pragmatic problem solving mode; which necessitates blinders for your emotional processing. 

I hope you are able to get some deep, uninterrupted, and restorative sleep at home while your partner is being cared for in the hospital.
I'm sorry you're going through this.  It sounds awful.
I am giving you a virtual hug, and sending a karma smack upside the head to whoever accused you of being selfish. You are absolutely entitled to your grief. I don’t care if it’s your college roommate’s divorced uncle by marriage three times removed. No one has a right to say anyone else’s grief is more important than your own. 

My husband had a stroke in June 2018. He is well, but it turned our world upside down. I absolutely grieve for the man he used to be and the life we were supposed to have. It sounds like you are suffering from caregiver burnout, and you may want to consider therapy. It’s a lot for anyone. Sometimes I just hit this emotional bankruptcy and mental fatigue and just can’t take anymore
Yes, look into hospice or a nursing home now. I was at my wit's end when I hadn't slept a full night in two months and was doing all the caregiving both day and night. Your quality of life and quality time will improve, because you won't be exhausted all the time. You will have more energy to spend time together because you won't be exhausted. You will get time to grieve. It is a very very good idea, and there is not a single downside to looking into hospice before the day you are so run down that everything breaks down. Because then when the breakdown day arrives (and it will soon, by your description), the wheels will already be in motion.

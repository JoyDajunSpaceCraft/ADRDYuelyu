Does she live with someone else? If so and she shuts her bedroom door at night, you can put a door alarm on her door and put the sensor in that person's bedroom so it notifies them when she's out of her room and they can listen to see where she is (bathroom, kitchen or going wandering). They could also be placed on exterior doors. We had to do that on Mom's doors because she'd decide at 3 a.m. that it was a bright sunny day and she needed to go start gardening, in January. You can get them on Amazon, they're not terrible expensive and definitely worth the peace of mind.
Can you put up some sort of alarm that will wake you up before she gets out?
We put some door alarms (a pack of 4 inexpensive ones from Amazon) on all the exterior doors. It makes this loud annoying sound (the neighbors can hear it). It snaps my dad out of it most of the time and alerts the family when he tries to leave. He turns around and walks to his room. It  appears to be helping to prevent him from leaving but not from “trying” to leave. He worked graveyard for 25 years so he’s programmed to be up in the middle of the night. These episodes are typically between 3 - 5am. Sometimes a couple times in the same night. 
Hope you find something that helps for your family. Maybe put a movement sensor on her door (like the kind the stores have when you enter). That could help alert your family prior to her actually getting to the door. Just a thought.
I bought these: Defender Security S 4180 Doorknob Lock-Out Device – Doorknob Lock with Key to Block Access to Keyhole, Removeable and Easy to Use, Fits Round Doorknobs with Max Diameter of 2-7/8” https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CGYNFF0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_FMXM5DW9PH6FERYGJ9W4?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

We put them on at night and she hasn’t been able to wander out. I feel so much better knowing she will be safe in the home all night.

Hey so I was a caregiver for my mom when she was on the verge of passing. Im in my late 20s and it was hard. I felt guilty for how i was feeling about the situation. The best thing you can do is ask for help. From friends and family. Also does your grandfather have a case worker? You should see if his insurance would cover a nurse to come by a few days during the week to look after him. 

Its very important to keep time for urself and normal activities. For me school was my escape. I made sure i dedicated time for it and to get lost in it. Doing my best in my school work helped me to forget the reality of what was going on and also a sense of accomplishment that even though i was stresses, filled with anxiety and a bit depressed i felt i had this going. 

But also having time to care for urself is important. For me I'd wake up at 5am while she was still sleep (the nights she wasnt up in pain) and id go to the gym. By the time i got back i was able to shower eat and start school work (online classes) before she woke up.

Eventually family came and was able to provide me with breaks. (Til i had to make them leave for adding onto my stress) but thats another story.

Get help! Being a caregiver is hard emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually. Ask for help however u can. Time management is a big thing but it will work towards ur benefit. U can always dm me to talk or vent. I know the emotional rollercoaster u must be on. 💚
I'm in my early 20's and I'm a full time caregiver for my mother. She can't walk, stand, or even roll over on her own. My father travels for work so its usually just me here to care for her and her various medical conditions / surgical wounds. 

Don't feel bad for feeling bad. Most days I can manage but sometimes the resentment gets intense. We *should* be out there building careers, families, hobbies and friendships. But the idea of abandoning those we love is more painful than staying to help, so its not much of a choice. 
Not a young caregiver but want to ask where is the rest of the family??? It’s too much for one person, especially a young one who has a life to build. I am so sorry you are going through this and I hope you can get some help from other family members or outside people. There have been other communications from young people on here and I hope some of them reach out to you as well. Maybe we need a sub-sub-Reddit for young caregivers! 
I'm a youngish (30) new caregiver, trying to finish graduate school while taking care of my terminally ill mom. It is TOTALLY normal to feel the way you do, especially at your age and life stage. If there are other relatives that can step in to carry some of the load so that you can stay in school, please ask them for help. 

If your grandfather is diagnosed, perhaps he can go into an assisted living facility? Do whatever it takes to continue building your own life. It's not selfish, and you can continue to support your grandfather in other ways. Take care of yourself first!
I’ve been taking care of my grandfather for the past 7 years and I’m in my early 30’s. It’s been incredibly hard. Traveling is hard, pursuing and advancing in your career is hard, building a family of your own is hard... but you can do it! The best piece of advice is to see what services he can get either from the county such as Medi Cal or his private insurance. Services like IHHS will pay you to provide care if your grandfather falls into the low income category. Access these resources! I can’t depend on family whatsoever but I was able to get a nurse a few days a week. If you don’t take care of yourself and pursue a life of your own as well resentments grow and will jeopardize your relationship with your grandpa especially if he may have dementia. You need to take care of yourself so you can take care of him!
Good grief! You angelic darlings are going through it! Well, I'm a full time CNA on an Alzheimers unit - feel free to PM me to vent, ask questions, or if you need help with behaviors. (Wandering, refusing care, sundowners, etc) Or if you just need moral support. Much love to you all <3
Hey man, 

Another mid-20s caregiver here. Also a student, unemployed, dealing with depression and low motivation. Imo the biggest thing you can do for yourself is find people you can talk to/have vent sessions with, and make sure you do basic maintenance on yourself (eat regularly/sleep/shower/do something fun). It's super easy to forget to take care of yourself when you're taking care of ill family members. 

Don't feel bad about being unemployed and struggling with school. It's insanely difficult to balance academics and caregiving, and trying to find work on top of that is pretty tough. Idk how the job market is where you're at, but in the US even though supposedly there are plenty of available jobs, most are not willing to work with around schedules like you probably have. 

On the academic side of things, have you considered going to a junior college, or something similar? The environment is friendlier to part time students and you might save a grip of money if you can get your gen. eds out of the way. 

If nothing else, hang in there and know you're not alone. And remember that you're doing this super charitable and loving act for your fam... It may be thankless at times but you're a top-tier person in this internet stranger's book and I'm sure many others as well. Feel free to dm if you want
HEY!

I can't even imagine what it is like to be so young with such responsibility. the closest I came was when my former husband got clean and so my daughter went to stay with him to reconnect and then he was diagnosed with AIDS from a dumb mistake made while high before he got clean , so at age 18 she was his primary caregiver and was the one to finally tell them to take him off of life support. She developed PTSD, crowns disease , anxiety and it breaks my heart to see how it devastated her. Its because of her and others like you guys and everyone else in this boat (I am now with my dad) that I am building a platform for people to be able to receive daily check in texts,  "I'm about to lose my shit, I need to talk " hotline with resources if needed, a learning /tutorial area where my years as a nursing instructor leave you with short snippets of "what to expect when ...."and then instead of getting your car washed or your dog walked if you have to stay late at work, j we come out on demand to watch your loved one so you don't have to deal with the crap from work.  Curious to know what other things you'd be interested in having access to . 

Good luck to you, if you have any questions, ideas, care questions, behavioral questions just any questions or need a shoulder to vent upon, I'm here. 
Hey! We don't have insurance(I don't live in the US and in here health insurance is too expensive), but I've been trying to see if we are able to get an assistance that increases his retirement salary so we can cover a nurse for him.

School is my escape too, but I'm not doing so well. My GPA is currently below average and I'm feeling kinda bad about it.

Thanks for all your advices and support, I'll be sure to try and take care of myself too <3

Yes!!! I literally cannot count the number of times people close to me implied I should put him in a home 'cause he is "too much work", but I love him so much and even when he isn't in his best mental state he is still such a sweet person, that I can't stand the thought of not being close to him. 
It's a rather difficult situation. My mom(his daughter) passed away when I was a kid, and then there is my brother and my father. They both do their best I guess, but my brother is married and needs to take care of his family and my father works all the time. They help me take my grandpa to appointments and stuff since I don't have a car, but in a day-to-day basis there isn't much they can do besides that. 

Thanks for all your support and YES, maybe we do need sub sub for young caregivers.
Hey! Good luck finishing graduate school, you must be a very hard working person doing both difficult things at the same time.

About the assisted living facility, I don't have nothing against the idea but I'm really too attached to my grandpa, and there are a few obstacles in the whole process. We do have retirement homes here, but the public ones seem to be too harsh, and the private ones are too expensive. My grandpa is also a very needy person and since his wife died I don't think he'll adjust.

Thanks for your advice. I'm trying to find a midway to take care of us both.
Wow, 7 years?? I seriously wanna be as strong as you, lol.

Unfortunately, where we live we don't have as much benefits when it comes to retirement rights. But I'm trying to search for something like the services you talked about it. We might get a nurse, not full time but at least partly. 

Thanks for your advice and support!!

Sorry, you asked a few really good questions at the end of your post that I didn't see while posting on mobile.  


Being young and wondering about how your experiences compare to others your age is totally legit. I relate a lot to  feeling stuck and looking at everyone else seemingly moving forward all the time.  And there is a some alienation from others in our age group, there's not much to do about it imo. Even people that have kids young don't really have the same experience as caregivers, because we're talking about end of life care, which can have surface level similarities to child-rearing, but they're totally different modes of existence. My working philosophy is to simply accept that your 20's will be different from the norm, but not to get too hung up on it. Try  to lay your foundation, whether that be sticking with school, learning a new skill on your own, finding part time work, whatever it is that makes you feel like you're still progressing as a person. The key seems to be to not let yourself stagnate and let your health deteriorate.   


And take time to keep up your mental hygiene too. Take up writing, meditation, yoga, something that will help you take time for yourself to ask "how am I doing today?" And don't feel bad if you have negative emotions towards your situation, take the time to unpack whatever guilt/anger/resentment/etc. you feel as you feel it; bottling that shit up is a recipe for making yourself miserable, and for not doing a good job at your care-taking duties.   


Best of luck to you and your grandpa. I hope you get good news. 
Poisionivyyo, you are a badass! Holy moly! 

  
Nickmiller2, I'm really sorry you're going through all of this. It's a tough (and very emotional) situation. In addition to what everyone in this thread is saying, I want to suggest thinking about your bigger purpose (although I hate saying purpose, I think everyone's purpose is to live the life they want to live) in life. What is it that you'd rather do or explore? School is not the end all be all, and I'm not sure if you like school besides the social aspect.   


This is coming from someone who racked up two degrees and if I wasn't fortunate enough to have parents who helped me, I would be swimming in about $200,000 of debt now instead of $35k. And I'm not even doing what I went to school for anymore. I think a lot of young people are going through the same thing. We all go to school because it's what everyone else is doing and what we're "supposed" to do. But if it's not something you're passionate about or you're not studying what lights you up, it's going to wear down on you. You're saying you're not doing well in school and you're feeling bad about it (which is a form of shame), and shame is one of the biggest energy and relationship killers. 

&#x200B;

I'm not anti-education at all; I'm just saying to take a good look at what it is that you want to pursue instead that will light your heart on fire. Because when your heart is on fire is when you and everyone around you really benefits. Sending sooo much love to you and your entire family. Feel free to PM if you want to talk about this privately/some more. <3   


  

Dont feel bad! Its completely understandable to fall back when dealing with a situation like this. When things got really bad with my mom i actually took a term off. 
Just do what u need to do for you too. Time management was my best friend. Help is a huge bonus. 
Goodluck 💙
No i completely agree with you. N thanks for the badass complement 😏

But i just recently started college. Pretty much a couple months before my mom started getting really sick. But my point is i was 28 when i started school. Im 29 now. N I waited until i realized what I really wanted to do with my life n an education. I work a very comfortable job now where i wont go into debt paying for my school. But point is i know what I want to do and had my plan set up prior to enrolling. N a lot of kids do exactly what u said n it is really sad. 

I love everything u said

**I am not a Physician.** For many years I worked for a Physician who was Board Certified in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.  This makes me familiar with many ailments and treatments, but I am speaking from my past experience, not a Physicians level of knowledge or experience.  I also care for a family member with aphasia.  

Aphasia is a broad term.  This muddies the waters when it comes to our understanding of aphasia.   As I understand it imaging does not always show the cause of anomic aphasia.  They may try an MRI next for a more detailed image or may just move to a plan of care next usually involving a speech therapy.   

Not all damage shows up in our current imaging options so sometimes there is not defining cause. In fact we still do not know the main cause of anomic aphasia, just factors that increase the odds of having anomia, such as damage to certain parts of the brain.  Study results differ when it comes to the areas effected.  Again this could be because there are many different types of aphasia and many different types of anomic aphasia.  

Out of curiosity have they preformed any verbal testing? If so have they determined what type of anomic aphasia he has?  


I hope this has helped in some way.

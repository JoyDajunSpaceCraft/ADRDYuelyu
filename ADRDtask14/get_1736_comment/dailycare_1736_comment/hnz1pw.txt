That could be a very early sign of dementia or some other frontal lobe pathology that lowers inhibition. How old is he and what does he do for work? Is he still handling his own finance? Any drastic change in spending habits? You can ask him directly about those incidents and look up the MOCA test to test him yourself.
This post has 3 screening tests for dementia. Fill them out and take them with you to your dad's next doctor appointment.

I would guess that being nude around guests falls under Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist's
"Does the person seem to lack the social judgement she/he previously had about what to say or how to behave in public or private?"
I'd call it a sign of dementia. My dad thinks he is a nudist as well. He liked to "skinny-dip" in our pool late at night, so he's always had an affinity for nudity, but my mom found him one afternoon in the backyard sitting in the buff. He knows he's naked, he just sees nothing wrong with it. He'd sit in the front yard naked if he could. So I'd definitely mention it to his doctor and get him screened. If nothing else, maybe the physician can convince him that nakedness around unsuspecting people is in appropriate.

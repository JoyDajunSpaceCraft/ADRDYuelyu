Hard to say. It could just be normal aging. Does it affect his daily functioning?
There are basic tests your doc can give that’ll help you figure this out. My mom started off the same way. Forgetting words, forgetting how to get back home after shopping, forgetting conversations etc. She was diagnosed in her late 70’s and is now in the late stages at 85. The unfortunate thing is dementia is different for everyone. 
As for talking to your dad, you have to do it. Maybe keep a log of the forgetfulness that’s concerning you and have a conversation with him and his doc. My mom didn’t want to admit it of course but eventually dementia took over and I became her caregiver and decision maker. 
Good luck!
Bredesen Protocol! See what is or has aggravated memory loss, and go from there!
Facebook search the group, "Bredesen Protocol unaffiliated" 

He also published a book back in 2017 called, "The end of Alzheimer's"

If your dad isn't responding to the Protocol, look into detoxification. Or see if he is APOE4 positive which is huge for folks under 65 to develop early onset. Either that, or he possibly needs to detox. Do your research. There is always hope.

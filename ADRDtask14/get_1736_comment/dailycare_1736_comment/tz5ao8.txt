You also want to be sure and read the fine print. What I discovered the hard way was the price they quoted was the in the door price, or rather the pricing it takes to get you in the door. Once you're in the door, all the other little nickel and dime costs kick in. Sometimes I ended up paying almost $1,000 a month more than the initial price quote.
Are you in the US? Could he just pay out of pocket and eventually get on Medicaid?

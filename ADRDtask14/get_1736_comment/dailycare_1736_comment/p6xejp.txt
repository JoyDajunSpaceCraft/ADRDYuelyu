Hiya, sure there are more folk out there like you than you think!   Absolutely, support groups are helpful, in varying ways.   So sorry for that happening in your teen years, that must have really sucked for you.  It's too sad, that in family illnesses, often kids/teens get kind of overlooked regarding getting support.  Tbf, teens will often reject it anyways, claiming "they're fine".  lol   Often, whether teens or adults, we don't realise till after, that we were actually traumatised to fu\*k, and there is continuing / residual fall-out.

You can even join various support groups, as it's often tricky to find one that exactly fits some folks complicated / double-whammy situations.  For sure there are thousands of folk who have alcoholic/drug addiction + dementia situation.

There are many different types of support groups around, some won't fit your vibe necessarily.  Go to each group a few times, to get the feel - sometimes on a certain day it can differ from how they usually are.   Keep visiting all the different support groups you can find, till you find ones that suit you.  Mostly, you ought not be pressured to speak up too much immediately, it should be up to you, to start opening up.  Maybe just a very short intro of yrself / yr situation.  Get the feel of the group, some of the other people in it, and your own feelings will start to coalesce.

I can't recommend highly enough, support groups!   Some sort of suck & are mostly a waste of time.  But, anyone can benefit at least in some ways from most support groups, and some groups can be of enormous help & value & comfort.   Go for it, humongousgoat, I hope you find some good ones!!   good luck!
Thank you so much for taking the time to explain this to me, I really appreciate it. It’s been hard to accept all this and you’re very kind :)

Call your local LHIN as mentioned by another commentator. Your LHIN will provide FREE in-home care based on your Father’s needs.  The free care is the same as care you pay for - so don’t worry that it is substandard.  Also, you should ask your LHIN coordinator about adding your Father to the Long Term Care (LTC) home registry immediately.  Depending on what city you live in, the wait can be anywhere from 3 months to 2yrs for a spot.  These are profit and non-profit Facilities that are subsidized by the Provincial government.  The monthly fees are very reasonable and much cheaper than what you would pay at a private Retirement home.  Think of the LTC homes as Ontario Universities/Colleges (subsidized) and Retirement homes as private colleges/Trade schools that charge whatever they want.  The fees for LTC homes might be covered by what your Father receives in CPP and Old Age Benefits, there are also additional subsidies if that is still beyond your budget.  The sooner you connect with your local LHIN the better you will feel, they can also  facilitate day programs for your Dad to give him a change of scenery and your family a break during the day (these are on hold due to COVID, but will hopefully return soon).  There is free/subsidized help out there, you just need to advocate for it.  Good luck!

Excellent to see folks share some positives; crucial to realize it is not ALL black.

I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

That's what I've found on this journey too, Truthful, it's not all black for us, not all grief, not all tragedy. It's life - the worst and some of the best. I know others do not having the same experience which is equally as valid. I hope new dementia families find a little comfort in our horrid and humorous shuffle down this dementia path.

Thank you for reading.
I've thought about that too, having the time to give my mom everything before she passes. Especially as my dad died fairly quickly from diagnosis of pancreatic cancer to death three weeks later. There are so many things not said, not done for him as we were in shock the entire time. I will not have that guilt when Mom finally heads out to the great unknown. 

Thank you for sharing your story.
You are welcome!

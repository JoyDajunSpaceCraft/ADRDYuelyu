As long as it's not caffeinated, drinking anything will keep her hydrated and that's what's most important at this point. There are some days I serve 9 cups of hot chocolate - the amount of sugar is nuts but we're dealing with a terminal disease and advanced age and it keeps her happy and hydrated and I haven't had an issue with UTIs.
My mom refuses water too! All she wants is coffee in the morning and soda all day which is pretty bad since she's diabetic.
We don’t have this issue. I wish my mom would drink carnation drinks. She rarely eats so this would be a big help. 
What about Gatorade, Nuun, any of the sports drinks? They’re very sweet. Or a berry smoothie mixed with ice?
Only guessing, but wishing you all the best in getting through this.
My uncle is getting like that and I've tried flavored waters with electrolytes but no success. Its frustrating as hell. Here's what I do to make sure he stays hydrated enough since water doesn't cut it for him anymore. I up his liquid intake via foods like watermelon,tomatoes and soups. He'll eat oatmeal so I make that sort of runny and his cottage cheese with pineapple that I add a bit of juice to it and he doesnt mind. Milkshakes that I add an ensure to the ice cream for drinkable calories. He'll sip on cola drinks some times and he'll eat 3 popsicles. I know all that is highly sugary but he doesn't have health issues with weight or diabetes so its good enough. Only time I can get actual water in him is with his pills and that's another battle entirely. Also my uncle takes quetiapine(seroquel) too. I hope something helps you to keep your mom hydrated❤
My wife is on Quetiapine also. We have some challenges keeping her hydrated but don’t think it is because of meds. 50/50 water/orange juice works for us sometimes. And just using a straw seems to help vs. drinking from a cup. 
Good luck.
My dad had no problem with drinking water when he was alive.  When we would give him his meds, I would usually mixed it in Glucerna or a homemade smoothie to hide the flavor of the medication 

Coconut water and Pedialyte good for hydration.
My Mom has been on quetiapine for 2 years - we didn’t notice any changes in her taste buds since using it.  She drinks water with kool-aid drops - sugar free but tastes sweet.
My FIL never had this problem then just in the past 5 month is is drinking coffee and Diet Coke only. He is also refusing to eat and then binge eating. It is draining trying to keep up with his food and beverage intake. He had also been on Quetiapine for over three years so I’m not sure that is his issue now as much as his dementia.

Do you think that she is not liking the taste of water because of the meds she takes or her dementia?
Oh er my late grandpa did not have dementia. Just strokes that left him bedridden. But yeah he did not like drinking water! What we did was buy what we call gelatin (unsweetened) and he would sip on it and eat it and that was his hydration
If she’s not drinking alcohol or only caffeine, what does it matter what she’s drinking as long as she’s drinking something?
My dad’s aide started refilling his soda can with water and he hasn’t even noticed since it’s in his Coke can. Maybe worth a try 🤷🏻‍♀️
Oh thank you! I can’t believe I forgot about Gatorade. I will get some and try tomorrow. 😊
I wanted to add there is a product out there called jelly drops that is supposed to be like hydrating candy for elderly people. I haven't tried it and don't much about it but May be worth a try.
My dad isn’t on Quetiapine and his appetite waxes & wanes like this; I think it’s just a weird dementia symptom.
Good to know. He is on a dairy kick currently. All he wants to eat is yogurt, Cottage cheese, cheese and Diet Coke it is such a struggle to get any balance
Ugh yeah my dad is all about the soda too. His aide takes the empty cans and refills them with water. As long as it’s in the can, he mindlessly drinks it.

I do know that as dementia progresses they get more of a taste for sweet things. But I also think in the middle stages, it’s a bit of a control thing. Like, I’m not the boss of much anymore but gosh darn it, I’ll eat what I want.

Its not illegal to engage in consensual communication with a friend regardless of the age gap and obnoxiousness of the communication.  It doesn't seem to me that you have any obvious legal options except 1. trying to get the cops to start an investigation against your grandfather's friend for some drug offense, which frankly isn't a great idea since that would make her more not less dependent on him, it could implicate your grandfather, and the cops probably won't be interested to just go chasing someone unless they're a dealer 2. see if you can have your grandfather declared legally incompetent and placed under the guardianship of a family member - an option that would ruin your relationship with him and rob him of personal autonomy during his remaining years, and it probably wouldn't work since he sounds completely competent. 

Seems to me that you have no good legal options and you should just express your opinion to your grandfather and if he disagrees, accept that its his right to handle his affairs as he wishes.
I have a friend with a 90-something mom in Ontario somewhere.  Maybe we could hook them up after the new year. :)
Invite him to move in.
How old is the woman?
I am in Canada too and I have seen ads on TV talking about Elder Abuse... This seems like it could be financial or psychological abuse. A quick google will tell you everything you need to know about it but I'm not sure how you proceed once you decide that is what is happening.  You could call the RCMP or a police station and tell them you know an elder who is being abused and go from there.  

Here is an article I found about elder abuse sentences being toughened,  so clearly you can be prosecuted for it.  I'm not sure how things would work in your case specifically though.

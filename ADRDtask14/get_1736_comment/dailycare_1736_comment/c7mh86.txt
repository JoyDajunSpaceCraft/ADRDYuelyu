Sending big hugs back. Welcome here! Risperidone is powerful stuff; wow. Have had acquaintances on it. Don't know what to tell you other than googling the drug and checking out side effects. For example, found this: "Avoid getting too cold, or becoming overheated or dehydrated. Drink plenty of fluids, especially in hot weather and during exercise. It is easier to become dangerously overheated and dehydrated while you are taking this medication." I know there's more, and quite possibly prescribers don't have time to give you the full run-down. Best wishes!
Big hugs right back!

You should be able to call your pharmacist or maybe thr prescriber to ask any questions about the medication.

Suerte y bendiciones, no es fácil ¡pero se puede!
I'll make sure to keep her well hydrated. 

Thanks!!!

What about a bandage over the wound?  Then she could pick at that instead.
Dementia often has compulsive behaviors associated with it. I have vascular dementia and have OCD. I clean... a LOT and even after housekeeping has cleaned! (I live in Assisted Living). She needs distraction: something else to do with her hands, possibly a fidget quilt/blanket. Have her wear cloth gloves, if she is willing and tell her how pretty they look on her (re-enforcement). If that doesn't work, there are medications available to help calm her. Ask her doctor. Doesn't have to be permanent, only until her nose heals. Good luck!

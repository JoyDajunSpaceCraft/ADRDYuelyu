Many a family member has rushed to the side of a loved one, only to have them not even open their eyes and then pass when the family member takes three minutes to go the restroom. Some nurses think patients feel like they have to hang on and fight death until their loved ones leave the room, at which point the patient is so relieved to be able to let go. Of course, sometimes there is one last lovely moment between the dying and their family members, but this seems to be more a fantasy than reality. Maybe try imagining yourself at that age with a beloved grandchild pursuing an important academic, personal, or career goal. I bet you’d realize your stage in life is the end and be excited for your grandchild’s thriving young adulthood opportunities. Love her from afar. I imagine she knows how very much you love her already.
At this point in time it’s not about her but about you. I live overseas and was scheduled to go home, and was ticketed, and my aunt took ill. I was walking to work 24 hours before departure and saw my flight (the next day) overhead, and thought “I should be on that plane.” Lo and behold, I landed as scheduled to be met by my father who told me my aunt died three hours before arrival. That was ten years ago, but it still gives me chills.
Thank you for these words, really helped put things into perspective. It's going to be a rough few weeks ahead trying to work with this going on, but I'm sure my family will keep me updated

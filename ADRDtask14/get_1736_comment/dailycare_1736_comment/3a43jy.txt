Good luck to both of you in this journey. The humor will serve you well. 
You're so lucky that he's not in denial.
My mom was just diagnosed as well.  We have the same humor as you.   It is making it a lot easier for all of us that we can laugh about it.  There are definitely still tears...but much more laughter than tears and I hope it can stay that way. :(

I'm glad to hear that the laughter is still there. My father and I haven't really talked about it much since he told me. I'm unsure if they are still figuring things out, or if he doesn't consider it a big deal? Haha.

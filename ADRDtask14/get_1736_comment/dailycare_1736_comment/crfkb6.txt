Our kitties never hung around my dad till the Alzheimer's kicked in. Then they would stare at him wanting to snuggle. So cute.
Our cat’s name was actually the last word my mom would speak. 

Shadow.
Enjoy these moments. You will treasure them even more as her ability slips away.
We think that “Penny” was the last clear and distinct word that mom said.  Penny is my brother’s dog and they had become buds against all odds.  She still visits mom regularly and would dearly love one of the belly rubs she always got from her.

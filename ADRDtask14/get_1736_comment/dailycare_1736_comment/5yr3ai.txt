There are a couple of home tests you can do to see where she is:

You fill out fill out the test for ["mild behavioral impairment" (PDF)](http://canadanews.ga/polopoly_fs/1.3000545!/httpFile/file.pdf)

Have her fill out [SAGE Test](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/brain-spine-neuro/memory-disorders/sage#SAGE)

The completed tests should be taken to her doctor.

You're pretty on point with your knowledge of what to do as far as planning goes. Kudos! 

As a note to OP, and to add to above comment, what symptoms is she showing precisely? The immediate course of action would to be what plus_dun_nombre suggested and to get the future plans in order and in writing. Depending on her symptoms, it might be too early to give a real diagnosis of dementia, but the testing can't hurt nonetheless. If both her parents had it then she's a very viable candidate for the disease but it can develop in anyone.

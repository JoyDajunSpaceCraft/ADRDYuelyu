First step is to talk to your primary doctor to get a referral for a neurologist, who can order an MRI for you. None of what you said screams "dementia" directly but if you're worried and have injuries in the past, it's worth getting checked out in an MRI. 
You say you have suffered concussions in the past: Have you had an MRI recently? Either way I highly recommend heading to the doctor asap. The earlier a doctor catches issues like dementia, the sooner you can work on treatment and therapy to help slow the progression.
Definitely seek medical advice if you are truly concerned. But don't let your mind jump to the worst possible scenario. Concussions or not, a certain amount of illogical thought and forgetfulness is normal. It happens to me far too often.

Thanks, I appreciate the reply.
Thanks for the reply and your advice.  I had an MRI last year for headaches, and I was told it was unremarkable.
Thanks, it is easy to get worked up over something like this.  I am going to keep an eye on it for now.  It is cathartic, though, to vent about this online, so thanks for reading.
Stress, medications, dehydration, and fatigue can all cause confusion as well and they are far more likely to be your cause (at your age) than most dementia even with a history of concussions.  It’s possible you are having dementia or problems related to a TBI, but it’s more likely to be something far more treatable. If it doesn’t go away or you are concerned see your PCP.

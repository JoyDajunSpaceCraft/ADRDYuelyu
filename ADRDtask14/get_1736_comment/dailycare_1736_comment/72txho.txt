Just be there for her. Ask questions if she feels like talking about it. Learn about the disease so you can talk to her about it. Mostly just be there - it's sad and stressful to see someone you love struggle. Dementias are hard because you see the person you love in front of you, but it's not quite them anymore. So you grieve while they are still with you to some extent. 
On /r/Parkinsons I updated the side bar with links dealing with dementia

With Parkinson's Dementia we are still able to recall facts, but slow in uptake.  With Alzheimers there maybe no recall.  

For me I used to multi-task with no issue, so in a loud room with many converstations I could process what was being said. These days if the TV is on while my wife is talking to me, I'll get very little of the information that she has said.

So I have to write down a list of "things to do" and cross them off as they get done.

Maybe he's worried cuz COVID is bad again?
What does he say when you ask him?
If he is in dementia, he's worried because he's caught in a loop. He worries about you but then loops it over and over.
 If you heard my father, on a daily basis like I do.... It would make perfect sense.
 He repeats the same thing over and over and over.

He may have developed a bleed around the brain that wasn't evident on initial scans. These can develop over time after head trauma (subdural hematoma), especially if he is on blood thinners. Probably needs another CT scan ASAP.

No blood thinners. And he followed up with his doctor a few days after the initial ER visit and got scans and blood work done, they still said everything was fine. Just complained about a headache for about a week or less, went for a follow up with his doctor, and now for the last few days has been unable to speak or write other than a word or two here or there. The doctors seem to think he'll be fine, as they've said two different occasions now. But they don't live with him, they don't see what a drastic change it's been over the course of just two weeks. From speaking like you'd never know anything was wrong, to not even able to put together more than 2 words.
Yeah I'm surprised they let him go and didn't keep him for repeated scans. Someone I am taking care of had a fall and hit his head last week, and I monitored him all night and into the next day on the advice of his doctor. A sudden change meant I had to bring him in immediately for a scan, but he ended up being fine (well, he still has dementia of course). I would bring him back for a scan, but there might be nothing they can do at this point.
Okay so you're saying the doctors are right it's just the concussion causing it and he will probably get his speech back soon, even if it's not back to 100% right?

I find it to be a stimulant, so I take it in the am. Any substance that wakes me up I take in the morning; anything that makes me sleepy I take it night. Very simple rule.
I've seen it both ways. Never really heard anyone say they noticed a difference by taking in the am vs pm. 
I'd also talk to your pharmacist and see what they recommend. 
I think the ideal would be to take it at a time that left you feeling relatively normal. I used to give it to my dad at night I think. I'd say if it makes you sleepy take it at night.

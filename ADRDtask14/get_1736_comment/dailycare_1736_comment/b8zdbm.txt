I'm so sorry to hear about the diagnosis, but very happy your mom has you and your sister to help her. 

For my mom, I couldn't give her options: I had to say "Oh, hey, so and so is coming over every day to make sure your meds are good!" or "Jan is coming by tomorrow to clean the house - you are getting older and deserve to have someone help you!" and find creative/compassionate ways to explain why it was necessary. My mother did not respond well to "because you have Alzheimers" or anything like that...she could not wrap her head around it. 

Full disclosure: it quickly got to a point where my mom refused to open the door for people and would throw things at them when they came in. It was super upsetting for her...and for them! And for me! So keep in mind it can and likely will get tougher. To that end I highly suggest some sort of support for you and your sister. I got a whole lot of out of a group therapy kinda thing, where I could vent and share ideas with other people going thru it. 
I played the sympathy card as if the help my mom would get would make ME feel better. 
My mom is the same way. We kinda have to force it on her. We got the home health aide by telling her we would pay for the first month to see how she likes it. That worked for that. She still would probably prefer if they didn’t come by and she likes her aides. We got her Meals on Wheels the same way, we’re gonna pay for it so you can try it out. My mom doesn’t think she needs the care or help so she doesn’t want to pay for it. Some decisions we just have to make for them, I find my mom accepts those decisions once they are made for her. Good luck and I’m sorry.
I agree, we’ve had to just make these decisions for my mom and she’s more willing to accept them one the decision is made. I need to find a support group.

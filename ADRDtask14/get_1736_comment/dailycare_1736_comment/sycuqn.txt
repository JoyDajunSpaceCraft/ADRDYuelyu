Yes, I've used respite care for 30 days and then again for 60+ days. My advice is to have minimal discussion about it and if possible, to use an excuse that he can't refute. For instance, I would not say it's because you won't have the time or energy to give him care because he may just insist he can take care of himself and it will turn into a back and forth conversation/argument.  Maybe you will need his bedroom for a couple weeks for a nurse and then it gets extended... Put blame on others whenever possible: "The doctor said I'll need a nurse for 2 weeks and made me schedule it through her office." "The nursing agency requires.... or doesn't allow..." etc. Also, I would wait until shortly before he's going to go to the new place to mention it to him. And stress that it's only temporary.

(I don't understand your idea about the steroids?)

P.S. Expect angry phone calls demanding that you come get him, or saying that he is leaving or walking home, etc. Be prepared to block his calls with the caregiver knowing how to reach you in an emergency.

I had thought perhaps to suggest that he was being relocated temporarily to trial the drug, but I can't and won't source them for him so I think it was a dumb idea.  


My midwife team have expressed concerns about me bringing a newborn home with dad in the environment, so I think your suggestion of blaming the medical team is a good idea.  
Thank you for your help :)

Grieving is a process, and its still very fresh, and you weren't able to get the closure you wanted. I'm sorry for your loss. 

I recommend talking with a counselor, someone trained to help you through this difficult process. Your connection with the departed was special, it was unique. Cherish that, and while it hurts to look back at the good times you two may have had, it will become a source of good feelings. 

I'm sending hugs.
I lost my grandmother two weeks ago after caring for her for 2 years and I feel completely numb. Life on Novocaine. I can only hope it will get better and I suspect that it will, but I’m doing everything I can to practice self-care and put myself in as many positive environments as I can find. Best of luck to you, and I’m terribly sorry for your loss.

Dementia is as random as it is cruel. I'm afraid there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason behind who gets forgotten or who gets remembered. But please remember that this can change Day to day, so don't feel disheartened if they forget you on a Monday, by Tuesday they might remember exactly who you are. In later stages this can vary hour by hour. 
I don't think he will completely forget you, he may remember you at certain ages.  My father thinks of his children as very young children - he doesn't relate me to the child I once was and can't say who I am or  what relation I am to him.

I use drugs.com to research interactions, side effects and so forth.  That gives me some information to then have a conversation with the doctors.
Not a doctor but I was married to someone in the medical industry and often found myself at dinners with pharmacists. Those people know their stuff - and are well versed in drug interactions. When my infant son kept getting a mystery rash now and then and we couldn’t figure out why, I mentioned it to my pharmacist who asked if i gave him cherry or grape Tylenol. Turns out, I kept the cherry Tylenol in the diaper bag and rarely used it. My son was allergic to the red dye. I’ve called them two other times, both late at night on a Sunday but I always preface it with … Look, I know you’re not a doctor and I’ve got a call into the pediatrician but this is what’s happening … is there any kind of otc remedy that might help until we get to the doctor. My point is, pharmacists spent years and years studying drugs and can be a valuable resource.
Thanks yeah that’s exactly what I did
National Library of Medicine is another resource: nlm.nih.gov 

I find them to be a little too technical, but it is a resource.

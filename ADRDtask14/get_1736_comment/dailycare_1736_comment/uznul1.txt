My mom has dementia and she does this.  My husband could be speaking to me and right in the middle of his sentence, she will interrupt and ask me a question.  Her dementia is severe and sometimes it is as if she is in another world (her mind is elsewhere), so when she interrupts, I believe it is because she's not listening to us and understanding that there is a conversation happening.
I haven’t heard of a correlation between dementia and interrupting, but I have heard of a correlation between hearing loss and a greater chance of developing dementia. 

In my grandma’s case, I noticed hearing loss and dementia developing at the same time. Her 1st hallucinations were auditory and then visual. 

She also gets mad at me when she’s listening to imaginary people and I’m the one interrupting. lol!!!  She says I need to get my hearing checked. :)
I would say it's both. The hearing loss is natural from age, but the response is individual. Some people withdraw and others become aggressive about being included and a few will accept hearing aids. They were too small and too high tech for my dad and I haven't solved this one for him. If she's losing rational thinking skills you may need to find a way to motivate her to using them.
My dad has hearing loss and gets massive build ups of wax in ears. 
If keeping track of hearing aids is an issue a quick fix is Apple AirPods and an iPhone on live listen,
His ears cleaned by the ent really makes a big difference for awhile
I should clarify that one on one conversations were not really interrupted, it would be me talking to the Drs, or a cashier, or others. Interrupting 3 or more people talking. I would still be able to finish talking unless it was one of those constant conversations we would have like the old "Who's on first?" routine.
My mom was always a talker (period), but now it’s almost constant! Understand.
With ME, no. wearing my hearing aids are not helpful because it has little to do with the cause.

i have over 200 friends living with dementia, and interruption is a common problem for ALL of us.  This is addressed at >> https://truthfulkindness.com/2021/01/31/fear-anger-dementia/
Following but I think it’s just my moms personality she’s done this to me since I was a kid and treats me like Cinderella get me this get me that my whole life 🤷🏼‍♀️
Yes my Dad would do it. I can sit here now and retrospect on his actions. Over many months I can see how he went from engaging strangers and joining conversations to being just a listener, to just being by himself or "clinging" to me during get togethers with the in-laws - as our side of the family (Dad's side) is from the Maritimes. The slow loss of memory, being able to hear something then respond with something. Then it's hearing something, taking a bit to understand but then the conversation has moved along so what you just understood is not relevant. Then it's not really understanding and just what's on your mind and since you can't recognize the pauses or stops in conversation you just blurt out whatever is on your mind. It's almost like getting older is getting younger again like when a 5 year old will interrupt - and I think that is just what happens with a shrinking brain.
Have you had her ears checked for wax build up? Might be helpful.
I and my Mum have always interrupted people a lot. I can now chalk this up to my ADHD, and now I know about this, and know it's somewhat hereditary, I see that my Mum has textbook ADHD too. Unfortunately the combination of ADHD and Alzheimer's isn't easy :-/
My dad has dementia and he interrupts all the time. He has no short term memory and has a hard time keeping up with what is being said. I try to just keep my answers very short and concise for this reason.
basically yes, it’s normal to lose that sense of politeness, etiquette, ability to remember taking turns and listening to what other people are saying about themselves instead of just thinking about yourself. Literally the part of the brain that lets you consider the position from another persons point of view, that shrinks. 

if she doesn’t wear the hearing aids, this will accelerate the dementia. If participate in conversation requires too much energy and focus, her brain will basically “check out” of ambient sounds and conversations happening around her, and weaken if not exercised: eventually her brain won’t be able to process that sound anymore even if she starts wearing hearing aids again.   

As it becomes more of a strain to talk to her; the speaker is required to repeat themselves multiple times; that person talk louder and shorter each time: they start leaving out details, nuance, social niceties, basically everything except shouting the basic information. 

Then she can’t exercise politeness, she becomes unpleasant to be around; people don’t hold conversation with her, discuss interesting topics and force her to exercise that muscle, so it deteriorates faster. It is really *use it or lose it*

Can you get the hearing aids checked at the audiologist? There may be a reason she avoids wearing them that she can’t articulate but is fixable. For my grandmother, she wasn’t wearing them because they made everything too loud! So the audiologist reduced the volume. still we had to start paying attention to when she WAS wearing hearing aids and speak softly then; whereas we had been almost shouting (not in like an angry way, more like an outdoor summer camp counselor talking-to-group voice)  by default as a habit just to get pragmatic information across

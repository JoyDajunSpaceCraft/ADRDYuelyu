That sounds tough, so sorry!  Have you contacted Alzheimers org (800.272.3900, or similar org for your country) perhaps they might have some ideas..?  I'm in southern hemisphere, so, don't have any info for your country.   best of luck!
I’m not very far into this journey, so I don’t have great advice for you. However, I would reconsider your last sentence. Medicaid shouldn’t be considered a last resort. Medicaid should be considered. It really should. Does she qualify? Have your parents set up an irrevocable trust to help them qualify? It would have been great to see a lawyer specializing in Elder Law as soon as they saw signs of dementia or as soon as she was diagnosed, but today is better than nothing.

Have you considered a 'talking clock' or a 'talking watch' for your dad?  There are many devices for people who cannot see that can tell him the date, day, time etc. by mere touch.  In either case, I'd look at websites that help blind people.

PS  Good luck with your dad by the way, this is a difficult thing.

edit:  Something like what's below? 

Please note I have no experience with this web site, just wanted to give you an idea.

[talking calendar watch](http://www.braillebookstore.com/Talking-Calendar-Watch.1)
First Street may be the place you need to go. [I found this watch](http://www.firststreetonline.com/Electronics+amp+Gadgets/Clocks+amp+Watches/Large+Display+Touchscreen+Watch.axd) But they have a [whole bunch of other choices](http://gift-ideas.firststreetonline.com/search?w=watch) 

Let us know if you find a good one.
I believe there is a pretty good one out there call digiclox.

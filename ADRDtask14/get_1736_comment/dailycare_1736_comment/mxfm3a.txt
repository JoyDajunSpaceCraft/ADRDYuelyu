Talk to her doctor. My mother was the same. Up all hours wondering around. I was exhausted. They put her on seroquel. I give it to her at 7 she’s in bed and asleep by 9. It’s also helped her be more alert
Do you live in a area where you can get medical marijuana? It's much stronger than cbd. Ask her doctor first.
sleep is a VERY common problem for us with dementia.

Personally, going without nap intensifies my insomnia -- i become too tired to sleep and i will AVERAGE 3 hrs sleep per night.  

Personally we ended needing me to find meds, >> [https://truthfulkindness.com/about/life-other/med/medications-4sx/](https://truthfulkindness.com/about/life-other/med/medications-4sx/) .
We did this as well. It’s so frustrating and exhausting for caregivers that it’s easy to forget the LO is always miserable. Sometimes medicine is needed. We started with a tiny dose. She needed a bit more, but is still on a very low dose. Good luck.
Thanks, it’s good to know that someone has experience with this
Yes! And even just obtaining CBD that has 1% THC in it can change the shape of the CBD molecule to better fit and cling onto the brain receptor. This can be huge for having CBD feel like it’s working. “Full spectrum” is a good phrase to ask about or look for.
Yes. My mom does not sit still. I just had to put a door on my kitchen. She’s drawn to dishes and cookware. Rearranging everything and washing it. No kidding she gets up about 5 times an hour and goes to the door and try’s to open it. It’s rough on me to see her act this way. But I know she has no recollection of her actions. Once in a while I’ll get a glimpse of my mom. But it’s getting further and further between them.
She lives in Curaçao so it’s a bit challenging. I am planning on growing some for personal use and will look into also growing a CBD plant with low thc for mom. The current CBD oil we are using is full spectrum though
My mother isn’t very mobile right now, but we have hand towels for her to fold and other “jobs” to keep her busy. Could you gather utensils for her to sort or something related to dishes?  It’s so hard keeping them busy. Good luck.
That’s the funny thing about dementia. If I give her a task she will absolutely ignore you. She’s also had a stroke recently so that has left her with considerable cognitive deficits. The physical mobility bounced right back, the mind deteriorated.

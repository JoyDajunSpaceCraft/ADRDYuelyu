U.S. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska [drafted legislation aimed to prevent these discriminatory protocols.](https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/new-bill-attempts-to-ensure-people-with-disabilities-get-equal-ventilator-access/) His announcement of the bill cited our[ ](https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/state-policies-may-send-people-with-disabilities-to-the-back-of-the-line-for-ventilators/)report, saying “A just society is measured by how we treat the most vulnerable, and now is the time for Congress to step up.” You can learn more here: [https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/new-bill-attempts-to-ensure-people-with-disabilities-get-equal-ventilator-access/](https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/new-bill-attempts-to-ensure-people-with-disabilities-get-equal-ventilator-access/)

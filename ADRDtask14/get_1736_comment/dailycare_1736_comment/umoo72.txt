It could be as simple as him not putting value on those things. He may also have something like ADD.
Did he contract Covid by any chance?
Dementia is so much more than forgetting your keys and remembering them 10 seconds later.. it's more like forgetting what your keys are for or that you even need to take your keys at all..keys...why are they useful? Not to mention the confusion, the lack of executive function (which for many is way more prominent than memory issues), depression, social issues (aggression), some have psychosis, gait issues, anorexia, trouble with ADLs and more. Dementia is not a single disease but a terminology used for a collection of diseases.
No. Not covid related

I'm not a professional in this field, but have worked in a facility that is focused on providing care for those with dementia/Alzheimer's. When I am faced with this kind of situation during conversation with a client, I find it can be helpful to simply make conversation of the info they can give. 
Like your example "the second shift nurse from last night found something wrong it was ....." could be followed up with a remark or question like "oh dear they found something wrong? Are you okay?" 
Or "I hope everything is okay." 
It can take some creativity to work with what you get but doing this can help the client track better and make visiting more enjoyable for both parties.

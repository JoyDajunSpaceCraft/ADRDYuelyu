 ... so sorry and it sucks being in that situation.  Have you tried to see locally what is available for your mom ... even some "temporary" even if it's just a few hours, going out and meeting somebody as well that makes you happy might help.  I'm going through the same with my mom in terms of paying for her care/home and fronting all the cost, my mom hardly recognizes me as well but (knock on wood) she still has her smile so to answer your question of what keeps me going ... it's that.
I can leave her during the day for couple hours. That how I run errands and go to gym. 
She’d just walk slowly around replacing things, like putting glasses into pillowcase. Nobody visits anymore. People avoid us cause dealing with us makes them sad.
It sounds like you are suffering from depression, which is understandable considering your situation. Do you have mental healthcare available in your country?
I don’t have any advice to give but I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Sending virtual hugs your way.
No, unfortunately
Jesus, that breaks my heart. If you need to talk please please please PM me.
I’ve experienced that a lot with my mom too, people avoiding her because it makes them “too sad.” It’s heartbreaking. Sending you lots of virtual strength - you’re not alone.
Thank you

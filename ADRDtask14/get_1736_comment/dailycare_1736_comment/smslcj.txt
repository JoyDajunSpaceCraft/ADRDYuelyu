Get references and check them. Including people or the families of people they took care of before.
If you're in the US, check out [care.com](https://care.com). It's a popular site to hire private caregivers and they take care of background checks if the caregiver agrees. I've used them and so have other people I've met in my support group. The bigger headache with hiring private is withholding and paying taxes. This takes time and work and that's why some people feel it's worth it to hire an agency instead.
Get a rent application to see how consent for a 'credit check' is done.  But you may need an agency to process a credit check.  Or, sit beside them and get them to do their own credit report online while you watch (& offer to reimburse them for the online fee, vs the free approach which takes weeks by snail mail).

eg. Equifax & TransUnion & some other outfit I've forgotten.

Credit checks can provide invaluable background about someone.

And then, there are 'criminal record checks', typically done through your local police station for you, I think.  You certainly don't want to expose your loved one to a criminal, right?  Doubtless there'll be a fee, ought to be reasonable, though.  Could take days or weeks for them to get around to it.

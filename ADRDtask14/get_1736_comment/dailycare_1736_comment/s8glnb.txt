It may not be dementia. There are mimic conditions that are curable, deleriums, that could be the cause; medication, infection, nutrient deficits, etc.
I wish I knew the answer. When you are able to see the neurologist, you could bring this up. Also, could you note on the calendar her changes, and then share this info as well? Good luck 🍀
Is she eating enough? I’ve noticed my aunt gets really, really bad on days when she hasn’t had enough to eat. Yes, we give her plenty of choices but she just wasn’t hungry and didn’t eat.

Took her to a doctor, he gave her an antidepressant that also increases her appetite. This is all still very new but on days that I’ve been able to get her to eat a lot, she’s (almost) like her old self. On days when I can’t get her to eat much at all (even ice cream or apple pie): she has trouble remembering and putting a sentence together. The difference is striking 

She has always preferred sweets and desserts. I specifically asked the doctor and he says he doesn’t really care what she eats, he just wants more calories right now.  (She also drinks 30g protein drinks and takes prenatal vitamins). 

Her next appointment is in 3 weeks. Hopefully, I can get her to gain at least 5 pounds.  

Any chance your mum isn’t eating enough on her bad days?

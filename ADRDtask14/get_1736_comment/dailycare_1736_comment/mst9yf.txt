Definitely bring pictures of her with various family members.
You want to set up the room to feel familiar.  A favorite chair, her usual bedcover, a lamp that's been on her bedside for the past 30 years- things like that.
Take pictures of things that mean the most of her and put them in a photo album..
Her books, if she's an avid reader.  Continue to have her magazines and newspapers delivered to her.
For my mom's smaller decorative items and seasonal clothes, I have several tub totes of her things that I keep at my house and I will rotate some of the items out.   One thing that did surprise me was how once my mother was moved in she wanted me to take lots of things back as she felt overwhelmed by too much visually.  We also bought a lower, long tote that slides under her bed that holds extra items so she can rotate some items on her own but it is out of sight so it is not stressful.
My mom had her crochet supplies and yarn.   She was always making scarfs for the aides and they LOVED them.  If there is a particular hobby mom has, try to bring it so she can occupy her time in the fun way that she knows.   And yes,  photos photos photos.
You could bring some important pieces of jewellery with her, if she has any.
Yes to photos and meaningful objects.  For my mom we told her that the bulk of her things were ‘in storage’....so she’s knows they’re still there!
You might try a digital picture frame that can rotate through a lot of pictures.
These are some of MY strategies >>  [https://truthfulkindness.com/2021/03/07/to-go-home/](https://truthfulkindness.com/2021/03/07/to-go-home/) ;
Thank you; we’re also going to grab every picture of our dad we can find and paper the walls with them.  She no longer remembers his name but does remember “my husband”.
Looks like I’ll be making a new album - one with family pics and one with things that are meaningful.  Thank you!
This is a great idea;  I should have mentioned that she has macular degeneration and can no longer read.  I bring her magazines with pretty pictures but she won’t pick them up any more.  Really, really sad, because she used to love reading and magazines.
Great idea!
Thank you!
Framed photos of the things that are most important can be remarkable mementos that take up very little space.  A "picture wall" maybe?

Maybe a tape player and a subscription to the library's audiobook program might be interesting.

Iâ€™d say you need to talk to a lawyer.
Is the bill supposed to be for taxes? Because if your mom's not on the mortgage she shouldn't be responsible for paying on the house itself. But I can see her being on the hook for taxes that hadn't been paid is she is on the deed. 

I agree to check with a lawyer.

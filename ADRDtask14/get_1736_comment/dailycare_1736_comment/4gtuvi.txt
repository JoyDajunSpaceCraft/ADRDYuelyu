I think that's brilliant. My granny would have been able to live on her own A LOT longer with something like this. I would have bought it without hesitation no matter the price.

Being able to do things inside the house remotely would be amazing. Like turning the oven off, being able to adjust the temperature too. 

How about an intercom?

My granny was always confused on how to use a cell phone and would always loose them. I would have loved to be able to talk to her or have her talk to me with just the push of a button. 

I love your idea and if I was rich I would give you lots of money to help this become a reality.

As soon as my granny was moved into a home she changed and hasn't been the same since. Freedom and independence is so important, IMHO. This sounds amazing.

Her favorite song is "Don't fence me in." ðŸ’–
I have worked with persons with Alzheimer's and other Dementia's for 28 years. Anything to add a level of safety is brilliant. A community that has 24 hour staff and peers to interact with is a best choice, as it allows the family primary caregiver/spouse/child to become the loved one again and provides a better quality of life for all. This isn't always possible primarily due to finances. Average income for those 65+ is $24,000 annually and the average cost for care is conservatively $72,000 annually.

I recommend contacting a caregiver company, like Homewatch Caregivers, Visiting Angels, etc. When dealing with them, just say you want someone who can speak Tagalog. It is more expensive than doing it yourself, but they do all the training and resume searching for you.
Why a Filipina, out of curiosity?
my mother is Filipina and speaks Tagalog

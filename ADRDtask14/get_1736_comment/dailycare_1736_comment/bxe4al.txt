Iâ€™ve been told by my consultant that the only way to be 100% sure is to have a brain scan... which incidentally revealed that my Dad had a stroke 6 months prior which we had NO idea about!!
I starts out with a brain scan and cognitive testing. If there seems to be a chance, only then will they advance to a lumbar puncture which is currently the most conclusive way for diagnosis I think.

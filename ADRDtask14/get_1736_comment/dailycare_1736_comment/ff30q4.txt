Checkout life360. I haven't used it but it gets brought up on parenting subs a lot. It looks like you can location share recent and current location as well as receive alerts about low battery.
Ditto on life 360. Until my relative could not go anywhere on his own we used it to track him to the library and back. Very good service.
Thanks looks like it has a trial so I'll give that a shot.

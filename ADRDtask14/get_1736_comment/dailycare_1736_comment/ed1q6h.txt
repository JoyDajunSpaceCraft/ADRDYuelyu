Bless you for doing the job no one wants to do...just came to say that.
Keep letting him ride the bus.  They know him and will watch out for him, call the proper authorities in an emergency.  Perhaps get him a  dog tag necklace with your information in it.  Does he qualify for a government cellphone plan?  Good luck to you and don't feel guilty
Interesting way to grow up, isn’t it ;) It’s kind of you to have helped him, in the end, after everything. Yeah, I left my dad to his own devices for years - what else could I do, he wouldn’t listen to me - and now it is what it is. It is a burden, some days more than others, at the same time I can’t imagine him not around. I have great days with him too, it’s just frustrating that I can’t help him the way I’d like to. If I made it my business to entertain him and keep him from loneliness, I mean that’s what I’d do all day every day. I don’t have the space for him and can’t afford to move somewhere bigger. That aside He’d drive me freaking nuts living with him... idk what to do tbh.
Thank you... I could do better. The day I wrote my post, I was just pretty frustrated that things are the way they are. I wish I could afford to live closer to him and check in on him more regularly. I wish I had a car so I could pick him up when he’s lost, or take him to the community centre instead of guiding him through busses. Of course, and I know it’s fruitless, sometimes I just wish he weren’t sick.

I'm so sorry to hear that your mother is having such a hard time.  <3

Is your father going to appointments and hearing this from the doctor?  Many people feel awful about "withholding food" because they feel like they are "killing" their loved one.  What does he do if the food is offered, but she doesn't eat any of it?  Would he be okay with blending some of the food?

With her new timeline, has hospice been considered?  They would help your father move away from this behavior.

Yes, he hears it straight from the doctors mouth, but he doesn’t get it. Part of it is he eats from a tube in his stomach, for about 10 years now so i think his mindset is “if i could eat, i would never skip a meal.” When she doesn’t eat it he will sit there and spoon feed her till she eats it. Sometimes i have to dump out her food just so he won’t shovel it down her throat. Hospice has been considered, just not yet. 
If he won't listen, I would do a lot more dumping and telling him that she had her snack while he was out or laying down.  You could try to have home instruction on feeding her, but it may cause more conflict than it's worth.

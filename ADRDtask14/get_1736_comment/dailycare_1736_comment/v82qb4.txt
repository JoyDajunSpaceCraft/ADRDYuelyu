He might also beginning to have dementia. Paranoia and changes in temperament or mood can be symptoms as well as becoming forgetful. If you can encourage checkups with neurocognitive screenings (this is supposed to happen during annual exams for Medicare patients but doesn’t always), I would start there. If you need to do more, you can call about elder abuse. If this man tries to kick your mom out of the house, she has legal rights as a tenant, even if she doesn’t own it or pay rent. You can call elder abuse about that or an attorney to fight an eviction.
It sounds like they have a very long history together.  Other than the recent fighting, you haven't written about any concerning traits.  Old couples can bicker.  My parents are horrible, and if I didn't know them, it would sound concerning.  But I've come to realize that it's how they communicate, and it all blows over in like five minutes.  My dad, we suspect, has dementia.  Mom at first was reluctant to work around that, and still expected basic things from him (which is probably good for him), but they've settled in to their routine, and she's taking care of him.

You've not given any information to suggest why your mother's man would kick her out, or that he wouldn't be accommodating and supportive with her forgetfulness.  Have you had a conversation with him to see what he's thinking?  How can you help him help her?

I'm sorry if I 'm missing something.  You're good to look out for your mother and to be concerned.

Try a Road ID. They have different styles including a silicone band similar to the old Livestrong bracelets (but stronger) and a nylon band. You can get 4 lines of info engraved. I wear my silicone band all the time since I cycle and ride a scooter most days of the week. https://www.roadid.com/

Second the Road ID. I have one because I'm a cyclist, and diabetic.

In addition to the band, for $10 a year you can link it to their database and enter pertinent medical information. First responders enter the serial number on the band to get the info.

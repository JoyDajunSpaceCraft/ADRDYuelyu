Do you think he could operate a Wii with Wii sports?
The oculus quest virtual reality system.  Whether it helps depends on what stage he's at though.

There is a mini golf game.  It doesn't feel exactly like real golfing but it's as close as you can get while not having to walk around to do it.

He can go kayaking and ice climbing just sitting on the floor or chair.  Visit old cities he's been to.  I guess some seniors are moved to tears when they visit their childhood homes they haven't been to in ages.

Socialize with more people and spend more time with you or loved ones if thry had a headset too.  Increases "visits" as you don't have to drive there to do it.

Recent studies suggest VR may be good for pain relief and depression.

The downside is that it's not good for certain dementia people.  Like if they are at a point where they forget where they are and suddenly find themselves inside a virtual world and become scared cause everything looks like a cartoon.  

  Play when sitting down on a couch or floor, not in a wheelchair or standing at this point in his physical health.  It's cause you sometimes forget you can't lean on that ping pong table or rock and then you fall over.  Falling is never good for the elderly so avoid it by playing seated or just propped up on the center of a bed.
I posted this same question and lots of people have recommended it - I think its worth trying!

Any game suggestions?
I think the general wii sports or Wii sports resort. Wii sports resort has things like table tennis and bowling. Wii sports I think has baseball, golf, and basketball.  I would look at pawn shops for the games and for an original Wii console.

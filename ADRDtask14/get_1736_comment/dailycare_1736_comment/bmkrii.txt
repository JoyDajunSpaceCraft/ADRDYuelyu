I would be interested!
I'm an RN that has worked in geriatrics for over 25 years.  I'd love to help out if you ever needed it.
I would be interested as well.
I would be very interested in this.
Thank you for this kind redditor!
Hi, that's amazing. I'd love to get your perspective if you're free to chat. I'm trying to understand how we might build something for care providers and social services teams as well.

Why not chat with the rest of the family and see if they have noticed anything different about her?  Memory lapses are not unusual in someone who is 79, doesn't mean they have a "mental decline." Changes are going to happen as we age.  If the rest of the family have noted changes then you can discuss the next steps. I don't think there is a reason to "confront" her or talk to her doctor just yet.  While you are talking to the rest of the family probably a good idea to talk about who in the family will have a health care and financial POA for her.

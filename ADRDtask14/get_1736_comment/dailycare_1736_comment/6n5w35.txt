Look up fidget blankets or fidget quilts. They're available for a wide range or prices or, if you or anyone you know is crafty, there are lots of patterns available to DIY.

Completely understand. How about trying a simple jigsaw? If you put it on a table in front of him. I find it helps if you start it off together, then hopefully he will start trying to do it. Or maybe something like this for him to try and assemble? (see Amazon link below) It came up under 3D kids jigsaws on Amazon and it's not expensive at all. In my experience it's always better if I ask them to help me work on this, kind of pretend it's something you're trying to do and ask if they would help. If I can think of any other ideas I will definitely let you know! 

Also, try to keep a full glass of water in front of him at all times, I hear it's so important for people with this illness to keep hydrated and was given this advice.

My Mom who has Alzheimer's folds towels at the nursing home. Try to find something he might have done to occupy his hands.

Tips to engage your elderly parents.
1) Encourage them to listen the audiobooks
2) Offer selections of their favorite music to keep brain cells stimulated
3) Encourage elders to engage in exercise classes or day trips sponsored by community park and recreation departments
4) Suggest your parents purchase a pet: it can be a cat, dog, bird, fish, turtle or hamster (limit pets to those your parents are capable of caring for)
5)Encourage your parents to volunteer in various community activities or programs
Yes.  Stacks of tissues everywhere.  And little reserve bundles of tissues stashed in every drawer, between sofa cushions, tucked into sudoku books....  Just everywhere.  Don't understand it, but it must provide some comfort.

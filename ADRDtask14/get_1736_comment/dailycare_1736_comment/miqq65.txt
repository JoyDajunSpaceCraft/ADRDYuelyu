 Unfortunately it's your mom that has to decide. No one should have to put their life on hold. Life happens. If we live long enough we will likely need someone to care for us. I personally would rather a professional that does it for a living/job than expect someone to stop their life for me. I'd rather keep my personal relationships with family on a good emotional level. It's a tough situation regardless. There is nothing easy about it and it will be an emotional roller coaster, to say the least.

 Good luck to you and your mother. Best wishes for all of you.

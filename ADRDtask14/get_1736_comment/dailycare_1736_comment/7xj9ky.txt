This one's easy - just about anything will be a welcome source of encouragement. "Thinking of you" / "Wish we were closer" / "We love you and hope to see you all soon" are simple and ordinary sentiments but exactly what's needed right now. Something bright and cheery - not a sympathy card (yet!), nothing too silly, just something earnest and serene and light. Include some highlights from what's going on in your lives right now.
You know, I'd get on the phone and let her talk.
Sending a cheerful note- about anything, really, is kind.    Even a postcard can brighten up her day.   
Any small bit of positive news about your boyfriend would be welcome- "We went hiking park we had never been to before" or "he cooked something the other night that he said was a family favorite" would make her day.  Ask your boyfriend more about her so to make your notes more personal.

Caregivers have a hard time of it and a bit of love sent their way makes all the difference.
I definitely didn't plan on a sympathy letter. I don't want to say anything that would make her sad due to the circumstances, so I figured asking is the best way to possible to avoid things that may seem sincere but could also trigger her. Thank you for the help, I appreciate it. :)
Unfortunately, I've only met her a couple of times so I'm not quite ready for the phone call stage yet. I hope to get to that one day. I figured start with the baby steps, but I appreciate the advice. So thank you! 
I never thought of a possible postcard. It definitely gives me more ideas now. Thank you for the advice!

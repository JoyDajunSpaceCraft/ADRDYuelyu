If she won't cooperate, there isn't much you can do before she reaches the point where you can have her declared incompetent.  If she is assaulting you, you may have to press the point.  I would suggest that you speak with your doctor and ask for advice.
Talk to a lawyer who specializes in elder power of attorney.  We went through this with a parent. There are pretty clear laws on the books about this. Try social services too. Good luck. 
If she won't talk to a Dr. about it, you must - and keep trying until you find someone who actually listens to you. Find a specialist in geriatric neurology or geriatric neuropsychiatry and get help. Document the incidents of strange behavior (keep a journal) and also document whom you've contacted and the outcome (appointments, referrals, no ideas, recommendations, etc .)

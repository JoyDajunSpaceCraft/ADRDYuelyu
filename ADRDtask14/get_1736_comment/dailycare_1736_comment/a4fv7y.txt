Thanks you for that, and for what you do.
The times we have been blessed with a sitter have made so much difference for me.  Getting a decent night's sleep makes an incredible difference in my ability to care for my child and cope with the challenges of her care.  

Thank you for the work you do.  
Can you say what a hospital sitter does? Is this something provided by the hospital usually?
Thank you and warm wishes to all the care givers and medical staff out there. 
My job is to sit with patients, report on any changes in their behaviors, and help keep them comfortable in a non-clinical areas.  You would have to check with hospital policy.
Thanks for the explanation!

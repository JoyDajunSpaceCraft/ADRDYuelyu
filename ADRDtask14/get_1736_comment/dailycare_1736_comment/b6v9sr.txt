So very glad things worked out! Thank you for the update, they are rare, and I do love them so very very much.
Oh, lord. This is making me bawl like a baby.
What you have done for your father is invaluable. I hope you feel very proud of yourself for being so brave and compassionate, for making this happen for him. It is a grand gesture of love. 
My love to you both. 
I can not be more impressed with you.  You are a hero for doing this for him.  I hope this time is a blessing for him and for you as well.  <3
Thank you! And God bless.
You are a braver man than I. I am so glad you made the trip. You should be proud that you have granted him his last wish. Great job!
Your words are very kind. Honestly I feel hollow. I just left him to die on the other side of the world. He’s not alone, he has a big community, and it’s what he wanted, but it is a strange a thing to do, and a hard feeling to live with.

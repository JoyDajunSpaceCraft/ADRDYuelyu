My mom has become obsessed with trees.
I know that being out in nature can really help people with anxiety and depression, so it helping him stay calm makes sense. I can imagine that the soft quiet of being outside in the woods vs the constant drone of "busy" in the city would have marked differences in how a person's brain reacts, and in the case of dementia where the brain is experiencing things very differently, that "soft quiet" would be a relief. So great that you've noticed this!
Did she have a lot of trees in her life before or is it a recently developed interest?
Itâ€™s a recent thing.

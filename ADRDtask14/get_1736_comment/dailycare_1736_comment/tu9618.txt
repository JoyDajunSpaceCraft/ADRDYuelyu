Go get lightweight houseboats that snap all the way down the front instead of nightgowns she has to pull over her head.
Try a poise pad inside a Depends at night to hopefully contain leaks. Some people even use double Depends. I only change the shirt every other day unless it gets dirty and I let him sleep in it too. The same thing with pants but I do switch out underwear. I choose clothes that will be comfortable for sleeping in too. If you can learn quick ways to get clothes on and off that don't hurt her, it's best to just do it yourself now that she's at the stage that she can't help. For painful shoulders with poor range of motion, I learned to do "Arm, Head, Arm" to get on shirts. (NOT Arm, Arm, Head, or anything else.) It's quick and doesn't require certain painful shoulder movements. Also, stretchy clothing material helps. Rather than it being an attitude issue, remind yourself that she literally doesn't know the steps for getting dressed anymore and that she's just confused in general. And that old people often hurt all over and are frequently cold. This makes changing clothes undesirable and unpleasant.
She doesn't have an attitude just an inability to remember how to do things.  Seems so simple for us but so difficult for them. Maybe a dressing gown which buttons or zips up so you can undo and it drops to the floor?  Maybe use pull ups and unfasten (or tear) from the sides so those drop to the floor also?  Sometimes we just have to keep doing more as they are unable to take care of themselves.
Oh trust me she has an attitude. She has been a passive aggressive woman her whole life and could be very confrontational. That is definitely part of her deep down. 

But I will discuss maybe trying her in a different night gown.

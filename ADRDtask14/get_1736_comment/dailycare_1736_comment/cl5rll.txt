There is no sure fire cure.  They are angry, hot, bored, in pain and often know they are dying; not the most pleasant of circumstances.

If you are the only one doing this, you take the brunt of their wrath.  Sometimes placating them will work, sometimes distraction will work and you can also try disengagement.  Just leave the room.  

Yeah, just leave the room.  As long as they are not in pain and there is no blood on the floor, they often (no, not always) will calm down in the next 10 minutes.
My wife has a brain injury and her symptoms are at times similar. I find my best practice to be distraction by bringing their attention to something else. Change the subject. Never argue. Short term memory is your friend in these situations. One example is offering a snack or dessert that she likes. This works for me.
Try finding ten little tasks that either he or the two of you can do together.

-write the names and dates on the back of old photos so you know who is who ... while letting him reminiscence a bit.

-go through that drawer in the kitchen that everyone has where we throw old car keys and stuff.

-go through some old correspondence and up date the phone/address book

-if he can still see to read, get him a tablet where he (you) can download new books.  Tablets are great because you can set them for extra-extra large print

-get out the newspaper, turn to the tv section and pick out some movie the two of you can watch later

-there must be some box in the basement that you can bring up to root through and have him tell you what is  what.

That sort of thing isn't a distraction, and isn't a 'you're a problem' ... its  an I need some help from YOU!  

Sometimes the best distraction is 'your needing help!'
Hi. Your nurse hit the nail on the head. I literally use the bait and switch all the time.  "I'm hot" I usually come back with something along the lines of "Oh it's pretty warm in here, I'm hot too, here let me turn up the AC, fan and that'll cool us down"  


Since you didn't mention things he gets upset about, I can't give you a reply I use.  But as a tid bit I usually try to sympathize with them, even if I'm not actually feeling what they are. "My leg hurts"  "oh you know what, my leg also hurt last week, this is what I did to fix it >insert ice, icey hot rub, pillow under knee, etc< here that should work!"  


You just have to be sneaky with the distraction. It becomes easier the more you do it.

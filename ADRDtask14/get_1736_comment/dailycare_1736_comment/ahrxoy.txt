You can recommend she go to a doc without bringing up Alzheimer's at all. People can go to doc just for piece of mind. You got a weird mole? Get it checked out.. to confirm cancer or eliminate it so you can stop worrying about it.

Dementia and confusion are different things, and it would be good to have a clinician help you identify whats up. Even if it is dementia, the cause might not be Alzheimer's; it could be reversible. Some causes you might be able to halt, but not reverse though, so the sooner you guys get it checked out, the better. 

Good luck. 
Also note that depression and anxiety (with the latter perhaps being most relevant in this case) can cause inattentiveness, forgetfulness, and disassociation. This may absolutely simply be a case of anxiety, and it's not uncommon for middle-aged women to develop anxiety disorders.

This is just a thought. And simply asking her if she has anxiety may not be enough, especially if she hasn't had anxiety in the past. Sometimes it's difficult to know yourself, whether you suffer from anxiety. Seeing a doctor would be a good idea in any case if the described "symptoms" are causing concern.

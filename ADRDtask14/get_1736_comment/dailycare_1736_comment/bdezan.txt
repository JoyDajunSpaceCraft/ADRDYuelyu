I'm way older than you but like yourself I'm doing similar work.
It's hard but the thing that keeps me going is knowing I'm making a difference in peoples' lives.  
See if your facility has a Employee counselling service plus you are going through grief, your personal grief because of your dog and you can't help but be emotionally involved with your clients.
Make sure you get some grief support.
If in a few months it doesn't let up or you get worse you may need to put your mental health first and find new work.
It is amazing what you are doing at such a young age. I work part time as a caregiver for an assisted living facility and it is draining to say the least. I've seen some people not be able to handle the death of residents and eventually quit. Most, me included, seem to accept that it comes with the nature of the work. The passing of the first few residents was hard, got a little easier after that.

I tell myself to focus on serving the residents during my time and their time there and that's all that we can do as caregivers.

As for your back, I'd definitely be cautious. Once your back goes, it's a forever ailment. Be careful and take care of yourself. I won't do anything on my own w/o help if I sense that my back will get affected by the task.
thank you guys for the advice!
I agree. Also, just in general care for your own mental health. That fact is not related to the kind of work you do, but can have a big impact on it. “It’s hard to care for others if you aren’t caring for yourself”. 

See a doctor about your back. Consider taking a training on proper lifting techniques and using physics to do most of the work (when you can.) 

Burn out is real, and it’s a hard job. We can’t change that. But we can shape our lives to be better to ourselves and others.

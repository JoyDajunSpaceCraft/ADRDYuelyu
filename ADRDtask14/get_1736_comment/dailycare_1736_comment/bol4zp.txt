I feel like you should tell your parents. It might seem easier to just hide it, but consider how they would react if, with time, they realised how it has undermined you. 
You are right, no matter what people tell you, the feeling might always remain. But it's never too much to say "it's not your fault". 
Seek help, if you need it, just someone that you can talk to. A friend, a parent, a professional, or just a random guy you met on Reddit.

Getting someone declared legally incompetent against their will is incredibly difficult, emotionally draining and expensive.  The best way to approach this is if you can convince your parents to do some estate planning and set up living wills and springing powers of attorney.  Otherwise, there is little you can do; courts are reluctant to strip people of their autonomy. 
Hello,

I'm sorry to hear about this--it's very unfortunate and upsetting.

&#x200B;

First, make sure you take care of your own needs--as it can be very overwhelming to tend to another person, especially if your efforts are not appreciated.

&#x200B;

Second, begin by asking him about his preferences, the sorts of things he enjoys in life. If it's listening to The Beatles, than listen to them with him. Build rapport and trust--don't go in with an "agenda"

&#x200B;

Third, don't argue with him. His demential will likely worsen, and his rational capacities will decline. Arguing is futile. Listen patiently, and decipher the messages that he's trying to send. For example, if a man with dementia keeps asking when his wife will return from the grocery store (even though she passed away 5 years ago), don't try to convince him that she's dead--simply interpret his question as a desire to see his wife and respond empathically with, "you miss her, don't you?" In your situation, he might very well know he has dementia--and denial is a coping strategy. Suggest alternative coping strategies, but without direct demands or passive aggression.

&#x200B;

Fourth, consult with behavioural interventionists--they'll have the know-how to deal with the behavioural challenges of late-stage dementia patients. Try to give him home care as long as possible before you consider institutionalization--emotional distress increases exponentially in an institution.

&#x200B;

But again, your health and well-being is paramount, as you  may be one of the few who could actually help him. Be strategic with your resources, whether they be financial, emotional or temporal.

Take care,

Matthew

I tried for a year and a half to get a diagnosis.  What finally happened was he got sick and I took him to the ER.  They admitted him for observation, and eventually diagnosed him with advanced dementia.  If all else fails, try to get him to the ER.
that's a wonderful idea, thank you very much
I will keep that in mind, it's a good idea

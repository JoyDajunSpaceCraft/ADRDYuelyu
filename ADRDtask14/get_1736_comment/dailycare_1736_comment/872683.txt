I think it would be a good idea, but from what I've read you have to be able to show informed consent and be capable of making decisions and with dementia that is a problem.  You could get assisted suicide with a cancer diagnosis, for example, but not dementia (in the places that allow it).  This needs to change and some advance directive should be allowed for dementia. The best you could do in advance is have a 'DNR' (do not resuscitate) on a healthcare directive.   I didn't know about the Netherlands though.
Where do you live? I think the Netherlands is the only place that allows euthanasia for dementia patients.
If you're in the U.S., in any jurisdiction you're opening the person who assists you to homicide charges. 
A friend's mother, in a US state where assisted suicide is *not* legal, committed suicide.

[The Hemlock Society](http://www.finalexitnetwork.org/About-Us.html) is a good place to start with figuring out what you need to know and plan for.

I'm following the same line of thought - Even though I don't have reason to believe I'm at an particular risk, what with the rising rate of dementia, it doesn't make sense to me to not consider and plan for what I'd want to do if I do find I've started down that path...
The United States. I know Canada will let non-citizens be euthanized, does the Netherlands allow that as well?
Apparently they require a "well documented relationship between the doctor and patient".

Idk, maybe if you established care over there...
Is this true!? Canada has a place you can go, as a foreigner, to be willingly euthanized? That seems crazy.
Thank you, for your insight.

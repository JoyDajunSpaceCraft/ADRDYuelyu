I have no suggestions, unless you can get a tracker for them. I don't know how you'd do that, though. It's tough ... my grandmother lost both her glasses and her hearing aids. So did my father in law. I think it's just an unfortunate part of someone with memory issues living in a care home. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news ... .
My dad has this problem. I started getting cheaper glasses from Warby Parker.
My mom is in assisted living, and most of what she reported as lost or stolen eventually turns up hidden in her room.
Hello! At the facility that I work at - all of the residents eye glasses are labeled and collected by the nurses each night before bed and placed in a labeled tray locked in the cupboard. I’ve never seen a resident lose glasses.
I wonder if she could get used to that. I’m just concerned she may lie down to sleep with them still around her neck.
Misery loves company. ;)
We dig through mom’s room, but she is pretty good at hiding stuff in pockets and such!  And almost every week we bring clothes out of mom’s room that are not hers. 

I have to wonder if other residents don’t have family who sort through their rooms regularly that some of mom’s stuff could be hidden in their room. I understand it’s the nature of the disease, but dang eye glasses are expensive. I’m going to have to look in to ordering some online.

It is an option to have the eye glasses collected at night but she has even lost them during the day.

People afflicted with dementia will often fixate on something(s). In the case of my mom, it's washing her hands and paper products (napkins, paper towels, etc.). She'll literally want to thoroughly wash her hands 30 seconds after she's done something like clearing a plate, and will stash away napkins and tissues in her purse. She'll also insistently offer napkins that I've brought her to others, most frequently at weekly church events.  It's annoying as hell, but just how it is, and we just have to make the decision to accept that this is their reality and to accommodate it as long as it doesn't pose a threat to their well-being..

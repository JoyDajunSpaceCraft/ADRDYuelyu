Mine now thinks her male caregiver is her boyfriend! She tells me how he cooks for her, washes her hair, cleans her nails, he's SUCH a good boyfriend!  

Maybe you could bring a caregiver in as a "friend of yours" for the first handful of visits and then the friend becomes "her friend" and visits without you.... that kind of thing... until eventually s/he's able to caregive without her even realizing it.
Without humor, I would go nuts some days for sure!!
Keeping your sense of humor, even if you are the only one who gets it, will help to keep you sane!
Wow, I'm going through this very thing right now with my father. Although I'm the one that's the primary caregiver and desperately trying to extract myself from the situation. What's the next step? How are you going to approach it? I've had several discussions with my dad so far and the recommendation of his personal physician has helped a little bit. Still, he balks at whether he really needs someone around all the time and the cost -- it's not going to be free and he's paying. ;-) I've been free to this point but that's got to end.
Longtime nurse and recent caregiver for my mom here.  

What finally worked for me was the angle of "What if I get sick or hurt?  Who would take care of us?"
That’s a great idea, thanks for the suggestion! And that’s funny that your LO thinks her caregiver is her boyfriend. It’s good that she’s happy with him!
I know, right?
Yes, exactly!
Someone in my dad’s support group suggested dealing with the cost issue by saying something like “it’ll be so much cheaper than what an assisted living/nursing home/ memory care facility costs. This could save you money.” IDK if it would work, my mom hasn’t even mentioned the cost issue, luckily I don’t think it’s crossed her mind, at least not yet. But it’s worth a try.
Thanks for the suggestion. I tried that with my mom, but I got “I’m totally fine. I take care of myself and I do everything for myself.” 😢
Exactly this. My MIL was against any help coming in, now she just knows her as a friend. It doesn’t take long, and it’ll make all the difference for your dad.
Actually, the funniest thing my dad said in response to my queries regarding a caregiver was that "I don't need one. I just needs someone here when you're not." In other words, he wants me to stay on as a free caregiver but schedule someone to magically fill in the times when I have to be gone from the home. Which also leads toward his other request/demand: "Don't be gone so much."

Umm ... No. Just, no. Love ya bud but something's gotta change. ;-)
Yes, that’s what we’re hoping.
Yeah, the decline of basic common sense, plus the “it’s all about me” mentality that is common with people with dementia makes these kinds of situations, and many others, so challenging.
That is very well said. A lot of folks that I talk to just don’t get it. Without having experienced dementia first hand, people offer comments like “Oh, so your father is forgetful now, eh?”.

No, it’s so much more than that. He is a changed man. If I’m honest, always pretty self-centered but now COMPLETELY self-centered. And that lack of common sense that you mention is so obvious as well. 

We’ve crossed a line during this pandemic, though, where he needs professional care. It’s just too much for me unless I’m willing to devote myself completely to this task because that’s what it would take.
Very similar for my mom. Previously moderately self-centered, now almost totally. The pandemic definitely caused a further decline. 

When I started to tell people about my mom’s dementia, I got a lot of chuckles and “oh, she seems fine”. People think of dementia as cute old people saying mildly inappropriate funny things, and they don’t understand the reality, which is horrible and heartbreaking. To be fair, I was much the same way before my mom started having symptoms and then got her diagnosis, so I am a better educated and more compassionate person now. I think dementia education for society, given the large number of boomers, is going to be essential going forward.
Oh, absolutely. Unless they spend more than 10 minutes with him, people will say that "Your Dad seems pretty good today.". I want to tell them that, honestly, they have no idea. 

I have certainly learned a lot and am a more compassionate person now, as you mentioned, but that doesn't change the reality that my Dad really needs (or is going to soon need) a professional caregiver in my place. And, his needs have just begun to outstrip my capacity. And, if we know one thing about dementia and decline, it's that it rarely gets better. There's always worse coming. 

The self-centered focus has taken away my Dad's ability to look and see the impact that this is now having on my life. It isn't even a consideration. Where you might have spent your life growing up having your parent looking out for your best interests, my Dad has now lost that ability. It's a hard thing to recognize that it's up to you to take care of yourself and I've fought against this change (to a professional caregiver) for a while now but ... it's time.

I have siblings but no one else is looking out for my best interests here -- they would happily allow me to continue to devote the majority of my time to caring for him as long as they don't have to. And, he himself -- as I said -- is incapable of recognizing that his demands have reached an inappropriate level. 

So, change is coming ... step by step and day by day.
All our situations sound some similar and as weird as it sounds- I love visiting this sub because it reminds me that I’m not alone in this. I have been my moms primary full-time caregiver since 6/25/2020 when we lost my dad. I closed my mobile vet practice and my husband and I sold our home and moved in with mom so she could stay where she is comfortable. 
We have been through the loss of her drivers license (which she still forgets and gets furious if reminded of it when she thinks she can still drive) I’ve had to take her medication away because she can’t remembered what and when she took it. I’ve been yelled and accused of doing so many things I’ve lost count. 
We finally were able to talk her into allowing us to bring in some “friends” at the end of February of this year. She wasn’t sure at first but now she adores them and loves it when they come. They are much better at get her to do things, whereas she always tells me “No” when I suggest anything. Her favorite hobby is laying in bed, watching Fox News and yelling at the TV. 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
I give anyone so much credit that is on this journey. It is by far the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I’m so thankful my husband is supportive - I couldn’t do it without him. We lost his Dad to Alzheimer’s 5 years ago so sadly we have been down this road before but not at this level of involvement and mom is so totally different than Tom was. 

Honestly- “One Day at a Time” is my daily mantra. Sometimes even an hour on extremely hard days. 
Keep your chin up everyone and know that you’re not alone.
It sounds like you have as good a situation as you can. Living there with caregivers coming in. Unfortunately, that just seems impossible for me. My Dad, in one of his more mean-spirited moments has made it clear that when he has to have a caregiver that I’ll have to move out. Now, he might not believe that after it becomes reality but … I’ll hold him to it. 

We’re working on scheduling full time caregivers and I will split time between there and my new place … wherever that may be.
It is ok, but the hardest part is that it is HER house and she gets easily agitated and angry if we try and do things around here. 
We have the basement, which is a walk out, and is comfortable but most of our things are in storage as she won’t hear if moving ANYTHING oh hers!! She is also a hoarder so it’s always a battle to get rid of things when she’s not looking and making other changes on the sly.  Due to the nature of the house set up we are unsure how long we can keep her here safely. Her mobility has drastically declined and even with added safety features she’s taken some bad falls. So far just cuts and bruises tho. 
For me- the worst part is the narcissistic attitude, the complete lack of gratitude from her for what we have sacrificed for her and the nasty things to says to me. And I’m sure you have heard this before too-“Don’t take it personally” Yes, I do try not to but nobody understands that when it’s your MOTHER saying these things to you, it’s not as easy as it sounds. 
Everyone thinks they KNOW & understand when they are really clueless to how much of an emotional and physical toll this takes on a person. 

I hope you can find some resolution and help with your dad. The other aspect that people don’t grasp is that it doesn’t get easier- it only gets harder.

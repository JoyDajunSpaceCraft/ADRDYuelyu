First of all, I’m very sorry about your recent diagnosis. Every so often I see posts here from people living with dementia so there are a few of us that aren’t care givers. The Alzheimer’s Association is an incredible resource. They can probably point you to support groups etc. 
I wish you the best and we are always here to listen.

Thank you
I can barely imagine what it's like for you to read most of the posts on here. I really hope that place helps in even the smallest way. What a life we have
I’m 56 and a CPA so I’m pretty smart. I was anyway. I see the decline daily and it scares me because I know what’s happening.

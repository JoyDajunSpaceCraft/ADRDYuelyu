I am in it.  My husband has had alz for four years two have been medicated. He is no longer permitted to drive thank goodness. 

We have incorporated a lot of family life into his care which seems to help him stay cognitive and aware. One of our daughters works From our home and we watch her kids everyday â€” grandkids are great distractors. 
They even take my mind off of it for awhile each day

I would suggest looking into home well or some agency that can give you in home care if needed. They dont cost too much.  But family is by far the best for your dad because he will stay connected. 

Praying for you all.

You should look into www.lifeprotekt.com. I have dealt with this company and it works very well. They offer wearable (watch-like) GPS devices, and a variety of other products that can come with good service plans. The devices can be linked directly to your iphone/android/computer desktop, and will give you updates. GPS technology is such an important asset to have when you have loved ones who can wander away or go missing. 
Wandering is such a dangerous behavior, and these kind of wearable devices are a good way for you to keep tabs on your dad without making him feel patronized. Also, try contacting your local police department-Let them know that your loved one has an issue with wandering, and sometimes local police departments can provide assistance in paying for GPS technology. 
Good luck with your dad and I hope this helps!
iPhones have built in trackers "find iphone." That's what we're using with my mother in law, who is 67 and has Alzheimer's. 
Thanks for the help. I'll check them out.

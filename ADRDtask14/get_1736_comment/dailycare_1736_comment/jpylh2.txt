Honestly, get your hearing checked.  If you're not able to find evidence of this problem with unbiased electronics, it could be something as simple as you're not able to hear whispers anymore.  Gettin old ain't for sissies.
This could either be her answering you and you not hearing or her thinking she answered you when she doesn't.  Get an inexpensive voice recorder and leave it on all day.  Let her know what you are doing and why.  It sounds like this could be a medical issue that you need to identify and treat.
The problem isn't that it doesn't happen when I record it. I can't easily start recording every time I have a conversation with her. I actually watch her face to see if her lips move, and they don't.
Does she have this problem with someone else?

oh wow
Oh man. That was a pretty bad thing to do. Ugh.
That is painful. Hopefully someone reading this learns an important lesson. Sometimes life doesn't let you undo the wrongs........
Not sure whether to feel bad for you or call you a POS.

Hopefully you have learnt and changed your ways.
Do you still smoke weed?
Changing is the only way to forgiven. It's too late to change what has happened in the past. Now just move forward and be a better person friend.
‚ÄúJust my luck the pawnshop had closed‚Äù

Man don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be ok if you got it back.  You did a terrible thing and I still wouldn‚Äôt forgive you if you got it back.
One I'm sorry for your loss. Two I have no right to tell anyone on how to feel about what they have done in their life but I hope you can start to feel better lol
Honestly, I think by writing this, owning it, saying it out loud, letting those feelings come out is helpful in the heeling process. 
So let yourself heal. üñ§
Wow, not many people do f***** up s*** for weed. It wasn't the weed dude it was you.
Makes me feel a better about stealing my grandpa's playboys.lol we all do stupid shit when we're young. It was just shit timing with him passing away shortly after. Had he been in his right mind and you stole it from his room or something, and he found out,I guarantee your grandpa would've forgiven  you. Was it a pos move? Definitely but you have to live with that regret till the day you pass.
May I ask you if you know why at this point in your life, you decided to steal his ring? I don't mean the weed addiction. There's more to it than that. The reason I'm asking is two fold. As an adult, I'm learning more and more about compassion, and the human experience. 

My guess is that you were experiencing significant pain, and your emotional desperation left you to the act of stealing from a loved one. I also know that human being's don't fully develop their frontal lobe portion of our brains until 24/25-ish; therefore, we make terrible decisions during this time. I'm not saying this as an excuse, rather, as a fact that could be considered.

Secondly, I'm asking because my step-son has broken his father's and my heart for many many years by constant deception, lies, and theivery. To be honest, even our extended family doesn't trust him. My dream was to have a good relationship with him, but I can't personally have a good relationship with someone I can't trust. For me, that's the foundation of any relationship.  

Hearing your story reminds me a little of my experience with my step-son. I'm hoping you can provide some insight so that I can have more compassion for him, and understand why his behavior is like this. He's 20 years old. Unfortunately, his bio mother is a criminal and a total mess of a human being, and she's affected his upbringing. I know this is part of it, but I'm having such a hard time understanding how at 20 years old why he still chooses this path. You're welcome to dm me if you're willing to share. 

Lastly, I think the fact that you're so remorseful shows that you have grown from this experience. Please realize that none of us are perfect. If we're genuinely remorseful, and have realized how much we have hurt others, and feel that in our hearts, that's the first step to forgiveness in a path to healing relationships. This is a big step, and I think it's courageous of you.
I stole money from my mom.  It is in the past and we have to live with it forever. I don‚Äôt think that regret will ever go away. I do not believe we need to dwell on our past mistakes.
what happened with ur dad
So painful man. But I‚Äôm sure Grandpa would forgive you after reading this. Get yourself together. We learn everyday, don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself‚ù§Ô∏è
You‚Äôre an awful person for that ngl. If I was your dad I would never forgive you.
Of all things you could have chosen to steal...
Th
your addiction to weed does not justify nor explain the actions you made. you took advantage of a medically disabled family member, as well as lying to his face after being asked, in order to buy weed. your addiction does not come into play here. having been addicted to weed, it is not the weed you are addicted to, but the escape from whatever uncomfortable or depressing reality you were living. this is inexcusable and I have absolutely no sympathy for you. you can take this lesson with you and learn from it, or carry the pain of having tainted the final memories of your grandfather and his personal effects with you forever. do better.
i get this sub is  to confess, but thats just shitty, this is prolly gonna be on imatotalpeiceofshit soon (not by me coz im not a dick)
I live with it everyday. I cry sometimes when I think back on it.
Not even close to that person today. And I‚Äôll accept the POS.
I do but i work to fund any smoking habit I have.
you can forgive but never forget.
Biggest weight has been lifting. I don‚Äôt feel like a robot killing myself mentally anymore.
I was lost, angry. I grew up in a broken home. Both my parents were out of my life when I was younger. You do anything to forget ur past.
I‚Äôve come from a broken home, dad in jail, mom never home out finding a new man. My brother and I were left alone as little as 7 to stay home and fend for our selfs. When my dad got out he began a new family and I felt completely left out.. watching his kids grow with something I wish I could have had. My stories not the best but it is this.
 
**edited**: I feel like this was my excuse to just be a angry/spiteful teenager. Tho my grandpa was more a father than my father was, I never truly forgave myself for what I did. Even now I cry about this. I cried like 4 times commenting and making this post. It‚Äôs hard for me to open up when I‚Äôve never had anyone to open up too‚Ä¶ around that same time(teenager) my brother was starting to have kidney failure, only person I could trust was dying in front of me. (He‚Äôs doing a little better) I hated myself and my life so I‚Äôd just smoke till I couldn‚Äôt remember my past.
He forgave me after 8 years after my daughter was born. He said he saw me grow from who I was at the time. (If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking)
Was and it‚Äôs okay.
It's not just the act, that's water under the bridge at this point.

It's that certain actions are actually multi dimensional and persist in your mind, probably forever. Too many of these, and the burden becomes unbearable.
A great quote that I live by. ‚ÄúWe all make mistakes. Do not let the mistake define you, but rather the actions you take to rectify it.‚Äù

If you have truly changed, and are working to better yourself and repair the damage caused to those around you - good on ya, keep trucking and keep that quote in mind.
And idk if I could do either.  But what do I know I‚Äôm not a parent.  Hopefully you‚Äôre cleaning up your act now.
Well, I have to say that as a full grown adult, I'm confident that you had a pretty tough upbringing, and probably no one took the time to show you the ropes of life. You probably weren't taught good values during your developmental years. 

Although it does sound like you are on the right path now, and you know in your heart now what you did was wrong. That means that you have a healthy conscience. You're normal. A normal human being who makes mistakes. I hope you can rebuild your relationship with your father. It takes a very long time, and breaking down walls to rebuild trust, and there's no guarantees. That what I've been telling my step son all these years, but he still doesn't listen. Keep at it if you want to rebuild that relationship. Be humble. Be honest. You're a good person. You've been through a lot, and it takes times to heal.

Edit: and thanks for sharing your story. Hopefully, one day my step son will come around.
Hey, that's a world of hurt to process at such young of an age. Forgive yourself. Kids and adults generally steal when they can't process emotional pain. It's documented in science. Again, not an excuse, but a factor to consider. 

Go see a good therapist if you can. Hang in there, and let it all out. You're carrying too much on your shoulders.
Couldn‚Äôt hold it in anymore. I‚Äôm not perfect, yet I‚Äôm not that 18 year old anymore either. I feel like a weight has been lifted a little.
My wife and kids saved me from me but I never forgave. Thank you for the quote. I‚Äôll remember it.
I shared this post with him, just now. I had the biggest cry I‚Äôve had in years. I feel normal now, I don‚Äôt feel like a bot. Holding in my emotions, killing myself mentally.
And for my father, he has a better relationship with my kids. I told myself my children will never grow in the conditions I did.
Big hug to you OP. You're gonna be ok. You're a decent person. You had a big handicap start in life. That part isn't your fault. Now that you're older, you're responsible for your actions and your personal healing so you don't repeat the generational trauma.

You're probably too young to be on FB, but if you're curious check out The Holistic Psychologist. Her insight is genuine, real, no bs. She's very honest and healing. Sending you positive vibes kiddo.
Good for you! Lol, I thought you were a kid still. Maybe you're not too far from my age then.
 
If it matters im 30 now
You've got 8-10 more years until you're full grown imho. Life's still confusing in your 30's (emotionally).

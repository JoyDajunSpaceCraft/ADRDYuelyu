I found that when my partner wouldn’t drink I would place several different drinks around him.  A cold ice tea, a chilled cranberry juice, water, and warm cocoa.  It helped in my case.  He would fight it if I offered and occasionally got upset as I set drinks around but soon he would forget and absentmindedly pick up a drink.  
I would call Alzheimer's Association. They have a 24/7 helpline and might be able to help you troubleshoot. 800-272-3900 
I've had to take my father to the ER due to getting dehydrated. He got a couple of bags of fluid via IV. He's not a patient person and it took several hours before he was discharged. I'd do whatever I could to avoid that.
That is a great idea! Mom is better today. Thanks for your help. 
What a good idea. I realize I've been doing this a little myself without thinking it through like you have. I'll have to step up my game
I wish this would work with my mum. She's become very particular about what she drinks, to the extent that she often neglected to drink for ages and then complains of a dry mouth or nasty taste
Oh! Thanks. I'll do that.

I’m so glad! As everyone is different before dementia, you never know how they will be effected or what will work to help them.

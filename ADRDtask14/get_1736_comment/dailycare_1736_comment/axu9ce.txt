I don’t have any advice except hang in there and that time usually smooths things out. Usually. :)
My mom has a hard time with change in general, I’d imagine your dad is too. Remember transitions are hard, especially for them, since they don’t understand why. Be patient with your heart, as he doesn’t mean to break it when he’s acting out. 
I haven’t had to move my mom, from facility to facility, so I don’t have advice specific to that. But I did move her to a facility shortly after a hospital stay where she kept thinking I was going to make her sleep outside. That was hard.

Remember to get your rest too. 
Also an only child, and my dad is a widower. I'm his POA and personal directive. We were also in a lovely private facility and had to move in the fall due my dad's needs changing. I held off as long as I could, then health matters forced the issue.

I have no advice, only that I'd love to give you an internet hug. This is tough enough without family help. Moving is hard on everyone. We can use that tough skin on 99 per cent of what's being thrown at us, but moving is just too much sometimes.
Blessings and hugs. 
Thanks everyone ❤️

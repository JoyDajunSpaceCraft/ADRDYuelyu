If you haven't already, I would open up some communication with the facility so you can work on a plan together to improve things. Aside from the possibility that they might not want to keep him, this is bad for your Dad's health. Falls tend to advance dementia and the ER visits and injuries are creating a vicious circle with the delirium and dementia. It is common for a new MC patient to have increased agitation for a couple months. You could ask the facility how they have handled similar situations in the past. It's expensive, but you might want to look into getting him a sitter at night until this resolves. Did he have a catheter at home and leave it alone? Was he sleeping through the night at home? Delirium is a serious medical condition and it might be appropriate to have this treated medically until things settle down. That could mean some medication before bedtime though it needs to be monitored and dosed correctly so it does not actually increase his risk of falling due to too much sedation.  Don't assume you are starting over. You're not the only one that's been in this situation and there are answers. If this facility is not understanding and capable of working on this issue, I don't think you are losing much.

I completely agree with you about the SNF - even long term, not just temporary. SNFs have memory care wings too. I've been in very nice ones. Having an RN always on duty and a staff that is used to dealing with various medical issues in-house could save him from some ER visits.  This might not stop him from being able to mess up the catheter, but you might consider adaptive clothing if you haven't already: For instance, an adult onesie paired with a sleep suit or pants that open at the back, or with a size zipper that he has trouble opening.

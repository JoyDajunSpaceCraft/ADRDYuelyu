 So sorry you’re losing a loved one to dementia.  It’s very difficult to see them slowly fade.  Those moment of clarity, with her telling you that you’re her “healing” is so sweet.  A part of you will always be in her heart, like she is in yours.  Wishing you strength during these times.
Aye, beautiful to hear man :) im glad you got to have this moment

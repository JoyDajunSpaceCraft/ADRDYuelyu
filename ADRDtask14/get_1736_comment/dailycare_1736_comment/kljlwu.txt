An advance medical directive. The medical directive should be discussed as a family, so that no one has to make decisions by themselves.
Adding to this: get the legal matters sorted out sooner rather than later. Appoint a Power-of-Attorney, remove her name from deeds and bills, and secure bank accounts. That's logistically speaking.

Emotionally speaking, it may take your dad a while. My mother was also diagnosed in her early 60's and it took years for my dad to accept it. We had to make it work around his denial and it caused a lot of frustration and anger for my siblings and me. Your mom won't have the ability to go at his pace so he'll either need to catch up or you'll need to do as much as you can without him.
Thank you I will talk to my Dad about this.
I guess I'm worried that taking her off legal paper work will be too painful for both my mom and dad emotionally. I can see why but taking that step might be more than they can face right now. I'll try to find a way to talk to my dad about it. Is it harder to do if she's not able to do it herself later?
Yes, it is harder to do later on because the courts are generally loathe to make a determination about whether or not someone has capacity. It'll do it, but it'll require you guys to prove capacity (or lack of it) through documentation. You have some time, from what your mom's capacity sounds like, but it might be a conversation you begin around this time and work up to.

For Verizon, it’s a plan called “Just Kids” in which the phone can only call/message or receive calls/ messages from up to 20 numbers that you specify. More on that plan here: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/verizons-just-kids-wants-your-childs-first-smartphone-plan/3331328002/

We had similar issues with our dad once his dementia really kicked in. For us, the solution was getting a new phone with a new number for him on a plan that we could monitor and limit features. We saved all his favorite numbers (family and close friends) to the contacts and blocked any number not in the contacts list. This was easier on a flip-phone and our dad didn’t have experience with a smart phone, so he didn’t miss apps or a data plan. 

There are quite a few call blocker apps out there for smart phones that might help you. This list may help, depending on what type of phone you have:

I would say if he's already fallen for scams, def get a new number for him, he's a known target. We had to do this too. We are currently using the jitterbug smartphone which you can put a lot of controls on; we monitor his calls and texts with an app on our home computer (he lives in assisted living a few miles away)  and can use the GPS to see where he is. But its still a smartphone, so he gets on the internet and fills out forms some times, or gets the phone messed up out of pushing too many buttons out of frustration and we have to "clean it up" so it runs smooth again. I also saw an interesting tablet device called the "Grandpad" that \*looked\* ideal, but its offered by consumer cellular and requires a hard credit pull???? and when I called to get info I got a REALLY pushy sales person who tried very hard to get my info instead of answer my questions, so that scared me away from that, but maybe you might want to look into it- the thing I liked about it was that there was no internet, but you could still stream music, get weather updates, and video call- but that had mixed reviews too. Its not easy, you'd think with all these ALZ cases they'd make an ideal simple phone for this situation, but unfortunately the jitterbug is the best we've found. Good luck.
There is a phone we thought about for my mom for the same reason. You put a picture on each button and then program the phone with the numbers that correspond with the person. It's not cheap though and we opted against it as my mom quickly reached a point where she wouldn't talk on the phone at all.

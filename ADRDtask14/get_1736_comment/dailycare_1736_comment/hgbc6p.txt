Maybe ask a local church?
If your grandmother is on Facebook there are loads of support groups.
Hey [u/0812alskardig](https://www.reddit.com/user/0812alskardig/) \- that is a really difficult diagnosis to come to terms with for everyone. It is really thoughtful of you to seek support for your grandmother. 

I second u/kitkatinkerbell that there are a bunch of active Facebook support groups for caregivers. Below are some of the popular ones:

Smart Patients also has good support forums and communities for specific diagnoses which you can find here: [https://www.smartpatients.com/communities](https://www.smartpatients.com/communities). 

It may also be worth looking into some of the virtual counseling services like BetterHelp, Talkspace, and 7 Cups if she is willing. 

Hope that is helpful!

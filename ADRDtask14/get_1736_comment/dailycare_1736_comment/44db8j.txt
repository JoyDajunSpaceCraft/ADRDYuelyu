As I am sure you know, this is a very common with most progressive dementia's. And most people at do feel ashamed when they have an accident. 

I am a professional caregiver. A few years back I was faced with a similar situation. One day a nurse came by to check on the patient and I explained to her pretty much what you just posted. The nurse suggested that I take my client to the bathroom every 1 1/2 to 2 hours everyday. She said to make it part of the daily routine everyday. So I did, and the accidents almost completely stopped for quite a while. If at first she resists, keep trying by using positive reinforcement. After a while, she will come to appreciate the routine. People with memory issues love routine, but when you are trying to start something new, sometimes it takes them a while to get on board.

Hope this helps. Good luck  
You can also set a timer so she goes every [two hours](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/bladder_training/). Call it the "tinkle timer" 
You can even set an alarm to make a "bathroom flushing" sound. I do this for myself for bladder training, its really helpful.
Thank you for this response. I think making it more of a routine sounds like a great idea - it definitely isn't a regular enough thing yet. Especially with me only being here certain days! 

Again thank you.
Thank you, this is a good idea. Do you think I could partially lead by example just to keep the idea of using the bathroom fresh in her mind? (The bathroom is within eyesight of her living area)
Your very welcome, and if you can, try to get everyone on board!
I don't have dementia yet and there is absolutely no way I could remember to go ever two hours without the alarm. Once the urge has gone, you forget all about it. People who still have a normal urge to go pee have no idea how completely the idea vanishes when those nerves are no longer firing.
I definitely will.
I definitely will.
I definitely will.

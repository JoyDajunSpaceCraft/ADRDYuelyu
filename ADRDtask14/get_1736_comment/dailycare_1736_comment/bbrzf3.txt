Don't be so hard on your mom. You weren't raised by that woman. 

My mom has always been full of resentments. As she declines, the rest of her personality is going away and she is left with only her resentments on top of her frustration over her declining mental abilities. 

I am not saying you are wrong about your grandmother, but your mother may have a point. It's hard to forget a lifetime of bad experiences. Cut her some slack. She is probably frustrated by the current situation and by the lifetime of unpleasant memories grandmothers behavior brings up.  

She is under stress too. She is your mother. She could probably use a little understanding and loyalty from you too. Maybe more than grandma. She is aware of what's going on. Grandma probably forgets anything that happens now quickly.
Thank you for this. Your advice is already helping me greatly.

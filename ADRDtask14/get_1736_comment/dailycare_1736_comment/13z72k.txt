Sorry to hear about your mother-in-law. Buckle up and prepare - this disease is ruthless and brutal. I don't know about your area, but hit Google right away. I'm sure there are support groups there; Hell, there are tons of groups in even small towns.  You could start here:  http://www.alz.org/

Good luck.  This is going to suck.

This is really common, even with family caregivers.  The dementia patient dumps all over the person giving the most care (in my case, my sister gets the grief) and is infuriated that you're not joining in on the outrage.  I think part of it is fury that the patient is so dependent on the caregiver.  The part of your grandfather that once was an independent, self-sufficient man is absolutely furious that he needs help.  

Two ideas: First, consult your granddad's doctor.  He may need antidepressants or other medication.  Second, don't challenge his delusion, just deflect.  "Susan attacked you?  I'm sorry to hear that, and I'm sure she's very sorry too.  You're sorry, right, Susan?  Oh, yes, we're all very sorry, can you forgive us?  What can we do to make it better?"  If his answer is "Susan should go away and not come back" say how hurt that makes Susan and you, couldn't he give her another chance? That you love Susan and know she loves him too?  It's emotional manipulation and it sucks, but his brain isn't functioning rationally right now and the key is helping him feel more in control.

Maybe also allow him more control in his daily life.  Do you want to wear this blue shirt or this red shirt?  Do you want to watch a movie or football?  Do you want eggs or pancakes?  Little choices during the day can make him feel more in control of his environment and less frustrated with needing care. Asking either/or questions is more likely to elicit a positive response than "what do you want to wear?" as he might get angry/frustrated that he can't think of anything.

Again, this is very common.  It's a part of the disease, and I hope neither you nor "Susan" take it personally.
This happened with my FIL. We all live away from him and when he refused to work with professional care givers, he had to be moved to a nursing home.

I’m so sorry you’re going through this.

While DocCyane is correct that pneumonia is a common cause of death for people with LBD, the answer is really anything. Parts of the brain start shutting down randomly, and the brain controls everything. It could be a heart attack, and you'll never really know if the LBD actually caused it or not. 
does your mother suffer from LBD?
I'm sorry. That was a dumb question. 
Thank you.

Just tell him the facts. It will be sad, but people your grandfather’s age have seen illnesses and disabilities in their friends and other family for much longer than you have. It’s likely to be more accepted as an unavoidable part of life.
Other poster hit the nail on the head. Tell him the truth for now and see how it plays out. Chances are he'll handle it better than you're thinking. If he freaks out, you can redirect future conversations and avoid the topic. 

Lycka till.
There is a woman I know of who volunteers as a research participant, including doing spinal tap to measure bio markers, because her daughter has dementia. It was so sad to hear but she is just in full mama bear mode doing all she can and saying if her daughter has to go through all the medical tests then so will she. She must be in her 80s as well. 

Do you think that your grandpa could provide support to your dad if he knew? Because on the flip side it could be comforting for a person with dementia to have their parent. 

But I think it’s smart to consider your grandpa’s well being too and weigh out the pros and cons of telling him.

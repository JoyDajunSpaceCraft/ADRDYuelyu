Is there a school near by with a program that uses the types of tools he has? 
Perhaps see if there is a nearby hobby center that can use them.  Some senior independent living communities have hobby centers or if there is an educational program for teaching skills to the disabled 
Hi darth, yes both nearby high schools have tech programs. They are well funded and rely on alumni support with no secondhand exchange programs. Any donations go to town auction.

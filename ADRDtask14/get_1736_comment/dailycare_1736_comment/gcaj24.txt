 My dad’s anxiety has been high because of COVID. If there’s any kind of repetitive task he can manage (painting, doing a puzzle, gardening, etc.), those things have helped distract my dad!
Put on music he likes, watch a movie, make sure it's OK to get him high on cannabis?  You're a good brother(IL).  He's lucky to have you.
You can call his doctor for an ok to give the Xanax.  My dad is in his early 90’s and was on Tramadol and took a Xanax every night for years, so it is doable.  He’s just on Tramadol now, but he’s prescribed TWO Xanax for panic attacks, so...
Sister in law....haha.  He also fell and broke his ribs yesterday.  I was gonna give him a 1/4 xanax but I can’t bc of his pain medication.  We don’t live in a legal state so weed is also out.
That sucks, and you're a great sis.  Music, media, distraction.

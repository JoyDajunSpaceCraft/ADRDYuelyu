Feeling dizzy can have something to do with inner ear -- this can happen apparently out of nowhere and can affect ppl at any age. Contact the doctor for sure.
You should call his doctor
A trip to the doctor is always good. It may be his ear i.e. balance. And make sure he's drinking enough water.
UTI can be disorienting
If the dizziness happens upon standing up, it’s likely orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure dropping with moving to an upright position).  If he’s on blood pressure meds he may need them adjusted, or it can be as simple as him needing to sit up at side of bed slowly and move his legs for a bit before standing up (slowly)
It would be worth asking his doctor if that could be a side effect of any of his meds.  If so, giving it earlier in the day or substituting a different drug might make a difference.
Dehydration can cause dizziness and disorientation. Maybe encourage more fluid intake, or put a glass of water next to his bed.
He has very bad hearing and wears hearing aids all day. Obviously he takes them out when he goes to bed, so waking up disoriented makes a lot of sense
While you are waiting on his Dr. appt you might want to have him try some re-balancing exercises for the inner ear. Google search vertigo on youtube. I think in his case it could be one of several possible issues and balance problems can of course be dangerous. If it is an inner ear thing, that can be sorted pretty quickly.
Dehydration was my biggest theory, similar to waking up with a hangover because you don't have enough water in your system. His doctor is hard to get information out of and finding a new doctor right now is even harder, but I'll have to address this if it won't go away. Thank you!
Good luck! I hope you find an answer soon :)

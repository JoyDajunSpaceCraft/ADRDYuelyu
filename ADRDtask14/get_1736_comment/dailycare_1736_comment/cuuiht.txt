> Is it OK to feel freed? Is it OK to just relax? Will I be able to get back into caregiver mode when she comes back? 

Not only is it perfectly ok but very healthy for you to get relief every now and then.  Being the ONLY caregiver is very unhealthy.

It's okay to feel everything you are feeling. You will be able to get back into caregiver mode but this is a blessed piece of respite that helps you recharge your life. It's wholly necessary to have this kind fo downtime whenever possible - and in an ideal world we would all get it regularly. I am so happy for you in having this chance to be yourself and do your own things for a while. This also gives your family some insight into what it has been like for you, even if they have the help of a professional - it is still absorbing and life-changing.  


Enjoy this time. Do everything and anything you want to. <3
Are you really freed if you feel guilt? Don't feel guilty. Im sure even your mom would understand in her best frame of mind. You deserve to relax and be happy. ❤
You're right, thanks for your words.
Hugs! Ty
Thanks for your kind words! I've decided to accept my friends invitation to a trip next town. BRB tomorrow!
That's actually a great insight! She used to tell me not to ever slow down for another person, not even her. 

I'll rest a little and do some things I want to do for myself. Thanks.

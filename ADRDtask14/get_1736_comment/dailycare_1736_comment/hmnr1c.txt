My stepfather had hallucinations with Lewy Body Dementia. His were pleasant, though when he thought he won money he would get agitated looking for it.

Another infection is possible, even if theyâ€™re saying no UTI.
My FIL struggled with this too. We tried all sorts of things, but never really found a great solution. He was very self-aware and had periods of lucidity most days, so we were able to let him talk about it and that seemed to help because he didn't feel like he was going crazy. He described them in such great detail. It was truly a window into his world!
Oh, that's very helpful. Thank you. We'll check into it.
I keep thinking something has changed, for these to come on so suddenly. That's why the check for the UTI. Perhaps my husband can get her to agree to some bloodwork. Thank you for responding.
Be sure to get sodium levels. If it's low it can effect all sorts of stuff. My mil has not been able to walk, Drs blame low sodium. Also a urine via catheter.

Considering safety is threatened in this, the doctor needs to step in. It's bad enough when you have to take their keys, I can't imagine how difficult this will be and you can't do it alone.

If the doctor continues to be useless and you can't switch, sometimes you can fudge the truth a bit and tell the person there's a new law that says only certified people can do the work and they have to have "x" certification to do so. Make sure it's not something the person has. Tell them insurance won't cover it if the certified person doesn't sign off on it.

What I did: whatever part of the house he was in, I was in the other part, throwing stuff away. Let him get mad.  Heâ€™s mad all the time anyway.  Jerk.

This is so well written.  It's difficult to read, kind of like watching category 5 hurricane coverage on television while living in a coastal city.   My mother is dealing with memory loss and has meltdowns, but not this bad.  But now I'm wondering if you've painted a picture of what storms might be coming my way.

Again, what a hard hitting, well crafted piece.
That was brutal to read and made me relive several moments of taking care of my last guy with FTD for the past year and a half. Solidarity ❤️
Thanks, eliz and Uvabird. I write to have something all my own to focus on - even if it is about Mom! And I try to include the whole truth - how being a dementia caregiver can have you doubled over with laughter at times, and sobbing into your pillow an hour later. It's a helluva ride! 

Uva, it always so different for everyone. I hope rage never becomes a part of your Mom's journey, but if it does you'll take a deep breath, and find a way to figure it out. Wednesday evening she started to come out of it, and has been a little less angry everyday. I'm guessing it won't be our last visit to Monsterland! I sure am making the most out of this reprieve as possible right now!

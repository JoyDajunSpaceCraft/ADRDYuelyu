I wouldnâ€™t be worried about just this isolated event. If this becomes a pattern, I would bring it up with your mom or other family member.
I agree it is too little to assume it is dementia. 

You don't say how old he is.

Can you talk to him about this or ask your mom to talk to him?


I agree with the comments below -- prob not dementia. But it does bring up funny memories of my sister, who has dementia. She is a devout Christian who wouldn't even say "butt" for ass -- she said rear end -- and now swears regularly. :-D

I know that seems old to you but it's prime of life. Definitely talk to your mom.

I look back on when I was young and how clueless I was about my parents, the problems they hid from us.

Good luck. It is probably NOT dementia.

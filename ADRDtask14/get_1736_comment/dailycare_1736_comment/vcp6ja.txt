We've suspected that my dad has dementia for the past decade.  I could never get the doctors to take it seriously, or to do more than ask him the basic five questions (which my dad games). Ultimately, we did nothing but started to work around my dad's decline.  It's not like there's any magic pill that would stop anything, and the doctors weren't helping, and talking about it just made my dad angry, so we stopped.  Now we just work around it.

He scared himself badly enough to stop driving on his own volition, which was great (not that he did much driving). 

Unless you need to Name the problem, I suggest that just working around your observations to make arrangements for his comfort and protection may be the easiest plan forward.  Starting to discuss financial arrangements and making changes to limit access to accounts or credit cards, simplifying bill payments, blocking incoming calls from unknown numbers (my mom does this just to lose the 20+ spam callers she was receiving a day), this can all help chip away at problems.
Luckily my grandma knew something was not right and had been telling us so I didn’t have to break it to her. I still had to coax her to the appointment a bit but she was ultimately okay with it. If he ever expresses frustration at losing a word, etc. you could just try to sympathize like yeah that would be frustrating. We might be able to help, let’s talk to your doctor.
Get all your paperwork in order. Power of attorney, will , health care poa and information access.   If you don’t have those it’s going to be hard.  Preferably before you have a conversation or diagnosis. You can also talk to his doctor ahead of time, even without the authority. The Dr can’t tell you things but you can tell them your concerns and have them listen. Hopefully the doctor will do the basic scanning and refer to a geriatric neurologist.
I would not start with the scariest potential diagnosis, he may become defensive, go into denial, dig in his heels.  I would ask Dad to go with you to the doctor for a general checkup because he hit some benchmark age and tell the doctor privately *before* the appointment. There are a few other things to rule out before assuming it to be the terminal illness of dementia
Imo not much benefit to discussing the diagnosis directly with the patient. It’s more for the family so they know what to expect and learn techniques to manage it. The goal is to manage the symptoms and give Dad a good quality of life as long as it can be good.

And so the family knows that the new meanness is due to brain damage, it doesn’t indicate anything about the actual person and all your memories and past relationship with them.
I began with, “I have noticed \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Have you noticed a change? I want you to be safe. Let’s think about talking to your doctor.”  Granted, my mom has always been reasonable and we have always had good communication. The conversation was awkward at first, but it got better. I know it won’t be this easy for everyone. But it’s worth a try.
Our family doctor was like this. I pushed until he referred us to a neurologist. The neurologist did give mom some meds that we hope are slowing things down. But he also checked other things that might contribute to dementia. It turns out my mom has severe sleep apnea. Her overall health and cognition have been better since we got that addressed. I think it’s worth pushing.
I am sorry to hear you have had such problems getting a diagnosis. far out, it is sad that Drs can be so unwilling to pursue problems. I know my dad's dr isn't great but he lives in a small community and there is no other options. 

It is the driving that worries me the most and why I feel we should push for a diagnosis because I don't think dad will stop driving on his own. My mum has been banned by her dr already. He drives the grandkids around and it does concern me
Yes he does voice frustration at loosing words, but funnily enough it is only ever in relation to my very recent adhd diagnosis. He is trying to reassure me that what I am talking about and experiencing is just totally normal. He doesn't like to think of anyone stepping outside 'the norm' or being special, especially when it comes to health. I think he is a sensible man but it is going to be tricky. But just slipping it in as a suggestion to help is a good idea, thanks.
ah yes, ok. I think we have power of attorney and will sorted. Having a chat with his doctor is a great suggestion, I wouldn't have thought of that but it sounds like a great idea. thanks
I do understand your point of view but I do think it is important to let the person know what their diagnosis is. Well, at this point anyway. He will be at the very beginning of it, if it is dementia, so I think he will understand and be able to process it. His mother died of it so I have been hyper alert for ages, as much for my own self as for him tbh too. But he is def cognisant to be able to make decisions about his future. None of it is easy. I hope you're right and it may just be old age.
My dad is reasonable too so hopefully it will go ok. I like your straight forward but caring approach. I think I will employ that too, thanks
I think it’s time to move both Mom and Dad to a walkable community. Ideally close to the little downtown core if there is one, so he can socialize and run low-stakes errands without putting himself or anyone else in danger.
Oh that’s adorable. That does complicate things though. I don’t know if you could ask his doctor to slip in a cognitive test and pretend he does it for everyone?
If it’s early then understandable. If he has started to approach the paranoia stage then definitely not. At worst, they can start to believe that the family is gaslighting them
They do actually do them for everyone above a certain age where I'm from, or at least they are supposed to.

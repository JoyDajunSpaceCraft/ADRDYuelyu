The mirtazipine could definitely be a trigger for anger and maybe even violent outbursts. I really do encourage you to talk to your doctor about it, but do some more research because there will be doctors who tell you that this drug has no significant behavioural side effects, which is incorrect. I have had both positive and negative experiences with mirtazipine, but if it's not working for the person under your care, it's important to safely discontinue and try something new with the guidance of your doctor or specialist . 
This drug had the same effect on my mother in law then knocked her out and finally made her ankles swell before we stopped it. Now on memantine which seems for mum to be the right drug. 
Just started my father on mirtazipine - to try to get him to sleep at night. It is hard to wake me when I'm sleeping  so he can be up to a lot without me knowing. I read about heavy sleeping but the other issues (swollen ankles?) are concerning.

What is your purpose for showing her the movie? To be honest, it comes off as a bit cruel. I'm sure she knows what is coming, and seeing it on screen probably would just be upsetting. I haven't seen the movie, but I did read the book. I can see if your wife is interested in activism, there were portions that were inspiring in that sense. Otherwise, I don't know if it would do much other than shove in her face exactly how much of herself she is going to lose.
I am so sorry man. 
I know. In retrospect, it was cruel.

She's a doctor, and has always wanted the facts before everything else, but in this case, she couldn't wrap her head around what was happening to her. Also, she asked about that movie, and was interested in seeing what it was all about.

Also, I wanted to bring up in conversation what her thoughts were on the end-game, but could not (and still cannot) find a way to ask her what she ultimately wants.
I see. Well, I appreciate what you are trying to do. It sounds like you had good intentions, but the outcome was not what you wanted. I think maybe you can start the conversation by talking about end of life wishes as hypotheticals. Start by talking about what you would want to see if something happened to you, and see if she responds. Unfortunately, she may never be able to "wrap her head" around what is happening to her. You could also say "WE" should update our will/power of attorney. Include yourself and talk about you want to see for yourself and see where that goes. Good luck!
Thanks -- those are good thoughts.

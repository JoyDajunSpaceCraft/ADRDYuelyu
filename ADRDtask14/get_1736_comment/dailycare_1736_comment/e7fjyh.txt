If they don’t know what kind, then the answer is impossible to know. From what I remember (I’m not a doctor or a specialist, just a caregiver) most types aren’t inherited, but more caused by environmental factors and genetic mutations.
I believe I heard on the radio that more people will get it just by living longer.
I wish i knew the answer to that.  My mom has dementia but she’s 94. Her father had it as well. He was younger though.  It honestly scares the crap out of me
I believe my dad's dementia was caused by his type 2 diabetes as well as Agent Orange exposure.  My FIL's was caused by his prostate cancer treatment.  Most are likely environmental rather than genetic.  If there isn't a strong family history, I wouldn't sweat it.
Oh reallY!? Wow I always thought that it was a genetic thing that was passed down. Then again he's the only person in my whole family who has it.
Tell me about it, I feel you.
No, it can be inherited, it can be lifestyle, it can be really bad luck.

My dad has it and absolutely no one else in my family have it. He was a heavy drinker and smoker for years, and has Type 1 diabetes. 

It's more likely to be inherited if it's early onset (diagnosis before 60).

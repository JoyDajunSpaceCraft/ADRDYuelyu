You may not get much of a response from personal experience since this sub is more caregivers than those with the diagnosis.

I’m wondering about your upset stomach. My husband’s doctor had him taking a half a dose a day for the first month to give him time to adjust. Perhaps you can ask your doctor if taking a half dose at first may help with your stomach issues.
My mother (who is tiny and a bit frail) tried taking it but it upset her stomach too much.
Doc prescribed for hubby with Lewy Body Dementia and it was horrible.  Made him feel sick all day long and increased his REM sleep disorder to 3 or more violent events a night, I had to sleep on the couch for a week so he wouldn't hurt me. Took him off of it after one week.
I know you’re looking for personal experience but that may be hard to find here. My mom took Aricept for about a month but had to stop due to nausea and vomiting that did not improve.

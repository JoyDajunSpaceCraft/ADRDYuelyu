She could have frontotemporal dementia, (FTD) behavioral variant.  Please have her assesed by someone who knows this condition. Depending on the part of the country you're in, there are several main universities that do extensive research on this. You need to get her to a neurologist that knows what they're talking about 
I agree that she needs to get to a neurologist. There could be many different possibilities and the behaviors that you are describing are worthy of concern.
I thought of FTD too, or possibly you could also get her checked for Lyme disease if you live in an area with tick (never hurts to check if you do). We were told my father had FTD when he actually had Lyme Disease, took 5 tests but he came back positive and was finally diagnosed with Lyme Disease, which causes dementia if left untreated (not much is known of this but it’s always a thought, if there’s a history though I would definitely say try to get her tested for by a specialist for FTD)
Seconding this. I read it and thought of ftd as well
Thank you.

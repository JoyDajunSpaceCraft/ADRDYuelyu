Oh wow - I was not expecting that edit! I'm so sorry for your loss. You obviously cared about her very much. Did you realize she was so close to the end? 
I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm so so sorry. She is at peace now. We're just faceless internet strangers, but I feel for you immensely. I know the pain these situations inflict. If you need anything, even just a listening ear, let me know. 
Neither was I, she was quite responsive the day before I saw her but yes, we knew she was nearing the end â€“ she was only receiving palliative care. She was in her eighties and lived a good, long life but the world has lost a little o its brightness this week. Thank you for your words.
Thank you so much, this truly means the world.

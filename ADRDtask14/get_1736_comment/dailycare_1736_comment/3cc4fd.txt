If your uncle does have dementia, him keeping to himself could very well be a coping mechanism. Engaging with others is a mentally stimulating activity and it could be difficult for him to follow conversations, so he is keeping to himself. I had a friend whose husband did not want to visit his grandchild for this reason; the sum of the child, his daughter, son-in-law, and wife were too much stimulation for him all at once.

Another very difficult lesson for us to learn when living with or caring for someone with dementia is that you do not try bring them back into our world, you need to learn to be part of their world or whatever their reality may be.
My grandmother with Alzheimer is becoming more withdrawn as well. She has trouble keeping up with conversations that involve more than one person at the time. It helps if you talk to her one on one, and talk about stuff she understands. If we talk about our jobs, vacations, the news, or the world 'outside', she loses track and gets sad or agitated.

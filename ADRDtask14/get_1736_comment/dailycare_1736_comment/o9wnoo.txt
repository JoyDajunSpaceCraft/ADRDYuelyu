I’m so sorry your whole family is going through this. There aren’t any ‘good’ options sometimes, only least harmful to all involved.

You can listen and validate your mom’s feelings, even if you don’t agree with her interpretation of the situation. She probably needs to vent/process how hurtful the words were, before she can (hopefully) move past it to acceptance that it’s grandma’s illness/anxiety talking, not her true feelings. I have learned “I’m sorry you feel that way” is a perfectly acceptable response to something upsetting to someone that I don’t agree with the premise of. Sometimes people just want to be heard vs given any kind of reason OR solution.

Sending you both positive thoughts.
Thank you for your kind reply. I think you are right and this has given me more insight; she just wanted to be heard and validated. I thought I would be helping by assuring her it was the disease at fault, but for her the most important thing was having us understand how hurt she was regardless of the root cause.

I’m sorry you’re going through this. My dad was the same when he was in the hospital for a short stent (a week and half or so). He was uncooperative, assaultive with medical staff, refused to eat and delusional. The nurses were kind enough to set up a FaceTime call for us. He was non responsive with us and after a few minutes said to hang up he didn’t want to talk to us. When he came home, it took a few days for him to readjusts mentally. However with the dementia, it wasn’t long before the episodes of delusion resurface and disappear like a yo-yo. Hopefully when your mom returns home, the familiarity and being around people she loves will help her readjust quickly.
So my mom spiraled like that — icu psychosis or hospital associated delirium. I’m not sure if your mom is oriented to time and place...if not you could look at strategies for grounding someone with delirium or icu psychosis. You could ask her care team to do exercises to alleviate that.

If she is grounded then I’m not sure if those techniques would work.

It is sooo hard to have a loved one hospitalized right now. I was devastated when my mom would ask me why I wouldn’t pick her up, when she was hospitalized. Hang in there. She is there to get the care she needs.

Is someone other than her husband available to help with her rehab at home? I know she’s set to move to assisted living but in the meantime, is it feasible to care for her at home? We had an occupational and physical therapist coming out to the house to work with my dad. Perhaps that may help if that’s an option.

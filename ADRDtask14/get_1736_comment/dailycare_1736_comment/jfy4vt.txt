Early diagnosis is very important.

Yes, there is no outright cure, but modern treatment can control some symptoms if the person responds well. The earlier the diagnosis, the more time for doctors to figure out if there is something that helps. More often than not, there is something that will slow down the degradation of the mind. Most of the time, early diagnosis and treatment adds years.
It might not be dementia. What if itâ€™s something else that can be treated now? What if not treating it now means it becomes a bigger problem? This is why sticking their heads in the sand is such a bad idea. It may be something else entirely.
sometimes it is metabolic dementia, which can sometimes be stopped or even reversed.
I think early diagnosis is crucial for the patient and their family. I was diagnose one year ago, and still have enough wherewithal to contribuate and help plan for the future. I have had time to process and understand the changes that happen and make sure each day contains quality time with those I love. I truly hope your relative does not have dementia, but other way, they should see a doc to figure out what is happening. My thots are with y'all.

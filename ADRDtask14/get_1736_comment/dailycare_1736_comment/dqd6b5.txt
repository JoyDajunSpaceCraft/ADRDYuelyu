Black bean brownies are a classic, and they taste pretty rich - not like he'd know they have beans by tasting them.

Also - it's pumpkin season, so maybe pumpkin (or sweet potato) pie. He'd get the veggie nutrients and some protein from the eggs and milk in it. 

Oh, and 3 ingredient no bake peanut butter oatmeal cookies. These are nice because you can make them pretty small, they aren't messy and don't require silverware - so someone who's starting to have trouble getting things to their mouth without making a mess (but can still chew) would like these. https://frommybowl.com/peanut-butter-chocolate-cookies/
This is just an easy one but have you heard of Kodiak cakes? Itâ€™s a high protein pancake batter. They do waffles too. My dad is the same and he thinks theyâ€™re old fashioned buckwheat pancakes. Loves them
This one is a little strange, but there are some delicious dessert humus recipes over on r/vegangifrecipes. I've made the chocolate one and the snickerdoodle one for my parents and they love it.

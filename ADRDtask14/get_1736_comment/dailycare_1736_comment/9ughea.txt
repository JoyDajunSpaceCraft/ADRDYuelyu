Thatâ€™s a really tough situation to be in. I hope your family can get through this by pulling together. 
I'm sorry to hear that. My friends granpa passed away two years ago to Alzheimer's and though he never said it out loud he indicated the same emotions like you are now. Just remember that there will come a time when everything's ok.
My grandma had Alzheimer as well, I don't know about stage stuff, but she started to losing it pretty quick, maybe 4 years, then she passed away, last year.
I can relate 
Exactly. I think people at risk for dementia and Alzheimer should be given the option of consenting to assisted dying while still cognitively healthy.  I might just write an article on this! 
Are you me?
Where do you live? Canada allows euthanasia
The assisted dying law should be adopted in other countries. But the dying have to give consent...
Tricky if they're non verbal

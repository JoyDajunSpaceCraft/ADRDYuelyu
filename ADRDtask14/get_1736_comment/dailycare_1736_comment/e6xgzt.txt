I hate this with my Dad. It devastates me every time. 

It's one of those times when you do have to lie and you carry the pain of the lie.

I try not to lie directly. I'll say something like "well who knows? Let's hope so. There are lots of new medicines coming out all the time". Say it in a positive way. 

Then shut the subject down and distract. Think of something positive to say, change locations (take him out or just move rooms), give him something to eat or drink.

I didn’t like lying at first but it is really a good, kind, compassionate tool in your tool box. If they don’t have the capacity to reason, there is no sense hurting or upsetting them. 

I’ve been lucky so far regarding that question. Once my mother asked, “am I getting worse or how is the weather?”

I grabbed on to the weather question (diversion tool) and said, “It’s pretty windy outside.”
I loath lying but I learned really quickly that their mental well being is of prime importance. It hurts you more than them but learn the art of distraction too. It takes your mind off the guilt but way more importantly they forget what was in their mind at that time.
"Tomorrow could be a great day.  Let's go for a walk and get lots of sleep, that will help."
Thank you. I'm just starting to have to deal with this for my wife.
This is a great answer.
This is really kinda beautiful
Oh I'm sorry. It's such a miserable situation. 

I've found it's pointless being honest. All is does is upset the person, then they forget, ask again and get upset again. It's better to fudge the truth and tell yourself your doing it for absolutely the right reasons.

The things that come to mind to suggest are bed protective. There are mattress saving waterproof covers for under the fitted sheets, and absorbent pads for above the sheets of either the washable or disposable variety.


Less sleep and more check & changes for the caregiver. Lots of laundry with some certain detergents.


It really is very labor intensive and not easy to deal with. Checking and changing more often cuts down on the messiness of the messes.


By the time they're taking off the undergarment, it's frequently a sign that they're uncomfortable with it being filled. More changes lowers the likelihood.
There are jumpsuits for suituations like this that only do up at the back that she is unlikely to be able to get out of and then get to the diaper.
if she is doing it in her sleep maybe just some simple tape across would prevent it from happening
Maybe use some sort of suspender on the diaper?
we have had good luck with these.

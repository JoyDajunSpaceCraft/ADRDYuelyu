I am not a doctor, but you may want to check out “Brain on Fire,” a book about a woman’s struggle with a rare disease called anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. It is sometimes mistaken for dementia and bipolar disorder, as its symptoms include delusions and manic behaviour. I don’t think it is a well-known disorder.
You will find that so little is known about dementia. Also, dementia isn’t a disease. It’s a group of symptoms. It can be caused by many things. The clear MRI’s would only rule out certain diseases which may be causing the dementia. They will have to continue to look for causes. It’s frustrating and very hard to endure. I’m sorry you are having to deal with this. It’s very stressful.
Yes!  My mother has dementia (just moved from mild to moderate) and ALL her brain scans are clear with nothing aberrant or abnormal visually.
Also make sure she doesn’t have a bladder infection or is hyperthyroid or anything else that causes mental issues.,
Thanks to everyone who responded. If she ever comes out of this psychotic episode, I suppose we'll be able to better assess the extent of the dementia if she is indeed suffering from it.
This is what I am experiencing with myself! Early signs, but not very significant. Good days and bad days.
Same with my mother. Scans all good, but obvious dementia that keeps getting worse.

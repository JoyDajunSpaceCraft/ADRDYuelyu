It’s just the way it is. My mother basically wanted us to sit with her and hold her hand all day. We did that a lot but it’s impossible to do constantly. Your mother may need more anxiety meds.
Could you put notes from family up around her? Maybe cards saying they love her and will see her tomorrow and that they have asked “caregiver” to visit with her while they aren’t there? That way, she can see them, or the caregiver can read them to her, and maybe that will stop her from thinking she has been abandoned.
What about a digital picture frame that plays video (and sound!) with messages from all of you?
Facetime or Google Duo should do the trick.
It is always difficult to console when some one is suffering from age related insecurity . The caretaker unless becomes a caregiver , by convincing her that she is not alone and he/she can take care of her loneliness  and  he/she is a part of the family. This can happen if he/she is trained caregiver and spends maximum time to gain her confidence .
Highlighting this suggestion -- adding objects or more manpower is a losing proposition in the long run. Medications are more portable and efficient.
This is really sweet, just be careful as this kind of device became a problem when my relative became to sundown and have visual and auditory distortions.
Ooof, good point.

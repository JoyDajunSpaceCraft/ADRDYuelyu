If I recall, in general I think they need a terminal diagnosis with a six month prognosis and a referral from their doctor. But I could be wrong on the specifics. 

I think hospice is always helpful as a supplement to care. But the amount of care will vary wildly depending on their stage of decline and where you are located. But still worth exploring. 

When my dad died they determined he was eligible for comfort meds and two visits from aids a week to help with bathing. They also delivered a hospital bed and other equipment to his home almost immediately. 

He only lasted 36 hours once he was released from the hospital so I didn’t see how hospice care progressed I think folks sometimes believe care will be more round the clock than it really is.

I know you must be so overwhelmed right now. I hope you find the help you need.

Ask doctor. In US Hospice has to be prescribed.  I  understood the 6 month guideline as wel but the doc will know best.
The hospital beds should be an easy to obtain w Medicare and doc advice.  Will help toilet ing rotating feeding  etc


And yes hospice is worth it they are a blessing.  All the support and invisible helping hands you wished you’d had all along?  Hospice has them and are caring giving and will take great care of your parents.
The limitation goalpost can be moved. Expectation of so many months, yes, depending on the area. But I just saw an article a couple of months ago on a patient in one of the local hospice programs who was going into his 8th year because while his cancer hasn't managed to kill him yet, it's still slowly progressing and his prognosis hadn't changed.
I recommend Vitas if you have them in the area. Medicare will pay and you can get recertification every six months as long as you aren’t getting treatment.
Thx.
Thx. I will check

Set up cameras inside the house and install the app on your phone. You can ignore a phone call and just check the camera and see that she is ok, and return back to your activity. I really like having an Alexa in the room she spends the most time in. She doesn't know how to use it and her daughter is the only person who calls it to calm her down when the sundowning gets bad. That way she can see your face when you video call her, and it just makes them feel better to SEE you. I don't leave my grandma with dementia alone in a room other than the bathroom unless I have the camera on. Mine is 86 and if she manages to take 2 steps without supervision she will fall. I took my first vacation after 1 and 1/2 years a few months ago, and it was tough letting go. Being able to see her snuggled with her puppies in bed from my phone whenever I randomly stressed made it so I could feel like I did my part, put the stress away, play for another hour and then checked again. Good luck.
Dementia progresses at different rates.   I moved my mom across the country to my town and found a senior living community that I would deem "semi assisted".  They had buses to take people places, 14 meals a month, light housekeeping 2x a month.  It was a lively place.

But like you, I started getting calls.  "My TV isn't working"- she'd hit the wrong input button.  "I'm so cold, there's no heat in here"- she couldn't remember how to turn on the heater.  I would call maintenance to go over and help but often I was over there.  Then she made excuses not to use the buses to go shopping but it appeared to be a cover for not knowing how to call to reserve a spot.   She was avoiding the laundry room too because she didn't know how to adjust the machines- whatever setting the wash was on, that's what her clothes were washed in.  Hot, low, gentle cycle-she simply didn't know what to press except "start".

What came next was forgetting to eat.  Or forgetting if she took medication.   She put notes up all over everything.   I took over the finances.  She used to love shopping for groceries or forays into Goodwill to look for a treasure-but it wasn't fun anymore.  Just confusing.  She had a blank look on her face and often lashed out at me.  

Have you had your mom assessed?  What level of dementia is she at?   

I would start now to look at memory care- not nursing homes.   And assisted living often doesn't do the upper levels of memory care, which is why my mom was given 6 months to leave her beloved senior community- they just weren't certified to deal with what was coming.

I placed my mom because, like you, vacations were becoming a source of extreme stress for me.  She couldn't use the senior transport to go pick up milk if she ran out.  She wasn't able to do her laundry properly. She couldn't tell if food had gone bad- dementia robbed her of her sense of smell.

Memory care- good memory care- will be full of activities all day long and honestly, I was headed for a heart attack with the stress of calls over nothing or calls of confusion in the middle of the night or worrying the iron was left on, etc.

You also can consider respite care while you travel- some facilities do short term stays.
I work in the gerontology field and also had a mother with early onset dementia. I’m sorry to say that things aren’t going to get any easier. Put a care plan in place and identify your support system now. Do not wait any longer. Finding a professional Care Manager who can offer advice and guidance is a good first step. If you are in the US, www.aginglifecare.org is a good place to search for one of these professionals in your area. If you don’t already have power of attorney, talk to a lawyer and arrange to have that put in place ASAP. This is an incredibly stressful situation to deal with and you won’t be able to do it alone, it takes a village. Honestly, unless you can afford for her to have 24hr care in place in her home eventually, I would consider placement sooner rather than later. The stress you are dealing with now is nothing compared to what will come later on as her needs increase, and it will affect your life negatively if you do not plan ahead and prepare. I am so very sorry to hear you are going through this, my heart goes out to you. I don’t mean to be negative but don’t want to sugar coat it either. It is an awful thing to see a loved one go through, and often harder on family members than it is on the individual themselves. 

The repetitive calling is a common issue for individuals with dementia and it can be very frustrating. A common solution is to take away the phone or limit phone access, but of course this can be problematic in a home setting with limited supervision in place. I have also heard of a service called teleCalm which limits repetitive calling, but I haven’t seen it in action myself and cannot vouch for its effectiveness.

Wishing you peace of mind and a smooth journey. ❤️
If you use cameras, make sure she can’t easily get to them because she might unplug them.  My mom would unplug any gadget (including the PC) over and over again. 

A memory care unit is paramount if she can afford it.
Only child here too.  I'm not sure but you need to get the rest of your family involved if that's all option or bring some close friends in on this. You'll need them if possible.  

I would also find an elder care lawyer and get control of all of her credit cards, bills, etc get PoA.
What you can expect: she will eventually forget to use the phone, and she will forget other things as well like how to use the toilet and how to take care of basic hygiene. Her personality may change but all in all, she’s still the same person. 

What you can do: I highly recommend having someone come by more often than an hour a day as it progresses, because it will be easier for an outsider to deal with than you. Studies suggest that in early stages, being in a memory care facility slows the progression of dementia. In later stages though, it could make things worse. I also recommend looking in to Validation Theory for dementia. In short, it basically says don’t correct them or remind them they’re calling over and over because it makes them scared and confused and even aggressive. Instead, validate their feelings and communicate on an emotional level. 

Regardless of the cause, everyone’s progression is at different rates but all in all the stages look the same.

I realize your post is over a month old, but I just now saw this and I'm sure the issues themselves continue on. I was my mom's caregiver for 5+ years and I know help my stepmom care for my dad.I can relate first-hand to the types of issues you are having. You mentioned you have someone coming in 1 hour a day, which can certainly help. We resisted for a while, because of the financial commitment, but finally hired a caregiver to be at the house for 4 hours twice a week. We used a reputable agency and it took a few people to find the right fit, and was a real game changer for both my dad and us. They play games, she helps with light house work and they have much more quality time to sit and talk. If your mom lives alone, this could help with loneliness which could also reduce some of the phone calls.

Earlier, u/ladythebug commented on teleCalm. I created [teleCalm](https://teleCalmProtects.com), so I'm a bit bias and not going to try and sell you on it -- but you can certainly give them a call to see if it's a right fit for you to stop the unwanted calling habits.
I work memory care, that seems like the best option for your mom to me. Many of the families here have cameras, and if you live close by you can still visit every day.
Having someone check on her hopefully will help.  My Mom sounds about the same level, I do finances,  take her on errands,  etc..  Hired my friend to spend a few hours with her three days a week when I'm working.   The more my Mom socializes the better she is.  I hope the same for your mom.  It's so hard, especially at first.  I remember thinking I was gonna die before her from the stress 😲
I never had to go through that with my mom but she always gave me a scare cause she was always getting lost :( this was before we knew she had Dementia, but she will eventually stop calling you slowly and one day you’ll start to wonder when they stopped.

What to expect (from my experience): 

1.She may start getting angry with you. My mom was only 53 when she was diagnosed with advanced Dementia and she had to stop working… when she stopped she got angry because she was confused and she wasn’t doing something to engage her brain anymore ( we all work full time ). She would argue and yell at us for a good 3-4 months. 

2. She may eventually start talking to herself and start hallucinating, for a while my mom would have whole conversations with herself laughing and all that and she would look at me waiting for me to respond and i would just nod and laugh too (she was speaking gibberish) and when it got dark she would tell me she’s scared and when i asked her what she’s afraid of she would point to the corner and just start talking gibberish again. Her Neurologist said that hallucinating is normal for advanced stages.

3. As she falls deeper into Dementia she will want more sweet foods. My mom currently has stopped eating actual foods and will only eat it if it’s sweet. I gave her a piece of chicken breast one day and she told me she liked it but the next day my boyfriend said he found pieces of it stuffed in the sofa. 

4. Aggression is real. Recently I’ve had to experience the aggressive behavior that comes with this disease :( it’s really heart breaking but… nothing you can really do except calm them down and validate their feelings. 

5. Hygiene slowly goes out the window… currently dealing with this too. IDK if this is for everyone, but my mom has stopped wanting to brush her teeth and wanting to shower. She gets extremely agitated.

5. Be prepared for her not to know who you are… I stopped asking if my mom knew who I was. It really broke my heart … but the last time I asked she told me she didn’t remember & she pointed to her heart and said I know. 

I’m sure I have more but those are the ones that really stick out to me. 


What should you do? 
1. Exercise her brain doing simple puzzles or anything to get her mind going! The saying is true if you don’t use it you lose it.

2. routines are a must ! having a routine will help in the long run because they’ll sorta remember that they do this everyday, especially when it gets harder for them. 

3. Show them pictures to help them remember that particular memory and people  listen to their favorite songs or do their favorite activity. 

4. be patient, it’s hard but they’re basically going back to being a child again so if you get frustrated walk away and calm down before interacting. My experience is that my mom held onto that negative feeling if we were raising our voice to her or getting upset and she would be in a bad mood for a good part of her day. 

5. Invest into some slip on shoes like sandals or vans it’s easier to put them on, invest in some pants that have no buttons or zippers, it’ll be easier for them in the long run to just pull them down to go to the bathroom or change. 

6. Don’t be afraid to ask for help ! Take care of yourself mentally and physically. 

Hope this helps !
You have a lot of comments above that I read and have said a lot I would say. If finances allow please save yourself the trouble and put her in memory care assisted living, she will be happy, you will be tranquil she is ok. Win win. They need 24 hour care.
Did the same.  Set up a nest smoke alarm in the kitchen, 2 way Nest Cam iQ in the kitchen so you can talk to her through that, base of the stairs and driveway.
holy shit. are you me? i feel the same. I came close to checking myself into the ER today. I'm looking at memory care facilities now. I don't know what I would do without family.
This is the same thing that happened to my nan. First was the TV, next was washing. Now she keeps moving her clothes around. She went into assisted living last week because she started walking around at night/early hours of the morning in her pjs and it's started getting cold. It was dangerous as she lives near a road and didn't know where she was going. She seems happy at the facility though! She already has new friends and helped with the Christmas decorations and they said she was low on iron so they put her on iron pills and she's got colour back in her face. They have loads of activities and a memory man that comes in and works on memory tasks. I was so scared about her going into assisted living but it's really good for her. She just gets a bit upset when we visit and go to leave as that's when she starts wondering why she can't come with us which broke my heart. It's such a sad disease :( I can't stop thinking about how my nan has been robbed of her final years. She makes no sense and is slowly becoming unrecognisable as the person I knew. She called me "lovely" the other day then 2 seconds later called me a little bitch. Not language she would usually use. Dementia is so heartbreaking.
Thank you so much. I already have POA in place and have tackled all the major financial things, It's a shame how much scams against the elderly are out there. If I had more time I would push to put people, including some doctors, in jail.

Thank you for not sugar coating, I know it is just going to require more and more care.

Thank you so much.
And there-in lies the rub:  who the hell can afford it? My Mom refuses to “spend down” to a maximum of $2,000 to qualify for Medicaid. So since she won’t  do her part, I’m not busting my hump to find her a place.
Thanks for this.
Thanks so much for your post. Yes, things still ongoing. My wife is leaving her job to take care of my mom, and both of her parents so this is now working out. Things have gone a little more needy over the past month since this post. Loneliness is definitely a thing. I'll look into teleCalm.

Happy holidays and happy new year, thank you for reaching out.
Question, is there a solution for mobile phones? She only has a mobile.
i have a camera ready to bring over. I'm 15 min away if there isn't traffic. the phone tracking is not working as it should buy I'll fix that soon, need to replace phone. knowing i am not the only one dealing with this brings my stress level from 10/10 to 3/10. Thank you.
> I remember thinking I was gonna die before her from the stress 😲

This was me 2nd half of last week into yesterday. Someone is going over there right now to check on her and that will be a regular thing going into the future.
thank you so much for this saving this good luck to you as well.
it's not easy.
exploring this right now. Thanks.
My grandma was very similar to what your mother sounds like. She was resistant to going into a memory care place and was very angry scared confused all the time- always calling us etc. We took her to the memory care place and she is so much happier now- everything is taken care of for her, there are always people around and it’s reduced the stress on her so much as well as on us because we know she’s safe and when we visit we get to just enjoy time with her instead of having to deal with crises or explain to her again how this or that works.
I think that stress takes the same toll on all of us as we care for loved ones.  

I made the mistake of thinking that self-care consisted of letting myself eat unhealthy (but delicious) food because I was tired and stressed out and deserved it.  Recent lab work was terrible.   I am now making time for walking and making heart healthy food and no more junk.  

I hope you find a good memory care place.   And I hope all this doesn't take a toll on your health.
The other day I got the "I know you are grown adult but you should have told me you were going out of town." just pure confusion. It took me a minute to get through my head that it wasn't an insult, she is just lost in her head.
Not today, but teleCalm may have a mobile solution in early February.
That would be perfect. Thanks you.

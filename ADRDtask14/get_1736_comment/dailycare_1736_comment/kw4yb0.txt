Have you looked into personal care homes or memory care centers instead of a nursing home. Nursing homes are for people that skilled nursing services. For dementia a memory care facility could work nicely.
i am asking my peer groups at Dementia Mentors.  Will try to find this question again when i have a better answer.
The safest,best, and nicest facility that is local to family in town is a nursing home and they have a spot open. Sheâ€™s on hospice right now, but depending on how quickly she deteriorates she could be discharged. I wish there was a memory care facility open and close by!
Thank you so much! I appreciate it wholeheartedly.
Every area is different. Sounds like the best option and she will be overseen by her hospice team.

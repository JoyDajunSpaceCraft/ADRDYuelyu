I would have your mom contact the doctor. See if there is any medication or therapy program you can get him into.
You need to have your mother get a guardianship for him. If he’s not mentally capable of taking care of himself (or making decisions), it needs to be done soon.
Does your country have a crisis team ? Where I am you can call mental health for older adults if there is aggression towards people and they will come out and assess. 
I was told to acknowledge their concerns/fears then move the conversation on but I agree it doesn’t really work. Can you walk away and leave him alone when he gets like that ? It might be better to not engage at all.

You can create a guardianship without his permission with court intervention...
Yeah it sucks. There’s not really anything you can do to change his behaviour. His medical team might be able to prescribe something to help but it won’t stop the behaviours completely. 
Talk to your mum about how much she can handle or wants to handle? If it’s too much for her it might be time to be looking at care, even just temporary to give her some respite. I don’t know if they do short term stays in homes where you are but some time away from him will likely be good for her.

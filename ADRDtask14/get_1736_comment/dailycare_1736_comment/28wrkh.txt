A few months ago my mother started having seizures. I had no idea it was part of the normal process. She takes medication for it now. Each time she has one she seems to move down another notch.  And each time she has one I think, "this is it." Alzheimer's is a cruel bitch. 

Hang in there. It'll all be alright in the end. But getting to the end is very stressful. 
My dad is in the end stages of FTD and has pretty frequent seizures too. Each one itself is less than a minute but it tends to happen in clusters where he'll have a bunch of them over a 30-minute span. It's dangerous because he just drops and hits the ground REALLY hard when it happens, he's actually in the hospital right now because he hurt his back pretty bad in his most-recent bout on Wednesday. Really all you can do is hope the doctors can get him on medication that will help with the seizures and just be there for him...like u/color_me_curious said, it's a cruel bitch.

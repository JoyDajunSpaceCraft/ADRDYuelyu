My grandma started out this way, and we put cooking shows on the tv for her to watch for an hour or so before mealtime.  It seemed to help a lot, and once she's back to eating, her body will become used to it (same way it's now used to not eating).  
She still always says she's not hungry (I think it's an "oh, I don't want to be needy, so I'll go without, but you can eat whatever you'd like from the fridge!" way) but once we put food in front of her now she can eat a lot.
will she drink something like ensure, maybe chocolate flavored? my mom went through a spell where she thought food was poisoned and my dad was poisoning her but now she is eating, mostly sweets and my dad is overdoing it because he is a food addict himself.  but when she was distracted she was more likely to eat when she was in that spell, like if we had the tv on cosmos (she likes cosmos, the new one) she would eat while watching it
Its common..  Putting high calorie nuts on the table helped a lot.  Dad snacks a lot.  Ensure was godsend too though sounds like that won't work for you.

Avocado is high in calories and healthy.  I mean just one is already 333 calories. 


In general, I've just been sticking really high calorie, nutritionally dense food for my dad.  I also had him see a nutritionist as his health insurance covered it.
She will not drink ensure either! She doesnâ€™t do any tv watching anymore she usually just sleeps or is interacting with one of us.
maybe she is constipated? sometimes dehydration does that, and not eating, and it also lowers appetite.

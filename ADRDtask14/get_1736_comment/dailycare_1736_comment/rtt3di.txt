So sorry to hear this … after my mom died, my dad (they were married almost 60 yrs) thought she had left him for another man OR that I had killed her … it was a rough 3 yrs until he passed last Feb 10th
I don’t have any useful advice, but I’m just so sorry for you and your grandad. Be sure to take care of yourself as you’re caring for him.
You already told him. Once is enough. It's cruel to keep telling him over and over and letting him suffer at hearing the news again and again. It's fine to not discuss it further or to go along with him thinking she's still alive if he discusses her.
We are having sort of similar issues with my grandma. My grandpa divorced her over 30 years ago for another woman, but he died 5/6 years ago from prostate cancer. Some days she’s waiting for him to come home/take her somewhere, or she’ll keep going on and on about how he’s probably out with other women and that’s why he’s not coming home. So, we will gently remind her “no, remember? Papa died..” 

She’ll stare at us a minute, then evilly chuckle and say “oh yeahhhhh, that’s right.” 😳
SO sad, but a familiar story I read over and over …Dad once held a meeting in his head … spoke to a room full of people THAT HE SAW and gave a speech, he saw it all and spoke very clearly … when the meeting was over, he fell asleep … When he woke up had no memory of the episode, or me of course and berated me for not picking his car up from the mechanic … so bizarre
Oh yeah, we went through a whole phase where she was CEO of a company she was running out of her China cabinet, where she had some Japanese figurines she’d collected when she’d lived there decades ago. Each one had a back story, and every once in a while there’s be a new character/employee she’d brought in “off the streets”.. it was very involved. The Mafia was always after her (I can’t tell you how many times I “paid off” the mafia or some random lawyer that was giving her troubles.), another time a bridge collapsed in there and killed off all the cabinet children. She grieved for weeks, regardless of what we tried to console her. I am SO EFFING HAPPY that we are done with that phase 😳 it was always a roller coaster of emotions for her from that cabinet! While she was in the hospital to be monitored while having her meds changed, my sister and I packed up basically anything with a face in the whole house just in case it happened again.
WOW !! So involved !! She’s in a calmer state now ? I hope it makes life easier for everyone, her most of all … sad to watch your loved ones become strangers
She has definitely calmed down. I had to have her hospitalized so we could get her anxiety under control, and they added on about 5 new meds over a 2.5 week period. They’ve made a HUGE difference in her general every day comfort and happiness!
Glad to hear that … its sad the all the meds they have to give. Both antipsychotics for mental health and others for body health. I hope this isnt a bad thing to say, but I believe the cocktail of drugs greatly accelerated his time. I’m glad he was on them as it made him comfortable, calm, happy and manageable … ultimately he died from kidney failure and possible COVID exposure (he passed early in the pandemic in a home that had a COVID breakout) as sad as it was to see him pass, it was definitely for the better … his quality of life was crap, he missed mom, he wanted to die and finally accepted his fate, he didnt fight it.
Yeah, it’s definitely a pros/cons type of thing. She’s much happier this way, even if it shortens her life span. I don’t think she would want to live like this as long as she has though. She was always a very independent person and you can tell she HATES having to rely on people, even in her new normal mindset
I’m glad she’s feeling better and the pressure can be taken down a bit on you and the family …

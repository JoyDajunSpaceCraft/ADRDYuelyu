That sounds like a beyond terrible spot to be in. Have you gotten her assessed for disability with Medicare?  This will give her access to Medicare benefits (medical and financial) before she turns 64. If you're having issues getting her approved, you might have to lawyer up.

Good luck and much love.
Thank you ðŸ˜Š she does have Medicare. Im not sure what disability with Medicare is, but her disability is the reason she qualifies for Medicare despite her age. Is that a specific program? My understanding is that Medicare doesnâ€™t offer any coverage for long term care. What would the financial benefits be?
oh sorry i misread... didn't see that you were looking for long term care insurance specifically. Don't have much experience there. I don't think medicare has a specific coverage for long term care.

This won't really help actually get insurance for long term care, but you can make long-term care/personal care a write off IF you get "Qualified Long-Term Care Services" approved by the doctor. [Here is a link I skimmed.](https://www.paelderlaw.com/can-i-deduct-my-long-term-care-expenses/) Basically, you'll need a written note from a doctor saying she needs it, and depending how much your paying it may not be worth it. There's a number that's automatically(?) taken off for medical expenses. Also, it only counts for people who are paying taxes (ie not cash transactions with someone who isn't getting a 1099 or W2). But, I think it does count for Memory Care facilities.

tl/dr I don't know how it all works but, you can try contacting someone to get details on "Qualified Long-Term Care Services" regarding a tax-thing.

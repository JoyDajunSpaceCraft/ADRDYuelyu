I’m thinking the aid needs to unplug the phone at times. Or tell him that a repair man is coming or anything to make him feel ok and move on.
My mom is only 76 and does this to my sister nonstop. All day she gets calls about the tv or cookies or whatever. She forgets she already called and calls again, even with the aide there. She finds ways to call even if the phone is unplugged or discharged. The other day, she figured out how to call from an iPad. 

I have no ideas for you, just sympathy
You may think this is harsh, but it may be time to take the phone away.  He’s lost the ability to use it reasonably.  It’s disrupting your Mother’s job, which is unnecessary.  If it would make everyone feel better, just take it away while the aide is there.

Another solution is to have the doctor prescribe medicine for his anxiety, which is at the root of the phone calls.  At the proper dose, I almost guarantee that the phone calls will decrease.  My Dad had an awful time with anxiety until we got it under control, he’s much better now.
Have you thought of finding better ways to restrict phone/ technology usage?
She needs the phone for emergencies as she is asking about 40% of the time. We have no more money for more help and are working in that. Her helpers seem useless to keeping her off the phone. My sister turned her ringer off one night a couple of weeks ago. I got a call from the hospital that she was there. My mom called 9-1-1. She ended up in a geriatric psych ward as a result.  The iPad she only uses with aides to play word games and FaceTime with us under supervision.  That goes in hiding when they leave. 

This whole thing just stinks.

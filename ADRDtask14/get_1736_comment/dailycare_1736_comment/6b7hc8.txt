I ordered one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C6J2NSE/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_DitgzbF0913YD) yesterday.  It's due in tomorrow.  My hope is to load a USB and have it so all that needs to be done is press the play button which I can stick a label on.  My fear is that each time it's unplugged or turned off that you will have to hit the mode button to get it to read the USB.  That and possible buzzing from who knows what interference.  I picked it because it looks simple without a screen and has a physical volume knob. I'll report back after I've tried it.  
Okay so I have the radio.  It's compact and when you turn it off it remembers the previous mode.  The on off switch is on the back so it probably doesn't matter.  It won't play off a USB drive but apparently it will play MP3 from a memory card.  As I didn't have a memory card I just used the Bluetooth function to test the sound.  It has a charming accent as it says tuner mode and Bluetooth mode switching back and forth.  I'm not completely old on it but for the price it seems amazing.

You can also consider something like this: https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Music-Player-Alzheimers-dementia/dp/B01B9THLUW it's the most simple music player out there and specifically designed with very few buttons to minimize confusion. Load it with mp3s and open the flap to play and close it to stop. The button on it is used to skip to the next song. I personally hate how it does not have a go back to the previous song button, but it will do its job of playing music or any other audio you put onto it. I've seen it used in nursing homes and retirement homes all the time and is great for anyone with dementia, alzheimer's or any other cognitive deficits.
Thanks, I didn't know it existed.

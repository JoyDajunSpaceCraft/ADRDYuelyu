My Mom already had dementia when she got covid, being isolated in the hospital made her much worse, got her all disoriented.
Has she had a brain scan, MRI?
Always expect UTI, or other infection first before dementia.
I am going through exact same situation with my father in law. 75 years old, was diagnosed with dementia - “Age-related neuro parenchymal atrophy (predominantly in bilateral frontal lobes).”

After that he got covid and recovered with isolation (was vaccinated). But suddenly just since last two days has major bouts of hallucinations. 

If possible I would like to know how your mother did since you last posted and what course of action was taken by your medical team.

Thanks in advance!
I know this is old but I just stumbled on it. My father had covid, then dementia/delirium. It sounds like it was in that order for you as well. Just curious, did your mom recover at all?

I should maybe clarify that despite all the signs pointing there, my father does not ultimately have dementia, and I’m wondering if others have had this experience.
MRI indicated bilateral symmetrical fronto- temporo-parietal atrophy.

Was told normal brain contraction due to ageing...
My great aunt developed dementia after Covid, I think the isolation was difficult on her, and her husband had also passed away. They were in their mid 80s. My mother (70) had dementia before Covid and she did not have (covid) symptoms.

How old is he?  Has been clinically evaluated, such as a MMSE?  Seems like some form of dementia, but whether or not it is of Alzheimers origin is hard to say.
Hard to tell at this stage it's best to keep taking him to Dr. My pa would put things in the wrong place when putting the dishes away, make a cuppa tea and boil the kettle a few times before actually making it. Things like that, not as much forgetting things just more like confusion and not being aware of it.

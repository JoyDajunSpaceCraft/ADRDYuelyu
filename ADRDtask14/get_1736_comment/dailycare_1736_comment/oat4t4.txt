Sorry you are going through this. I would probably look for a support group of people with a similar condition so you are not going through this alone. I would also find a reputable source of information about things you can do to slow the progression, if possible. Unfortunately, there is a lot of bogus information out there about reversing or curing dementia. I'd be interested in hearing if other people have found reputable sources.
Your doctors should be able to help you with resources. You need a therapist of psychologist to help you with managing things to prepare you for the future. Traumatic brain injury is not the same other dementias and does not progress in the same way as it does in a elderly person. You might get better, you might plateau or you might get worse. Probably some combination of the three. You need to develop some good habits now, like keeping a schedule, organization, easy hobbies you like, language and physical therapy exercise, a support group and finding resources. You will need meds. take them. Do not self diagnose.

I'm not self diagnosing, I have several doctors already documenting the problem.  


And I'm trying to find resources, that's what my question was.  I can't find resources for young people (30 and under), only really for caretakers of older people.
My neurologist is already aware and part of the conversation, she referred me to OT and I'm doing a few cognitive decline tests over the next few weeks.  I don't have records of my prior injuries because I was not allowed to get medical attention for them.

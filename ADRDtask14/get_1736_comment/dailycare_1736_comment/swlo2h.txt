Are you seeing signs other than those related to TV or movies? I wouldn’t be concerned if it’s only related to pop culture type things. Can she remember conversations with you about things that are meaningful? Is she having trouble with technology such as phones, tv app, computers? Does she now have difficulty developing a plan and following through with it? Is she having trouble at work? Have you seen personality changes in her? These are things I noticed with my husband who have frontotemporal issues (the most common type in people your mom’s age).
Could be, but from what I've read women going through menopause can have many of the same symptoms as dementia. There are also some nutrient/vitamin deficiencies that have some of the same symptoms. May be time to bring up her getting a check up to check on those things. From the people I've talked to, the symptoms from menopause can be especially bad, but once it's over their cognitive issues also go away.
Sounds like me with my menopause brain!

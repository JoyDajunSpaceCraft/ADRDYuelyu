Yes, I make things up when redirection doesn’t work.  They cannot process information in some stages anymore, and their jumbled thoughts often cause pain for them, anxiety, and fear. 

Sadly, rewards likely will not work either, but may depending upon the stage she is in.  My mother was far along in the stages to hear anything positive or reassuring or for is to try to convince her of anything!  She was also very unhappy and extremely angry, and that can often be the case with the move to nursing care.  

I often will say something that reassures, like so-and-so is delayed, will call later, is fine, etc.  We also tried to repeatedly tell her she only had to work on getting stronger so she could be go back home and be safe go home (she fell so much we were often living with her and making more trips to the ER than I came remember).  

Her house was definitively the only thing she clearly indicated mattered to her, not us, not anything else.  Honestly, sometimes saying to her worked and sometimes it did not.  We never expected it to work at all.  She refused all OT, PT, etc.  My Mom would engage only in speech therapy because she liked the young woman (her approach was amazing).  We tried many things!  

I am so sorry that you are going through this!  However, this sub provides so much support!  Hang in there!
Thank you for your tips. It's also helpful to read that this is just part of what happens and you just have to try different things. It's so sad for them and for us!
I know!  I hope helpful and know you aren’t alone.

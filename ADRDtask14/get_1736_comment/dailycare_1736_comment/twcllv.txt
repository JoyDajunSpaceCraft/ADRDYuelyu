Lion’s Mane is the mushroom.  You can get it in capsule form (also powder but it tastes horrible).  My Dad’s neurologist recommended it.  I started taking it myself - I figured it can’t hurt!
There is *some* small study research that says lion’s mane can help with cognitive decline, but it may be more preventative than something that helps after symptoms have developed. I’d be curious to hear anyone else’s experience!
Look into the benefits of microdosing.
How does it help you and your dad? I'm very curious about this!
Look into MCT oil,  it's a refined COCONUT  OIL and Keto Diet .
Thank you so much!
How do you legally microdose?
To be honest, I don’t really know how it helps my dad.  At this point, he probably is too far gone to benefit, if there is a benefit.  We should probably discontinue or, at least, ask the doctor if there is still any reason to take it.  I will say he stayed very stable with only moderate decline for the first 3-4 years after diagnosis.  It’s been the past year that he has really declined.

I am hoping that it may help me a little, as it supposedly helps with the inflammation that goes with AD.  I know that I have one of the markers for AD, so am doing what I can now (I’m 65).  My dad’s neurologist, who is a huge advocate for this, is pretty respected and known in his field (he was one of the main doctors in the Aduhelm study).  He told my sister that he takes it and would suggest that anyone with a family history take it as well.  So far, I seem to have all of my marbles, but I assume I wouldn’t show symptoms until my late 70’s or 80’s (Dad was diagnosed at 80). For me, it may well be a placebo in terms of actual benefit, but I figure it can’t hurt.  I don’t take any prescription meds and so mainly take supplements that address things like brain health, immune health, that sort of thing.
That's where research comes in

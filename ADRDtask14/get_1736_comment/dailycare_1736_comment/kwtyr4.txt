Hi yeah,my Dad had Vascular Dementia and he was convinced there was someone in his house on a night time so the Psychiatrist reluctantly gave him a minimal dose of risperidone.

We were informed there could be bad side effects and there was,it made him very agitated so we had to stop using it,this was about 5y ago .
My grandmother tried it a few years ago but it was like a sugar pill for her so we switched to quetiapine. Anyways, for the sleep it should work immediately, for the hallucinations it may take a few weeks.
Doctors prescribed it for my mom and it took them a few weeks to determine the correct dosage. She's been fine since.

I dunno then,that was why Dad was given the minimal dose, because of the possible side effects.
This was 5y ago there's been much more research into this horrible disease.

"Risperidone is used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or irritability associated with autistic disorder. This medicine should not be used to treat behavioral problems in older adults who have dementia. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.1 Oct 2020
I would report it to the doc if it doesn't get better.

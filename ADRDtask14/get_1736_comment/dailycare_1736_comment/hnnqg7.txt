Sorry to hear you are going through that.   I hope someone is able to give you helpful advice.
Look for senior services or dept of aging, etc. in your state. In California it is the Dept of Aging.  In Oregon it is Senior and Disability Services. There are ombudsmen or advocates who can be very helpful in navigating long term care issues, Medicare and Medicaid and more. Call them. They are super.
Text questions to the administrator of the memory care facility

Then Text the  the exact terms that you have discussed, ask for reply. Then you have the deal in writing.
Some states require facilities to keep private pay people after the money runs out. I know Massachusetts did, at least 20 years ago, not sure about now. I donâ€™t know how that protects private contracts made, etc, but probably good to just check if your state has any laws to protect your mom.
Why are you hesitating to get their promise in writing?
Regardless of the agreement, your mom may be at right so even if they keep her on Medicaid. That you live so far away makes this more likely. 

Can you feel check resources closer to you?
You should be concerned and consult with an elder care lawyer asap. Have him/her request the contract from the facility.

Getting an elder care attorney is the best way to go.

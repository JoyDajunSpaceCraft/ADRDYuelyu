Hello. First of all I’m sorry you have to go through this; it is a hard to see our parents getting old, their health declining and eventually having to switch roles with them. I am going to therapy for one year now and it helped me a lot with managing this situation - maybe this could help you as well.

My mom has dementia for almost 5 years now and sometimes it gets worse day by day and other times it stays the same for a couple of months - I believe this also depends from person to person. Also, it may depend on the care they receive, the medicine they take and family/friends help. 

To answer your question directly - I am not sure if this is normal or not. Maybe you should discuss with a psychiatrist and learn more about it. 

Wishing you and your father the best! Don’t forget that you are not alone and there are a lot of resources online and people available to help you.
Everyone is different.  I had to put my Father in memory care last December.  Tried Assisted Living first. Lasted a few days.  Then he went to memory care.  But, yes, it can progress quite fast or at a slower pace.
This happened to my grandma but only just last year. You said he became agitated? I notice when my grandma gets agitated and angry her confusion goes through the roof.

A hallmark of beginning-stage Alzheimers is an impaired ability to record new memories. Obviously if you can't record, you can't recall. Only at later stages is there an impairment of the ability to recall existing information (words, family members, etc). If this is the first sign of impairment, the underlying issue may not be Alzheimer's, but some other syndrome. You should be concerned enough to try and schedule a visit with a geriatric psych or neurologist, who can try and give you a diagnosis. The visit will be more productive if you can provide to the specialist in advance a written summarty of the family's concerns, so you don't have to be worried about embarrasing your GM. I hope for your family's sake it is something correctible like a vitamin B deficiency.
How old is your grandmother?
Sorry missed it 68. Yes, you should be concerned.

 Look into local/state adult protective services. Give them a ring.
There shouldn’t be a income limit for Medicare which she should be receiving in her 70s. Medicaid would, so I think you might be mixing the two up, which is very easy to do. This article might help.

I would ask her doctor about a social worker. They would have more accurate information for her local area. I would also look for something like Commission or Agency for the Elderly or Aged. These could be another local asset for you. 

Here’s some more websites, but I will warn you they are extensive and can be a lot to digest.

Good luck fellow caregiver. Hugs and prayers.
Contact an Aging and Disability Resource Center for your area, or an Agency on Aging.  Talk to a social worker about the situation.  It's probably not as unique as you think.  They may have some good suggestions.
I'll look for the numbers, thank you!

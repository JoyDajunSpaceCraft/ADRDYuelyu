Every moment is different. It’s a legitimate rollercoaster. One moment you feel hopeful they are coming back to normality and sometimes in the same conversation you get your hopes destroyed. But only you are on that rollercoaster. They don’t have a clue. 

My MIL tried to climb in bed with me. Hours later had to get up and get ready for “school” 

What your going through sounds pretty “normal”
Very normal. My mum had lucid dreams, so maybe that is what happened to your FIL?

One time she thought my brother was visiting her and he had just gone out for a while. She knew he would be hungry so she made a big plate of sandwiches for them. Then she inexplicably went back to bed. I turned up at four to see some dried out sandwiches piled high on the table and she was still in bed. She had dreamed the whole scenario; my brother has bean dead for twenty years :(

This is my lunatic alcoholic gold digging step mom. My dad has had dementia for about 5 years. She has stopped bringing him to the dr. She lets him drink all day   She has made herself the sole beneficiary of all my dad assets. She has taken us off the will. She won’t let anyone in his family see him. My uncle and I would like to know what needs to be done to get her gone. And make one of us power of attorney. We have a ridiculous amount of evidence against her. We’re worried if we take Legal action. She will go nuts blow even more Money that should be going to his care. Also worried it will get dragged out so long we won’t be able to see him until it’s to late

You would think out of 37 people someone else would have a big enough place for the gathering, but if there is no stopping it from being at your grandparents, then, maybe taking him to a quiet room with only 1-2 people would be good for him. I know my mother does better with less people.
Hi it's great that you're helping your grandpa. My mum has the same problem, when in a group she becomes so shy and quiet. I usually have to get people to chat to her and involve her as much as possible as people in my family tend to get caught up in their own conversations that they forget she's there. 

I also keep her busy with some of her favourite magazines and toys, put some of her favourite music on and sometimes I get her to help out with small jobs like helping me clean the kitchen even if she does it wrong she likes to feel useful. 

One thing that my mum likes is dogs, sometimes my friend brings her dog over and my mum is captivated for hours with this little animal, I actually bought an interactive robot dog which keeps her busy too.

Hope it goes well
The noise level from that many people is hard on someone with Alzheimer’s.  A lot of people can be confusing too. If your Grandpa seems overwhelmed, have family members visit with him in a quieter room, one on one.  It doesn’t have to be a closed room, so he feels isolated. Then let him come out again at important times, then back to the calming place.

My SO has Alzheimerâ€™s Disease. Earlier on in his progression we had regular therapy for him with a geriatric psychiatrist I feel it was worth it.  As he has progressed I am unsure if additional therapy would have any lasting effect.  
Therapy for dementia sufferers is often like therapy for children, involving the caregivers also. Try looking for a memory Cafe in your area. This is a place that dementia sufferers and their caregivers go to to hang out with each other and quite often has a good social support system and a lot of info. Try looking up habilitation therapy rather than rehabilitation. There are also different kinds of therapy for instance my uncle in his dementia was suffering from Aphasia, that's loss of work words so he got speech therapy. I don't know if it truly helped his speech which he finally lost entirely, but it made him feel better cuz he felt he was doing something about this problem. Good luck every case is different.
If it's early enough this might be the best thing - as it progresses there is more a tendency to use medication to help with the anger and depression.
Thank you so much for your response.  I will look into those things.

What a coincidence, my FIL swears he drove his old racecar across the pacific from LA to Hawaii (where we live), and still can't seem to remember where he parked it..... goes looking for it from time to time, or sees another random car on the street and tells us it's his and he just bought it. 

We use CBD to help reduce his nighttime anxiety (constantly checking doors and windows, hearing the smallest noise and thinking someone is breaking in) and he seems to sleep a lot better with it than without.
I’d settle for decreasing the agitation/aggression because I still need to work in order to support us both and thankfully she’ll be staying with a nearby relative during work hours then heading to my place nights/mornings. Never expecting dementia reversal but I’ll take baby steps of improvement compared to nothing right now. 

The agitation/aggression would cause her to quickly wear out her welcome at the relative’s. 

In fact, will ask cousin to bring some CBD gummies to airport when picking us up as post-nap agitation particularly in the evening is a big problem. She can go from near-lucidity chatting with relatives to repeated interrogation about stuff she claims to own within minutes in the evenings.
Ah… nighttime anxiety is thing?!?  Explains why mom is so obsessed whether or not the back bedroom on my 2nd floor apartment is “secure”?  Told mom unless ninjas scale the wall, we’re good.

Used 2 drops CBD oil in her nightly cranberry juice yesterday + a 3mg melatonin and she only woke up 2x wondering where bathroom was but no sundowning the next day at all, no afternoon nap and was remarkably lucid as we went to 3 banks & the AT&T store to deal with her finances/fraud reports.  Mythological car purchases were only mentioned a couple times today too!

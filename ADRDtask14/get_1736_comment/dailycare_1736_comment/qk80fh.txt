The typical advice I've seen is that there's nothing you can do to correct a delusion or anything like that. Attempts to correct will, at best, not stick, and at worst, cause distress and anger and such.

If these delusions are not causing distress, the best thing is to just go along with things as best you can. It's tough and it sucks, and it goes against a lot of instincts, but it's the best for your loved one if it makes him more comfortable. If they do cause distress, try and distract and change the subject as best you can.

I'm sorry you're having to deal with this. It's pretty terrible.
Just go for the ride.  You can't change the fact that he can't remember who is who. You can't jog a memory that isn't there anymore. Sorry.

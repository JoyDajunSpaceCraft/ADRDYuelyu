There are many different distinct pathologies that result in what we call dementia. It is likely that we will eventually be able to find the upstream cause for several of these dementias. Eventually we will develop detection methods and treatments. The downside is that once the dementia symptoms appear, reversing them is not possible and likely will not be possible in the future. So the best we can hope for is that early detection and treatment will eliminate advanced cases. 

Edit: This only applies to neurodegenerative dementias.  
Prevention is always better than cure. And one possible preventable causes is water contamination. Trace amounts of metals in our water supply, through constant exposure, eventually bioaccumulate in our bodies. Our minds work overtime to get rid of excess metals on a daily basis. Slowly but surely, our minds calcify under the burden of metal toxicity.
Once more emphasis is placed on purer water circulation, the potential for many accelerated dementia cases could diminish.
Other factors within our control, such as stress, pollution, inactivity and obesity also increase the odds of developing dementia. Simple things, like drinking tea and coffee, may have a protective effect. Green tea improves metal chelation - the binding of harmful metals into substances that the body can more readily discard. And regular coffee consumption is said to limit damage to the body on the cellular level. Drinking high silica containing mineral water is also said to reduce the content of aluminium levels in our bodies, as the silica binds to the aluminium, allowing it to be excreted.
There are treatments that can remove the amyloid tangles that form in dementia. And early intervention with these therapies look promising - but only in cases that have not already progressed far. 
Ultimately, it is the therapies that strengthen our existing defences against attack that are key.
Galvanising our minds with myelin enhancing agents, such as lithium or valproate, offer a certain amount of protection against dementia in bipolar patients. Perhaps low dosages could also be considered and administered to those without bipolar who are deemed at risk?
Actually, dementia can be reversed and even cured in some instances. From the [NIH website](http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dementias/detail_dementia.htm):

>##Reversible Dementias

>Many conditions that cause dementia can be reversed with the appropriate treatment.

>* **Cerebral vasculitis**, an inflammation and necrosis (tissue death) of blood vessel walls, can cause a form of dementia that may resolve when the person is treated with immune suppressants.

>* Some studies have shown that people with **depression** are at increased risk of developing dementia. Severe depression can cause dementia and can be treated.

>* **Infections** can cause confusion or delirium due to related fever or other side effects associated with the body’s response to a foreign entity.

>* **Metabolic disorders of the nervous system**, such as mitochondrial disorders, leukodystrophies, and lysosomal storage diseases, can lead to dementia.

>* **Metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities** such as thyroid problems, low blood sugar levels (called hypoglycemia), and low or high levels of sodium or calcium also may also cause dementia.

>* **Normal pressure hydrocephalus** is an abnormal buildup of cerebro- spinal fluid in the brain. Elderly individuals with the condition usually have trouble with walking and bladder control before onset of dementia. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can be treated or even reversed by implanting a shunt system to divert fluid from the brain.

>* **Nutritional deficiencies** of vitamin B1 (thiamine), caused by chronic alcoholism, and vitamin B12 deficiencies can be reversed with treatment.

>* **Paraneoplastic syndromes** (a group of symptoms that may develop when substances released by some cancer cells disrupt the normal function of surrounding cells and tissue) can cause symptoms that resemble dementia. Such symptoms generally occur in people with cancer when the body’s immune response to the cancer also ends up targeting proteins in the central nervous system. In many cases, the neurologic condition occurs before the cancer is detected. Circulating antibodies against brain proteins are common in both neurologic and cancer conditions.

>* **Side effects of medications or drug combinations** may cause dementias that arise quickly or develop slowly over time.
Sorry my answer was for neurodegenerative dementias.

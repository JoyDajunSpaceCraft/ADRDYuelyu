My SO spends a bunch of time watching movies on a computer at a desk.  I slowly add a variety of snacks as the day goes on. I don't remove any.  Lightly salted almonds, popcorn, veggie chips, jelly beans etc.  at lunch we move to the table and he is not enticed by the food but agrees to eat some of it so he can get ice cream his favorite food.  After ice cream we might do something out of the house and I'll stop and get a snack.   

Don't underestimate the calories drinks can hold. I give him two to choose from at any given time.  He hates ensure etc but loves bottled frapacinos which hold a decent amount of calories. 

I do my best to balance the diet by making healthier meals but his sugar intake is high. At this point I have to choose his daily happiness and feed him what ever he will eat. 

Also he seems to forget he is eating. It doesn't matter if it's snacks or a meal.  I have adapted by handing him his fork after I've loaded it up when he stops on his own.  It reminds him and he begins feeding himself again. I hand him an almond etc. 
Medical marijuana can also help stimulate the appetite if that is an option for you.
You could experiment with high calorie nutritional drinks like Ensure, boosted up with ice cream and fruit. 

Have they tried an antidepressant? Depression can sometimes cause a decrease in appetite.

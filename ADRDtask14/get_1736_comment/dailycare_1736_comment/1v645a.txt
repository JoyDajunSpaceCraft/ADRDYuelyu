Yes - my dad has the same issue. I have always had a problem with the drugs they give, but it's not my call - I can only object and suggest natural remedies.

He really went south when they gave him Loxapine - which is usually given to schizophenrics.  This caused him to go into a wheelchair at 60 and never to walk again.  You can tell by his eyes he knows whats up - but cannot say a word. It's a shame.

The pharma industry is just in it for the profits.  I have heard B12 complex in high does, eating pot brownies and drinking honey ginger teas are things that bring down inflammation and help reverse the drugs. 

Good luck.

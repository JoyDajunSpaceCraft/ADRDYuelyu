At your age, it's more likely you experienced a mild traumatic brain injury (if what you're calling a "snap" was physical) or are experiencing the onset of a mental illness (many start in people's twenties). In your situation, I would try to see a therapist or psychiatrist, because they are usually aware of TBIs and the ways they can overlap with/differ from mental illnesses. You would have a better chance of getting a diagnosis or referrals to community resources from there.

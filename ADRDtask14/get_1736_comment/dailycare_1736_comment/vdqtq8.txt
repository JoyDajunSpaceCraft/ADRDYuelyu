I think it’s a lovely idea that may give her comfort even if she doesn’t seem to respond. Tell her she is loved. It can’t hurt and may really help to comfort you too.
They played Frank Sinatra for a friend's grandmother during her 2 week hospice.  She would give a ghost of a smile sometimes when Frank would croon to her about the Summer Wind.
What a lovely idea.

Depends on her current status, with whether it might bring a positive response rather than a negative response.  If she is still in earlier stages it might be more successful, but in later stages she might get agitated trying to figure out who is in the house talking.  "There is a stranger in the house".
I've not heard of anyone doing it but I don't think it would hurt to try. Everyone responds to things differently. 
Favorite songs and familiar music may help too.
I have YouTube playlists for my mom. I play music from her country of origin, classical music, dog videos, basically anything that I think she would enjoy. We play it on the tv with the Amazon firestick and it plays the videos from YouTube that we have in the playlist.

Perhaps you can do something similar? There's probably tons of soothing affirmations set to nice music on YouTube. You could play it on a tv, iPad, or iPhone.
I think that’s a beautiful idea..
I saw a caretaker site recommending Alexa for answering endless questions.  Might work for you?  And you could also record this loop and leave it on playback.

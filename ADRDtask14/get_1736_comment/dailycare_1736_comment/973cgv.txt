I donâ€™t have an idea but maybe r/legaladvice would?
I'd definitely like to hear back from you about what you've found. My wife can no longer sign her name, but her retirement/benefits company insist that she use their debit card once a month to prove she's still alive.

Thankfully, we have a friendly local grocer who overlook her inability to sign, and accept her scribbles. 

Our local bank, when we get the right clerk, accept her thumbprint in lieu of signature.

Fixed! Good luck getting answers.

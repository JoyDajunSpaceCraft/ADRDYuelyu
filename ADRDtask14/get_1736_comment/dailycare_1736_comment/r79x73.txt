Know that it will be stressful for everyone.  He may have more tremors than usual, and may have some psychosis, such as hallucinations of people coming to get him.  

If possible, your or your mom stay the night with him for a few nights so if he wakes in the night disoriented, you will be there to reassure him.  

Telling him today doesn't mean it won't still be a surprise on Monday.  And count on a lot of confusion on Monday.   You will likely need to tell him many times where you're going and why.  And when you get there, he may demand to go home (two years in, Mom's still demanding to be taken home).  Tell him it's temporary\*, so he can get the help he needs. Then distract him by showing him where the bathroom is, how the shower works, etc.

* Get used to lying to the disease.  Tell him yes, you'll take him home when it's safe to do so.  That will be a moving target always some nebulous time in the future. 

It's  a difficult transition, especially if they're not moving together.  Your mom will need a lot of TLC too, because this will be very stressful for her too.

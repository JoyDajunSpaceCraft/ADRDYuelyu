We just have to show that we are fully vaccinated (or have an on-site test), and go through a quick screening, and we can visit any time we like. The half-hour, scheduled visits ended several weeks ago. Iâ€™m sorry you are still stuck in that situation.
Where are you located? Restrictions in Georgia, north Georgia specifically, are very lax.

They stopped visitations entirely because some of the staff tested positive for covid. Then basically went back to normal for the most part after that. Masks are required again now, and there's a screening kiosk but no limitations other than that.

Kind of mind blowing all things considered.
I'm in Northern California. The policy at my mom's place is that you have to check in at the front desk and get a temperature check, then check out when you leave. No big deal. 

When she was in a rehab place/skilled nursing back in June, they were only allowed 1 half hour visit per day, which had to be scheduled in advance. But they didn't really enforce the half hour rule.

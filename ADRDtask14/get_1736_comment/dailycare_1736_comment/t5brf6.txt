>Maybe a small hidden tracker would do the trick but we do not quite know where we should put it that it will be with him everytime he goes out without him noticing.

One of his shoes ?
We used a device through a service called AngelSense (google it). It was great. My dad had a device that we put in his pocket, which doesnâ€™t sound like it would work for you. I think they have other wearable options.
Try a Samsung Smart Tag they have a hole in them so you can ziptie them to something, so he does not throw it away. The tag battery lasts a year and is user replaceable.  We have been trying one for a couple of weeks and seems to go ok and seems better than an Apple Airtag since anyone in your group can see tag location.
When this was a potential issue with my mom, we settled on the shoes as the best place for a tracker. 

We never ended up doing it because the trackers we looked at were either small but not reliable, or reliable but too big, but I'd still say the shoes are the place to put it if you can find something that works.
We thought about that
But he is wearing different shoes depending on where he thinks he is going
And some of them are not really suitable for adhering a tracker.

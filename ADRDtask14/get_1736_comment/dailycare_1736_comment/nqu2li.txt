My mum didnt recognise her own home when she returned to it. Sometimes (much of the time) with dementia it’s just kinder to avoid speaking about important stuff because it only causes distress and in a few moments you know it won’t be remembered. You know your mum can’t make the decisions so why involve her in the worries you have? Assure her that she’s in a great place with fabulous people and she can go home when she’s better?
Yup.  I don’t tell my mom anything important anymore.  We are hopefully getting her settled in long term care this summer.  The day she moves in I’m going to tell her we are going to an appointment.  I’ll drop her off, and that will be her new home.  The disease is so much at this point that on most days she doesn’t remember the home where she spent most of her adult life, so I know she isn’t going to remember much else once we get her moved.  It’s sad.  She is so opinionated and independent by nature...but she just can’t make these decisions for herself anymore.
I didn't tell my mother much. Any questions eventually faded; when she did have them I would respond with "let me look into it." The disease will do the heavy lifting, unfortunately. The state my mom is in now, I wish she had a question about her home or her past life. She is lost in time and space.
Yes, just try to change/avoid the subject. Over time she will forget her home and settle in the facility. Just went through this with my mom. After almost three months she has finally stopped talking/asking about going home. I’m getting ready to sell her house and don’t plan to talk to her about it at all. Good luck!
This breaks my heart. I lost my Dad to Alzheimer’s, but he was lost to me at least 2years before he passed. TBH, I had prepared to take him home for hospice, but we didn’t make it

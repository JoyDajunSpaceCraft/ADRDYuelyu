I am not in the UK nor do I have an answer but I would love to know if such organizations exist. Unfortunately my mother quickly forgot how to use technology so it was not very helpful to her. She did still remember how to use her cellphone to make calls for years in to her diagnosis and for that I am thankful. My momâ€™s current home has an ipad and we do video chats through it!
Hey LeslieYess

Good to hear from you. I put this message in a few subreddits and have had messages to say that these organisations do exist, which is fantastic. I'm really pleased to hear that you've been able to chat with your mum using the IPad at her home. If you're interested in reading more about digital inclusion I came across this website, I've not properly read it myself but it looks interesting. I know you're not in the UK either but it may still be of interest to you.

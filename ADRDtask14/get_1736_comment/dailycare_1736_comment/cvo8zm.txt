I felt the same way.  The last week of Mom’s life, I didn’t really feel sad.  I think we all start the grieving process earlier in the progression.  I was slowly losing mom for around 18 months before she died.  I was losing mom slowly, and I started grieving for the woman she was. 

So when she died, I had a weird sense of relief.  She no longer was in pain, her mind wasn’t torturing her anymore.  She was at peace.   I have had guilt because I didn’t cry and carry on.  I talked to others who went thru this and they told what I am telling you.  No, not everyone feels the same,  but all of us went thru this and hit the stages of grief at our pace.
Now for a little humor.  Moms been gone for just over a year.  I have my daughter and her family coming to visit for a week.  Yesterday I was sitting on the floor wiping the bottom of my fridge out.   All of a sudden it hit me.  This is something mom did even when it was just us kids.  I laughed a little to long and a little to hard. It hit me,  I am my mother’s daughter.  And thought she is looking down on me with pride.  She was a little OCD about cleaning. So I guess it did sink in a little.
You have been grieving the loss of your father for four years.
My mom recently died of cancer, and I have felt exactly the way you describe. The grief counselor said it's normal to feel that way when a loved one dies after a long illness. She called it anticipatory grief. I remember the worst I felt was around the time my mom was diagnosed, but I grieved during the whole three years she was ill. Now most of the time I'm okay, but I still have moments when the grief takes over.
likewise. It was like I was losing her for several years, so when she finally left, it was exactly as you describe it, a weird sort of relief.

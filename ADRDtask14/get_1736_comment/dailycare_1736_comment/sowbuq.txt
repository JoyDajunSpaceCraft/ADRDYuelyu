Sounds like you're getting a little burned out.  Can you arrange some respite care, to allow you to recharge your batteries?
Oh my gosh I am not sure how you are coping with that. One experience with that, where they were just so out of it, not even mean, it traumatized me. I feel for you to deal with that over and over again.

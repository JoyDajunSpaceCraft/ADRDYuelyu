Is placing your dad into a facility an option? It is a hard decision, but your dad may need care you and your mom are unable to provide. Staff are trained and he can receive the constant care he needs.

My dad had Parkinson's and my mom and I tried to take care of him as long as we could at home. We could not provide care for his hallucinations at home so we had to put him in a nursing home.
Sounds like Sundowner's syndrome. The patient gets more agitated at the end of the day- bottlenecking of lots of stimulation from noise, sounds, conversations, activity and fatigue. My sister and I have figured out a way to get our mom up earlier and recalibrate the day so that as she tapers down for bed, everything isn't so overwhelming.
Talk to his doctor ASAP anti psychotic meds can be very effective.
We have been dealing with the same issue with my dad for about 6 months now. We wound up calling the paramedics during one of his episodes. He was hospitalized and the docs put him on seroquel. It hasn't stopped the episodes completely, but it has really evened him out. If you need to call the paramedics, do it.
You have been given excellent advice in the comments. Just wanted to give you a big virtual hug.
I’m trying to get my mom on board with it but I feel like she’s making excuses because she feels guilty. Once we get him applied to Medicaid I’m just gonna take the reigns and look for a full time place for him to stay because like you said, he needs professional care that we cannot provide for him.
It's totally understandable that your mom feels guilty.  But both you and your mom have your limits and your dad needs professional care.  Your dad's situation is not going to get any better.  Parkinson's is brutal.  Get the ball rolling now for Medicaid.  Next step, finding a facility.  Both steps take time.  Contact a social worker, if needed, to help you thru the process.

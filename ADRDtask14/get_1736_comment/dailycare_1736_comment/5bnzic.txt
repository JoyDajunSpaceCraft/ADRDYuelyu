My grandma only speaks Spanish and I noticed her reading the mail one day which was in English. She wanted to practice it so I bought her some books in English. Got her some Dr Seuss books and some fun travel books. I also bought her and my grandpa a Polaroid camera so they can take pics of family. I've noticed she acts like a kid at times and simple things like those items entertain her.
My other grandma (doesn't have Alzheimer's) likes to color and play word searches. I might buy my other grandma some items like that too to preoccupy her :)
He will probably  remember how to play games he played  as a child or young man,  if he liked playing  cards  he might  remember how to play his favorite card game. Games geared towards children might  work well too like candyland or chutes and ladders. 
I don't know if this counts as math/sequencing - but my mom was able to play Yahtzee with some heavy prompting.  (We used to play it all the time as a kid.)

She also is able to play that golf tee jumping puzzle game.  (Another thing we always had around when I was a kid.)
Trivial Pursuit I think will work well and it's not that hard since questions are general and about popular culture. You can also try other board games with colorful surface and objects that can be held like cards or dice.

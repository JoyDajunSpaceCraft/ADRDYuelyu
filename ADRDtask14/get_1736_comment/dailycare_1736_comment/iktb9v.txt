Yes, my wife had the same aggressive and agitated behavior as zeno mentions, was extremely paranoid, also spoke of wanting to "go home."  Wouldn't sleep at night.  Refused meds.  She is now taking Quetiapine (and Nuplazid).  Amazing change for the better.  Much calmer.  No paranoia.  Is affectionate again.  Not sure which med did what but we are grateful.
Quetiapine was a wonder for my Mum. It relieved a lot of her anxieties and her unsettled behaviour. As the years went by she was slowly brought down off it as the disease progressed and she was fine. Dont be concerned!
Depends on the severity of her psychotic and behavioral disturbances.

If they are mild and manageable it causes more harm than good but if they are more severe it can be a life saver.

For example my grandmother without quetiapine was shaking like crazy, refusing food, aggressive about "wanting to go home", paranoid, won't sleep at night... With it she is calmer, doesn't shake, eats, is affectionate; yes there are still bad days but even in those she is manageable.
No
Thank you very much for this. Of course that is the hope; that we get a bit of her back. It’s nice to hear that it has worked on some level for someone!
Thank you very much. That’s really reassuring to hear x
Thank you that is really useful insight to have, and reassuring.

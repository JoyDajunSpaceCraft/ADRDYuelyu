I wasn't living with my mom, but I did visit when she was still at home.  It's amazing how even just sitting there watching a movie with her took the wind out of my sails.  So, what you're feeling is normal in this case.

Exercise has been my lifesaver.  I typically get up early in the morning to the gym or a run, and I believe it has been the one thing that has kept my head above water through all of this.

Other than that I've been trying to simplify my life.  Figure out what's important and what's not important.

That's a lot of time. Must have been difficult for all of you. Did he go on vacations?  How did he live his life? 
Yes!  It was quit the effort.  I put up over 1000 posters,  get into facebook groups of illegal dog trade,  and also drove to an area in my country that is known for sellingbdogs under the table. We got a lot of phone calls a lot of people wanted to help.  We we're sent pictures of neglected King Charles Caveleres,  that looked like our dog,  bit alas it wasn't Carmen. 
2 weeks later I got a very dodgy phone call and the person told me he doesn't have a camaea but our dog walker into his house.  I went to see him with my dad being behind me in another car,  and sure enough it was her!  He pulled a good Samaritan move telling me he doesn't want the prize money,  but eventually he didn't let me drive off till I gave him the money (I guess it was to make it harder on me to accuse him in court). 
We drove Carmen home and everyone was super happy,  especially Carmen and my mom. 
Carmen was very distressed in the first 2 days,  she's been really quite and hid under tables. But now she's back to her happy spoiled self and my mom takes her to about 5 walks a day. 
It's hard for me to express how frustrating a story it was prior to resolving.

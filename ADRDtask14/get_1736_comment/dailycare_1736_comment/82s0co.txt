We had to stop mom's meds when she became resistant to care and quit eating. We stopped everything under the direction of her doctor and she became less agitated and began eating again though she did have a fairly big drop in cognition. Still I feel it was the right decision. 

I guess what I'm saying is talk to his doctor. Tell the doctor about your wishes for your dad and see what the doctor says. And if the doctor turns out to be one who insists on continuing treatment no matter what the costs consider getting a second opinion.

I'm sorry about your dad. Hang in there.
It's hard, isn't it.

The medication my MiL takes will apparently 'slow the progression' of the disease, but won't take away any of the symptoms and nor will it ever heal it. It does, sometimes, seem cruel for her to be taking something that's going to make it all last longer.
Thank you.
Your welcome. I also wanted to add that another benfit for mom was for some strange reason her balance improved and we were able to stop relying on a wheelchair. Every case is different obviously and it's always a tough decision but there can be upsides and there does come a time when letting the disease run it's course just becomes the best option as sad as that is. 

Good luck with your dad :)

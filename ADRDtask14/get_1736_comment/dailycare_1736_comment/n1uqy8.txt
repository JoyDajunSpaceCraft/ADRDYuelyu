What is LO?
In my experience, happy doesn't factor into things when putting a Loved One (I assume that's LO?) into a facility. When I am looking out for my mother's best interests, I do what I know to be right rather than what her damaged point of view might want/like at the time. She hallucinates and I don't, so I get to do the driving in this case.

My mom didn't go under her own power. I dropped her off and the facility did a great job of settling her in during Covid, meaning we couldn't help during any transition, which was probably for the best. When you have to take control of the situation, you have to think of what is best for the patient, not the polite thing to do. If my mom had cancer, I would do everything I could to get her cared for.
When does one qualify for skilled nursing versus memory care?  Would like to know for financial reasons.  Thanks.
I'm assuming "Loved One"? Never seen "LO" before.
I don't know about other states, but in California, here's some information about it: [https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when-californias-medi-cal-will-pay-nursing-home-assisted-living-home-health-care.html](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when-californias-medi-cal-will-pay-nursing-home-assisted-living-home-health-care.html)

You can research your state too and see if there's some things that will get your loved one qualified.

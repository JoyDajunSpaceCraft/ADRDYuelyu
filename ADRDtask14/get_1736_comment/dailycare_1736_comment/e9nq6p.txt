I am not saying you are at this stage, but one of worst/best things that happened to my family/father was when my father was committed for 4 weeks in a hospital. He was at the gym and said to a attendant that he wanted to die (something he said to us frequently, but was never serious). The attendant phoned to police and they had my father committed. In hospital he was able to visited by a doctor every day who was able to assess his condition and prescribed the correct medication. We also had my father's driver's license taken away, which was also difficult but we are very glad we did. This is in Canada BTW. 



It gave my family time to regroup and assess how to best care for my father. A year after he was committed he was sent to a private care home where he spent the last year of his life. 

I think this event will most likely be a catalyst for the brain scan
Tracking is only possible if someone takes something with them. I know they have pet trackers that are smaller and less obtrusive, maybe slip them into something the person always takes with them.

Outside of that, there's not obvious way.
I heard a company just invented shoes that have a tracker in there. It's hidden in the soles. Its a new product and probably expensive. But might give the family peace of mind.
Devices like [this bandage](https://www.trackpatch.com/products/get-started-kit) are specifically designed for situations like this to notify the family when he wanders so he doesn't lost in the first place! It works well because its not something he will have to remember to wear. Sorry to hear about this situation-- I know its tough!
Thank you!

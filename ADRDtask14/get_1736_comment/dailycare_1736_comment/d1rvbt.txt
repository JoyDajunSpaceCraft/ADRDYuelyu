Thank you!
I think it is a lofty goal but would be helpful. My sibling and I live relatively close to our parents (about a half hour for my sibling and 90 minutes for me). I stay with them when they arenâ€™t doing well and I know both of their mental health is declining along with their physical health. The most important part to me would be the ability to actually identify valid resources for help.

Glad to know people are trying to make things better out there.

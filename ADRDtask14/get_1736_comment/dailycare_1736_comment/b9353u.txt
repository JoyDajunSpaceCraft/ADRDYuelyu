great start ... I always suggest going to a Alzheimer's support group in your area to check on other people's experience as well INCLUDING potentially finding a long term home WAY BEFORE it comes time to do so, it might be difficult since some homes might not have enough rooms/beds available.  Might as well get advice from people in your area that have gone through this in addition to any local benefits you might not know about. 

FYI absolutely go through an attorney specializing in this field, I had to do it especially since there was a house involved and getting all the finances in the POA, additionally you'll be happy especially when things don't go through probate and paying taxes.  

So sorry to hear about you MIL  ... and good luck and remember your not the only one that has gone through this and thrived 
A full neuropsychological exam, so you can keep an eye on how the disease progresses, as needed 

Prepay cremation/burial expenses (to save money and time later)

Make a list of all online account logins & passwords, if any

Make list of all financial accounts info (retirement accounts, pensions, investments, etc.)

Get a checkbook from her, for when your husband needs to take over her bills
yes, you'll need Healthcare POA and Durable POA for financial/real estate, etc.
Re: prepaying for your funeral. 

That struck me as debatable. I googled it and there a numerous articles on the topic:

Food for thought.

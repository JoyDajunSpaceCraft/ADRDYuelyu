You want an Elder Care Attorney not a regular Family Attorney. My dad was able to get it over my mom with her consent. The lawyer knew exactly what to do though. Good luck!
I've just been through this with my Dad. His GP said that the person must be capable of understanding what they're signing. Someone can have memory loss and still understand the function of an enduring power of attorney. In the end I asked the GP for a medical certificate to pass on to the lawyer stating that he was sound enough to make those decisions.
I AM NOT A LAWYER— In my state, which is not your state,  I was told that a “lucid moment” would suffice and that it would  need to be notarized.  Also I would suspect that you would need one in the state where she made decisions re her money and healthcare, but thats just a guess, ( In my state legal vs health POA, are 2 different documents.) Be aware that financial institutions often require more, the POA is just the starting point. Getting a POA into the system at a large bank or insurance co can be a huge hassle and take time for approval.  In my experience, if you want to skip that level of hell, your relative will have to be lucid enough to give consent and prove identity before they will give any info whatsoever.
I just met with our Lawyer along with my mom and got POA for both Health and Financial issues just this week, her dementia is getting worse and our lawyer was concerned as he had to make sure she knew what she was signing. Go talk to a lawyer they can provide options and get you to the right legal provider, good luck

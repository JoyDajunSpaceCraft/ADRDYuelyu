From personal experience, I don't think that talk will be fruitful even if she accepts. My grandpa was aware of his diagnosis and we talked about a week, discussing what needed to be done. He accepted, was aware, and asked what he would need. At the end of the week he forgot. Every time subject is brought up and he just says "old age", we tell that it is dementia. He says "oh okay" and few hours later it's gone again. 

If these talks turn to arguements, there is no need to upset them over simple things like this.
When I took my mom to the neurologist for the dementia diagnosis, the doctor at one point talked to me like she wasn't there.  He was a kind man but he was demonstrating the point he was trying to make- that we could talk about my mom having dementia right in front of her and she wouldn't be able to acknowledge that it was about her.  

It felt creepy but he was right.  By the time we got to the parking garage she had no recollection of anything said in the appointment and had no idea why were were out.

I do talk to my mom and what seems to settle her in regards to her condition is saying "the doctor says you have 'age related changes' but you are doing pretty good considering you are almost 85."   She will often chalk up her memory loss to "I just don't care anymore" or "I don't NEED to remember things like I used to so I don't." 

At this point, I just want her to be happy so whatever she says, I agree with and I also bring up happy memories from her past, from stories she used to tell me a million times in a row when the dementia wasn't so bad yet.  And she appreciates those little bits of stories from her childhood.
The anosognosia means that it will probably not be productive to try talking to her about all of her health issues. I understand that you want to talk about things but you could end up upsetting her to the point where she shuts down completely.
The only time I talk to my dad bout his dementia is when he asks why he’s having difficulty. But he actively sought help for his troubles from a neurologist so he’s different than your mom. 

In instances where he remembers stuff wrong, right now I’m challenging him on some of those; because I need him to perceive that his take on reality is skewed, and sometimes he needs advice and help about stuff he’s absolutely certain of. But I never make him feel bad about being wrong, and I usually go “that’s okay, everyone forgets stuff sometimes”, or “you just misunderstood, it’s not a big deal”. 

I want him to trust that I’m trying to help him and do what’s best, not trying to “win”. So I don’t get up in his face about how wrong he is, I just point out that reality is different. 

And on a lot of little confabulations or forgettings, I’ll just let him have his version. 

But he’s pretty pliable and easy to get along with. 

Anyway, when he asks what’s wrong with him, I tell him he has brain damage, but it’s okay, it’s just happens, and he didn’t do anything wrong to cause it. 

And then he usually cracks a joke and goes back to watching westerns. 

I guess my point is, maybe if you overtly demonstrate that, even though something is wrong, it’s not a big deal, she’s not at fault, and you want to help make her life easier - she’ll chill out a little.
It's really hard. I want to be honest and realistic with my mother and treat her with respect but honesty and full disclosure really doesn't help the situation. I was shocked when I first started reading about caretaking dementia patients and all the books suggested the "Truman Show" approach. I thought that correcting her and trying to MAKE her understand or remember would be helpful but I've learned that it's not.
I have in the past year when my mother in law asks about why she’s taking these tablets, from pure exhaustion I’ve been straight with her! She always says my memory has always been rubbish as an excuse and as someone with a rubbish memory, I understand lol!

The further I go with her illness the more I want to protect her from it! I give her excuses that she’s tired etc! I’ve always loved her but now more so! She feels like my child, I need to keep her alive! I hate it, like all of us and so wish I didn’t have to deal with this but she was a lovely woman before this disease! So I cherish her but hate the situation I’m in! It’s so friggin complicated!!

I understand what you’re saying! When I helped her to bed last night I asked her if she was ok, she said, I don’t like this, she was aware that moment how things were and it broke my heart!

I thank my stars we’ve got her on anti psychotic and anti depressants and have a 3 woman team of carers to help us!

I think you’ll know what to say at the time, it’s an unknown road isn’t, we’re never going to get it 100% but when u do, file that away when you feel U less patient, capable etc! Xxx
I don't know in your situation but with my mom it was like talking to a toddler. The one time we really tried, she freaked out, ran from the room with all of her meds and tried to hide them while she packed her clothes because she was going to run away and never come back and we'd be sorry. And she was going to live in her SUV with her dog and all her cats. After that we just operated on "because your doctor said so" for anything we needed to do without her being on board, somehow that made it better.
My mom is mid stage, know and accepts she has memory loss, and it feels SO wrong, but my brothers and I have started to simply make decisions and not tell our mom.  For example, a contract for deed land payment arrived.  I just put it her account and didn't tell her about it.  She doesn't even remember there is a 35 acre field another farmer is buying on payments.  Trying to explain all that again is not necessary.  

We talk about her memory struggles, but most of the time, we really don't dwell on it.  She seems okay, knowing what she knows, but we don't hammer on it and expect she will remember what we talked about, even after as little as 15 minutes later.
Warmest wishes to you and yours, I commend your caring spirit & efforts ❤️ pls understand my reply is simply sharing based on my experience, which feels a bit similar to what you’ve described.

I understand the desire to reach your parent while you can yet encourage you to consider your timing/the narrative. Independence & a sense of control,  esp now, is essential - so perhaps when she may be having “a better day,” ask her help to you understand her wishes, for future health care planning, etc. If she understands COVID, use that as leverage to explain that you want to be able to get organized while everyone is healthy in case of an emergency; then ask if she has concerns to discuss. If she changes the subject, let her change it and try again a different day. 

On my end, within the first six months of one of his new cancer diagnoses [he’s had several new ones recently] while he was in early yet quickly accelerating dementia, my father asked me daily, sometimes even several times in a day, what his Oncologist said. It was difficult to tell how much he retained; each time it seemed that he went thru several stages of fresh grieving / heartbreak yet was such a trooper due to his strong faith. Amid the family, I was the only one he would ask & it would be whenever the rest of the family were not in the room [tho they’d often be in an adjacent room/listen]. As he was at time still very cognizant/able to make decisions for his future treatments that was still being determined, I gently delivered the news for months in effort to ensure he could make an informed decision whenever the time came. Yet once his wishes were known and he kept asking, I began to worry the fresh grief was wearing on his spirit. Eventually, I sought the feedback of a specialist in dementia care. She encouraged me to fib, and see what happened. He seemed relieved and simply stopped asking.

Then, as other sad events unfolded - our young family dog passed away very unexpectedly, Mom became sick, I needed to undergo extensive surgery - I selectively decided how much to share based on his current health/comprehension level. During his numerous hospitalizations over the last few years, when he became exceedingly confused/it was all the more hard for him to physically recognize anyone in face masks/shields, I went ahead and answered whenever he called me by grandma’s or mom’s name, bc it brought him comfort.

Every so often we still revisit what his wishes are now. He has specific goals that we hope to help him accomplish. Some days he delightfully surprises us with his en-pointe jokes/observations -&- other days we are just grateful that he seems comfortable/hasn’t fallen/will wake up to watch TV and ask for his favorite foods. Because yes, sometimes for us, dementia care means ice cream for breakfast, a gentle redirect or breaking a “house rule” to give Dad another peaceful day, and make a new memory together, while he can recognize us ✨💖✨
For me, my mom sounds like she is in a similar stage as yours. I will occasionally remind her that she forgets stuff and she seems to start realizing it too. I've also started using the word "Alzheimer's" instead of dementia because it is a more common word. She seems to be fighting me less on it since I've started saying it that way. This is completely anecdotal, but you can also try different things to see what she responds to. If it goes poorly try something different next time because she probably won't remember by the next time you see her.
This is much harder to do when the denial is so total; my wife even refuses to go to a doctor for ANYTHING! So it’s very difficult to not try to get her to see what’s happening. There’s no team here.
In my experience, trying to explain it to them so they can participate in the conversation about it, never helps. She just insists that she is not. She actually thinks her memory is perfect despite obvious gaps. Like walking out of the bathroom leaving the tap water running to the point of overflow and standing water on the floor. She may remember the puddle. She does not remember forgetting. At worst, trying to get them on the same page makes them suspicious and accusatory, and by telling the truth ("no, I don't think you're stupid. It's normal for someone who turned 90 to have memory issues, like getting gray hair.") they believe that you are gaslighting them into a Truman show but opposite. So you have to actually do a Truman show in order to gain her trust. In my family's case it's tricky because she can still sense when you're lying. So we have to explain stuff and emphasize nuggets of truth she can wrap her head around. That and, giving the opportunity for her to save face, using lighter language like "so to refresh your memory...." that it's easier to nod along to, rather than a more accusatory "you forgot this"

Eta: later on when they forgot family... it's so hard for them to fathom that they could forget about an entire child they raised. Their mind can't even process that possibility. If they had a kid they would obviously remember, right? Also, they don't remember forgetting stuff generally. Anyone normal would remember all their kids, right??? So therefore if they don't remember then that kid doesn't exist and therefore you must be gaslighting them.
The question, for me, is why do you feel you need to talk with her about her health issues? She has a right not to care about her own health.  I don't think that whatever you plan to say would make any difference.  Just do what you need to do to support her the best way you can, if there are things she doesn't want you to do then don't.  It is her life and even though you have good intentions it's still her life to live/die how she wants.  If you can accept that then maybe you will have less stress.
Thank you for replying. It seems that the consensus is not to push these sorts of talks.
Spot on. If the goal of bringing up dementia is other than providing reassurance, it's a waste of time, at best.

I have the talk as it helps her - whenever she forgets or makes an error, I explain that it is not her fault, it's the dementia that is to blame. This is reassuring and de-escalates the situation quickly. She forgets about it soon after.
I recently posted about a similar situation I am having with my boss. I struggled for months to figure out how to talk to him about his progressive memory loss. I was surprised that he met my concerns with something along the line of "yeh, I know, it's getting bad, right?"

The reality is that he knows his memory is bad but cannot see just how bad it is. It's starting to have real issues with our business. Almost all our clients have brought this up to me.

I'm trying to figure out the next steps, but I don't ever see him fully accepting the situation.
Thank you for responding. We're trying to get the whole family on board with the strategies in your last paragraph.
Thank you for responding. I guess I won't push those sorts of talks, and we'll deal directly with doctors when we see other health issues like the breathing difficulty.
> not trying to “win”. So I don’t get up in his face about how wrong he is  

My father is having difficulty with this. We've talked about how him correcting her and arguing with her is counter-productive, but old habits die hard. 

Thank you for your advice. I'm going to preach your 'no big deal' approach to the rest of the family.
Thanks for replying. I think my father needs to learn more about the Truman Show approach. He's stuck somewhere between denial and acceptance. I think he's angry that his life-partner is "gone" and he's trying to berate her into coming back.
> She feels like my child  

We joke about this all the time. So many of her actions remind me of a toddler.  

> I asked her if she was ok, she said, I don’t like this, she was aware that moment how things were and it broke my heart!  

I had a similar interaction about a year ago. She knew something was wrong and said she didn't feel like herself. There are still lots of reminders of the person she used to be, but nothing as lucid and self-aware since that moment.  

Thank you for sharing.
Thank you for responding. We haven't used "dementia" or "Alzheimer's" when talking with her, though I believe she was in the room (with my father) when the doctor gave the original diagnosis, so it's no secret. She bemoans her old age and bad memory when misplacing glasses, etc.
My mother is the same way. She is angry at me often. I had to take her medications away about 7/8 months ago and she is still pissed about it and says he can manage them on her own! Sadly she cannot and doesn’t even know what she takes. It is an ongoing battle that I absolutely hate. Her dementia causes her to hyper focus on anything she doesn’t like and she so therefore she didn’t even appreciate all the good things she has around her. It sucks so bad. Hate it hate it hate it
I'm finding that there is a lot of truth to letting them live how they want.  My mom at 85 has a new bipap that she just can't get used to using.  I've tried everything I can think of, but I've finally come to the realization that at this point, it really doesn't matter.  

At first I thought her memory was slipping because she wasn't sleeping well, covid lock downs, no socializing.... But, the truth of the matter is she's 85 and following in the same steps as her many siblings before her many of whom had the same issues. 

My brother and sisters all thought that the bipap could be the answer to her memory loss.  She is in such great physical shape, and we just wanted to keep her mind going as long as possible.  She hates the machine/mask with a passion.  Last night I finally gave up and told her not to mess with it anymore.  It's just not helping because she only keeps it on for about an hour average.   It is only good at aggravating her.
Thank you for your reply.  

> She has a right not to care about her own health....it's still her life to live/die how she wants.  

I agree with this basic sentiment, but I don't think reality is quite so simple. Her judgement is obviously impaired, and if "how she wants" includes things like leaving the stove on or wandering into traffic, there can be serious repercussions for other people.  

There may also be ways to reduce her suffering if we can understand a problem, like with her breathing struggles. So I posted my question to get some perspective on how to talk to her. We will probably take others' advice and tell her she's got a routine check-up when we arrange a consultation about the breathing issue.
Yes because rationalising things with dementia patients are really hard. The only reason we remind grandpa from time to time is because he reacts positively to it. I suppose he thinks being ill is better than getting incapacitated and frail due to old age. 

I suggest asking her how she is from 0 would be more effective. Let her voice her own issues. It looks like she gets defensive when you "claim" she has a health problem. Of course you should keep an eye on her to detect these health problems and not take her word for it. If you feel the need to take her to see a doctor, claiming it is a routine visit or the prescription renewal for her meds can be useful.
Radical acceptance-life on life’s terms. It’s a bitch
If it helps, my mom is the same way with my dad (who's the one with dementia). She's only now, 5 years after his diagnosis, starting to learn not to argue with him. I wish she'd caught on earlier, because her approach always made his care harder on her by making him more prone to outbursts, but I guess that after 50+ years of marriage they've got an established dynamic and it's hard to change that.
Thank you too, so very sad! When u see them lucid it helps but sometimes I wish she would go to the next stage, I feel it would be easier to cope with it, if anything so she wouldn’t feel the pain what she’s going through!

But I’m ignorant to the next stage and probably hate it even more! The thing is none of us know where the next stage will take us! We’re currently working through incontinence but I’m still hoping it’s a blip after a fall! Xxx
Yes! I see so many care givers trying to figure out ways to get their loved one to do something: eat, drink, sleep, exercise, play games, take pills. The fact is that this disease has a way of it's own with each person.  I can't see how trying to get them to do something the care giver thinks will help is the right thing to do. Some things have been recommended by my husband's doctor but he has not interest in following through. That's his choice and I accept that it is his choice. I would rather spend peaceful time with him then trying to get him to do something he doesn't want to do. His brain is dying, he is dying, I want him to be able to live as calmly as possible so I'm not going to fight any battles with him. If he is doing something unsafe I will figure out a go around, I don't need to discuss it with him, I just need to act.
You might try You Tube videos such as this one by Dr. Natalie who has a whole series with tips on how to care and communicate with those with dementia:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWnILUjkgXg
I think there is a difference in talking to her about her condition and keeping her safe. People with dementia don't understand/remember what you tell them.  I can tell my husband 10 times a day not to do something and he will still do it because he doesn't remember me telling him.  You have to figure out ways to keep her safe without  getting her to buy into it because she can't.....which is what I was trying to say however imperfectly.  They don't "get it", their brains don't work in a rational way, they are incapable of understanding and retaining what they are told. You have to unplug the stove, hide car keys or disable the car, lock cupboards, have bed alarms, lock the doors so they can't get out. Good luck.

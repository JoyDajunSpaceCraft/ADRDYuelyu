I know it can be upsetting when you are not experiencing it every day. This might be helpful to watch. 
A lot of time you just try to redirect them. Especially if they forget after a few mins. But if she sees the bus say something like "Oh yes, look at all the people going places. You know I'm so glad to be here visiting you."

"Thank you I am a little warm. I will lay down for a few." Then just come back out after 4 or 5 mins. By then the thought might have passed. Or if she's still on it just say "I feel much better. That rest was what I needed."

Also She thinks I am my mother
Yeah I did what you said here, and it worked. She was like "I'm glad that you are feeling better, a mother knows" and then she went to sleep, so I'm good now. Thank you! It is hard indeed. I do love my grandma but sometimes this is so terrifying.
It really is. You just try not to argue and redirect the attention. A lot of time they forget and move on pretty quickly. Like if they need to change clothes "Why don't we get you freshened up. I know I feel better with fresh clothes on." And if you get upset just remove yourself from the situation (go to another room, step outside) because it is better for both of you. I hope you are able to enjoy your visit.

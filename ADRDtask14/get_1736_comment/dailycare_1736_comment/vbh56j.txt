Have you tried using talk radio at a moderate volume in Grandma's room? Sometimes that helps people with dementia because they 'hear' someone in the next room talking, and they think that they're not alone, the other person is just out of sight.
Does the grandma have access to a phone? My fiance's brother could talk on the phone all day (he hasn't been diagnosed with Dementia, but likely has early onset). That keeps him occupied as well as having an Amazon Firestick where he can talk into the remote and watch whatever he could ever want. My fiance works 24 hour shifts so I'm with his brother the majority of the time and he gets that way too. Thinks he should spend every waking moment with him, but I've told him he still needs to have his own life. He still needs to workout, be healthy, see his own friends, etc.
Is that substantially different than having an audio book or TV in the same room on? It might be worth a try, we have a TV in the kitchen, but I'm foreseeing difficulty with that. The upstairs is our space so she stays out of that area (she can't really go up and down stairs and is afraid of falling anyway). If we ever are upstairs and go down into the kitchen and she hears someone she will go to investigate and generally won't leave the kitchen while you are there (I think this is called trailing). I'm also imaging that she is just going to turn the TV off.  I also don't doubt that she will go start crying if we tell her why the TV is on.

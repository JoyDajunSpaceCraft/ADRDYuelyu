It’s been a few years since I checked but the downside to these types of devices is they have to be charged often.  I decided that it wouldn’t work well for my situation because it would need nightly charging.  I hope you find one that works for you.  
Good idea. Has to be something that makes sense and affordable. 
You could try a Tile but the range is pretty limited, the best one is up to 200ft. Does he take his phone with him? If he has a smart phone, you could put the app Life360 on it. I use it with my mom.
I have my fathers' phone (flip phone) on my cell phone plan and when he would decide to go out for a walk I was able to track his phone.  The advantage for using a cell phone is that you can call  as well as track it.

That's why we installed institution locks on all exterior doors instead. They ain't getting out unless you want them to get out.

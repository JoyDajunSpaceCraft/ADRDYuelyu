I'd suggest talking to Office of Aging (or similar) in the Texas county you'd like to move him to. I think a hospital social worker might tell you the same. 

Approval for long term care facilities and Medicaid varies from state to state so if you feel that the move to Texas is imminent it's best to talk with a social worker in that county who can help you determine what he's eligible for and what services are offered. 

Best of luck, this part can be very, very frustrating.
Not sure of his age but it appears that he is under 62 if you are applying for Social Security Disability.  Medicaid (not to be confused with Medicare) has different rules in each state including asset recovery.  States have residency requirements - so your father would have to live in Texas for a period of time before qualifying for Medicaid.  He might qualify for Medicaid in California but it will not transfer to Texas. Medicaid covers at least 70% of the residents in long term care (the others either pay cash or have a long term care policy).  Is there someone who can care for him in Texas while he establishes residency?  Is there a facility that you are considering in Texas?  It would be prudent to contact that facility and speak with the admission coordinator.   This is a good web site: [https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/1640](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/1640)

This is very difficult and I am so sorry that you are shouldering this without much support.
Call the ADRC in Texas since you hope to move him there.  They will walk you through everything and tell you what your options are.

Here's the number for California in case you need it.    It's called Area Agency on Aging in California.  [https://aging.ca.gov/Find\_Services\_In\_My\_County/](https://aging.ca.gov/Find_Services_In_My_County/)

Actually, start with the people in California since he lives there.  If your dad needs to be in a memory care facility right now, he can move in while the Area Agency on Aging helps you get Medicaid funding for him.
Thank you so much for your advice and well-wishes. It is frustrating but I am determined to give my best for my dad.
Thank you so much for your kind advice. I had not even considered residency! I don't believe my siblings can offer the same care and attention but we should still talk about it. Thank you for these suggestions and the link.

Seems like a great idea. The worst thing about dementia for me is how it removes all those stories, all those memories. Writing them down or recording them digitally would be a great way to preserve them.
I think it's a compassionate idea and may be good for some to be able to view, just not me. My mom (who has vascular dementia) isn't quite the same clever, astute, and independent woman who raised me, and it's difficult for me having had to almost switch positions in which I'm the adult who looks after her, as if she's a child in some ways.
That was my thinking. I just need a way to get to the session (the first half an hour would be taken up by me trying to get there, probably), and I will start the project.

Do you think that there would be anywhere else for me to post this idea on here so I can get some more opinions? I posted here first because, well, it's this that I'm going to be talking about.
I can understand that entirely. I know it will be interesting feedback when I find out what the careers say about the idea. I'm not sure on the timescale yet. I can understand it may be hard, but it's more focussed on the people who are not currently affected by dementia in any way, so that they can try and understand it better.

Thank you very much for the feedback.
The activity of this sub fluctuates it seems. I'm not sure which other subs to try to be honest.
I'll stick to this one until I actually manage to create it (may be some time), then.

Once they go into memory care, they donâ€™t have to have personal phones and usually settle in after a few weeks.
Wow. I don't know the answer. My family no longer lives in my mom's town so she can't stay in her own home. I think about quitting my job to go take care of her at home. But I see that may not work out at these later stages. Good job on caring for your grandma so well!
I'm in a similar boat, except I live with mine. Her behavior when I'm not here is 300x worse than it is when I'm here. She calls the caregivers fat, lazy, stupid etc. all day long, chases them around the house, threatens to call the police, etc. Every once in a while we get someone she really gels with that she enjoys for a few days then eventually turns on them too. The caregivers know what they are signing up for, and are *hopefully* trained accordingly, just as they would be in memory care.

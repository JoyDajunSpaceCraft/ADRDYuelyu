My mom was an constant, invariable user of eyebrow pencil.

One day she came out of the bathroom with her eyebrows done up, just like always, except, lipstick...

I thought it was hilarious, but my sister had a bit of a cow about it!
I love it. We once switched my mothers eyebrow pencil with blue eyeliner. Still makes me giggle after all these years.

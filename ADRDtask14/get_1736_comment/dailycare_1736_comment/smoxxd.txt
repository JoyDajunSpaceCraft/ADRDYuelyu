You are not responsible for your parents’ choices!  Know this, deep in your heart.  Just as parents have to let their children out on their own, you need to let your parents be out on their own.  Your wish to be within driving distance is compassionate.  Take care yourself and your partner.  Don’t freefall, just fly!
Your parents are free to make their own life choices even if they are poor choices. You have the right to make your own life separate from theirs. Your local library and possibly your local seniors center will have resources about setting boundaries with your parents. 

You can still be a good son while being just their son - make sure they are aware of resources to help them, even if they won’t use them. Call them to tell them good news or interesting stories, visit once in a while or take them out for coffee. Don’t get sucked into their lives, you have your own to live. 

All the best to you
They they want to enjoy life, let them! You do the same! Move out of state. Believe me when I tell you, you will both be better off without each other. You can't do anything of substance for them that can't be done by others, except enable their dysfunction.
Went through this with my own parents, honestly you cannot change them at this point. Make a life for yourself without any guilt. I do check in with my mom( dad deceased) at least once a week and organize repairs to her home and take her to the dr but I live close by. Your parents aren’t really that old at this point.
Solid advice.
Look at it this way: the duty of parents is not to raise a child long enough to survive to an age where they can take care of themselves and bring children of their own into world (not saying you have to have kids, just that you should be able to). At a certain point, you have to finish the job yourself. 

If you are prematurely trying to take care of them, you won't be able to fully mature and achieve independence. In a weird way, feeling guilty and postponing your life is like trying to remain a child. Children are very self-centered and think they are responsible for everything bad that happens in their world and so they alter behavior to try to fix things. But since they are only children, they can't fix their parents problems, so it only causes them problems, usually in the form of some kind of mental illness (which may lead to physical illness). 

Imagine if you were five years old and your house caught fire. What is your duty as a child in this situation? You may scream, warn your parents, and grab a pet, but ultimately you have to run out of the burning house. If you try to drag your parents out, you will all certainly die. But if you escape, from a place of security and clarity you are better equipped to do something that will actually help them, such as screaming for help or finding an adult who can rescue them. Don't amplify your self-importance by thinking you can save them, that's just your mental illness talking. Make something of your life, finish growing up, and then you can help them.

There’s a feature of dementia and other severe mental illness called “anosognosia,” that basically means that the patient is incapable of being aware of, or seeing the features of their own illness. So they may understand that their memories are slipping (my mother often tells me that she is “good at forgetting”) but they do not grasp that they have an illness that will get worse over time, and eventually cause their death.
When my dad was 1st diagnosed he knew and mostly understood his diagnosis. Then he moved to forgetting the diagnosis but knowing that there was something wrong with his brain. Now he lives mostly in his own world, which is not always a good thing but it has stopped the constant requests to go to the doctors.
Unfortunately, in my personal situation, Dad is lost within his own mind and reality. He doesn’t understand the word, the diagnosis, or that he has it. Sad to witness. BUT, he has some health issues that he then also cannot remember or worry about. Double edge sword.
My mom was very aware of her deficiencies for the first few stages of the disease. This caused so much mental anguish and turmoil. It was heartbreaking to witness. It was almost a blessing when she progressed to the point of not knowing the difference. Of course, I wouldn't normally want her to degenerate further. But at least she could have some peace.
My dad told me his diagnosis several years ago. Now he’s forgetting big chunks of the past few decades (3rd wife, for example) and he knows there’s something “going on” but he can’t remember why. 

He asked me a month ago and I told him “You have brain damage, not because you did anything wrong. Sometimes it just happens.” He said, “Oh. I guess that’s something for me to think about... Oh, I won’t - I’m just going to forget it!”

(He reads the newspaper every day and a couple of weeks ago he asked me, “What’s covid-19?” I’m moving him to assisted living this month while he can still remember well enough to get used to a new place. 🤞🏼)
My dad knew. He spent all his time on the computer playing brain games and researching it. It was awful. He's moved beyond that now. The worst part is that his twin brother has it and still knows. He visits my dad and sees his future. I can't imagine the terror of that.
My mom knew she had “short term memory loss” and always thanked my wife and I for our help alll the way til the end. She had a 5 year battle. In fact, it made me cry when the day before she died, she said “thank you for everything you do for me.” I miss her, but I really hated to see her struggles every day.
My MIL outright denies it. When I tell a medical professional, she argues about it. She's in nursing home care and thinks it's just us being mean and not wanting to deal with her.
He was already telling people "I'm old, my memory is getting worse," whenever someone told him to remember something few years before the tests. We received the actual diagnosis at the same time, doctor told us in front of him after the initial tests were completed. 

Unfortunately, he doesn't remember it clearly. He knows he is taking more than blood pressure medicine, and the thing I stick to him is about memory. He doesn't understand what dementia is, he just thinks he is old.
My wife clearly has dementia; everybody knows, but she vehemently and angrily denies it all and REFUSES to see a dr for almost ANYTHING. I’m near to setting an ultimatum- dr or I leave. And I will because I have to.
No, he doesn’t know. I mean, I’m sure he knows on some level, but it’s been outside his realm of understanding since day 1. Grandfather had a stroke and bam, he had no idea where home was.
I tell my mom she has an atrophy in her brain, but I never outright say the words dementia or Alzheimer's, and have requested her doctor not to say so as well. She doesn't know she has dementia and I believe she's better off not knowing, since she has major depression and suicidal thoughts as well, and I do believe she might take her own life if she did know.
I hate to keep this secret from her, it's really taxing and hurtful. But I believe it's better this way, in her case...
Then again, a doctor once said she had dementia symptoms in front of her and she outright forgot it and didn't understand it, so who knows
My mom had vascular dementia. She used to be the sharpest tack in the shed but she started forgetting things and becoming irritable. She would insist she was fine, everything's fine. When things started getting bad, she would get scared and say "there's something wrong with my brain".  She took a tumble and we were able to get her into the nursing home, where she finally came to a place of acceptance.
My husband knows but he thinks he only has memory loss while he also has significant cognitive decline. He also thinks he can be cured. 

At first, he kept saying that I was telling him he was mentally ill. I’ve finally gotten it through his head that it’s in his brain and he can’t help it. He has Lewy Body Dementia.
He knows his memory is not so good.  He forgets he has an official diagnosis though sometimes, getting to be more and more often.
My mom was told more than once but it was basically like she went full on little kid and stuck her hands over her ears screaming "lala, can't hear you!" Except with much foul language she never used before. She decided we were just being mean and trying to prove she was crazy. She'd settle down and forget over a couple of days and we just stopped trying to tell her. Her doctor said it was probably best to let her have her way in that since there were going to be many changes she wasn't going to like. I think she knew, early on, before we got a diagnosis. How could she not have when both her mother and grandmother went through the same things and she was right there taking care of her mom through it all.
She says “my memory isn’t what it once was” and understands that. She doesn’t understand that she has a diagnosis.
Dad was aware something wasn't right, but he only mentioned it once to Mom and not me until he was well into it and had hit the "it's not me, it's you!" stage. He was super combative if it was brought up so we tried to tiptoe around it, but eventually he started hitting himself in the head presumably because he knew it was the fault. He still does that now even though lots of his vocabulary's gone and he has tons of walking and balance issues. It's so sickening seeing how far downhill he's gone these past two years.
One of my uncles was cognizant of his Alzheimer's like 3 years before he died and he had it for like 10 years.  My father did not believe that he had dementia and that he was losing his memory because of old age. My father would actually debate his doctors about not having dementia. Only one time, my father was asking me why he thinking his mother was alive and at times believing he was back in Haiti while living in New York, I told him that he has dementia, and he somewhat agreed, that one time. An aunt who has dementia doesn't believe she has it.
When first diagnosed, I was freaking and often frustrated that Mom didn’t understand or seem to care that she needed to do things to keep healthy and hopefully slow the progression. Later she would look at me and say, I think I’m dying. Something is wrong.”  Now she’s end stage. Brief moments of clarity are even more heartbreaking. Overall I think the lack of realization is a good thing.
To the younger ppl on here: please understand this may not be your future. Dementia is NOT “just part of growing older,” - it is a brain disease, one of the most wretched.

Sometimes they know, sometimes they don’t. My bestie’s mom knew something was very wrong but not what, exactly. Dementia in its final stages is brutal.
My mother (moderate vascular dementia) has no idea she had a stroke or that she is in any way impaired, other than “not remembering all that well.”  I asked this question just last week.
By the time we got a diagnosis, my dad seemed to understand that something was wrong but couldn't grasp what. I think he knew something was up before that - he had some self-insight until relatively recently, saying things like he knew he believed things that weren't true or that he felt foggy - but since he's got this 1950s idea of masculinity, the John Wayne strong, silent, stoic type who protects his family and never says anything that might upset them, he never actually let on.

Now, of course, he's off in his own little world. I hope it's not quite so scary, although with his delusions, well, you never know, especially since he mostly speaks in word salad these days, so good luck understanding what's on his mind, if there is anything coherent in there. Still. I hope he's past the point of self-awareness, because I think the only thing worse than losing your mind like this is KNOWING that it's happening and that you can't stop it.
My mom thinks the reason we have the same conversations over and over and over is because WE have memory issues, and she has to keep reminding us of things.
No
My mom knows and talks often about how she has Alzheimer’s and that’s why she is always forgetting things. I’m not sure she really understands all the implications always though.
My dad knew there was something wrong. It was challenging, but he stay relatively nice til the end. At the end he just slept all the time.
My mom vehemently denies she has any mental impairment. She'll insist she's "not senile" whenever we correct her. She's adamant that her opinion/advice is the accurate one. And she once said she "let me take over her finances because she had been doing it for so long". OK sure, if it makes you feel better...

She's had memory issues going on 10 years
NO
Nope! Insist she’s perfectly ok . Until I show her video of whatever her tantrum is. Then she’s like …oh.
My mum seems to be early stages but it's aware she has a problem. She recently went and got diagnosed.

My neighbor, who is clearly a lot further advanced, refuses to admit there's a problem and her family are struggling to get an official diagnosis because she refuses to see a doctor.
My mom has lucid moments occasionally and knows she has dementia. It does cause her some distress. She used to work as a caregiver in a memory care facility. So she does know and understand what's happening to her.
They individuals may have been told of their diagnosis,  but they don't integrate the idea in their lives as the caregivers do. Caregivers are frequently reminded by their patient/spouse that they just don't remember everything like they used to.
No. She tells people that her “doctor told her she doesnt have alzheimers”. Noone told her that. She also telss people she doesnt have diabetes anymore (she does). she doesn’t understand why everyday i help her get in the shower. it’s because left to her own devices, she will not shower
My grandmother just thinks she is a bit forgetful — in her mind, she is still living a fully independent life and our care for her is just acts of kindness. But as others in this thread have pointed out, there’s a small blessing to this. There are pitfalls and challenges and frustrations galore to caring for her and keeping her safe, but at least she lives free from the anguish the early stages of the disease caused her.
Mum is in complete denial about her early onset dementia. She insists she has always been aloof and bad with directions, and when you point something out to her she might laugh and say “oh yes of course! Silly old cow!”. But it’s gotten to the point now where she might do something absolutely nonsensical (take three trains instead of one, or insist that the bus stop was closed for example) or reply to something after the conversation had moved on.. or flat out forget that she’s already done something she needed to do, so she might do it two or three more times. It’s absolutely heartbreaking because I think she thinks I just want to cart her off to the looney bin and I’m exaggerating everything to the Drs… thankfully she is very cooperative because I insist that it’s for my peace of mind.
My husband heard it from his doctor but has forgotten.  He was aware but not sure anymore.
He's been told. It was communicated very poorly by yours truly and I feel bad about it (don't really want to discuss it). I don't think he remembers it and certainly doesn't fully understand it. He does say how his brain doesn't work as well as it used to. He attributes it to a heart attack in 2017, which might have exacerbated the dementia, but did not cause his issues. He feels like he's improved over time, he has not. I'm not certain what makes him think that exactly, but it's interesting every time he says he's getting better. The only problem we have with his assertions is that occasionally he thinks he'll get good enough to drive again. Of course, he later forgets that too. One thing I can share to be cautious of is that some people equate the words dementia and demented with evil. My FIL was a catholic priest until he met my MIL and when his dementia is referred to as dementia it bothers him greatly. When we probed his feelings about that it was because of this more biblical way of thinking about the word. While he hasn't been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, I'm more inclined to use that as he isn't as averse to it.
My father, 83 and stage 6, thinks everyone else has a problem. Add to his dementia, some narcissism, and you have an ugly combo!  As another poster stated, he gets mad when we state he has dementia. When we put him in respite care last month for 10 days, he said he didn't belong there and he was going to fix the others.  We just placed him back in that home last week for long term.  The owner is an angel and definitely knows how to deal with people with dementia. Most difficult part when we had my father living with us, was not to argue or question his statements.
During the day, my father can often have semi-rational discussions of the bizarre and frightening things he doesn't remember doing/saying the night before.  


He'll often say something like "I did that? That's not me. I must be losing my mind."  Then, later, when he gets aggressive, there's no reasoning with him whatsoever. Reminding him that he's currently acting in a way that he really deep down doesn't want to, does not make him want to stop.  


And then it repeats.
In the diagnosis stage my mom knew.
My grandfather didn’t know he would only say his losing his mind .
My mom knows. She still has moments usually in the morning where she is quite lucid. She knows why she takes the tests to see her score and compare it to last time, if I remind her what her last score was. It was 20, by the way. She knows she's on some "memory drugs". She does not, however, think she needs the medacube med dispenser... Until I remind her that she's on MEMORY DRUGS... then we laugh about it.  My mom is still a very very nice person, always has been.
My mother has this, and she becomes combative whenever anyone mentions dementia or Alzheimer’s around her.
My grandmother thinks it’s 1998 and can’t identify what city she is currently living in, but if you tell her anything is wrong with her, she’ll tell you it’s nothing serious and no worse than anyone else her age. Every mistake she makes is someone else’s fault. Even after having an age-related seizure, she doesn’t remember enough to judge the magnitude of any of this. 

Honestly, I think the only was she stays “sane” is to be blind to all her faults, and find someone else to blame them all on.
Is the prognosis always terminal for dementia?

Edit;syntax
Same with my mom.  And I sincerely hope this is not the case for me…
I'm sorry to tell you that my MIL got dementia after living in her new home for five years. She still went through the phase every night of putting on her shoes, getting her purse and trying to go home.
Slightly off topic, but can you identify any possible reasons (e.g. lifestyle factors) that have caused that your father's twin brother got the disease later?
Did those brain/memory enhancers online work for a time?
💔❤️‍🩹
My wife is in her mid 60s in the early stages of what appears to be dementia. It has gotten much worse over the past 6 months. She refused to see the doctor until she had a few consecutive bad days where she became frustrated with her poor memory.

She trusts her primary care doctor. The quick basic 5-minute test she took in his office made it clear something was going on. When he recommended a neurologist and more tests she agreed. After the session with several cognitive tests, she became tired and then angry — (Bring food! Take breaks!) She then refused to have anything else to do with the neurologist. 

All she has left is bloodwork tests and she agreed to do that… after 3 months.

For me it is one slow thing after another. I joined a (free) dementia support group that meets every other week at the local community center. After 2 sessions I feel so much relief (I’m also seeing a therapist). Like I said, I’m in the early stages of caregiving, and ALL the others have been through it. They are such wonderfully supportive people!

Still, I had a good cry tonight about all of these feelings, especially the feeling of loss. There’s a reason they call it the long goodbye.
Please stick to this. My mother passed at 70 bc she was the primary caregiver to a stubborn neurosurgeon who made her life unbearable. He literally wore her down to a husk.

She was too worried about privacy to ask for help and it cost her more years with her kids and grandkids.

My sisters still hold this grudge against my dad.
Agreed you are absolutely doing the right thing to reduce her stress and anxiety.  They do know, and flashes of them come back to haunt you.
Do you mind if I DM you with a few questions about your mom and your experiences?
Weird. Yours, too? My dad hits himself in the head or just hits his head against the wall on a semi-regular basis. He doesn't do it hard enough to really hurt himself but it's a heck of a thing to witness. Sometimes I think he knows there's something wrong with his head and this is his solution.
my mom is the same too.
This sounds so much like my dad. Everything is always someone or something else's fault. All the stuff he can't find? It's because the care home manager/Paramedic/psw/his friend(s)/I took it. This week he fell backwards because he couldn't get out of the way of his walker that was rolling towards him. So it's the walker's fault. Not the 25 pounds of shit he has piled in and on it. Or that he is clearly missing the cognitive ability to just grab the walker and apply the brakes.
I was told it depends on what caused the dementia, and that there’s like 60-some-odd causes for it. 

But the ones where the patient’s brain is slowly dying: their brain is part of their nervous system and that includes the parts that run involuntary stuff like the heart and the kidneys, and also unconscious functions like swallowing. My understanding is that some crucial part of them (that runs their heart or their kidneys) can eventually shut down, and the result of that is predictable.
It depends on what causes it. By the time B12 deficiency or hypothyroidism cause dementia, they're fucking up a lot of other things as well,
There are a lot of indirect effects that cause death, but would likely been treated better without the dementia. People with dementia don't communicate their symptoms of these other things well (especially later in the disease when they can no longer speak well or at all) and so things go longer than normal without attention.

Possibly because he had a live-in girlfriend who kept him occupied. My dad had a girlfriend but he was alone all day until she got home from work. He had a lot of idle time with no one watching. He sort of cut us out of his life after he met her so we weren't watching. We should have been and I feel terrible but I can't change the past.  I think all that time by himself may have sped it up. Or maybe it was going to be like that anyway. His brother is the bad twin. Maybe mean people progress slower
>*Did those brain/memory enhancers online work for a time?*

I was wondering that, too.
I really don't know. I don't know if the pills he took worked either. It's hard to know what would have happened without those things.
Thank you, this is reassuring to hear :) Indeed, I'd rather spare her the grief. She's already got too much grief in her life already
Sure
Yeah they're trying big foam gloves on him so he doesn't hurt himself anymore as he's got bruises from doing it. Either it's some awareness left or the action's hanging around with no meaning attached anymore.
Totally makes sense. Thank you
My mom isolated a lot, believe she had early onset and hid it for a long time.  Complete denial with her 7 of 10 in her father’s family having Alzheimer’s and her father having early onset.  Tragic.
>*His brother is the bad twin. Maybe mean people progress slower*

Oh, my god, thank you for saying that (brave of you).  It's so true.
My MIL did the entire puzzle page every day until she couldn't. I know they've said extensive education and curiosity seem to be preventative, but she didn't go to college. 

They'd have to do a study on average people who are  just doing puzzles.
Thank you!
Oh yes, agreed.  You do as well.  Hang in there!
🙏🏻
It's not a myth! And he has dementia, no way he'll know I said it.

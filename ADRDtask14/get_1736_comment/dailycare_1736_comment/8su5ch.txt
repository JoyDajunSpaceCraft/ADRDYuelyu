True that they don’t know what to do, but it if they stopped to think, they’d realize how cruel it is.  Hopefully with the aging of America, people will become more educated in the appropriate ways in which to respond. 
They don't have any patience.

My mother's dementia has developed pretty quickly this year since her husband's passing.  At first I thought she was putting me on, but as time went on I realized she really did not remember what had happened to her husband, and she really did not realize why she was at my house.  Since then I've spoken to some counselors and have been advised on how to keep her calm and happy.  Before those conversations, I just wanted my mother back.  I thought by correcting her she'd remember details.  I just felt kind of desperate.  I feel like she's in there somewhere and sometimes she'll crack a joke and it seems like I have her back, but it only lasts for a few moments.  
Gee,  let me think about that one.
Caring for someone who has Alzheimer's or dementia isn't exactly like falling off a log. It takes time and training. 

in my experience, most people who correct a patient are doing so because they don't know any better and think (wrongly) that the correction may help the patient recognize them.  It's not borne of cruelty, it's a result of ignorance.

I can understand your frustration, but you're exhibiting the exact same type of anger and projection that you're accusing others of.

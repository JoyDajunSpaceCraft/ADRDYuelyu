That is severe. She needs to see a neurologist ASAP. I would go ahead and start looking for memory care facilities and applying for benefits.
She definitely should not be living alone. Make sure you DO go with her to the hospital/ Dr. (insist on it even with Covid restrictions) She likely wonâ€™t be able to explain what has been going on or may deny it. She needs someone with her to list what you have listed here.

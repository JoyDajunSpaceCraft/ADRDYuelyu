The Alzheimer’s Association has lots of good information for caregivers, even if your loved one has a differ form of dementia. This page gives some guidance on finding in-home help. Good luck with your hunt.[Finding care help](https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/care-options/choosing-care-providers)
Experience at least with a relative/close friend etc. but priority is a person has whom is caring and supportive and does the best to provide support tailored to your mom. 

I know many use agencies but in my experience the turnover is huge, and expertise is lacking at times.  It is great to find a loving and caring person whom is invested.  

Consider swapping care for living arrangements or other things that could work and advertise (next best thing to a relative/friend is a truly caring person, whom won’t be perfect, but will do their best for your mom). 

Good luck! ❤️
The role of caregiver is a difficult one, and it requires that a person have certain traits to do the job well. As you would when hiring any person for a job, you should look for these traits in a home care worker or independent caregiver when choosing one to care for your loved ones. Take note of these traits, as they point to success in caregiving work. 

1. Patience 

2. Professional training 

3. Compassion 

4. Dependability 

5. Trustworthiness 

6. Empathetic 

7. Eager to adapt 

8. Integrity

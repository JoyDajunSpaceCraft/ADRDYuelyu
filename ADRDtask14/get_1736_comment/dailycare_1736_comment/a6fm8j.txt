I think you’re on to something. It could be that he’s just not processing the information, but to him he thinks he can’t hear it. 

Would closed captions help at his stage?
My dad does this too.  64 with FTD.  He often stares at the TV but can't truly comprehend the storyline.  If this happens to you or I, we turn the volume up because obviously we can't hear the message.  They do it for the same reason except they simply can't receive the message.
My dad used to do the SAME exact thing with the tv. I always thought maybe he was losing his hearing, but honestly this would make a lot more sense. He also would always fall asleep watching tv and movies, he did it all day long 
The reason he listens to things instead of reading is because concentrating on written words is EVEN harder for him  than casually listening.

He often (as in, multiple times per day every day) falls asleep listening to these things too and if you ask him if he's sleeping or suggest he go to bed, he'll claim he wasn't sleeping. :/  But he'll wake up if you go turn it off and then start it up again and fall right back asleep. 
This is how my father in law spent the end of his life: in his recliner watching VERY LOUD TV sound asleep.
I figured. I just wanted to come up with one suggestion. I’m sorry he is stuck in that cycle.  

You’d think smart TVs would have an override parental volume control or something. 
I think there might be a way - I'm looking into it.

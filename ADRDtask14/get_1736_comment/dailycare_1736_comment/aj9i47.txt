Yeah. I'd say you're in the moderate stage.

Right now, we are in the moderate to severe stage. My mom was diagnosed back in 2014 too.
Sounds about the same as my dad, stage 3/7, approaching stage 4. 

He checks the mail constantly, even on sundays and holidays, early in the morning and late at night. He's fine with me but thinks his brother/my uncle is stealing everything from his house to his car to his toothbrush and socks. If he can't find something, my uncle MUST have stolen it.
Yeah, I gently pushed for her to get evaluated for several years but since she wasn't repeating herself constantly like most Alzheimer's patients do I just chalked it up to getting older. Back in 2014 it was just being a little self absorbed and having trouble finding the hospital in the city to visit my father (now passed). When she started getting lost driving around town in 2017, a place she'd lived for the past 30 years... that's when I knew something was really wrong. It still took several more months of persuasion to get her to agree to be evaluated.

Fortunately, she'll be inheriting the bulk of my aunt's estate, so when the time comes that I can no longer provide her the care she needs, at least we'll be able to put her in somewhere nice for many years.

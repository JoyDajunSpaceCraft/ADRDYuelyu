Don't keep track of these things in your head - use a log like a phone app or actual diary. Write down dates and times. This makes it much easier to see patterns and, even in the best of cases, our memory is notoriously unreliable :p
When you're grieving, as your mother presumably is, you can be all over the place with lots of memory slips. If she's otherwise healthy (diet/exercise/weight, blood pressure and blood sugar levels), and gets social interaction, I'd just keep an eye on her. If anything goes sideways, get her checked for a urinary tract infection.
It’s worth pressuring her to see a neurologist. I remember my first alarm bells went off watching my mom try to follow a pretty easy recipe and be unable to get it right.
A friend says his lightbulb moment with his grandmother was when she wasn’t able to remember how to make cornbread one day. She had made a pan of cornbread pretty much every day of her adult life until then. So yes, what you saw with your mother would also be concerning for me. I agree with the suggestion to keep a list on your phone of behaviors and difficulties you have seen so you can have a more complete picture of your difficulties.
The first thing to do is get a doctors appointment, and get an assessment done right away!

The earlier you identify the type of dementia, the better chance you have of mitigating it, and making sure your loved one has the longest and happiest life. 

It’s scary to be diagnosed - and you’ll get a lot of pushback from mom - but it needs to happen right away. 

There’s medication, exercise, brain tricks, diet, and all kinds of things you can do. But you have to get a real diagnosis asap. (Because some treatments for one kind of dementia makes other kinds of dementia worse! So you must identify the type of dementia first.)

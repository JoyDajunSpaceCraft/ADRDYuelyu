Where in the world is this lady that they're denying her meds in the early stages? That's insane! That's when you want to slow progression, if possible. Once they're more severe, it seems almost cruel to slow the progression.
A spinal tap resulting in cognitive recovery sounds like they were fishing for a normal pressure hydrocephalus diagnosis.  Cognitive recovery after a spinal tap is almost unheard of though.  How was this assessed, if you know? Also, a brain MRI does not detect Tau.  If she had a spinal tap that would have been a good opportunity to test her for Alzheimer's markers including Tau.


If she had neuropsych testing that indicated Alzheimer's disease and a neurologist  eval said Alzheimer's then it sounds like her diagnosis is Alzheimer's and the neurologists can provide the appropriate medications now.  There is no protocol to hold off medications until the dementia becomes more advanced that defeats the entire purpose.

Unfortunately there's not a whole lot that can be done.  Home health aids can be prescribed to visit the home and assist with activities of daily living.  As far as medications goes  cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are all that are available.  If she is having behavioral changes and anxiety that could be managed by the neurologist as well.  

It sounds like you are doing all the right things!
New doctor. Now. They’ll never get the right resources until she has a diagnosis
Not a doctor. Learning about dementia on the fly as my partner is newly dx'd. Have docs considered NPH? The headache, temporary spinal tap recovery and lack of tau lead me to ask. I've seen them mentioned in various readings; again, not a doctor.

This is really helpful thank you! (Tau wasn’t detected on any scans or tap)

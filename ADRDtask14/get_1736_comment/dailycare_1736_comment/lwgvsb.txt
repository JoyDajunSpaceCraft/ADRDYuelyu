My mother has both, her brain scans say alzheimer's. Her psychologists think it may have been slowed down if she had worn her sleep apnea device. However she thought it would drown her and didn't wear it for years.

The psychologists think that so many years of her brain not getting oxygen speed up the dementia. We're not sure if it would've gotten better because she still refuses to wear the device.
My loved one was dx with sleep apnea at 70 10 years ago.  She wore her CPAP for about a month and then turned it in. Stubbornly said the cure was worse than the ailment.  She has seemed pretty Stage 2-ish in terms of dementia for 4-5 years, but is starting to seem more Stage 3-ish here and there.  She doesn't remember ever being dx with sleep apnea or having the CPAP machine. I keep wondering if I should reintroduce it in the hopes of slowing her progression a bit. I will report back if I do (or find out) anything definitive.

It could be due to a loss of inhibitions that some dementias can cause. 

However, it could be something a lot simpler. If the individual recognised that people are treating them with "kiddie gloves" when they are clearly not a child, that person could become frustrated and be trying to work out what is going on, because they know that others are not telling them everything.
My grandmother is not officially diagnosed, but this kind of behaviour also started with her when her memory started to decline a few years ago and in recent months has almost gotten more....aggressive.
No but I've seen similar. Don't know if it's right but I assumed it was because she knew she was forgetting things and wanted to sponge all information or because once memory loss hits it causes paranoia when people tell you things you don't believe. Causing people to think things being said especially whispered are about them. 

Not an expert
This is my dad. 
YES! I think it's part of the paranoia that is common with Alz.
I've seen my mom exhibit the latter. Its probable mixed with some paranoia, she feels we're keeping stuff from her and gets suspicious.

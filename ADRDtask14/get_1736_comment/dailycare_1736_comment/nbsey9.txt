If she’s still alive, don’t underestimate the value of spending time with her or talking to her. Some forms of this disease have people remembering and reacting well to things from long ago while having no short-term memory. And kindness is kindness regardless.

Also, there’s the story of the old man who goes to see his wife every day even though she has forgotten who he is. His reason? “I haven’t forgotten who SHE is.”

If it’s really too late, you can be confident she adored you regardless. People understand that other people have lives to lead. You didn’t do anything to hurt her.

I work with people with dementia and this is pretty common. I work with one gentleman that does a booming "Brum! Brum! Brum!" quite often.
My dad says “oh dear” over and over, and my grandmother (who also had dementia) used to make a repetitive noise under her breath too. I think these repetitive noises and sayings are a part of the dementia & I think it’s an anxiety thing, like when they are confused or their minds are wandering. It can be irritating to listen to but is harmless in my experience.
My dad constantly pats his leg. At first I thought it was random but over time I have figured out it’s a pattern of slapping sounds. It’s annoying but eventually you tune these things out
My mum repeatedly sniffs.

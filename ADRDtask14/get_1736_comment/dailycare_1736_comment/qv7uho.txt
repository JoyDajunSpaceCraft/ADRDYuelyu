You might look at “tile” - https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/

If there is someone with a cell phone who can run the app
Yes I have one of those cheap tracker things on my mom's remote. She loses it allot. When she does I press a button on a remote in my room and the fob beeps on her remote. It's a little clunky, but it works well for us.
I second the tile suggestion! Itrialled “tile” while on placement! Very handy for the keys and they have special buttons for the remotes too never mind dementia me and my mother who helped me test it out found it super helpful . 

They have ones available that don’t require Bluetooth too but I found these to be a little less loud and a little less practical (I.e the remote used to find the lost items can itself become lost) but if someone with a smart phone doesn’t frequent the house it might be more useful!

Tiles are great for this!
Thanks!  Do you find the subscription part of it useful?
Thanks!  Glad to know it's not just my Mom who loses the remote all the time.
Thanks for your feedback.  These look great and since it's a set I can put one on the keys, remote, purse and anything else she forgets.

I would check with your employer to see what they say. It seems like there would be a protocol in place for handling those situations. And you wouldn't want to do anything that could get you in trouble. 
I know it's scary when they lash out physically. 
Taking care of a loved one in a home setting doesn't come with all the legal issues that being an employee can have. So I wouldn't want to give advice that could legally cause issues. 

With all that said, in my home experience with my Grandma- If she physically grabs me, I try to get her to use both her hands and take them in mine. That way she cannot hit me and I can hold her steady. She has poor balance so if she won't calm down, I walk her backwards until I can sit her down on the floor. She cannot get herself up and it immobilizes her. That gives her time to work out her anger and then we get her up. 

Again, this may not work or (legally) be the best course of action in your case. Sometimes just identifying the trigger can help. If you are able to figure out what set them off you can try to prevent it from happening again.
Try to stop him from attacking you as well as you can. Get some space between the two of you. If you can, just run. Make sure you have a clear path to run if you need to. If you have to hold his arms down you usually can also do that for your own safety. Worse case scenario you just take the hit as well as you can. Plenty of my patients have attacked me. Also try not to stand directly in front of them because they might kick you or spit on you.

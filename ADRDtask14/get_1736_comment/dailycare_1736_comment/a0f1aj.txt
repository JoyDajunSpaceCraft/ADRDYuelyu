I share the same concern but will not do the DNA test. 

A DNA test will tell you if you are more at risk of getting Alzheimer, not if you will get it for sure. Even a "positive " result doesn't mean you are doomed, "just" that you have a  higher risk.  You could never develop this horrible disease even with this higher risk.  On the contrary you could develop it while you do not have the genetic risk.  No benefit to know then... 

There are so many things that we don't understand about this disease,  nobody can predict for sure. I read a lot of articles about it and there are suspicions that environment is playing a role: food habits  (sugar), virus (herpes),  ...  This is why I try to change my habits rather than doing this DNA test.  It gives a (little) hope to be in control 

And it is good to vent from time to time  :-)



My family has the psen 1 genetic mutation that causes early onset alzheimers. My father, aunt, grandfather, and great grandmother all developed early onset in their 40s. I know our particular gene is strictly hereditary. Its less than 1% of of all AD cases. 

It seems that in your situation because there isnt a direct line of early onset, that there is a good chance you can come out unscathed

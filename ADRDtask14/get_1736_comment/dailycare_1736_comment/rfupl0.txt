how's her hearing?  and btw, whether or not her hearing's poor, she might enjoy the closed caption setting on her TV

if she's pre-dementia (MCI), an excellent diet might be very helpful in postponing her deterioration (and, likely harmless to try imo)

see my earlier posts, here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rcx6xc/grandmother\_with\_dementia\_staying\_with\_me\_for\_a/hog4zuu/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rcx6xc/grandmother_with_dementia_staying_with_me_for_a/hog4zuu/?context=3)
That interaction is concerning. However, it’s just one interaction. It’s paired with being withdrawn, but I wouldn’t jump to conclusions based on this one lapse. What I would do is talk to your dad to see if he has seen other instances that are concerning. I would start making a list of oddities as you see then. Document them so you can get a better idea of what is happening and how often. Then, if you are still concerned, schedule her for a physical with her doctor and share the list of oddities with her doctor. That way the doctor has concrete examples of behaviors and can have more info to base their cognitive exams and tests (blood, etc) on.
She is partially deaf (has been for 30 years) and uses hearing aids-- but she clearly understood the conversation was about a dog because she mentioned probable causes (i.e poisoning) and she also suggested the dog might have had a heart issue during the convo. 
She doesn't watch tv at all anymore but I've tried to put shows on for her with closed captioning. She has trouble grasping what's going on I think and doesn't have an attention span for it. The only thing she does in her free time is play scrabble online. For hours on end. That's all
Good advice that's exactly what I'm doing -- writing down all the strange occurrences I see. Another strange conversation happened when she asked me what kind of music the band played that I had gone out to see the night earlier. I said "they played funky jazz" -- to which she burst out laughing and said "Funky jazz!? what's that!?" Like it was the silliest thing she ever heard. I replied "they played jazz and they played funk".  She responds with a confused look on her face--"what is that?!" I said "MOM jazz is a type of music. Funk is a type of music. She continues "what's that?" I said "mom they are STYLES OF MUSIC -- JAZZ? FUNK? TYPES OF MUSIC... (I sort of lost my temper) and her expression turned to confusion and she just said "oh" -- clearly still not understanding. My mom is (was) a huge music fan -- so there's no reason for there to be confusion. It was the strangest conversation and I became so frustrated because I don't understand what she isn't processing.
Has she had a hearing test (to see if her h. aids are working well and still set up for her present needs)?

Does her scrabble site have a chat function? (I'm wondering if she's enjoying socializing online during/between scrabble games)

I find "find-a-word' puzzle books very relaxing, she might enjoy trying them herself (a way to inch her away from the PC and more into the real world).
Try not to get frustrated. It will only make it harder on you, her, and your dad. I know—easier said than done. Just keep in mind that if this is some sort of neurological issue, she has no control over it.

Dealing with dementia is a royal pita. Good luck. 

Glad it at least helped your mil.
Someone in this sub mentioned using a water tank monitor to check in on their elderly parent. It doesn’t require them to wear anything, which is a big hurdle to life alert necklaces. I’d never heard of it before and was intrigued so thought I’d share! 

Something like this: https://carepenguin.com
My father won't wear anything either.  His system has large call buttons that you can put around the house. I have one on the bathroom cabinet next to the shower if he falls.   Another one in the kitchen near the refrig,  next to the bed,  and then I hung the necklace from a drawer so it is hanging down towards the floor. If my father hits the floor the odds are there is a button near by he can reach.     He spent 4 days on the floor before being found 2 years ago before we moved him back to the US... I said never again.
Maybe.the famous Apple Watch would work for your Mom?
I've got one of those for my mom! I really like the app that goes with it. It just tells you that somebody is doing something that uses water in the house, but it's not intrusive or anything. My mom is really consistent, too, in that she usually uses water about 8:15 every morning, is what I've noticed, so if I look at the app about 9 in the morning, I can tell that she's gotten up.
She’s never worn a watch, otherwise I’d suggest it.  She just doesn’t do jewelry.

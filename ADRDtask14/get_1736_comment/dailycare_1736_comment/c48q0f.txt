What is definitely best is reaching out to elder care services/a social worker/adult protective services in your area and letting them know the situation. Otherwise it won’t hurt to drop by and help her out a couple times/week. 

You sound like a really good person. Thanks for being you.
I'm afraid I don't have anything else to add but God bless you for being a good person.
Maybe get a picture of yourself, looking as you do normally, put it in a frame and ask her if you could leave it with her/by her door. That way when you come over, you can point it out (“hey, you got my picture put up *point*”). May not do anything, but it may help her to recognize you are a friend (maybe also let her family know if you can so they don’t think you have ulterior motives).
Yeah this sounds good... Cracking the door open on third party help might be in everyones best interest here. 

Getting to know her over 2 weeks then disappearing being good or bad for her is kind of a crapshoot, like with any other friendship/relationship. I'd think it has more to do with the personality of the individuals inolved rather than the progression of Alzheimer's.
Ditto this and add that you could write her letters after you move. Mail with letters can be a highlight of the day.

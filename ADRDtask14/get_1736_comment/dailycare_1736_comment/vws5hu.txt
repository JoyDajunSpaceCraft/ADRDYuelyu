You can go on amazon etc and find "mugs" that have a handle as well as a lid, with an opening where you can put a straw in it, and ideally a rubber bottom. If she puts her hand between the handle and the cup, it should be easier for her to hold without as much work on her hand.

We made something called which she called "fruit tea" which was herbal tea mixed with cranberry and apple juice (to get it closer to lukewarm).
There’s a product called Jelly Drops, which aren’t solid but not liquid either.  It’s supposed to make it easier to get elderly people to stay hydrated, making them feel like they are eating or getting a treat.  They come in different flavors, too.  I haven’t bought them, but it’s an idea.
Any 360 style sippy cup is perfect. It's still the rim of a cup, not a tots sippy so less demeaning. You can put frozen berries in her water as ice cubes for flavor, and the sippy lids make it hard for her to choke on them. I recommend the Sassy cup for a slimmer hold, or the 360 brand. Both have options with lightweight handles. Just be sure to remove the silicone part each wash, as mildew can build up under/in the silicone if ignored.
Don't waste your money on the fruit/veg infuser type bottles. It's all fun n games until the mold shows up. Fail to rinse & dry thoroughly and those bottles are goners. $20+ each, they're a bit pricey. 

Our family enjoyed the flavor tho. Cukes & berries held their taste for a long time. 

Prob if you can find a good mug for her, you can try diff flavors w no choking hazard. 

God bless!

This has happened to my Mom who used to hold her cup with handle and drank from a straw. She can no longer hold a cup or bowl so I have to feed her and hold her cup. She barely drinks from a straw anymore, so I have to spoon feed her water so she doesn’t get dehydrated. I hope you find a cup that works!
My grandma (who did not have dementia but was blind and prone to falling asleep mid-sip) liked ones like this: Independence 2-Handle Plastic Mug with 2 Style Lids, Lightweight Drinking Cup with Easy-to-Grasp Handles for Hot and Cold Beverages, Spill-Resistant Adult Sippy Cup (2-Pack) https://a.co/d/c4i0ups (not sure if same brand).  We tried kids sippy cups but often the straws required too much force to get water out for her. She also HATED drinking water but started to like diluted cranberry juice (juice with mostly water added).  Good luck!!!
I like a Kennedy Cup. It’s one handled, lightweight, spill proof and can still use a straw.  They also have cups that are basic short, 2 handled and spill proof.  Here are examples, look around for the cheapest versions [2 handled summons and Preston cup](https://www.amazon.com/Sammons-Preston-Independence-Two-Handled-Spillproof/dp/B0716HD4SV/ref=asc_df_B0716HD4SV/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198076111901&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15555702707564346030&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9009247&hvtargid=pla-354078151852&psc=1)

We use lightweight travel coffee mugs for both hot and cold. At first I made the mistake of buying a big one that was too heavy for her. It was hard to find one the right size that didn't have cartoons on it. Some seniors are into that but mine is not. Travel wine coolers are just the right size for cold drinks. Nice and small. I have not just bought her one because I'm afraid she'll microwave it, but thinking about it because her hands can handle it.
Thanks. I got overwhelmed when I tried to search on Amazon. I was hoping someone would recommend a specific product. Thanks for your advice. ♥️

Have you talked to her doctor about upping the prescription dose?  So if her prescribed dose is to take 1 tablet of 10 mg. Xanax, maybe he could write one where the dose would be to take 1/2 tablet of 20 mg. xanax.

Or call it a vitamin pill?
Can you crush it up and mix it into something like applesauce?
Your first idea is excellent!! She is SO inquisitive that if I gave her a "vitamin" she would sense something is up and start asking tons of questions.
Thank you very very much.
That's possible, but is it safe?
No problem.   :)

If the doctor can't change the Xanax prescription, maybe you could call it a blood pressure pill (or some other type of pill she already takes, so she's not on the alert that this is a "new" pill she needs to investigate.
Call your pharmacist to ask.  Some pills have coatings so the pill dissolves and releases into your bloodstream slowly.  But others don't have coatings and it doesn't matter
  Your pharmacist will be glad to help.  You could ask them if there's a liquid version you could get instead of pills, too.
I don't have medical training so I can't say for sure. The only downside might be the taste. 
Most forms are safe to crush. 
If anywhere in the drug name it says er or xr then you shouldn't crush it, although I've had many doctors ok it. If you are not sure just call your pharmacy.    

You can also add it into a beverage, just be careful cause they can float and might be seen. I've had good luck with using a closed coffee tumbler because they didn't want the coffee to be cold. 
Perfectly fine.
Medications that shouldn't be crushed will say so on the bottle.

This sounds like a fantastic idea, I just wish you had Android support. my support network uses android, although I have an iphone for work. 
I am a full-time caregiver for my 24 year old daughter who is multiply disabled and critically ill.  I'd be happy to trial the app.  <3
If you send me your email address, I will notify you when it is available on Android.  We are planning to have it for Android summer of 2018.  If you can use your work phone to participate, please let me know.  Also, if you know of any others in care situations who might be able to help us, please pass on my information: mwerner@vitalally.com    Thanks so much!
Thanks!  Before we get started, are you an iPhone or Android user?

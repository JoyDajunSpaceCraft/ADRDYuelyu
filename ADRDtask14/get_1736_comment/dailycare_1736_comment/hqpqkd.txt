You lie.  

My current one is: No, I don't think you need someone here. (That's the lie.) But we don't want trouble with the neighbor who knows you're not supposed to be alone according to the doctor.   And we just can't take the chance of him reporting and you being in a home while they investigate it.  

She doesn't like it, but she's aware that the corona virus is worse (in this area) in the rest homes.  

I have no clue how something like that would be handled, but that's the excuse I use because there's absolutely no way I'd leave her alone.
One thing I learned is that there is no rationalizing with someone with Alzheimer's. I agree with lying. I lie to my mom all of the time, and my siblings find it so hard to do, but there's no other way I find that works.

Yep, just lie.

In addition to what SavyDreams mentions, we’ve also had success with things like “they’re just here to do a bit of cleaning for us.” Sometimes a simple “I know, sucks right?” Without entertaining the idea of it not being an option is enough. 

Same with him making things up about the caregiver, “They did that? I’ll talk to them about it.” You listened to him, but didn’t open an avenue for details or to argue.
you are so right and I've been so good with lying (that sounds awful) about everything else but I was trying to be sympathetic and listen to his complaints. Ugh, I hate this. Thank you.
I'm, unfortunately, quite familiar with the need to lie. The cleaning one is a good idea. I was thinking about that last night. Maybe telling him that mom needs help cleaning the house so she's just there to help clean. Thank you for the suggestions!

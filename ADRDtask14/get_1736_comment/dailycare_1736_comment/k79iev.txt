Sharing the link in twitter or facebook, where it's available for people to see, doesn't strike me as harassing. When people email or message me directly for fundraising stuff, on the other hand, it makes me want to block them. That's more like walking up to someone face to face and asking for their money. It's confrontational and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth, like they view me more as a wallet for their causes than a friend.

It's an awkward situation because this is a cause that's important to you, and it's valid. But everyone's got their own budget for charities and their own causes that are personal to them, and those aren't likely to change because you're doing a walk. But if they see the link on your social media they may donate because you're important to them.  You may have to just accept though that you will be the ones donating to this cause and they will donate to others; they aren't obligated to give to your causes.

Has he done this multiple times? My grandmother has been living with us about 3 years now and also has vascular dementia. She did the same thing about a month ago and it hasnt happened since. It seems she kinda gets into these "episodes" where we really dont know what will happen but they can be characterized by overt childish/immature behavior and exposing herself was part of one of them. From my experience with her it seems less likely that this is a kind of phase and more just random mood swings so it could happen again
My Dad has behaved sexually inappropriately towards me 3 times and I too, am eager to know if it might stop. Hope for us both that it's temporary.  I'm 46, he's 65. Xx
Sadly, this has happened multiple times. He never does anything untoward when I am visiting him...I guess my presence moderates his behavior. Weâ€™re trying to control his inhibitions with Depakote.
Ugh. So sorry for both of you.
Thank you - you too x

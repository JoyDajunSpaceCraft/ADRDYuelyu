Puzzles are a great option to keep the brain active! They don’t have to be the boring ones either, 3D puzzles are a ton of fun. 
My mom is in the same stage. She loves to read, so I keep her supplied with books and magazines that interest her. She reads the entire newspaper every day. We don’t have a good table for puzzles, but if we did I’d get some.

I also bought her an iPad. She can use a few apps, so emails with friends and such. A few games.

Medicare (if you are US) covers OT and PT in the home. We found those services very useful. Just need the referral from his PCP.

Good luck!

There's a certain sense of satisfaction of making something that can bring real joy when other things go lopsided.

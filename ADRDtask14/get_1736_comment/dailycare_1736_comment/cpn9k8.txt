Sometimes you have to imagine what you would do if a toddler presented a curious set of symptoms.  You have to play detective.  Given your grandfather is presenting digestive issues, best to hue to a fairly limited diet.  BRAT diet is what I would go to when I encountered similar circumstances with my father.  Bananas, rice, applesauce and toast.  Your father may also benefit from an active culture greek yogurt when he stabilizes.  My father would eat it because it was easy to swallow, tasted like ice cream, and was easy to digest.  Older people are very prone to UTI's and infection, so they are constantly being given antibiotics.  That can play havoc with the digestive tract.  If there is any way to build up his gut flora, it might be beneficial.  Otherwise, keep the diet very simple for awhile, and to the best of your ability see if he is sneaking something that is bad for his digestion.  I would first ask his doctor if he is eligible for some sort of inhaler if his breathing is very labored, or potentially oxygen down the line if it is persistent.
Thank you for the advice.

I think looking sad is a part of dementia. I would wait a while before I moved the clock. My dad has vascular dementia, diagnosed in 2017. He has tunnel vision on things for a while, then moves on to something else. Always staring kinda with his mouth open, looking sad. 
I think it’s like out of sight out of mind, I can never move anything if he’s looking at it, I can move it when he gets up for something else. 
She may just be enjoying the newness, if you truly think it’s upsetting her move it when she is in the bathroom or asleep. 
Good luck with this!!
Oh, that's thoughtful of you!  I got some of those for my mum years ago, thinking it would help her.  I had to put tape over the date and the temperature, it was too confusing for her, too much info.     And, the year kept confusing her - she'd ask repeatedly - "wait, why does it say 2015, is it really **2015**!!??".   

 I left visible only the time, and the day. (ie TUE / WED / etc)  She loves it.  There's a point in their journey, where past that, they don't really care nor need to know (on a daily basis) the date.  Knowing the time and the day is more useful, and the season. 

Perhaps you could give that a try, covering over some of the excess info?   See how she goes... Or maybe she's just getting used to it..

It's a lovely thoughtful gift you got her!  good luck!
Thanks so much, covering the month and year has worked wonders, she seems more thrilled with it now rather than sad and she's stopped staring at it now. Really appreciate your help.
Waou, wonderful,  I'm very happy to hear that!!   Yeh, sometimes less is more - it's tricky, working out what works for the memory lossed... you're most welcome!  good luck!

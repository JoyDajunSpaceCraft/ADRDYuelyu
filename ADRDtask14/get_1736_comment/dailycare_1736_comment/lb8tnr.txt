This would be a great question for your doctor. They can do some genetic testing for certain forms of dementia, but not all are genetic. You can speak with your insurance company about genetic counseling - if covered, they can explain the risks and benefits of genetic counseling before you decide to go forward with testing and couseling. Personally, I don't want to know what could go wrong, so I haven't done genetic testing.
According to the NIH, LBD is generally not hereditary.  There are several gene variants that increase your risk of having it but the cause of these gene variants is unknown. There is no genetic test for LBD. 

My advice is to live your life to the fullest and for your mother to do the same. My husband spent his money on possessions while I was traveling the world for work and pleasure. My health isn’t that great now and I’m glad I had those experiences. 

Many studies have shown that happiness is derived from experiences and from having friends - not from possessions. It’s sad that my husband may not be able to enjoy travel now and also we have landed in this pandemic. He has LBD as well and has no ability to form new memories. I only hope that he can enjoy day trips even if he can’t remember them.
Thank you

We use (and like) Tracki - but as with all trackers, there’s a monthly fee for internet access.
I was using a Jiobit for my moms keys when she would leave the house.

Best of luck but get ready to take the keys.
My mom got lost a couple of weeks ago and pulled over to ask for help. As a result, the DMV took her license. I felt bad for her but was glad not to be the bad guy. She wasn’t speeding and drove fine, but they determined her diagnosis a reason and her getting lost a few blocks from home showing it’s time. FYI

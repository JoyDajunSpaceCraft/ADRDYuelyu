Turn of Mind by Alice Laplante is a novel that is more about the experience of the disease but it is very well done.
Search teepa snow in YouTube. It was recommended when I had my internship at a Adult Care for patients with memory disorder (many of our clients have Alzheimer’s). I’ve been watching Teepa Snow‘s video but haven’t finished it yet. I think they might have something about how to tell children about dementia.
as corny as it may be, and in short-short essay format instead of a whole book, but Chicken Soup for the Caregivers Soul is actually
pretty nice to read.  Also CSftS: Family Caregivers.  If you can read a little less always-feel-good stuff, there’s Minding our Elders, a collection of stories about people from their caregivers’ perspectives.  I haven’t read or heard of any non-fiction, to be honest.  But ever since I heard that Eeyore’s depression doesn’t stop his friends from always asking him along, and that they never try to change him or fix him, I’m now sure that there are wonderful stories out there with dementia/senility/forgetfulness out there that I just haven’t recognized yet!  Maybe you can rediscover a kid’s story in a new light... if you do, please share what it is!

Edit: just re-read and saw that you specifically requested fiction, my apologies!  But I’ll leave what I wrote in case it’s useful for someone else. And typos.

"so my mom and aunt have been talking about going about caring for my grandma when she reaches the point where she can no longer care for herself (she's still in early stages). since my grandma and aunt have always had a contentious relationship they decided it'd be best if she stayed with my mom and me. the problem is, i am trans male, so i'm no longer the granddaughter she used to know.she hasn't forgotten my trans status yet, she doesn't deadname or misgender me. and i know not to get angry at her when that happens because that's the dementia at work, not her.what i wanna ask is this: when she reaches the point where i'm back to being her granddaughter should i indulge that and go back to presenting femininely? or could i get away with taking on a role of, say, new guy who moved in next door, idk where your granddaughter is, she's probably out playing with friends? i've been on hormones for nearly two years, my voice is very different, and every few months my beard fills in more and more. i still look a bit like me, but that is only going to last so long.i'll be honest: i really do not want to go back to being a girl, especially for someone who's going to eventually forget that she had this ""girl"" in her life. (god, what if at some point she starts seeing me as her ex-husband? i look like a younger more effeminate version of my grandpa. that's gonna be fun.) but i also want to do a good job taking care of her and making her life as stress-free as i can. can i have both?",caring for a dementia patient as a trans person?,1
"my 86y old grandma has been battling dementia for nearly 5 years now. it started with her repeating stories but it went downhill after my grandpa died.her short term memory is horrible. she will ask the same question many times, forgets my name sometimes (but knows who we all are) and generally acts like a child most of the time.she seems to always be very happy, doesn't understand tv shows but finds it amusing to watch and the most interesting thing - she's completely capable of living by herself.she lights fire in the fireplace, eats food we leave her and takes meds (i have to call her to remind her of everything tho). we visit her 2 times a week.the only thing that's gotten progressively worse is her short term memory and even her long term but she still knows who we all are and understands everything we tell her. it's been a slow decline during these past 5 years.what to expect in the future?",What to expect in the future?,1
"sorry i am not using my main account. i feel ashamed about this and i want some advice on how to deal with this going forward.i am trans and transitioned around 12 years ago and my dad basically disowned me at that time. more recently when i've been visiting my dad he's recognised me as my brother, who sadly died about 5 years ago and i haven't been correcting him. it almost feels like i am accepted and recognised by my dad as his son and it's been so nice to have him smile and talk to me in that way but i also feel so conflicted and feel ashamed for not being honest and correcting him.does anyone else have any remotely similar experiences or advice? i don't really know what to do anymore",My Dad remembers me as my brother and I haven't been correcting him,1

"hi everyone. i'm just wondering if anyone has any advice or experience with this. my mother (71) has been declining for several years - i think about 10. her own mother developed vascular dementia in her 50s and died at 76, and also had debilitating osteoarthritis in her neck, which my mother also shares.i think that the chronic pain (which absolutely ruins my mother's day to day life) makes her cognitive function worse, but that the dementia issue would still be there without the pain.the problem that i have is that she will not make a doctor's appointment for either issue, and she won't speak to me about it without weeks of rage and silent treatment afterwards. i know that she finds it distressing and antagonising coming from me, but she has always been difficult to speak to and has become even more difficult and angry and i can't really cope with it any more if nothing is addressed. she did bring up ""memory issues"" herself at a follow up appointment for a hip replacement a couple of years ago (i was present) - her gp laughed and said if she hadn't left the gas on and knows where she is then there isn't a problem. but there is definitely a problem. to my actual question - i've drafted a letter to send to her gp to ask if they can somehow broach the subject (pain, brain or both) with her without mentioning that i've said anything. is this an approach that any gp might take seriously or even be able to follow up? i've got no family to discuss any of this with and am feeling a bit lost so i was wondering if anyone might have some wisdom to share.i know this is garbled, thank you for your time if you got to the end!",Approaching GP re. mother and suspected cognitive impairment.

"hey everyone, so long story short, my father was diagnosed with early stage dementia a couple years ago. he hasn't shown many signs up until now, other than occasionally getting stuck on a word or forgetting he talked to someone a couple moments before, and the symptoms he would show were mostly few and far in between. he passed out about a week ago and hit his head in the bathroom. he got a mild concussion and went to the hospital, but they let him out a couple hours later and said everything checked out. he complained about a terrible headache for a couple days and now it appears that basically overnight skipped the whole early stage and is barely speaking, just incomplete sentences, a couple words followed by mumbling and pointing. the doctors said it would take some time to heal, but i'm not so sure it's going to go away. so i guess my question is, can a mild concussion send someone in the early stages of dementia straight into the later stages? as i mentioned, he was just fine last week and speaking in complete, coherent sentences. it's very concerning... any help would be appreciated.",Father (61) Worsening Symptoms After Concussion,0

"my dad, my mom, and me tested positive for covid yesterday. my dad is 55 with dementia and was diagnosed when he was 52. he was seeing things last night, today he needed help showering, &amp; now he can‚Äôt tell our dogs apart. he has never been this bad. my brother wants me to call the hospital to see if we should bring him in. i‚Äôve had horrible experiences with hospitals and i don‚Äôt trust them unless we need to. can anyone please give me advice?? we don‚Äôt have medical insurance. it would cost everything we own to go the hospital, but to me my dads life is worth it of course. i just don‚Äôt know if this is common with covid and dementia? i‚Äôm so worried",Help,0
"she's beyond the ability (or interest) to play games and is *very* hard of hearing, so music and movies are out. my parents have been looking after her pretty well, but there are times when she needs to stay occupied for a few hours while my mom gets dinner ready and such. so far, picture books sort of help, but i don't think she's getting much meaning from them anymore; sometimes she just turns the pages without looking at the images. the problem is that she can't get up and walk around; if she tries, she'll fall, so we have to keep an eye on her and keep her occupied when she's awake. any suggestions for keeping her from constantly trying to leave her chair?",Keeping my grandma entertained?,0
i finally went to visit my mom. she‚Äôs still living in her 3000+ sq ft house in a nice neighborhood (very safe). she has an underlying mental illness/paranoia/depression and now dementia (like stage 6). she can still use the bathroom. we have aides come in to help 4 hours each day. she throws a fit on any suggestion she should change her clothes. the doctor believes that a psych team would be needed to get her to bathe. we‚Äôre trying to keep her at home but it‚Äôs a lot to maintain (and she doesn‚Äôt have a lot of income) but i feel it‚Äôs time for her to move on and get additional care. i do worry she‚Äôd have to be highly medicated and potentially injured but an impatient nurse but i‚Äôm just kinda tired of having to take care of things from a distance. i also think it‚Äôs unfair on her neighbors to have to look out for her (and deal with an unsightly house). the house i could help improve but i‚Äôm just not sure it makes sense to do so. but she‚Äôs comfortable there and still recognizes it... what to do?,Mom hasn‚Äôt bathed in years and hasn‚Äôt changed her clothes in months,0
"my 87y old grandma suffers from vascular dementia. she lived alone until this february when she declined rapidly but with proper care she was feeling a lot better.she knew our names again, knew who she was and where she was, was eating and drinking well but behaved like a 3y old child and need 24h care.yesterday i woke up and spoke to her but she didn't respond. she just stared at me. she hasn't said anything besides ""leave me, go away"" since yesterday morning. she gets very agitated and tries to hit me if i offer good or water and spits out anything i manage to put i to her mouth.this morning she is just laughing uncontrollably and still refuses food and water. she mostly sleeps.should we start preparing for her death or is there something that can be done? she's definitely become non verbal and i feel like she understands nothing i'm saying.",Grandma refuses to eat and drink,0
i can't drive so i can't take my grandma anywhere but when i'm with her she keeps saying she saying let's go. i can't even really take her for a walk because she can't move too far before getting tired. i've had people tell me that i should just calm her by saying that we are going because she'll just forget about it quickly but she doesn't. if i say yes we are going right now she will keep bringing it up and might even cry about it. i tried to tell her we can't go anywhere today because it's too hot but she hears it as i don't want to go because i don't want to and sometimes will get a little upset about it. so what would be a better response for her?,How to respond to someone if they keep asking to go somewhere?,0
"my dad, 92 years old, has become completely uncooperative and violent with medical personnel. last time paramedics entered the house he became uncontrollably violent, if he had any strength he would have kicked and punched them. he would not allow any of them close, the medics said if we wanted them do anything we would have to bring the police into the situation to handcuff and subdue him. my stepmom and he have two nurses that split a 24/7 work schedule and my dad really likes them. they also have a home health practitioner that comes by monthly and can be called in as well, but not on any emergency type basis. he does video visits with his doctors for his meds. my stepmom and i have basically decided that that will have to be enough since he won‚Äôt tolerate any other help. we realize that at some point we will call on hospice but other than that we‚Äôre done with care that might call for a procedure to be done at a surgery center or hospital. of course this feels completely wrong but please, what else can we do?",How Do We Not Give Up?,0
"i'm looking for advise to keep my mother busy in times when no one is around.she cannot (really) walk, she has massive problems with any kind of electronic device, like trying to use the alarm clock as a telephone.so she is sitting in her chair, sometimes reading or flipping through the newspaper, with or without glasses, or sorting the same things over and over again.just turning on the television feels wrong, but letting here stare out of the window feels worse, but i cannot attend to her 24/7 as i also have to work. we try our best to keep her busy when we are around. visiting or inviting her friends, but there is so much downtime.asking her she says it's ok. before everything went down the drain, she was busy doing her house, keeping everything clean and nice and talking to people on the phone (this does not really work anymore).my sister today jokingly said give her a tablet with a horse on it to stroke, there must be an app for it. the more i think about it...but then again it's and electronic device. maybe a stuffed pet - losing the last kind of self-respect. idk.has someone a general advice, it mustn't been specific for this case, how to keep a person with dementia engaged and busy?",Keeping someone busy,0
"i‚Äôm a 32-year-old u.k. female and i was raised by my grandparents aged 82 and 84. they‚Äôve always been largely in good health but three weeks ago my nan‚Äôs leg weakness got dramatically worse and she started to have word-finding difficulties, frequent urination and a tremor. she can‚Äôt stand or walk unaided and the neurologist suspects dementia, which her mother had, so we‚Äôre waiting for a scan. my mum died two years ago and my siblings (who i grew up separately from) have historically been awful to me. my nan is one of my best friends and has always been so youthful so it‚Äôs a shock. it‚Äôs also incredibly hard on my grandad because she can‚Äôt be left unattended and i‚Äôve applied for a social care assessment to get some support for him but it all takes time and because i have to go back to london i feel absolutely terrible and don‚Äôt know how i‚Äôll ever be able to live a normal life with such worry and concern hanging over me. life has changed forever. i‚Äôm scared of life passing at a time when i can‚Äôt connect with it because my mind is elsewhere.can anyone share stories of how the acceptance might get easier and anything i can do to compartmentalise? i‚Äôm desperate.",Does it get easier?,0

"my grandpa (70) got diagnosed with dementia after my grandmas passing when he was about 64 he has since then lost weight dramatically. he‚Äôs on multiple medications to try to make him hungry (including weed which is legal in my state) he eats to our knowledge half a meal a day and drinks meal replacement shakes for the rest which are supposed to be used with a full meal for a high amount of calories. he lies to us and tells us he eats, when we look for what he tells us he ate we can‚Äôt find it. i live about an hour away from him but will be moving back to my hometown at the end of this year. i think i‚Äôm going to have to move in with him and take care of him since his only kid who will step up thinks feeding him one meal a day is sufficient. he also lies about showering but we can all tell he hasn‚Äôt showered in months. i haven‚Äôt gotten to the point of telling him to get in the shower and i‚Äôll wash him, but it‚Äôs getting to that point. do you guys have any advice on how to get him in the shower alone, or how to get him in the shower so i can clean him without him being embarrassed about me seeing him naked? the real question of this post is how can i make him gain weight if he doesn‚Äôt eat, for reference he is 6‚Äô4 and weighs about 90-95 pounds. i‚Äôm very worried he is going to end up in the hospital very soon with a feeding tube. we don‚Äôt want him to go to a nursing home but his insurance does not cover a home health nurse.",My grandpa is losing weight fast,0
"my father has been showing signs of dementia/alzheimer‚Äôs/lewy body and my mother is bearing the brunt of his care and supervision. she reached out to me asking for help, but i thought i would ask here to see if anyone has already tackled this. my dad was always very good with technology, he was instrumental in the early days of fiber optics and telecommunication, but those skills seem to be going the fastest. my mom is frustrated because she is not able to get in touch with him if she has to leave the house. when the phone rings he will try to answer the tv remote. this ends up with mom not talking to dad, and the tv being inputs being changed to the point he can‚Äôt figure out how to get back to his shows. mom is looking for some kind of solution that 1) he does not have to keep up with or remember where he set it down, 2) requires minimal steps/button presses to access. my first two thoughts were either a smart watch that receives calls, or something like an alexa or google assistant. do any of you have any experience that may help? any preferences or suggestions based on the options above? thanks for your time.",Help needed reaching dad.,0

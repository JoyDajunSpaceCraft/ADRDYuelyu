"apologies if this is a common question, i'll search through the sub for answers. i'm dealing with my mom's decline, she's 78 and has some kind of mid to late stage dementia. she's seen a neurologist, we're waiting on a ct scan and follow up to hopefully at least get a diagnosis. she lives on her own, a caregiver comes once a week to help with food and bathing. she has no money, social security barely covers rent so i pay other expenses but don't make a lot and have a family of my own. i have so many questions about her condition, how to care for her and how to pay for the institutional care she will clearly need in the future. living with me isn't an option for reasons, and the time i spend caring for her is straining my marriage. are there local agencies that can help? someone knowledgeable who can coordinate care? i just don't know where to go for help. i'm in the us, california. thanks.",
"hello all, thanks for taking the time to read this. i (31m) and trying to figure out how to help my parents. my mom (63) has been diagnosed with dementia. currently my dad (65) is her primary caretaker, but he is also a self employed salesman who normally would be out of the house most days making sales calls. thankfully (and not) due to covid he‚Äôs been home most of the time now. realistically, my mom needs to be somewhere with full time care, as the mental and physical toll of taking care of her is really weighing on my dad. the problem is that full time care in his area is something like $5k a month, which isn‚Äôt much less than my dad brings home. i‚Äôm obviously looking into what i can do to help financially but my wife and i are trying to pay off student loans in the hopes of starting a family soon. has anyone here found any good resources that might assist with full time care? medicaid is a last resort at best.",
the mental health team want to put my nan on quetiapine. i am concerned from a quick google. should i be?,
"my mom has been recently diagnosed with alzheimer‚Äôs. she can do everything for herself but has poor short term memory. her biggest issue is anxiety, especially about medical things. she has someone with her from friday at 8am until monday at 8pm and on the other days from 8-5. still, nonstop (20-50 times a day) she calls my sister, even when others are there, saying she just come, she can‚Äôt breathe, etc. she‚Äôs physically healthy and has had every test. doctors say it‚Äôs anxiety. they‚Äôve tried different meds, and they help a bit (especially with her ocd/mania) but not enough. she refuses to leave home, and with covid, we don‚Äôt want to force her. i have been filling in one of the open nights, but i‚Äôm an out-if-state teacher, so that ends next week. she acts worse for my sister, who lives close and goes there most evenings for a bit. has anyone else had insane amounts of anxiety and phone calls? any advice?",
"hello, everybodyi‚Äôm (26m) about to move in with my grandma who has dementia. her daughter (my aunt) is her current care giver and takes care of all of her finances and such and my grandma is still capable of bathing and feeding herself, so i‚Äôll mostly just be there to cook, clean, take care of her dogs, keep her active, etc. so, do you guys have any advice? anything you wish you had known before becoming a caregiver? suggestions for fun activities? best ways to slow their dementia? anything would help and any help is much appreciated as this is going to be very new for me.",
"hi all! new member here, hoping for some advice!my grandfather lives states away and has dementia, and it‚Äôs progressed pretty severely at this point. essentially, he no longer recognizes who my grandmother is :( he calls us every night, paranoid, asking for help finding her when she‚Äôs right next to him. i‚Äôm an slp by training so i know how important it is to stay calm, not challenge him, and affirm for him how much he we love him and that it will be okay. unfortunately, he is pretty adamant that we take action and call her to find her. when it gets to this point, we‚Äôre not sure how to respond. have any of you had similar experiences and have creative ideas on how to respond when he gets stuck in this mindset? nothing we‚Äôve done seems to work, so any ideas are so appreciated!! thank you for taking the time to read, and wishing you well!",
"i just found out that my dad who lives in a nursing home has been moved to isolation since his roommate has covid. first, how in gods name did this even happen? does anyone have experience with this yet? my dad is 82 with heart failure and emphysema and dementia. he is being tested today for the virus. i am trying not to be just angry and worried....has anyone on here had their family member survive this thing with those types of health conditions?",
"my grandmother is starting dementia progression, she has good and bad days as is normal. an activity she loves to do is color, but she gets frustrated because she thinks that shes going to get the picture wrong. we found [these books]( on amazon which she really likes but there are only two. does anyone know of other books like this? or other art activities which are simple but not insulting as she is still mostly there, at least on good days.",
"hey guys. i'm staying with my mom while my dad is in the hospital. i don't know how long he's gonna be in there but the doctors said anywhere from 3-7 days. when my dad is with my mom, she's totally fine, lucid, can do normal things, but you can tell there's something going on with her memory and if you ask her to recall things, you can tell she doesn't know how or remembers unless it's something from when we were kids or a long time ago.no one can have any visitors so her behaviors are that she'll fixate on my dad and when he can get out, why he's in there, why no one told her, but then we'll remind her and she remembers. though, there are times when she gets upset and she'll start crying just focusing on my dad being in the hospital and she thinks no one is telling her anything. sometimes things will upset her and we have to spent like 30-40 minutes just repeating the same shit to calm her down. for example, my dad called to complain last night before bed and mentioned something the doctor didn't do that upset him therefore it upset her, and so she was doing fine all day and then right before bed he upset her so it took forever to calm her down.i was wondering if you all had any links or resources on how to deal with the behavior and/or things to help calm her down, ways of talking to her, etc? my gf and i are taking care of her and i feel like what we're doing is good for the moment and calms her down, but i quickly realized that this is way harder than i thought it was going to be. we've been doing things that have helped like draw out calendars counting off days until he gets home or have learned when to tell her info and not tell her anything upsetting at all.",
my mom and her siblings are telling my grandfather tomorrow that his dementia diagnosis is real and he no longer has control of his finances. they‚Äôre also taking away the cars as he has become quite reckless. they are of course extremely nervous about this. my grandfather was a police officer and knows how to be pretty scary when he wants to. any advice or words of encouragement for them?,
"well, my mom has some healthcare workers visiting her for her chronic respiratory issues, while my dad is generally healthy.until recently a therapist told me that when she's tending to my mom in the living room, my dad actually came out of his room completely naked. i thought it might be an accident where he wasn't aware there was strangers in the house but apparently it already happened 3 times, and the therapist is pretty sure my dad is aware of her presence in the house. she said hi when she entered.also, my parents rent the spare room out to a tenant. so even if he didn't know the therapist is over he still should not be doing that.my dad isn't a flasher. he had never committed any sexual crimes. the therapist said it's possible my dad has dementia.i couldn't really believe it because he's still very healthy, mentally alert, love to read and play puzzle games, is still employed, shows no sign of being forgetful or disorientated/delirious. but on the other hand 3 times doesn't seem to be an accident and i do not want to entertain the thought that he's doing it on purpose. i'm seriously at a loss and don't know how to approach the topic. do i just go up to him and ask why the hell is he walking around the house naked? what if he has no recollection of doing this? would it be humiliating for him? anyone with similar experience or expertise can give some advice?",
"62 yo f, husband is 69 in nursing home. he barely recognizes me any more when we facetime. i have met a very nice man. i feel so guilty to be attracted to someone else. taking it extremely slow. but i just feel like i still want to live some kind of life. my husband and his well being are my top priority. he cannot take care of himself so i know and will always make him #1. my kids are grown with their own families. it‚Äôs me and the dog. has anyone been in this situation? what would you do/feel if you were?",
"f)so my (36f) grandmother's (84f) dementia has progressed aggressively in the last year, to the point that her short-term memory is pretty much gone and her long-term memory is also fading. in the last few months, especially, we've seen a lot of behavioral changes, such as sundowning, paranoia, and general nastiness toward her friends and nurses at her assisted living facility. i've known two other people with alzheimer's/dementia and was prepared to deal with these symptoms.but she's also demonstrating a symptom i haven't seen before- not memory *loss*, per se, but memory *shift,* regarding something pretty significant. her attitude about my grandfather has dramatically shifted in the last few months, from missing him terribly (he died in 2005) to outright resentment and sometimes hatred. she won't articulate exactly why she's changed her mind so quickly, although once she did say that she felt like he'd abandoned her when he died, which i get. and while she wouldn't tell me, she's apparently divulged some disturbing things about him to my mother that are completely out of character. this man waited on her hand and foot, and neither my mom nor i can ever remember seeing him angry, let alone violent. so, i'm wondering if she has somehow conflated something she saw on tv or read in the newspaper with her own memories and that's part of this shift? in the past, she's watched a lot of cop dramas like ncis and csi, and i suspect some of this has bled into her memories as a justification for her feelings. has anyone else seen this kind of thing happen? and if so, how did you deal with it?",
"my grandfather was recently diagnosed with frontotemporal degeneration. he is not accepting the diagnosis but it is very clear to the whole family that he is need of a lot of help. his doctor is not being very helpful in giving my grandmother support, so i am very worried about her. does anyone know of a virtual support group that she could join? their hospital hosts a phone call once a month, but of course we just missed it.",
"my dad (83) has dementia and had really been declining this summer. he was having trouble walking (not for physical reasons) and was falling and having lots of accidents and disorientation at night. my mom is his main caregiver and i try to come over frequently as possible and i stay with him when she has appointments or errands to run. in the past week, his walking has improved and his verbal expression ability has probably tripled. two weeks ago, i didn‚Äôt think he had a clue how to use his phone but last night he went into his room and called my aunt all by himself. i am so grateful for this upswing in his functioning but it does seem unusual. my mom said his prozac was doubled about five weeks ago so that may be the reason for it. anyone else experienced this?",
"well my dad passed last night. i had been working at my contact center job right next to him all day. nobody tells you how thin and scary they can get. i logged off early because i had a migraine from lack of sleep. i fell asleep from 5-7pm and by 7 he was gone.we are just so tramatzed mom and i have just been sitting here watching defending your life. we (mom, myself and his dog) are a bit lost. i think half of it is 3 years of sleep deprivation and 5 years worth of us going whenwillit end? well it‚Äôs now over and down eith and i hope i never have to do that again. i‚Äôm still glad i saw him tohis end thugj.",
"(this post is about asking for questions i could ask my granny)hello people of reddit, i was in bilbao spain as i‚Äôm studying gamedev there, and i was trying to get home to where i live for 5 days (usual trip is like less than a day, through one stop, here there were 3 stops with day waits). upon arrival i receive news about my granny having slight dementia, so she is okay, just sometimes has weird conversations. that day she was going with my sister and a cousin to the doctor, while i was trying to avoid her due to being in many different places (even while wearing a mask, and having a 5-days old pcr negative test for corona)later that day, the doctor finds out she also is suffering from stroke (i dunno if that‚Äôs how it is in english) already for like a week. we couldn‚Äôt put her to the hospital (where i and my family think she should be) due to not having a negative test for covid-19. the doctor however was really nice and put it on himself to take her in. the next day, we receive a call that she has tested positive for coronavirus. she was taken home and would be treated there for her stroke, and we are expecting that the test has failed, and we are testing her again on monday. why am i writing here? no, not because of dealing with it or karma-whoring. actually i‚Äôd like to ask you guys, what kind of questions i could ask her? i already have one for how they met with my grandpa, and i myself already was trying to throw a conversation to the side of when i was small and so on. she is really important to me, she was and still is to me like my second mother, so i‚Äôm feeling really shit that sometimes i can‚Äôt even think of what to ask her, to let her tell me smth i wouldn‚Äôt even know i wanted to know...",
"hi folks,i'm writing this on behalf of our family friends, whose father is suffering from dementia. our friends are at their wit's end , need a solution and would appreciate any suggestions that you might have.in the past two years they have done everything humanly possible to care for him. this includes multiple mental hospitals, memory care stays, home-nursing, and even bringing him back home after negligence where he was staying. the truth is that it's gotten much worse. the patient, a father in his mid 60s, has become suicidal, violent, and impossible to live with. he was never any of these things prior to the illness.his history of suicide attempts makes it difficult for admission into most memory care places. are psych wards still around? does a hospice make sense? are there any international options?&amp;#x200b;thank you.",
"as in, if they are cognitively fine one day but then gradually get more and more demented and there is no friends or family or colleagues to even observe this. they obviously can‚Äôt be placed correctly, what happened since there is no other person in their life to take on any responsibility for caring for this elderly demented person. their only hope is if they wander out in public, and a passerby notices? or if they are stuck im their residence with no capacity to take care of themselves and they just expire due to malnourishment ?",
"i understand that when a patient wants to go ""home"" it might not actually mean the house they life in, or it might not even be a place at all. they may mean they want to go to their home or it may mean they want to go someplace more comfortable.one of my dad's recurring themes is the need to go pick up stuff from ""the old place"". yesterday (not an isolated incident) standing in his living room, he said ""i think i'll just stay right here"". i said that was a good idea and hoped that was going to do it for the day. ten minutes later, we're on his front porch and he says ""if you'll give me a ride over there, i'll just drive my own car back"". i said why would you do that when your car is already here in the garage (he doesn't have the keys), and he said he didn't believe that and went into the house to check. i was hoping he would forget what he was doing and drop it. but he comes back out with his traveling stuff (loose change and keys) and says ""well, i'll just follow you over there, when are you leaving""? this went on for at least a half hour, even after my sister got home (which usually snaps him back). she had to take him to look at the flowers so i could sneak out without him noticing. it just makes me wonder how ""here"" can be the place he wants to be, but he can have no idea that it's his place.",
"my grandmother just turned 91 and for a little while now has been on the gradual decline in terms of memory. when there are a couple of us in conversation, i have noticed that more and more she sort of tunes out. she is also constantly losing things. she lives with my parents and i can see the affect it is having on them and her.just yesterday i was visiting and she was attempting to pay her taxes online, but couldn't find her wallet. in the search, we found her check book in the sleeve of a sweater in her dresser. this is becoming a constant problem.when i asked her if everything was ok, she nearly broke down, but she would not let me help her to continue to search. she is about as stubborn as they come. i am curious if anyone has any tips on how myself and my parents might be better able to help the situation. do we hold onto all valuable items for her? i know that she wont like that, but seems like losing the items is more traumatizing each time then the anger she might have from losing that independence. any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.",
"hi all, i would love some advice on how to approach my mother in law and father in law (if at all) about her showing dementia signs. please know that i only want to help her.my mother in law is 65 years old, and had an extremely traumatic upbringing which has undoubtedly affected her adult life, so it is hard to find the line to draw between trauma and possible dementia signs.i have known her for about 10 years and in the last 2 years i and another family member have notice a huge decline in the following areas:-telling the same story every single time we speak, dozens of times-paranoia that everyone is looking at her and speaking about her-inability to follow simple stories that were telling her- for example, stories about our day, or instructions-falling out with all of her friends-forgetting appointments and family plans -inability to sleep, constantly complaining about insomnia and waking up at 3am-increased extremely heavy alcohol consumption, regularly 2-3 bottles of wine per night and she says it‚Äôs ‚Äúto help her sleep‚Äù.things to note:i have tried to speak to my husband (her son) about this so many times and he becomes defensive, saying that i‚Äôm just being mean to her. i have spoken to my sister in law and she has noticed the same things that i have noticed. we have tried to speak to our father in law (her husband) and he just brushes it off saying that she‚Äôs doing crossword puzzles so she‚Äôll be fine. i feel like if i speak to her directly she will get extremely defensive and dismissive.so my question is, is there anything we can actually do or say to help her?! are there early intervention techniques? or do we just watch her deteriorate?",

my mom (74) mentioned to me today that her memory has drastically been decreasing lately. she's otherwise healthy but is caring for my dad (81 with parkinsons and dementia) and the stress of caring for him + covid (being isolated from her friends and family) aren't helping at all and i'd love to suggest something easy...even a book i can have delivered to her house or something. much appreciated!!,Any good activity books or activities in general that can help seniors improve their memory?,1
"hi all, i've posted here before about my dad. he's 71 and for the past year or so i've been keeping a mental checklist of warning signs of dementia. so far he's been checking every one. memory changes are obviously the biggest, but i've also noticed increased speech problems, confusion, aggression and falls. now, obviously i don't know 100% whether he has dementia or not, so i want him to see his doctor about it. i doubt she would have any idea what's really going on since he only tells her about physical pain, and he tends to downplay his confusion &amp; memory loss too. should i talk to her myself, or is there a way to gently coax my dad to ask himself? he and i share the same doctor, so i'm thinking about bringing this up to her anyways at my next appointment. if anyone has had any experience going through this it would be greatly appreciated!",How to gently suggest testing for dementia?,1
"any ideas as to what can suddenly cause hallucinations? my 91 year old mil has dementia, which has been managed with medication pretty successfully for a few years. in the last two weeks, she has begun having hallucinations- some pleasant in which long- dead family members are visiting and some terrifying in which she sees babies hanging from the ceiling. tests for a uti came back negative. her doctor prescribed an anti hallucinogenic medication, which is not helping. we are at a loss as to what could have triggered this.",Sudden hallucinations with dementia,1
"on wednesday, my mom's boss called me to alert me about my mom's diminishing job performance. she's becoming forgetful and they brought it to my attention that they've been covering for her mistakes for quite some time and they don't know how much longer they can continue doing so, especially with a new system being implemented at her job. her boss told me all of this info asking me to take her to the doctor so they can be updated about my mom's current condition so they know how to proceed.currently, my mom's in a stage where she's asking questions that she's asked before and i follow by asking her ""you don't remember...?"" she shakes her head, then a second later recalls the answer. the max i'll be asked the same question is 3 times within \~2 hours. she is also forgetful of buying things she's brought the day prior, this is a somewhat recent issue that has developed. my mother also had a pacemaker implanted in june, last year, after developing an arrhythmia, it took many months of hospital and doctor visits until they found the issue. her recent doctor's visit (last friday) also revealed that my mom has high blood pressure. we had lab work done this thursday so we're awaiting results and farther info. i'm here to ask what should i do next, what should i expect next? my friend told me to consider alzheimer's and i think i'm on a good path with the blood work being done. i'm just an only child to a single mother so i don't have much guidance with these things.","My [22 F] Moms [62 F] job is in jeopardy, she's becoming forgetful",1
"i notice that my mom has her idea of the past very mixed up. she is the kind of person who loves the past and reminicing about old times. lately though, she has things mixed up. her memories are real to her, but are no longer accurate. life events are condensed, combined and or jumbled up in major ways. i was of the understanding that dementia affects short-term memory but not so much the long term memory. her most recent assessment shows only minor cognitive impairment, but why is she mixing up events so much? how does impairment affect the long term memories of older people? how do i respond to her stories?",Over 80 with jumbled memories?,1
"cross-posted at someone's advice from r/relationships for context, my mom used to work in entertainment when she was around my age and up until 30 or so, and was relatively well-known, so i get why she is extra cautious about certain things like making sure the blinds are down and thinking that people are staring at her or paying her extra unwanted attention - it probably has literally happened to her. she was also harassed at her last job by her (male) boss, which i'm sure fuels her reasoning for this kind of behavior...but increasingly over the last ten years or so, and especially over the last couple, she's been saying some things that i think are completely ridiculous. for example, we've been having some issues with hot water consistency in our shower recently but apparently none of the neighbors in our apartment that she's asked have had the same problem, and she's convinced that the landlord (who admittedly is slightly sketch) is tampering with our hot water in order to provoke her because he has it out for her and/or wants her attention. another example - a nice scarf we bought went missing a few years ago and she's convinced the landlord broke into our apartment and stole it. or an example not involving the landlord - she reads a lot of anti-""country x"" (preserving anonymity) news online and follows that stuff on social media, and when our wifi goes out she tells me it's because country x is trying to sabotage her (or broadly, people who are anti-country x). i think she also reads a lot of sensationalist news about robberies and murders and kidnappings and whatnot, and so is pretty paranoid anytime i leave the house, but maybe that's just a mom thing?my grandfather exhibited similar paranoia towards the end of his life (according to her, and no formal diagnosis of anything - he would occasionally tell my mom that his caretaker at the nursing home wanted to kill him), and she both acknowledges his paranoia and does not believe she's wrong about any of the things she's saying. i tell her she sounds crazy and make the comparison to my grandfather, and she obviously does not take that well and tells me that she just won't confide in me about these things going forward, which isn't what i want - i just want to shake some sense into her. i don't know what to do - like yes, country x is pretty messed up and i'm sure they do some pretty sketchy surveillance shit, but i doubt they have the capacity to fuck around with our wifi all the way in america... and yes, our landlord is kinda sketch but who the fuck breaks into an apartment just to steal a scarf and spends their time messing with one person's hot water? none of this is well-received, she has shot down every suggestion i make about a therapist (she doesn't trust strangers with her secrets and personal life), and i have no idea what to do, or how worried i should be.i should also take care to mention that all she does is talk about this stuff - she doesn't behave erratically or do anything crazy besides occasionally being moody/in a bad mood because she thinks xyz. i also suspect a lot of the country x paranoia is fueled by the amount of stuff she reads on the internet, but that doesn't really account for the landlord stuff...someone on r/relationships mentioned something about early onset dementia. in all other respects she has everything 100% together - she's the family planner, family accountant, family organizer... from a life/care-taking perspective she's probably the most capable person i know! but this paranoia is really starting to worry me.any ideas/guidance, please?",My (24F) mom (56F) is exhibiting increasingly paranoid behavior and I don't know what to do,1

"i understand that when a patient wants to go ""home"" it might not actually mean the house they life in, or it might not even be a place at all. they may mean they want to go to their home or it may mean they want to go someplace more comfortable.one of my dad's recurring themes is the need to go pick up stuff from ""the old place"". yesterday (not an isolated incident) standing in his living room, he said ""i think i'll just stay right here"". i said that was a good idea and hoped that was going to do it for the day. ten minutes later, we're on his front porch and he says ""if you'll give me a ride over there, i'll just drive my own car back"". i said why would you do that when your car is already here in the garage (he doesn't have the keys), and he said he didn't believe that and went into the house to check. i was hoping he would forget what he was doing and drop it. but he comes back out with his traveling stuff (loose change and keys) and says ""well, i'll just follow you over there, when are you leaving""? this went on for at least a half hour, even after my sister got home (which usually snaps him back). she had to take him to look at the flowers so i could sneak out without him noticing. it just makes me wonder how ""here"" can be the place he wants to be, but he can have no idea that it's his place.",Home,0
"my grandmother just turned 91 and for a little while now has been on the gradual decline in terms of memory. when there are a couple of us in conversation, i have noticed that more and more she sort of tunes out. she is also constantly losing things. she lives with my parents and i can see the affect it is having on them and her.just yesterday i was visiting and she was attempting to pay her taxes online, but couldn't find her wallet. in the search, we found her check book in the sleeve of a sweater in her dresser. this is becoming a constant problem.when i asked her if everything was ok, she nearly broke down, but she would not let me help her to continue to search. she is about as stubborn as they come. i am curious if anyone has any tips on how myself and my parents might be better able to help the situation. do we hold onto all valuable items for her? i know that she wont like that, but seems like losing the items is more traumatizing each time then the anger she might have from losing that independence. any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.",Grandmother (91) keeps misplacing items,0

for some reason this post wasn't allowed in r/askdocs which is mildly infuriating so asking here and hopeful a doctor will respond. my mom was diagnosed with lewy body about six months ago by her neurologist with input from a psychologist who tested her. she was prescribed medication to deal with hallucinations. no follow-up appointment was provided and although it wasn't explicity stated that no more appointments would be necessary there was a general understanding that there simply wasn't anything to do be done about the onset and progression of the dementia. we've since moved her in with us and intend to look after her for as long as we are able.her symptoms have progressed and at my mother's insistence we've reached out by phone a few times about meeting with the neurologist but we don't hear back beyond his assistant telling us she'll check to see if he thinks an apointment is necessary. we never hear that an appointment isn't necessary.i don't want to pester a doctor if there's no point in scheduling a follow-up. i know this is incurable and we know where this is ultimately headed. but i don't want to give up scheduling follow-ups if they're any way helpful for her either.what position are in here?,Should we not expect follow-up visits after a dementia diagnosis?,0
my mom‚Äôs progressed to a point where she‚Äôs irrationally angry and lashes out. until yesterday it was almost exclusively directed at my dad.yesterday she started sending me extremely mean texts and saying mean things about my dad (that he tricked her into the assisted living community she‚Äôs in) and she told me to f-off when i‚Äôd stand up for dad. it got to the point where i blocked her number. i know it‚Äôs irrational and the disease talking but where do i go from here? unblock her and act normally until it happens again? is there a point where it‚Äôs all rage and i just have to cut contact?,How do you set boundaries when there‚Äôs anger and rage?,0

"hi all, i would love some advice on how to approach my mother in law and father in law (if at all) about her showing dementia signs. please know that i only want to help her.my mother in law is 65 years old, and had an extremely traumatic upbringing which has undoubtedly affected her adult life, so it is hard to find the line to draw between trauma and possible dementia signs.i have known her for about 10 years and in the last 2 years i and another family member have notice a huge decline in the following areas:-telling the same story every single time we speak, dozens of times-paranoia that everyone is looking at her and speaking about her-inability to follow simple stories that were telling her- for example, stories about our day, or instructions-falling out with all of her friends-forgetting appointments and family plans -inability to sleep, constantly complaining about insomnia and waking up at 3am-increased extremely heavy alcohol consumption, regularly 2-3 bottles of wine per night and she says it‚Äôs ‚Äúto help her sleep‚Äù.things to note:i have tried to speak to my husband (her son) about this so many times and he becomes defensive, saying that i‚Äôm just being mean to her. i have spoken to my sister in law and she has noticed the same things that i have noticed. we have tried to speak to our father in law (her husband) and he just brushes it off saying that she‚Äôs doing crossword puzzles so she‚Äôll be fine. i feel like if i speak to her directly she will get extremely defensive and dismissive.so my question is, is there anything we can actually do or say to help her?! are there early intervention techniques? or do we just watch her deteriorate?",Mother-In-Law showing early dementia signs,0

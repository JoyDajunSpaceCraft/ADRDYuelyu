I know that he's just gotten home from the hospital but I would also recommend having him checked for a potential UTI. Absolutely, any change in routine, & especially something as traumatic as a hospitalization can result in a decline. With routine & care, he may regain some or all of what he has lost but it is highly individualized. However, I've found that with any sudden decline, it is usually prudent to make sure a UTI is not also in play, as many of the symptoms indicative of a decline can also be caused or exacerbated by a UTI. Sending you & your family love & support & we hope that your Grandpa-in-law is feeling more himself again. Xo
Hey there, I know this is a bit off topic & I apologize for that. Quick question to make sure I'm understanding this correctly- a UTI can be seen in a patient and they will start to experience AD symptoms afterwards?
No worries. So, unlike people who suffer from a UTI & are younger (who would complain of things like painful urination, fever, chills & lower abdominal pain), older adults often struggle with behavioral changes as a result of a urinary tract infection. You might see increased confusion. agitation, withdrawal etc. Unfortunately, for those already dealing with dementia, these type of symptoms can be overlooked or explained away by age or possible progression & the underlying UTI can get worse & eventually the infection can spread to the bloodstream. The rule of thumb is that if an elderly person, ESPECIALLY one who is already dealing with dementia, shows signs of decline suddenly, check for a UTI to exclude that as a possibility.
Awesome explanation. Thank you very much for taking the time to explain this. I never heard of this scenario before, so I was really interested, due to the bacteria involved with UTIs and seeing if it fit into my AD theory :)
I think this is super common. How long was he hospitalized? my dad who has Alzheimer's was hospitalized after falling and was in the hospital for 3 days. I noticed a marked decline after he came home; couldn't use the bathroom anymore, was shuffling around a lot, had more trouble talking. It took a little time but he mostly "recovered" and is back to his usual self.
He got out last Sunday after being in for 4 days. Thanks. I just didn't know if he should have been back to "normal" by now, or if it took a fair amount of time
as with anything, it really just depends on the person but anything outside of their normal routine can really throw them for a loop
Yea, I've noticed that. I have come to dread big family get-togethers, he is easily aggravated for a few days afterwards. This is just a very dramatic change, it's never been this bad
It’s worth testing for a UTI if you can. That can cause confusion, delirium even in healthy older adults. It could also be stress/agitation - or of course worsening symptoms. We’ve learned that skill loss looks more like little cliffs than gradual. Key skills are lost that propped others up. Also, for us a small dose of anti anxiety medication stopped the rummaging/escaping (lexapro). It was a godsend. Best of luck to you! If he’s like my mother in law, he will get miraculously better as soon as you’re about to go to the doctor haha
Did the hospital find a cause for the dizziness/vertigo? Sudden-onset dizziness can be a symptom of stroke. Even mild strokes can affect wider brain function and cognition. Infections can also cause the kind of changes you describe. Has anyone checked your Grandpa's temperature? Either way, it is difficult to know what the future will bring if it's not clear what is causing the current problems. You may want to have a talk with your Grandpa's doctor.
Well, unfortunately, with my grandma, it happens suddenly.
For an example: Monday she was fine, but at Tuesday she fell from her bed and peed herself. It was gaming changing to her, now it feels like her mental state got way worse.
So from what I experienced, yeah, it happens like you're seeing. :(
In one day they are ok, the other something can change. It's unpredictable
Check her for a silent UTI. These are symptoms.
I'm sorry, English is not my first language, what do you mean by silent uti and those are symptoms for what? I'm really sorry I didn't understand and thank you very much
Elderly, especially those with dementia, do not usually show symptoms of a UTI. That’s why it’s “silent.” Usually the only symptoms are sudden changes in behavior, falling, or more confusion.
Edited to say my mother has one now. She just returned from the hospital and rehab after leg surgery.
Oh, thank you for explaining! I'm gonna talk to my dad and aunt this morning to talk about
How long has it been since her fall? And prior to it, she was fully self sufficient?
Well, it's 4 days since she fell, and she wasn't fully self sufficient but she did most things alone, we just needed to remind the medicine, to drink the right amount of water and things like that.
Have his medications changed? Every time my grandmother was admitted her behaviour changed, usually because the doctors would change her medications for one reason or another.
Agree with the UTI comments here- based on experience. I have also seen sudden decline as well. It’s a very challenging journey.
If there was an ear infection or pain, it's likely as the infection clears up, he may start to improve. My mom got angry, extremely confused (more than usual), and incontinent when she had a UTI and again when she broke her wrist. She did the same when she went through a spell where she was only sleeping for an hour or two a night
Absolutely you lie to her. Think of it as a white lie? Don't feel bad about it, you're protecting her mental state.
They call them “loving lies.”A lot of “they’re out and will be back in a little bit”, etc. Just remember, you’re not lying TO her, you’re lying FOR her, to help her. ❤️
The truth without a valid reason is just cruelty when it comes to alzheimer.
I get that heartbreak. In my mom's case, I lied to her and a few seconds later, she said "No, wait. My mom died. How dare you lie to me." I've decided not to answer at all and just pretend I didn't hear it or I'll say "I don't know."
My mother and I made cookies every week to send to my brother in a care package when he was in Iraq in 2003. Unfortunately he was KIA.One day she was extremely agitated because we hadn't made him cookies to ship off yet. This was earlier this year. So.... we made cookies. We boxed them up.And I gave them to a neighbor.I hated lying to my mom. I hated the thought of her losing her son to war again even more. Towards the end, dad was just late coming home from work, we made a lot of cookies, and her daughter (me) just ran a couple errands and will be back shortly.It's so hard, but like others have said, they are loving lies. You are sparing your loved one emotional pain.
I actually posted a while back about having to remove my brothers memorial from my moms living room because she was getting upset repeatedly. He took his own life a few years ago after a really long struggle with ptsd and drug addiction after coming home from overseas. She has forgotten all his troubles too which is the positive part of the whole thing i suppose. We tell her he is still overseas or that he is at work or something when she asks after him now. I’m really sorry you are having to deal with this.
So sorry, it's sad. I feel for you! This awful terrible 2020, I hope & wish you get some relief, on all fronts. Yep, time for "compassionate lies". I guess it's similar to not telling little kids Santa doesn't exist.
My mum also, in the last 6 months, a few times has asked me "but where's grandma Rose?" (who brought her up). I'm still at this point able to tell her, "but mum grandma Rose died 35 years ago" without her having too much trauma, it's just the sadness when she then realises how much her alzhms is progressing... But since a while already, I tell her all sorts of compassionate lies, about many things (mostly minor things) - makes life easier for us both.
Sometimes I'm reminded of that poem, "is ALL that we see or seem, but a dream within a dream?". I figure, if it makes them feel bad, then absolutely better to lie - much more compassionate for them to have less trauma. It's a great gift you can give yr mom, and yourself. * hugs *
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
I saw a YouTube guide video a while ago talking about this, I'll see if I can find it.They said something I really liked in the same vein as loving lies: "You're not lying to your family member, you're lying to the disease", but it's up to you to pick the few which will be acceptable to you.If it were me I would rather be saved the pain of being told certain big things like you're talking about and reliving it every time it comes up. Ask yourself what you would rather deal with if you were in your mum's positionI second this: “You’re not lying to your person, you’re lying to the disease.”
As their caregiver we want to do everything we can to protect them from this vile disease - often those are easy pragmatic things like preventing a fall down the stairs, or setting a fire on the cooktop. It also includes trying to remedy the psychological toll that comes will the loss of memory, awareness, and identity - which is so much more complicate and obscure. Our healthy brains look at these lies as a betrayal of the truth, but what they really are is a complicated way of redirecting and saying “let’s not worry about that thing we have no control over and upset ourselves unnecessarily”.
It’s so hard to protect someone from their own self.
I’d be really interested if you could find that video! I’ll look myself but if you have a link I would appreciate jt
I was trying to find it earlier with no luck although I'm 90% certain it was on the YouTube channel Dementia Success Path. She makes good guide videos of different common scenarios and runs through how you can handle things. I'm just thinking it might have been in her video about how to deal with repetitive questions. I'll check her channel again tomorrow to see if I can find it. Her channel is quite small but it's really good, she acts out both sides of lots of different scenarios.
Thank you I’ll be honest, I’m a “little old school” when it comes to looking up guides online. I still prefer the written walkthroughs people would do on Microsoft Note to the YouTube video guides but I suppose it’s time to evolve with the times
Oh yeah, same here. I do prefer to read as well, her channel is really one of the only video guide type ones I've gotten much out of and enjoyed watching. Her acting is pretty spot on in my experience although I think some people were upset by it. I watch a few others but it's more just blogs of people with parents who have dementia and what they're all getting up to/activities they're doing.
I'm afraid to say I still couldn't find the snippet I quoted above although here is her channel if you fancy watching any of them yourself. I really hope this is the channel and I'm not totally mixed up.
Compulsive lying doesn't feel right to me, it's not who I am.
And becoming someone's torturer, turning their life into an endless loop of reliving the trauma of losing their spouse and their mother over and over again - that's also not who I am.
And so I resort to truths that obscure the truth. "Dad's not here right now. Where is he? I remember him talking about needing to go to the bank." All technically true. If her mom is, for example buried in a cemetery, "She's at the park today." Or if you know she's laid to rest in some other town, "She's in Pasadena right now. I'll be glad when the flu is over, nobody is supposed to be flying right now. Everyone's missing being able to see their family."
At a certain point, it’s not even lying anymore. It’s emotional damage control. Word choice can be helpful for both parties (eg: “died” or “passed away” vs “peacefully resting” or “with the angels” if your family is about that life).
You do lie. I'm sorry; it feels horrible to lie to your beloved mom, and I felt dreadful the first few times I did it. But my mom was having to relive the grief of losing her husband over and over again; when I said "Oh, I think he's gone for a drive", she didn't have to grieve. (As time went on, she wouldn't have believed me about his being dead anyway.)
I’m beginning to realize that these “loving lies” are the only ETHICAL option for my mom. I am so thankful for everyone’s kind words. I feel lost and alone and so exhausted but having people verify that something I’m doing is the correct path puts me at ease (even if it’s slight)
It's very, very painful, and I'm sorry you're having to do it.
I agree with everyone who says that those are loving lies. I'm a secondary caregiver (3 days per week) to my grandmother. She is so bad she forgets her questions by the time I answer them.
I usually still tell her the truth (sometimes I don't). I feel like she is an adult and has a right to feel the emotions that come with the truth.
Yes, give her the "loving lies". I know it probably goes against all your own loving impulses to do that (it certainly does for me with my sweet wife) but console yourself with the sad fact that she won't even remember that you told her that untruth. I know that's cold comfort but upsetting her does neither of you any good and you want to spend as much happy time as you can in this situation (the Long Goodbye...)
I am sorry that you and your family are going through this. Would your grandparents accept any kind of help, maybe someone just checking in to drop off a meal each day? There are home helpers that can just do light cleaning and cook a meal while at the house. Maybe try to broach the subject that way, getting them help around the house, not help for them.
I don't think I can offer much other advice as it is challenging when a loved one is resistance. Hope you can find a solution that works for all of you.
Change' is indeed a curse word in this situation (she's more than fine with all the other curse words though, lol). The 'good cop/bad cop' idea is definitely interesting and worth considering. Agree that this will probably boil down to a family intervention-style meeting soon. It's tough because she flares up very quickly when there's conflict; last time we tried it was "YOU'LL CARRY MY DEAD BODY OUT OF THIS HOUSE!!". The key might be to keep trying though.
Thanks for the advice.
This step may or may not work. Try telling your grandmother that of course she is absolutely fine, but your grandfather needs extra help to keep his health up. See if you can persuade her that it's not about her health, it's about his.
I like this approach. My parents were in a similar situation, mother with alzheimer's, dad with physical disabilities. I eventually convinced/coerced them into moving to a place that was "independent living" but also had other levels of care on the same campus - assisted living and memory care. Independent living had shared meals in a dining hall available, but the apartments also had a small kitchen, with oven, fridge and microwave. And they had a door button they had to push each morning to verify they were alive and well - if they didn't press it, someone was there to check on them.You could sell it to your grandmother as making sure if she had a medical issue that required a hospital stay, (covid, regular pneumonia, blood clot, anything), that's a way to make sure your grandfather is in a place where people are checking in on him regularly and he can get meals. Then it's not about calling her incompetent; it's about her being a good caretaker for her husband, making contingency plans for him.The immediate move gets them into a more supervised place, where meals are available and there's shuttles to town that can handle wheelchairs if they need it. And those places probably come with weekly housekeeping. In our case they also had a recommended mover that didn't just pack and ship - it was someone who specialized in helping seniors downsize from houses to specific floor plans, helping them make the decisions of what to keep, help pack and donate what couldn't be kept, what to just trash, etc. (I can send their name if you get to that point and want to message me for a recommendation, they were great.) Anyway, once they're in that place, staff there will keep an eye on things and let them, or family if need be, know if/when they get to a point where assisted living becomes necessary.
Yes, I would be overjoyed if we could work out a living situation like this for them! My grandma could receive the care she needs, and there would be plenty going on for my very social grandpa to enjoy. My grandma is just extremely attached to her house and thinks she can take care of my grandpa on her own, but we will have to keep trying.Thanks for sharing your experience!
Financially can they afford someone to come in every day to "assist" her with the daily house chores, Home Care Attendants, I think. They will handle the cooking and medication nothing medical. In the US, it can get costly. See what the state of Florida offers.With my dad, he was a roamer so at any point he would just get up and walk out (On his way to work, going to store, out for a cig, throwing out the trash, etc). So 2 things that the doctors and my family did to try and stop him were. A sleeping pill at night so he will sleep through it and a door chime like the ones in stores so if he started to wander and opened the door at 4am that would trigger and get someone in the home to stop it. It actually scared him and caused him to stay indoors. We had neighbors spot him and call us multiple times.A nearby uncle can help depending if they were close. Sometimes certain people can trigger memories that agitate the patient and it becomes harder to control. I could use my sister's name "his oldest" to get my father to do anything. When she came over he would listen to anything she said, with me it was the opposite, he yanked out an IV from his arm and told me to get his shoes cause we were leaving the hospital now! Told me how they were overcharging as I tried to stop him from getting on to the elevator. Told him to hold on cause my sister went to the car to get his shoes and his wallet. Told me good cause he needed his driver's license and slowly walked back to his room. With my mother is was my youngest brother, the baby. Mentioning his name cause her to stop and look around for him. Photo books were good for this as it helped calm both of them down. That is one thing that you can do now is create these photo books at services like Snapfish when they have deals and just have them shipped to her. Time for to stop rambling. Good luck. Don't forget to look for any services that the state provides.
Thanks for sharing your experience. We're checking out resources now to help us prepare. I like your idea of creating a photo book; we will definitely discuss that!
Alzheimers .org , dementia .org for all English language speaking countries have tons of great info & resources & tips & etc online; call the telephone help-line for your local area, for specific questions etc. Generally, they are very wonderful!!. best of luck!
Instead of posing it as care to my mom, we posed it as her having a housekeeper to help with meals (by that point, she hated cooking and would rather order a pizza or takeout Chinese than have to cook a meal) and housework. She loved doing her own laundry, but other stuff like washing dishes or vacuuming was not enjoyable to her. That helped.The harder point was moving her out of her home. She started wandering and became convinced a neighbor was trying to kill her. We had to move her into a memory care community. She hated that, but they have been great at working with her. They let her clean and organize, which keeps her busy, and there's always someone awake at all hours, so if she's up at 2 a.m. as is usual, there's a nurse or staff member awake and happy to chat, show her pictures of her hometown online, etc.
Thanks for sharing -- this is pretty similar to what we're seeing now. She never cooks anymore and always wants takeout and doesn't do much cleaning anymore, but still does the laundry. Another comment mentioned re-framing a bit to help her see that her independence is not being taken away, so we might try that.Getting my grandma out of the house will definitely be a feat. She's not at the point of wandering or any major delusions, but who knows how long we have till she gets there.
Just a quick thought - do you think one option in the “in between” time could be to empower your uncle to provide some drop in, consistent care? If she’s not progressed into the middle stage and is still relatively early, your uncle could maybe learn communication tips and strategies and behavioral things to help the day to day. What specific care does she need? Help in the bathroom? If it’s more daily chores, your uncle could possibly help (taking into consideration covid precautions). It’s also helpful for the whole family to receive that education - it will help you understand why she’s acting a certain way and you can learn to look for the triggers of some behaviors she has. You can get this through the Alz Assoc for free online right now throug
"My uncle has been bridging the gap as best he can but we worry that it's not enough. Things are OK enough while he's there, but the days he isn't there can be a bit of a gamble.Appreciate the advice and resources -- will definitely discuss creating a safety checklist with the family."
My husband told my MIL that the insurance company recommended it for everyone over the age of ___to establish a baseline. It seemed to work because she never questioned it.
Convince him to have a comete geriatric check up, cognitive function is included. Tell him that it is smart to have a baseline assessment while he is well so that later issues can be recognized and dealt with quickly. Good luck
He will hate the word, "geriatric." Say, "... over 65 check-up to establish baseline ..."
Been where you are. I went with my mom to a doctor’s appointment and asked for a neuropsychological evaluation.
Have a chat with her and be totally honest. then she can suggest to your Dad that he have a full checkup and include it. Might also have her look for signs of Parkinsons. Also might see if he can get some PT. falls can be from different causes. If he doesnt get any exercise his muscles and balance have degraded. There are things he can do very carefully and ever seated. balance can be done even holding onto a bedpost or support. The doctor would be great with thisor a neurologist if he has one. Might also if you havent walk his house and make it safe for him.he sounds like my dad (94), never anything wrong, he doesnt have problems and doesnt need help. he lies to his doctors and puts on a brave face. I give him plenty of room but when things need to be done I just do em. he's at a point where he's starting to accept it.Best of luck.
My dad's from England and was raised with the "Stiff upper lip" ideal. Physical pain he has no issues talking about, however when it comes to mental health he is more hesitant to ask for assistance. He does see a counselor, however when she asks how he's doing he tends to say "I'm quite well, thank you!" Which, I understand he's trying to be polite, but she might take it as "Oh there's nothing wrong." (Although she has been great at weeding out the truth every now and then lol)I can understand to a point why he might be weary of asking for help with things like dementia, depression, etc. Back in his day, if you had anything of the sort you were thrown into the loony bin. I was actually the one to reassure him to reach out to his counselor at the beginning. He was feeling VERY suicidal and I put it as "If you don't seek help now and attempt suicide and live, they WILL put you into a psychiatric ward." Was harsh, but it worked!
Take good care of yourself, and your dad. And a Merry Christmas to you all.
Talk to you doctor. She should have zero issues with doing a cognitive test on your father without ever saying you had anything to do with it. She can present it as just a normal baseline test.And our parents will accept it from a doctor more than they will ever accept it from a child.
My mom got one of those simple "doctor office" tests. Yeah, she failed. But it's mostly her memory. She understands discussions, she doesn't always remember, which is why I repeat things so much.Since she added zoloft for depression (first time in her life), I've noticed her memory retention is MUCH better. Not perfect, but better. I didn't think it would do that, but great.When I can visit again, I'll give her that same simple test and see what happens.She knows who she is, who her family is, can identify photos from the 1940s (who's in them, where it was taken--down to the name of the park or the address of the house, what the event was), so I'm not too worried yet. I validate when she gets things right but let her know that she has forgotten things.Some of her confusion is that she's been in lockdown in assisted living without a lot of thinking required. I'm hoping they get vaccinated soon so I can visit again and get her brain going a bit more.
"That’s tough to deal with. I’ve been dealing with my mom’s dementia for a couple of years now, and it’s not easy. What’s next for you could be finding a lawyer to draw up an immediate power of attorney and a will, and then enacting that power of attorney immediately to deal with her financial situation if her condition gets worse.
Also, a personal directive should be a definite consideration for when you need to make personal health care decisions for her, but that may be further down the line.
Without more background, it’s hard to suggest anything else. She may have to retire early; you may have to take her driver’s license away (with the doctor’s help).
These were all things I had to do, and it was mostly easy as my mom seemed agreeable more or less. I think what’s most important is that she feels or knows she can trust you, even if she goes down a path where she accuses you of things you didn’t do but she believes you may have done because she’s scared.
I’m a single child too, and it sucks when your parent starts declining.
Edit: an enduring power of attorney, i mean."
"You can call the doctor and tell them her issues and ask them to do an evaluation for dementia. Maybe tell her it's for a routine visit or something if she would be difficult about it.My mom had to leave work due to ""stress"" at about the same age. Shortly after she was tested and diagnosed with early onset dementia"
"You have my great sympathy having to deal with this at such a young age, both yourself and your 【mother.
Personally I would call the doctor she just visited and relay this new information about how long they have been covering for her erratic thinking at work. Since she has had an arrhythmia/pace maker and high blood pressure, there's a chance that her recent health issues have caused an acute situation, like small brain bleeds that are disrupting her cognitive abilities. He/she may immediately have her come in for additional testing or refer her to another specialist for further help.
Typically dementia is tested by a neurologist or gerontologist with a thorough exam. Someone should attend the exam with her to make sure correct information is given to the doctor and to help support your mom with any anxiety she might have. There are several different types of dementia and certain drugs may help in the beginning stages so it would be worthwhile to try to get a diagnosis. Dementia can be a slow moving disease and having a good relationship with a specialist will help her and you or whomever will be making decisions for her longterm. Having an official diagnosis letter can also be of great help to you with paperwork.
I echo meeting with an elder attorney to draft power of attorney and health directive documents. Having these discussions now, even when they are hard, will ensure that her desires are heard and honored so you will feel confident to speak for her down the road. My parents attorney helped them and me plan out financial items which helped in the later stages.
Peace to you - you are not alone!"
Please listen to "ValuableTravel" . You need to decide if you should take over (or monitor) her finances - please do this before she loses a bunch of money to some scammer. Get referred to a hospital social worker who can point you to resources (adult day care, food stamps, SSI disability) if needed.
What a good boss she has! If her job has good benefits, she might be able to go on a short medical leave while she goes to doctors to find out her problems and then to long term disability, if she has some sort of cognitive decline, so she doesn't have to retire early.
Also - consider 2nd opinion with a neurologist.
It could be something associated with her pacemaker. I know they can cause confusion so maybe they can also cause forgetfulness. There are a lot of nonspecific things caused by something called Pacemaker Syndrome so I would call whoever put in the pacemaker and ask them to see your mother.
"At 62 she may able to start collecting social security, and so even though that may not be enough to live on, it will be something. If her social security payment is low enough, she may qualify for Medicaid or a low cos Obamacare plan so that she doesn't have to be without health insurance until 65 and Medicare.
Though it seems that her employer has good intentions, I would hesitate to release all her medical information to them. Your mother has a right to privacy and HR does not always have the employee's best interest at heart.
I agree with everyone here that you should take your mom for a consult and hopefully a mental status exam. My mother had one done herself when she worried that her medication was affecting her cognition. You can google the questions asked, it's kind of interesting."
"Ask her doctor to run a B12 panel.How is she eating? She still eating meals or does she avoid regular meals because it isn’t worth the time/effort?"
"No advice, there's lots of great stuff above. Just another only child of my now single dad who needs more and more care, and I hear you. Editing to add: could this new development be hormone-related? Declining hormones make some of us beyond stoooopid, sadly"
Excellent advice from the other posters. Get her to a neurologist and work out a plan. UTIs can also make you confused. But...a neighbors wife had a similar problem with early onset dementia and had to retire from her elementary school teaching position. There are a lot of tricks you have to play to not ruin the family’s finances, so get some help from your local Council on Aging and probably check with a lawyer $250 for some advice, it’s worth it.
"Can you keep control of her finances while giving her a little more freedom at home? for instance it sounds like you really needed to step in with the 2 meals a day when you did, but now that she is stronger and that seems to be annoying her, could you maybe go down to one and just make sure her kitchen is stocked with easy things like soups and fruit? I know with my mom, she was pretty far gone as far as the money stuff went, but she still had lots of opinions about how she wanted to live her daily life. When I was able to give her the daily life she wanted, I could control all the things she was forgetting about behind the scenes without her even knowingIn my case I was advised not to go for guardianship and at the end of the day I’m glad I didn’t bother, bc once I learned how to work around mom and she continued to deteriorate, we really didn’t need it.Everyone is different though. Maybe you should give her attorney a call yourself and see what they think. Or talk to the doctor.
Also, if you haven’t done it already, maybe read a book about working with people with dementia. I haven’t read one myself, but I did read books on parenting toddlers back in the day and have found that at least in my moms case, a lot of similar strategies work. Things like redirecting her when she gets agitated, and letting her feel like she is making choices about things.Also, r/dementia might be helpful."
Her attorney won't do anything if she's diagnosed with Alzheimers; there's a reason she has one and there's a reason she appointed you. Can you call her attorney and explain the situation?
There is doubt about her ability to care for herself and make decisions. Talk to an attorney.
"You’ve asked about whether your mom qualifies for your state’s In-Home Health Services to help out, if your state has any?She’s officially diagnosed with Alzheimers? No reputable attorney will change a thing.It sounds like, even if she was in assisted living (and yeah, that’s the level of care for someone like her), they might not want her."
"I hadn't thought about State financed in-home health services. I'll be sure to look into that.Also, thanks for the reassurance about attorney's not changing her documents. I have provided them with the Doctor's diagnosis and they've said that they won't schedule an appointment without my knowledge."
My dad tells me all the time about the trips he has taken to Japan and Paris (he's never been to either) and of other places he's not been. He really doesn't know they are fabrications. I just tell him he is full of beans and try to move on to another subject that he is interested in. It really is the best way I have found to deal with it. Distraction is good thing in this case. My dad has full on dementia, so this is an ongoing issue. And not all dementia are the same. Another good thing to try is music from when you mom was young. Apparently it has been proven that music makes some permanent connections with people. I know that my uncle (before he died from Alzheimer's) was greatly soothed by listening to '60s music (tunes from when he was a teen). That might be a help for your mom. Good luck!
Why tell him he's full of beans? Why not go along with it to make him happy?
When I've heard the story 20 times in a row, I just want to move on. I do have my limits. And he seems to respond to the beans comment jokingly.
A lot of comments here saying, "roll with it, " and "go along with it." I've read that experts recommend doing that.
"It might be a sign of dementia, but I’ve also noticed a tendency for the elderly to embellish their life stories to make the mundane more exciting.
My father (78) acts as though his few years in the Air Force sweeping floors makes him a gosh darn military career man of Rambo level skills. He’s always been a histrionic attention seeker, but maybe this helps him retain some of his masculinity as he grows feeble. You wouldn’t believe the big, stupid truck he drives.
Anyway, I recommend going with the flow. It doesn’t hurt anyone and it’s not worth your precious energy."
I've learned to just go along with Mom's stories. Smile pleasantly, ask her about them, but just go with the flow. If I try to correct her, she gets confused and pretty soon she's repeating the same (wrong) story anyway. She remembers people, places, events from the "old days" but often mixes them up or embellishes the details. Distracting/redirecting her works too.
Okay thanks I will keep this in mind. Distraction is a good idea I will try it thanks.
My mom has dementia in her 60s. She's not good with short term or long term memory. She still remembers us, though! Sometimes she doesn't remember that she has no reason to be angry with us, but as least she knows who she's mad at. We just try to roll with it, but it gets frustrating.
Thanks thats good to keep in perspective
"Well.. It might actually be early signs as you fear. It does run in families. My dad and all 4 of his siblings have/had dementia.
The best thing would be to get her checked out, sooner than later, in case its not Alzheimer's, but something treatable/reversible/something that can be stopped.Good luck."
Reduce the stress! Easier said than done. Is she getting enough sleep? 7 to 8 hours? For some music relaxes them. Others need hobbies to divert attention from the stress.
She has always been a “go go go” woman. She’s constantly cleaning or doing something even when that thing doesn’t have to be done. We have been telling her to relax for yeeeaaars but she doesn’t budge. So like you said, that might be easier said than done. My grandpa is recovering from a surgery that didn’t go so well but he should be back home soon. That might help.
Get her checked out! That is definitely not normal forgetfulness.
As someone who's father has recently been diagnosed, definitely get her checked.
"So sorry! Forgetting buying writing and sending a birthday card, and a phone call of few hours previous - sorry, no, it's not really ""normal"" oldies ""forgetfulness"". Sure, very stressful with her sister, and yr grandpa in hospital and virus n all... Sometimes also dehydration, lack of sleep, and urinary tract infections can bring on extra forgetfulness. She ought to get checked by doctor asap - it could be progressing through ""early signs"" stage already - if so, the sooner the better to start dementia medication, if that will be appropriate for her. You ought to contact your area Dementia / Alzheimers organisation, they have lot of helpful support. If she might be sensitive / uncooperative to go docs for memory check, My mom (87, Alzhms diagnosis yrs ago already) it's always been easier to get her to the doctors when I say ""oh, I have to go see the doctor for something (my sore shoulder/odd tummy ache/whatever), you may as well come too, probably time for a checkup isn't it"". I book 2 appointments, I go in first and tell the doc ""she's had a sore leg although she will adamantly claim she could walk to kingdom come and back, so please just check it out"". You/ yr mom/dad ought to tell the doc your concerns about her memory - that's not against patient confidentiality -- only the following diagnosis etc is confidential. Of course many people are often a bit scared to get doc to check if they have dementia, will put it off, will want to be in denial. It's scary. Talk with dementia org. best of luck!"
I’d 100% get her checked out. Sadly this could be an early sign or just stress, and it’s hard to know just over a phone call. Better safe than sorry, if you get her checked and it DOES appear to be early signs, you can slow the progression much easier that way. Good luck!
I wouldn’t call it an “early” sign, just a sign. Get her to the doc and let them give her the cognitive test. Also check for urinary tract infection which can cause confusion. Good luck.
"Can you distract her from actually going anywhere by saying, ""Okay. We'll go home, but first....""Have to get a shower, dressed, make the bed, etc. All those little things. One thing at a time.The ""therapeutic lie"" is one that doesn't destroy her memories of the house, like it was torn down, but that you have no car, or gas to put in it, or a flat tire, or the road in front of the house or on the way is torn up. It depends on what she will accept.
After many TLies, I always wanted to go crazy, like tell her the elephants got loose from the circus, but I was always afraid that she would insist on seeing the circus."
This wanting to go home is about the feeling of being home not about the building they are in. Look up Teepa Snow and Careblazers on YouTube, both will give you strategies on how to deal with this.
"It is really hard to do, but try changing the subject or distracting her with something she might enjoy. It can be frightening when they insist on going somewhere and she might start ""wandering"" by leaving the home when no one is there. My mom's neighbor found my mom doing just that but she only made it to her driveway when he spotted her. Luckily he got her back inside. Shortly after this and a few other close calls we found a memory care facility. There comes a point when they cannot be left alone at all. She was so adamant about staying in her condo, but we all realized it was just too dangerous to leave her alone at all.This is a very difficult disease because they no longer use logic or reason in their thought process. When they are stuck on something they can be very stubborn too.
It may be time for your family to get more help from professionals in your area. Talking to her doctor may help you get started."
Oddly enough, last summer she would always try to walk down there which is why the cameras got put in. But after a couple months she stopped and never really goes on walks anymore in general.
My mom has gone through this. We moved her from independent living into memory care in another facility last fall and for weeks (months, perhaps?) she talked about going home, and still does now and then. All I can tell her is that she's home where she is, and she has the ability so far to understand and accept it for brief amounts of time. It should get "better" with time -- it has for her.
My dad does this. My parents moved out of the country because my mom couldn’t handle everything out there and my dad. They moved about a year ago and my dad constantly wants to go home. But when she asks where his home is, he doesn’t know. He even tries to pack his things all the time. He gets clothes out and other random things. He also often thanks my mom for letting him stay there, like he doesn’t realize she’s his wife of 46 years. It’s heartbreaking.
What I read in the 365 Day book is they are saying they want to go back to when they were not sick. My wife used to say this but stopped. Distraction is the best advice.
Makes sense! Thank you
My dad has Alzheimer's and I asked his neurologist about "keeping his brain active". We talked about crosswords, puzzles, etc. She said those are fine if your parent enjoys them but they aren't particularly good at "challenging" the mind. She said nothing is better than conversation with others. Your brain never knows what to expect when talking with others and must always be thinking/making connections.
Thank you so so much
"Physical activity, exposure to sun (Vitamin D) and social connection is what the science is saying. She also needs to get sleep. Sleep deprivation will make anyone lose their mind.
That's why folks who combine friendship with exercise outside do better - the sun sets your body clock that helps with sleep.
Also, for your mom's own well-being as a caregiver, there's an excellent book called, The Best Friend's Approach to Alzheimer's Care. https://bestfriendsapproach.com/.
Good luck as you care for a caregiver."
Thank you so much for this
Maybe try looking at pictures with her? Things she would find familiar(like family or where she grew up?) I would also recommend looking at the Alzheimer’s association page online for suggestions/resources they have always been helpful in my past experience
I appreciate that thank you!
I've heard learning a new language helps.
"I like to ask questions about my dads first language. He teaches me expressions so he has to engage his brain. Hope this helps.
"Would she be at all interested in something like an iPad? I didn’t think my mom would be but she uses here mini a lot. She looks at pictures (all of the kids upload photos to a shared iCloud photo); we take her “with us” via FaceTime if cooking a new recipe or doing anything she might be interested in (my brother just hands off his phone to his kids and they take her on “tours”; she plays simple games like candy crush, solitaire, and mahjong; she checks the weather everywhere; oh and Facebook, which os new to her.
I don’t know what is available on this device as far as apps in her native language, but if that’s something she would enjoy — or recordings/music/audiobooks — that could be of interest.
As far as I know, there’s no medical evidence that “brain games” really help memory. But engaging with tasks that require organized thought over a period of time do seem to help. (Not a doctor so take my interpretation with a grain of salt.) Puzzles, card games, and block stacking toys all need that kind of concentration. So do most crafts.
I hope that everyone is able to break out of their Covid bubbles soon. If it’s warm enough there, remind local people to stop by—keeping their distance and masked, of course."
Thank you so incredibly much for your advice- it is so incredibly appreciated
"My stepfather had hallucinations with Lewy Body Dementia. His were pleasant, though when he thought he won money he would get agitated looking for it.
https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lewy-body-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352025#:~:text=Lewy%20body%20dementia%2C%20also%20known,and%20movement%20(motor%20control)."
Oh, that's very helpful. Thank you. We'll check into it.
Another infection is possible, even if they’re saying no UTI.
I keep thinking something has changed, for these to come on so suddenly. That's why the check for the UTI. Perhaps my husband can get her to agree to some bloodwork. Thank you for responding.
Be sure to get sodium levels. If it's low it can effect all sorts of stuff. My mil has not been able to walk, Drs blame low sodium. Also a urine via catheter.
My FIL struggled with this too. We tried all sorts of things, but never really found a great solution. He was very self-aware and had periods of lucidity most days, so we were able to let him talk about it and that seemed to help because he didn't feel like he was going crazy. He described them in such great detail. It was truly a window into his world!
A hallmark of beginning-stage Alzheimers is an impaired ability to record new memories. Obviously if you can't record, you can't recall. Only at later stages is there an impairment of the ability to recall existing information (words, family members, etc). If this is the first sign of impairment, the underlying issue may not be Alzheimer's, but some other syndrome. You should be concerned enough to try and schedule a visit with a geriatric psych or neurologist, who can try and give you a diagnosis. The visit will be more productive if you can provide to the specialist in advance a written summarty of the family's concerns, so you don't have to be worried about embarrasing your GM. I hope for your family's sake it is something correctible like a vitamin B deficiency.
How old is your grandmother?
Sorry missed it 68. Yes, you should be concerned.
"Have you spoken with his doctor about your concerns? My mom was afraid she was “slipping” after surgery, and eventually went to a neurologist. It was a good news, bad news, good news outcome - not surgery/anesthesia related, but some real decline, but not Alzheimer’s and doctor felt confident with a plan to slow and even improve some areas.
Sounds like your dad’s decline is more pronounced. I hope you and he will get some good news."
A bit of background info. He did drink beer nightly for at least 30 years. My mom passed in February of 2021 and of course he had been grieving. The same year in July of 2021 he got his diagnosis which was very similar to what my moms cancer diagnosis was (possibly both parents had similar diagnosis due to alcohol). His chemo IV treatments were from Aug.-Dec. 2021. In December the memory issues were painfully obvious and appeared so suddenly. By January primary dr was updated, neurologist was brought in (EEGs were and CT of head done all ruled out things like a stroke), cancer doctors (radiation and chemo) were made aware, and surgeon was made aware. What’s made this all AWFUL is that in March his cancer still had to be removed via surgery (permanent colostomy bag). So it’s a catch 22. The cancer had to be removed to prevent spread and now he can’t learn how to use the bag.............. he is currently in “rehab” for post surgery to “learn the bag” but bless his heart he can’t help that he can’t learn it as of yet.
"Cancer sucks! It steals so much from us. What a difficult situation for you both.
I will say that last summer I had to help put a friend into memory care. I looked at a lot of places. Some - certainly not all - are able to handle issues like a colostomy. As bad as her memory issues were, it was a wrench to move her from her home. However, she was able to settle in and now is doing quite well. Key is the staff. It is a special kind of person who does that work.
I tell you this because it sounds like your dad is going to need care from now on. As we began that journey for m friend, everything seemed like loss. Loss for my friend, loss of my friend. Worse, I was an active agent in taking things away from her - but it was also the most loving thing I could do for her. And eventually I learned to count the things gained - safety, physical care, caring interactions with staff, visits with friends, and now she is close to her cousins, her last family.
Take care of yourself on this journey!"
Sadly in our state for assisted living (even with memory care) the patient must be able to manage the bag. So an option for us would be a skilled nursing home. And it blows my mind that a nice, cute assisted living is cheaper than a nursing home. It’s just the bag that’s holding him back. And I would be SO MUCH more comfortable I with him in a place like that. We are still just exploring options but the options are becoming limited.
And I love your mindset of gaining things like a feeling of safety and security. That’s how my mind has shifted for the past several weeks. I’ve been able to sleep at night even while he’s at the rehab facility.
How do I post my own comment or question ?

"It’s hard to tell from this if you are being an ass or not. Other than language slipping, what makes you think he has dementia? And is his language being affected in his first language?",,,,
"I would relax, but keep looking for worsening. Maybe you are seeing signs that are early enough that you wouldn’t get a diagnosis, or maybe you are seeing absolutely nothing at all. I’m 50, and I don’t remember my daughters first bike ride. I remember her learning to ride a bike, but not the exact first ride. I also get pets names mixed up other than my own pet. Other people’s pets just don’t matter as much to me. Old addresses I can remember well, but there was one house we lived in for a couple of months that I have absolutely no clue of even the street name. As an adult, I’ve only lived in 3 houses, so I’m clueless about 1/3 if those houses.

Again, you may be overreacting, but be on the lookout for true signs of confusion, personality changes, increased agitation/anxiety, loss of critical thinking skills, and increased memory issues. My husband, for instance, asked me today if he should eat his soup out of a bowl. That’s a sign because soup doesn’t work so well on plates. On his birthday, my friend said happy birthday to him via a text message. I read it to him and he responded by telling me to say “happy birthday to you, too!” He can’t remember something I told him 60 seconds ago sometimes. Those are warning signs.",,,,
"Agree with you u/bonnieMSM. A bit of forgetfulness is not the only sign. OP should be looking for failures in reasoning, personality and behavior changes. His refusal to take the test may be due to his fear of cognitive decline / dementia which is quite normal I think.

"Anesthesia will messup your memory but it’s fairly short therm. You’ll have big blank chunks but you’ll be somewhat aware of it. Not sure if it’s your father case.

As for being not receptive to the test is it like him? Like, was he always a stubborn, negative kinda guy? Or is it fairly uncharacteristic pf him?",,,,
"Generally, dementia is first going to show up in short term memory. He's remembering current things just fine right now, so he's okay.

Long term memory is strongly persistent. Flashbulb moments, major occasions, are very strong. However your flashbulb moments and your dads will be different. Your memory of riding without training wheels was super important to you so you remembered. It was a step towards independence. For him, not so much. He probably thought other moments - like your first steps, or the first time he held you, or your first word were much more significant and those are the things that stuck around.

I have lived in just a few places. I can tell you the address of my childhood home and my current home. I could probably kind of give you the addresses of the other places I lived? Like, I would miss some details.

Misnaming and misidentification are different things. It is very common to call out the wrong name. Names are stored in the brain in semantic groups; family, pets, friends etc. Your brain reaches in and grabs the name out of the group and sometimes gets it wrong. That's normal, it happens. Misidentifying - or incorrectly identifying who a person is and operating under the assumption that person x is actually person y is uncommon and a sign that something is wrong.

Language development occurs in a critical period in childhood. It's normal to have an accent that persists for the rest of your life.

So yes, you are wrong, and you are being rude. Also - you are not a doctor so stop trying to administer tests to your father.",,,,
None of these behaviors seem abnormal. They sound like being human. I think your dad is right and it’s disrespectful. Why are you pursuing this so hard?,,,,
"Nothing you've described sounds like dementia, and even if it is super early symptoms, it sounds like he is not receptive to your probing-- so, yes, pushing him might be insulting. If he has no loss of function, there is likely very little that could be done with a diagnosis anyway.

I don't remember any of my old addresses, except one. I couldn't even tell you the street-- and I live in the same town as all of them. I mix up my kid's name with my pets, and call family members pets by the wrong names often. I don't have dementia, I just don't pay as close of attention to detail as I used to, because I'm busy and I care less!

I'd focus on what you can control-- having a positive relationship with your father and being helpful and supportive.",,,,
"Not to be harsh, but I would be offended too. Also, from what I understand you most likely have no training in administering these tests. You should leave that to professionals when necessary and not ruin your relationship with your dad who sounds like a mentally sound man in his 60's. I would apologize.
",,,,
"Could be. Could be many things, stress, being tired, etc. It is pretty normal to forget words once in a while. Hell, it happens to me and I'm in my 30's. I think you might be looking for signs where there are none, but if there indeed are clear signs, this is something you should bring up with a medical professional. It is a very bad idea to try to diagnose your own family members.
",,,,
"The thing I wish I had done with my mum before her condition worsened was have a conversation with her about what she would have wanted to happen when the signs of dementia showed up. I would have felt that I had permission to intervene when things started to go downhill. When I look back now I know I was too tentative in trying to help.

I agree with the other posters it doesn’t sound like your father has the indicators of dementia. But maybe you could have a conversation with your dad about what he would like to happen if you or your mum see behaviours that worry you? Then he might feel empowered rather than like he’s being hassled?",,,,
"Talking about someone’s cognitive abilities is a very delicate topic. When I administer the MOCA and try to explain to my patient why I am doing it, it’s like a dance. I have to be honest about it yet if I don’t say things very mindfully, they often end up defensive and refuse to take the test. Once someone questions your mental faculties, everything changes. The person now has to prove to everyone, even strangers, that they are OK. From what you’ve described, dementia wouldn’t even be on my radar at this point.

I also echo what others have said, which is that you should not be administering tests without appropriate training. If a person is correctly trained they know they should never administer a test like that to someone they know. The test would be invalid simply because the chance of bias is so high; you will both react to each other which will change the outcome significantly. It may seem like a simple test, but there is so much more to accurate assessment than just knowing the items. You have to be a blank slate, know how to redirect anxiety in order to get the best out of the person, deflect questions about performance in very subtle ways, administer under specific circumstances, etc etc etc.

You sound like a caring person trying to help your dad. Preserve that relationship. If you are still worried about dementia, take the time to talk about all the things you want to know about him and his life. Have the treasured conversations people wish they could have had before the person was too far gone.",,,,
"Step one in healthcare is informed consent. If you do not have it, you can not proceed. You don't have it, you cannot proceed. Step two is determining the hypothesis, and finding a tool to measure that.

Step whatever is interpreting the outcome, based on the score and the background information, and comparing those results within the agegroup. Do you have the knowledge to accurately do this? Do you know what the MOCA is supposed to measure, how you need to standardise your questions, and interpret the outcome?

The test looks simple, but I assure you, the interpretation is more complex, if you want to draw any conclusions. Your conclusions aren't professional, so it gives you nothing. And finally, dementia isn't reversible, so what do you gain? What you need to do is discuss your worries, and ASK. Ask how he wants the rest of his life to look etc, so you can be sure you're acting out his wishes, instead of imposing yours.",,,,
"Lastly: amnesia due to narcose won't suddenly show up 9 years later.
",,,,
"I think I'd react the same as your dad if that had been done to me too. You don't actually see how that would be a little insulting and bothersome?

Dementia affects short-term memory, but not all memory loss means dementia. This is a medical condition that should only be diagnosed by a neurologist.

General slowing down in everything is part of normal aging. Leave your dad alone with the inquisitions and tests. If he's got something, it will show up eventually but it's not your place.",,,,
"I’m going to be the one dissenting voice. Dementia should be treated as early as possible. However, the word “dementia” is very hard to hear. My husband had “short-term memory loss”. Now he has been diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia.

Your dad’s surgery may have affected him if he went without oxygen and your family wasn’t told. Otherwise, it’s very unlikely.

I can’t remember events. I’m an engineer and I can remember numbers and pipe inside diameters etc. His accent is normal. Mixing up pet’s names is normal. Forgetting English words after 30 years in an English speaking country isn’t normal.

My husband’s long term memory is also affected now although it was his short term memory at first. He mixes up events and makes up things that never happened. However, his dementia is moderate.

Does your dad still work? Is it a problem at his job?

The best thing would be to get your dad evaluated by a neurologist. If he won’t go now, he may start getting worse and then it will become obvious that he needs to go. Your mother might be a better person to speak to about this. Let her arrange it.",,,,
"maybe start documenting these events so the next time you bring it up to family members they can't just brush it off.

are you able to go to a doctor's appt with her, or contact here PCP if she has one? seems like it'd be worth getting her evaluated",,,,
"Another possible explanation is that she's got sleep apnea/is sleep deprived (although the falling doesn't fit this). A neurologist could help accurately identify the root cause (although maybe not without an in-person visit).
",,,,
"She has dementia.

The falling alone is an early sign: the gait of people with dementia changes. Add to that the forgetfulness and the fear and she's deep into it.

When you can, you can get her a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).

Until then, divorce yourself from it by refusing to enable:

""No, I will not accompany her to the store, she has dementia.""

""No, I will not check in on her cooking, she has dementia. She needs professional help.""",,,,
"Not sure if you mentioned where your from but a issue I had with my mother is a power of attorney so you can help her with things.

Once her mind starts and it's documented by doctor's she can no longer sign to give you poa, a court must.

Even if it's never used have your parent sign a poa to you or a sibling before makes it to that point. Otherwise it's a lot of red tape.",,,,
"You’re in a tough spot. Hugs to you though for being watchful & caring. Does your MIL always see the same PCP? If so, please document everything you see: what, when, dates & times. Then take your list (keep a copy for yourself) & your concern that she has dementia & send it to her PCP. Her doctor may not be able to share any of her info with you but you sure as heck can tell her doctor all of the info about her that you want. Once the doctor receives your letter they may call your MIL in for a checkup. If not, at least your letter is in her file for her next appointment whenever she does go in.

Keep watching your MIL. Urge them to get their wills & poa’s in order.",,,,
"My MIL had early onset. Looking back on it, probably started about 55 but by the time she was 60 it was obvious to everyone but her pin headed husband. My husband (her son), tried desperately to get a diagnosis, adult day care, etc. Complete resistance until one day her husband threw up his hands and wanted her gone. My husband and I had to scramble to find a facility, which sucked. We both knew that nothing was going to be done until it became a crisis. And it certainly did. I'm so sorry for what you and your husband are going to go through. There's really nothing you can do if MILs husband and other children refuse. It's a trainwreck waiting to happen. Just stand by, wait for it to happen and then go visit. And go visit often because after she is put in a facility, NO ONE will consistently help (too depressing, she doesn't know me, etc.). Save your energy for making sure she is clean, has clean clothes, treats to eat and some exercise and sunshine. You definitely need to ""pop in"" at these facilities at odd times and be totally on top of her care. Good luck. This is a marathon, not a sprint.",,,,
"The fact that he opened up to you may speak to the fear he is facing. Might have been a mini-stroke.

Offer to go to the doctor with him if you see he is stalling. You could sit in the waiting room if he doesn't want you along for the examination. If this happens, maybe follow up with the doctor without him around: he may not have told the doctor everything you already know. And tell your dad you're going to do this unless you can be in on the doctor's consultation from the start.

I heard a good quote the other day: ""Some people are just hanging on by a thread. You might be that thread.""

Good luck.",,,,
"As someone who struggles with clinical anxiety and depression, it sounds to me like a bad combination of the anxiety and depression. Unfortunately it can cause someone to stay stuck and the feeling of being in a constant memory or thought loop happens and is freakin awful. When it’s really bad it can cause short term memory loss.

I’d say go with your dad to the doctor and make sure someone is with him. If he’s stuck on invasive thoughts he could be in a lot of need.",,,,
"I have seen older folks who presented with memory impairment whose geriatricians/doctor started them on an antidepressant before working up dementia. Whatever the case, your dad needs to see a doctor and start ruling out stroke, depression/anxiety, dementia, sleep apnea, heart conditions, various electrolytes and hormone blood work, the list goes on! The best thing you can do is go with your dad to the appt, get listed on all his HIPPA privacy forms so you can help advocate for himself!
",,,,
"Getting on an antidepressant was a huge help to my dad with moderate dementia. He still gets frustrated at the condition, but it doesn't send him down the rabbit hole of despair and anger that it used to before. He's still got his temper, and it can be ugly at times, but it helps him snap out of it quicker than before.",,,,
"Does he take other daily meds? Can you maybe ""sneak"" it into his daily regimen? It sounds awful, but with the dementia you can get away with little things like that sometimes, he'll forget about it eventually. I took over meds for my dad at a certain point, so adding something new in wasn't noticed at all. I added in a multivitamin to help with his nutrition and stuff like that.
",,,,
"When my dad first started having symptoms (age 55) he had issues with short term memory and hallucinations first.

I believe these were exacerbated by lack of quality sleep and malnutrition. If I were in your place and seeing my dad acting the way he was (the way your dad is) - this is what I would do:

Get him on a regular exercise program. Start where they are. Walking everyday outside in the sun. Some strength training

Take a hard look at their medications. My dad was on antacids that reeked havoc on his stomach acid levels and causes him to be deficient in vitamin b12

Get a good multivitamin that contains minerals (but not iron) and have them take one every day.

Shut off all lights and electronics two hours before bed time. Have them take a melatonin supplement two hours before bed if they are really struggling to sleep.

After all that - work to clean up their diet (no processed boxed foods or fast food) and get them into hobbies and social activities that make their life meaningful and to find friends. Also - start right away to try and get some financial help. We were never able to get my dad any help from the government for disability or welfare. They said he was a working aged man and that was that. Fortunately he was a marine and the VA eventually paid for his care. But at 62 he is barely alive.... essentially a vegetable and the road from start to finish was brutal.

He was similar to your father. Lots of depression, mental illness, poverty and just a tough life. We thought he was just being an ass. We could never have guessed he was going to degenerate the way he has. Good luck to you. If you are able to save your dad, let us know. If you can’t, then understand that none of us really knows how. But I wish you all the luck.",,,,
Fortunately my husband wanted to know what was going on with his brain. He played professional football for 13 years so he was worried about CTE fortunately he doesn’t have the classic symptoms but does have dementia and hardly speaks. I’m not sure how you can get her to go get tested. Sorry Maybe make something up. Like she’s been chosen for something.,,,,
"My dad goes to the doctor pretty much every 6 months. I thought it was routine for seniors to go that oftrn? If not, maybe persuade her to get the annual checkups everyone does. Doesn't have to be about her brain health. Could alert her Dr in advance and he could just do it as part of an overall Check. But there is a risk your Dr. Will tell your mom you spoke with him just as a warning. Mine never did but someone else here had that problem. At any rate, he won't tell her you told him until she got her appt so you achieved your goal at any rate even if she's mad.",,,,
"Hi!

So my mum's short term memory had been declining for a while. We were all worried about it and had been trying to think about how to approach it. She was a nurse all of her life, always thinks she knows about medical things, and flat out refuses to ever see a doctor. When she was pregnant with me she fell, broke her ankle and refused to seek any help and just let it ""heal"" on its own (was never able to properly walk on it again). So that's what we were working with! Then a year ago she got into a big argument with my dad over something she'd forgotten/got confused about and he threw in her face that we were all worried about her memory. So absolutely the worst possible way of bringing it up and she reacted terribly, was very hurt and we couldn't mention it.

Things then deteriorated and she got more and more confused and forgetful. So we realised it was so serious we had to say something. Because of the situation that had happened before I wanted to be VERY careful about how we approached it and took a lot of advice from the Dementia UK helpline. These were the main things:

try to approach it at a time where everyone is calm and nothing is threatening. If it is dementia, having silence (no distracting background noises) helps concentration.

have a very specific example of something that she got confused over. For us it was that my mum forgot my brother was getting married and thought he was already married. From what you say, I wonder if it could be when she phones to apologise for an earlier outburst? I would start keeping a track of what she is saying and when, as this might be useful in a conversation with her and/or her GP if that is needed. Basically the advice was not to be vague about it like ""I've noticed you've been a bit confused/forgetful at times"", as that is too easy to explain away/not fully understand.

try not to 'gang up' with multiple people. People with dementia can get paranoid so don't approach it in a group type situation. If there is one person that the individual particularly trusts, try to preserve that relationship by not involving them. It's about ensuring they feel they have support.

you don't have to mention the word dementia. Just say you are concerned about confusion/symptoms and stress that it could be a wide range of things (e.g. Vitamin deficiency).

I really hope this is helpful and you get there. Having a more informed and considered approach worked for us the second time. My mum was shocked at first (who wouldn't be) but accepted it and appreciated being asked directly (treated like an adult) and we got her to the GP with a lot of support and reassurance e.g. ""we are in this together"". I also said ""if this were the other way around, you would want me to get checked out, wouldn't you? I'm worried because I love you"". Sending love and thoughts from this corner of the Internet.

PS I'm not sure where you are - in the UK we have Dementia UK which is a helpline you can call to talk through things like this, how to approach it and your specific situation with professional dementia nurses and I found all of their advice invaluable. If you are outside of the UK, it would be worth looking for some charities that do a similar thing. Best wishes!",,,,
"I should say if this doesn't work, you might have to take a different route - contacting her GP directly and explaining the situation. Are you able to check if she is able to care for herself OK? If things get to the point where she is struggling to look after herself and you still haven't been able to get her to a doctor, you may need to go down the social services route. We didn't have to do that so perhaps others on here or a specific thread on it might be able to give you some insight. I'd try talking to her about it first, if that doesn't work, go directly to the GP, if that doesn't work, you might have to go down a more direct route. But as I say, if you can try and speak to a dementia nurse/charity helpline, they will be the best people to advise you. I hope all goes well xx

"My grandmother was/is the same. Paranoid, weird and clearly fictitious stories. Hostility towards anyone correcting her, trying to assure her nothing's wrong, etc. And a complete denial of having any real issues coupled with a general distaste for doctors. Thankfully, she loves her primary doctor for whatever reason. Unfortunately, he himself is pretty old and saw 'no problem' with her. My mom got advice from someone to write up a letter explaining the issues, concerns, symptoms, and give it to the doctor. In the letter, ask (er, sort of demand) that they refer her to a specialist for an evaluation, and if needed (def needed in our case) please make it seem like a great idea the doctor had, NOT the family. Then, schedule a 'routine' visit. Worked great for my grandma. Since he suggested it, she was sort of begrudgingly willing, and we got her evaluation (advanced dementia, 5 almost 6 on the GDS).
Now, this rouse only works if your grandmother is willing to see a doctor. That, or you sort of lie. Therapeutic lying. If she's talking about needing to go to an old lady's facility or something (which - doesn't exist - right?), tell her that's where she is going but instead take her to get the evaluation. Or if she forgets that she recently had an exam or labs (my grandma forgets about half of her appointments she's had within like a month), say you'll schedule one.",,,,
"That's really difficult. Could you speak to a doctor first and then tell your mum you are taking her to get her eye-drops? After the doctor gives a dose a few harmless drops the memory test could be the follow up questions as it does involve some reading to follow directions, writing, drawing and identifying pictures. These all could be part of an ""eye test"".
",,,,
"You 100% belong on that sub. 🙂

As for Dementia: not necessarily. My grandma spent 3-4 days during Christmas a couple of years back. She was like 92 or something. And while she was there, she was super confused! Very agitated too! They almost had to restrain her. She had fits of delirium and all!

The minute she put a foot outside that hospital, she was super mellow. She never was diagnosed with any kind lf dementia! 😀

It seems to me that my grandma did a couple of back to back panic attacks. It might very well be your case too! I mean your mother.

Also: i live in Canada so it’s a money thing.. like she could have received the tests for diagnosing any illness.

My point is : just being in a hospital can freak some people out.",,,,

"Sundowning CAN happen in the absence of dementia, so you are not necessarily staring down that road at this point, but it might ease your mind to have a conversation with her doctor.

Best of luck to you with your mom...

"Have a chat with her and be totally honest. then she can suggest to your Dad that he have a full checkup and include it. Might also have her look for signs of Parkinsons.

There are things he can do very carefully and ever seated. balance can be done even holding onto a bedpost or support. The doctor would be great with thisor a neurologist if he has one. Might also if you havent walk his house and make it safe for him.

he sounds like my dad (94), never anything wrong, he doesnt have problems and doesnt need help. he lies to his doctors and puts on a brave face. I give him plenty of room but when things need to be done I just do em. he's at a point where he's starting to accept it.

Best of luck.",,,,
"Talk to you doctor. She should have zero issues with doing a cognitive test on your father without ever saying you had anything to do with it. She can present it as just a normal baseline test.

"It's always reasonable to see a doctor in such a case. But I wouldn't be overly worried, I am 32 and have had the same issue when people I know well are wearing a mask. You say it was the end of the wedding, and he could have been really tired as well, which doesn't help.
",,,,
"Given that it was a wedding, I'm presuming you may have had your hair and makeup done differently to normal? This might also have contributed a little bit

That said, I'd say it's still worth getting him check out. The initial tests for cognitive decline are a set of tasks and questions designed to test the persons memory, problem solving, ability to follow instructions, and processing speed etc.

Even if he takes the test and come back as being fine (which hopefully he is), then having done a similar test before will be helpful if he declines in the future as it gives a benchmark to measure any change against",,,,
"Honestly, he should see at doctor. It could have been a minor stroke (TIA), and there might be things that could be done to prevent further problems, or at least lessen them. Perhaps you could have a respectful and caring talk with your dad.

A GP will be able to do simple memory tests. Specialists can do more advanced tests. It is often possible to detect early dementia, patients often function quite well in their normal environment, but will perform worse on these cognitive tests because problem solving can't be done on ""auto pilot"" (like going to work or making coffee in your own kitchen).

You have my best wishes and do take care. :)",,,,

"Hey! I two bits of good news.

First - dementia isn't really a disease that afflicts 16 year olds. I'm not a doctor, and a doctor is the only person who can actually help you here, but I don't think I'm violating the rules of sensible internet chatting to say that you very likely do not have dementia.

Second - there are loads of things that can affect memory. I'm on mat leave right now, but until recently I was a high school teacher and I worked with lots of young folks struggling with attention and memory problems. I don't really want to name the conditions my students had because self-diagnosis is often more harmful than helpful. I would start by urging you to go and talk to your family doctor about what you're experiencing. Be very candid with your doctor, and if it helps you to stay honest about your concerns, keep a diary of your forgetfulness for a week or so before you go in. If you don't want to get your parents involved, at 16 you should be able to book an appointment and see your doctor on your own. Doctor-patient confidentiality means that your doctor can't tell your parents why you visited (except for a very specific list of reasons). In every student that I worked with as a teacher, their doctor was able to offer medicine, counselling, and/or therapy that really helped. If your memory problems extend to school, and if you do have a condition that can be diagnosed, your school should also be in a position to help you develop strategies for learning and memory that work with your strengths.

After all this... If you see your doctor and your doctor kind of shrugs and can't offer you medical advice... And if you're reasonably confident that your doctor made a real effort to get you a diagnosis (meaning they took your concerns seriously and did some testing)... There are still things you can do to help your memory. It's going to sound super cliche, but your body is doing all kinds of crazy things in adolescence. It's not uncommon to have wild (and distracting, to say the least) emotional swings (and I don't just mean happy to sad... serious lows between sadness, anger, apathy... all possible). Again, I really don't mean this in a cliche way, but just the fact that you're having feelings can be distracting enough that you'll lose track of stuff. Your body is really just figuring out the literal brain chemistry of complicated feelings. Adolescence can also come with major sleep disruptions, both internally (like your circadian rhythm is shifting or has shifted) and because of external pressure (like work or school). These alone are enough to mess with your memory in major ways. So, if you don't get a diagnosis from a doctor, I'd urge you to take stock of your basic self care. Are you getting exercise? (I used to teach gym and in my part of the world the aim for a 16 year old is an average of 1 hour of exercise, even just walking, per day.) Are you getting enough sleep? (Again, recommendations may be different where you are, but where I am a 16 year old should aim for 9 hours a night.) Are you eating well? (We can go down a rabbit hole of nutrition, but if you aren't sure how to answer that question... If most of your food comes already prepared, from a box or tin or bag, you may not be getting the nutrients you need.) I know it can be super daunting to tackle these basic self care things if you are feeling at all out of whack... But even small improvements in these can help you with your ability to focus and remember.

Good luck! I'm cheering for you!

"I am my grandmothers caretaker, she has been living with vascular dementia for the past 5 years.

Disclaimer: I have no medical training other than the basics given to me by her doctors, this is just personal experience.

First thing: Be certain to have her taking her medication. Previous to my grandma living with me, she lived with my grandfather who suddenly stopped giving her medication. At that time she went from fully functional to needing constant care and supervision.

Second thing: My grandmother is so far gone that at times she does not know her own name or her children's names. But even so, every time my grandfather walks in the room, her face lights up and she kisses him. She asks for him repeatedly while he is gone, often with phrases like ""Where's my guy? The one I came here with?"" She loves him deeply still and has never forgotten his part in her life.

Therapy and a good routine are gonna be vital, and if you combine that with meds you'll slow this demon of a disease down considerably. A positive attitude is vital. I wish you the best.",,,,
"Hi, I've been working with families like yours over the last 15 years as an occupational therapist and what I can tell you is every persons trajectory is different. Once you have your wife's results back and a diagnosis, you will be able to get a better idea of possible trajectory, (as it differs for different types of dementia) but this is just a general idea- not a hard and fast rule. I can HIGHLY recommend Christine Bryden's book, Dancing with Dementia. It gives a wonderful perspective and great practical advice from the view point of someone who has really lived it. (She has been diagnosed for over 20 years now and is still functioning amazingly well, with lots of support from her husband.) I know it can be a stressful time and reading might be your top priority right now, but I've found it really helps people ad their families to understand how to live well with dementia. Best wishes.

"What did the Neurologist say? What did the MRI show? There could be many different causes for the current symptoms. I definitely recommend getting well thru the diagnosis process before planning for any specific situation/illness.
",,,,
"Yes. Neurology can take a very long time. Not surprised at all. A full neuro cognitive test that takes a couple hours is needed to get a current baseline. You're in for a long process to get a definitive diagnosis without something showing on an MRI. A Functional MRI will detect metabolism issues in the early stages. I think you should push for that. Again dementia can be caused be many different things. Early dementia can be a temporary thing caused by temporary factors. It is important to distinguish whether it is a degenerative process or something else. Best of luck.

"It's normal to experience some memory loss or word finding difficulty as we age. That being said, these symptoms your mom is experiencing can be something more serious.

"My advice. Get a clear big clock with the date, time & month on it . Get a pill box which will allow you to separate the pills into each day & ask her if she has a power of attorney in place. Things can get more complicated if there’s no POA (making medical decisions & sorting out finances). If there isn’t one, speak to your parents & get it sorted. Also maybe get a big chalk board, put it in your kitchen & write out the weeks worth of appointments, meetings etc clearly

Do some reserach on memory and get a referall from your doctor. Amazon has some good books with brain teasers, exercise for the brain. My dad is 93 and suffers dementia and had a stroke and had PD. He does crossword puzzles. The reading I did suggested drink lots of water and get a good night sleep every night. most people as they age stop trying to learn and only work their brains in the same way while not doing many things. Do things like if you normally brush your teeth right handed then use your left hand. Switch up some things so your brain has to process. Theres alot more but you get the idea. I dont know how much memory exercises are but try some of those ...understanding that its tough and its ok to not get em all. the point is the effort, the struggle and not the outcome.

Talk to your dad and tell him that all together things will be ok. Youre there for him for whatever he needs. The things you cant change you have to accept. But you will do whatever you can to help. One thing he coud do is together with you set down whatever family history there is. I tried with mine to do it and they werent interested. Whatever you guys want to keep. have him voice record or transcribe whatever you think best.

Memory is a very strange and not fully understood thing, for example it’s possible that memories pervade but it’s our ability to access and interact with them that changes. Whilst this isn’t the same as being able to recall at will, realising that some of those memories are there during meditation could provide comfort.

Also there are some supplements that are worth looking into Omega 3, lions mane, turmeric etc. In addition to avoiding any alcohol, some regular exercise, and regular good nights sleep.",,,,

The onset for this type of Dementia starts at around 45. However, I am by no means able to diagnose him with such a disorder. I would highly recommend going to a Clinical Neuropsychologist so they can conduct an I.Q. Test and determine if he in fact does have FTD.

"There are medications that can possible slow down the progression or help with symptoms. Therapy that patients can go to that may help. But as far I know it's all just comfort care. There was just recently a drug approved by the FDA that allegedly gets rid of plaque in the brain but it is VERY CONTROVERSIAL. I mean very, very. Like their clinical trials barely showed evidence of it working and was denied the first time but now they somehow approved it despite the fact it causes serious brain swelling.

On the other hand I am so sorry you have to deal with this fear as well. I am just a year older than you not far from NYC and I'm going through the same thing with my mom. Of course different situations and all. But her symptoms and what she does has caused huge tension in the relationship between her and me as well as somewhat between her and my brother. It is scary to watch and so painful to go through.

The best bet is to try and see if he will see a neurologist or neuropsychologist

EDIT: I would like to add severe depression or depressive episodes can cause memory issues that can really seem like dementia.",,,,

They are professional experienced in every aspect for the memory lossed & their family / friends / carers. They have tons of info on-line, plus telephone help-lines, in-person appointments for advice consultations - they'll be able to help you find ways & processes of navigating this. Best of luck!",,,,
"My dad has dementia- he's 60, and late stages. He was always so stubborn so he wouldn't let us help him, but I've read articles that support the findings that an active lifestyle, mentally and physically, can help improve the lifespan of patients with familial frontotemporal dementia- frontotemporal is a rarer form of dementia (and worth noting, not always familial) but it's also more commonly seen in younger patients. Article on the findings here: https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/01/416391/lifestyle-choices-could-slow-familial-frontotemporal-dementia

I'd say go about getting him diagnosed ASAP, if a doctor says it's depression insist on further tests as some earlier forms of dementia are frequently misdiagnosed (my dad was misdiagnosed at first, and it's common especially for anyone with FTD). The sooner you know the better because you can spend time with your dad as your dad, while he's still fully there. We never really got that chance, unfortunately.",,,,

Forgetting words, forgetting how to get back home after shopping, forgetting conversations etc. She was diagnosed in her late 70’s and is now in the late stages at 85. The unfortunate thing is dementia is different for everyone. As for talking to your dad, you have to do it. Maybe keep a log of the forgetfulness that’s concerning you and have a conversation with him and his doc. My mom didn’t want to admit it of course but eventually dementia took over and I became her caregiver and decision maker. Good luck!

"A hallmark of beginning-stage Alzheimers is an impaired ability to record new memories. Obviously if you can't record, you can't recall. Only at later stages is there an impairment of the ability to recall existing information (words, family members, etc). If this is the first sign of impairment, the underlying issue may not be Alzheimer's, but some other syndrome. You should be concerned enough to try and schedule a visit with a geriatric psych or neurologist, who can try and give you a diagnosis. The visit will be more productive if you can provide to the specialist in advance a written summarty of the family's concerns, so you don't have to be worried about embarrasing your GM. I hope for your family's sake it is something correctible like a vitamin B deficiency.

"This sounds very similar to what I first noticed in my husband. He wasn’t temperamental to begin with so when little agitations began popping up, they really stood out to me. The agitation, moodiness, slight memory issues (seeming to be more with things that he doesn’t really comprehend), inability to create and stick to a plan all worsened until it was hard to ignore. A few years ago, the doctor though he was likely depressed. Last year, I took him back and the doctor was able to see what I’d been seeing for a while. After a referral to a neurologist, we got a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment of the frontotemporal lobes. He isn’t advanced enough yet to qualify as having frontotemporal dementia (FTD) but that’s coming.

I’m not saying your dad has FTD. I am saying that changes in personality, increased agitation and outbursts, and impaired memory are things that need to be mentioned to his doctor. Perhaps it’s something that can be diagnosed and treated easily. If there is treatment available for whatever may be going on, you want him to have that treatment.",,,,

My question is, do you think it’s possible that your dad was hinting he would kill himself if he suspects he has dementia? Ask him. Ask him if he had a plan. I just lost a friend to suicide.

She'll also insistently offer napkins that I've brought her to others, most frequently at weekly church events.

My mom was a college professor as well and when her memory started to go it dealt a blow to her while identity and our perception of her. Things change and you adapt.
That being said, the first step is going to see a neurologist or geriatric doc that specializes in dementia. There can be many causes of dementia or dementia-like symptoms. A professional needs to be involved and rule them out first. It took us about 3 years from when we noticed major issues to get my mom to see a doc. Keep trying, keep insisting.

Those doctors can order a neuro-psych evaluation which is a comprehensive test that takes about 5-6 hours. My mom did hers over two days and that’s how she was diagnosed. It doesn’t have to be through a CT scan or MRI. The test involves testing memory and a bunch of other things dealing with mental capacity. The patient doesn’t get stressed they just answer questions in a quiet environment with assistance navigating the test. This test also serves as a baseline to monitor progression. The main thing is the diagnosis can open doors for care options. For example my mom got physical therapy for her balance issues.

Good luck. Also make sure you and your mom get a durable power of attorney for you for both financial and medical in case you have to make decisions for her.

"That’s tough to deal with. I’ve been dealing with my mom’s dementia for a couple of years now, and it’s not easy. What’s next for you could be finding a lawyer to draw up an immediate power of attorney and a will, and then enacting that power of attorney immediately to deal with her financial situation if her condition gets worse.

Also, a personal directive should be a definite consideration for when you need to make personal health care decisions for her, but that may be further down the line.

Without more background, it’s hard to suggest anything else. She may have to retire early; you may have to take her driver’s license away (with the doctor’s help).

These were all things I had to do, and it was mostly easy as my mom seemed agreeable more or less. I think what’s most important is that she feels or knows she can trust you, even if she goes down a path where she accuses you of things you didn’t do but she believes you may have done because she’s scared.

"You have my great sympathy having to deal with this at such a young age, both yourself and your mother.

Personally I would call the doctor she just visited and relay this new information about how long they have been covering for her erratic thinking at work. Since she has had an arrhythmia/pace maker and high blood pressure, there's a chance that her recent health issues have caused an acute situation, like small brain bleeds that are disrupting her cognitive abilities. He/she may immediately have her come in for additional testing or refer her to another specialist for further help.

Typically dementia is tested by a neurologist or gerontologist with a thorough exam. Someone should attend the exam with her to make sure correct information is given to the doctor and to help support your mom with any anxiety she might have. There are several different types of dementia and certain drugs may help in the beginning stages so it would be worthwhile to try to get a diagnosis. Dementia can be a slow moving disease and having a good relationship with a specialist will help her and you or whomever will be making decisions for her longterm. Having an official diagnosis letter can also be of great help to you with paperwork.

I echo meeting with an elder attorney to draft power of attorney and health directive documents. Having these discussions now, even when they are hard, will ensure that her desires are heard and honored so you will feel confident to speak for her down the road. My parents attorney helped them and me plan out financial items which helped in the later stages.

He’s always been a histrionic attention seeker, but maybe this helps him retain some of his masculinity as he grows feeble. You wouldn’t believe the big, stupid truck he drives.

Anyway, I recommend going with the flow. It doesn’t hurt anyone and it’s not worth your precious energy.",,,,
"Well.. It might actually be early signs as you fear. It does run in families. My dad and all 4 of his siblings have/had dementia.

The best thing would be to get her checked out, sooner than later, in case its not Alzheimer's, but something treatable/reversible/something that can be stopped.

Good luck.",,,,
"Reduce the stress! Easier said than done. Is she getting enough sleep? 7 to 8 hours? For some music relaxes them. Others need hobbies to divert attention from the stress.
",,,,
"Get her checked out! That is definitely not normal forgetfulness.
",,,,
"As someone who's father has recently been diagnosed, definitely get her checked.
",,,,
"So sorry! Forgetting buying writing and sending a birthday card, and a phone call of few hours previous - sorry, no, it's not really ""normal"" oldies ""forgetfulness"". Sure, very stressful with her sister, and yr grandpa in hospital and virus n all... Sometimes also dehydration, lack of sleep, and urinary tract infections can bring on extra forgetfulness. She ought to get checked by doctor asap - it could be progressing through ""early signs"" stage already - if so, the sooner the better to start dementia medication, if that will be appropriate for her. You ought to contact your area Dementia / Alzheimers organisation, they have lot of helpful support. If she might be sensitive / uncooperative to go docs for memory check, My mom (87, Alzhms diagnosis yrs ago already) it's always been easier to get her to the doctors when I say ""oh, I have to go see the doctor for something (my sore shoulder/odd tummy ache/whatever), you may as well come too, probably time for a checkup isn't it"". I book 2 appointments, I go in first and tell the doc ""she's had a sore leg although she will adamantly claim she could walk to kingdom come and back, so please just check it out"". You/ yr mom/dad ought to tell the doc your concerns about her memory - that's not against patient confidentiality -- only the following diagnosis etc is confidential. Of course many people are often a bit scared to get doc to check if they have dementia, will put it off, will want to be in denial. It's scary. Talk with dementia org. best of luck!

"I’d 100% get her checked out. Sadly this could be an early sign or just stress, and it’s hard to know just over a phone call. Better safe than sorry, if you get her checked and it DOES appear to be early signs, you can slow the progression much easier that way. Good luck!
",,,,
"I wouldn’t call it an “early” sign, just a sign. Get her to the doc and let them give her the cognitive test. Also check for urinary tract infection which can cause confusion. Good luck.

"Has he been diagnosed? If this is the only sign other than what seems to just be aging, then it could truly be something else. But if he's been diagnosed, just know that these things aren't that linear and every patient is different. I'm sorry that happened. I am trying to brace myself for when that happens to me. Intellectually you know it's the disease, but that doesn't mean it won't shatter your world.
",,,,
"I would say dr. visit, as soon as possible.

My mom had alzheimer's. By the time she began to not recognize relatives, she'd already been far from ""super smart, sharp"" for more than a year.

As in, asking the same question every couple of minutes for 20 minutes straight. Paying bills was purely an exercise in examining each bill from the stack in great detail, then setting aside to be dealt with later because of being too complex (but they were all too complex). Things that didn't belong there turned up in the freezer, fridge, cupboards. She held up the key to her house, same key for 45 years at that point, and asked ""What's this?!"".

There were signs and symptoms abounding for a long, long time prior, very unlike what happened with your father.

We all know that alzheimer's is not treatable, curable in any conventional sense (note on that below), but this doesn't sound like alzheimer's to me, and could possibly be something that is treatable, therefore the sooner, the better...

Note: There's something called the MEND Protocol, associated with Dr. Dale Bredesen, that seems to hold out a great deal of hope in regards to alzheimer's, but for most it involves pretty radical lifestyle changes in the areas of diet and physical activity.",,,,
"The first thing is to make a Doctor appointment. His family doctor may do a mini evaluation or not, but he will probably refer him to a neurologist for testing, if he thinks it’s dementia related.

It’s good to get a start on this right away, because what if it is something other than dementia? What if it’s a TIA (mini stroke)? Or an infection? Or a UTI? Some of those things are fixable. So let the doctor figure out what’s going on and take it from there.",,,,
"Well, a sneaky way is to call his doctor and tell him what is going on. Tell the doctor to keep your name out of it. The doctor’s office could then call to make an appointment for your Dad and Mom’s yearly physicals. He may not be suspicious if they both have appointments.

The doctor can listen to anything you want to tell him, he just can’t give you medical information on your dad without signed consent from him.",,,,
"Sometimes the best way to lightly encourage someone to get the help they need is to make it appear as though it's for you. I call this the humble approach. You are basically taking one for the team. You need to find a way to ""need"" to go to the doctor yourself, and having a helpful extra ear (him) to be by your side would help.

If you get the right kind of neurologist that is familiar with having to think outside the box re: neuro testing, you can set this up ahead of time. Perhaps you are going for an annual physical and part of your school/work or insurance requirements is to have a mental agility exam preformed.

Questions can be asked of him and you. Maybe you are even looking to him for help, and his ability to assist or struggle through the procedure may be some good insight.

Additionally there are some mental status exams you can provide at home. Again if he is resistant, you will need to work the questions into conversations over the period of an entire day, rather than a quick 10 minute assessment.

I encourage you to look up the mini mental status exam on Google, very standard. Also the Clock drawing test (make sure you read through the concept of this one. It is about you watching him do it, not necessarily the final result). But with us all being sheltered in place right now, introducing a ""game"" during a family dinner could very easily disguise your motivations and allow him to feel at ease, not shamed or embarrassed.

Connect with me for more of this info. I am a 25 year expert in this field, specific to testing and thinking outside the box re helping families get the diagnosis, treatment and help they need for persons living with dementia.

Best of luck, try the ideas, give me feedback. You are doing a great job and your empathy towards his struggles makes you an excellent advocate for him.",,,,
"This is a hard discussion to have. Many of my family reused to believe this was happening to my grandma and so my grandpa didn’t talk about it with them. When it got so bad they couldn’t ignore it they blamed him for not taking care of her.

Don’t be pushy, but by no means stop bringing up the subject with your mom. I think you should talk to your siblings about this as well and try and form a united front to have a family discussion.

Also, I thought u/Cathy_Braxton suggestions deserve careful consideration.",,,,
"You could try a couple of tactics- the one you suggested, saying he is on a business trip or at the store might also work. Is she retaining any new information?
",,,,
"Don't resort to telling her that her husband is dead. She won't remember for that long of a time and every time you have to tell her again, she re-lives that pain. Same thing goes for her deceased sister. Don't make it so that she has to absorb all this new information. One of key factors of dementia is losing the ability to grasp new information. You'll have to come up with a lot of trial and error ways of redirecting her attention. Whenever she's in doubt, you reassure her. If she asks about the husband, he's at the store buying groceries so he can cook dinner for everyone, it'll be a while before he gets back. If it's the sister, she would never steal money from your auntie, maybe let's check your purse, or you'll ask her about it when you see her.
",,,,
"Maybe just ""he still loves you, he's just busy right now"", or something along those lines.

I'd avoid telling her that he's died. She likely won't remember and it'll cause her a lot of distress.",,,,
"With any behavior change, rule out medical causes. Infection can impact cognition, so can medications and polypharmacy. Any dementia med is for preventing decline. I saw little benefit with my mom and she did have adverse stomach and bowel effects. I would encourage you to start thinking and planning ahead, which we all should do: financially, medically, for care needs, accessibility in the home, etc. However, cognitive decline can make the planning more urgent.
",,,,
"It may not be dementia. There are mimic conditions that are curable, deleriums, that could be the cause; medication, infection, nutrient deficits, etc.
",,,,
"I wish I knew the answer. When you are able to see the neurologist, you could bring this up. Also, could you note on the calendar her changes, and then share this info as well? Good luck 🍀

"Is she eating enough? I’ve noticed my aunt gets really, really bad on days when she hasn’t had enough to eat. Yes, we give her plenty of choices but she just wasn’t hungry and didn’t eat.

Took her to a doctor, he gave her an antidepressant that also increases her appetite. This is all still very new but on days that I’ve been able to get her to eat a lot, she’s (almost) like her old self. On days when I can’t get her to eat much at all (even ice cream or apple pie): she has trouble remembering and putting a sentence together. The difference is striking

She has always preferred sweets and desserts. I specifically asked the doctor and he says he doesn’t really care what she eats, he just wants more calories right now. (She also drinks 30g protein drinks and takes prenatal vitamins).

Her next appointment is in 3 weeks. Hopefully, I can get her to gain at least 5 pounds.

Any chance your mum isn’t eating enough on her bad days?",,,,

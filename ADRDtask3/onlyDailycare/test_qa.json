We plan to adapt it for people with special needs and eldery health issues. \\nToothbrush concept: \\n1. It cleans teeth without any efforts and complicated proper movements, because the toothbrush has 3 heads, that cover the tooth from all sides at the right angle and with the right pressure. You just need to move it from tooth to tooth. \\n2. Since the brush cleans immediately 3 sides of the tooth, it cleans much faster.\\nIf you have any info about what should we take into account to make the toothbrush as effective as possible for people with special needs, please, click on the link below to answer some questions. I would highly appreciate if you could help us.\\nhttps://jedibrush.com/special_form"

My Grammy is about stage 5-6, and my family (me, my husband, and our two young kids) have just moved back to my hometown so I can be the caretaker for my grandparents, mostly my Grammy who is 82. She lives at home with my grandfather, they've been married 60+ years and up until this point he's been able to do most everything for her himself. \nI come over everyday now, about 6-7 hours a day, to help with meals, housework, activities etc. But I'm at a bit of a loss! My Grammy was an avid quilter, loved to crochet, scrapbook, make cards... But I can't get her to do anything! She isn't interested at all in any of those things or even anything in that area. She just wants to sit in her chair. Occasionally she'll read her Guideposts, or watch the Price is Right, but I'm really struggling getting her to do things. I don't want to push her too hard as she can get very testy, but I know it would be good for her to engage in an activity of some sort. \nAny thoughts?"

I followed up to see why they were upgraded to the next package. The cable clerk explained that if you click on a channel not in your plan, the system prop asks if you'd like to upgrade by clicking again. This is what happened and between my mom and my stepfather, who struggles with the tv remote, I'm surprised it hasn't happened before.

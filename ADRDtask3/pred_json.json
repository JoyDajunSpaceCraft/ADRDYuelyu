  "My MIL went to visit a relative for a few weeks so that partner and I could get respite. Unfortunately, her hair never got combed or brushed and is now matted. It's waist length and there are knots all the way up and at the base of her skull. I'm worried that this may be bad for her health, I don't want her getting a fungus under there. We tried soaking it with coconut oil last night and combing it, but we couldn't get all of the knots out and she refuses to help. She got quite agitated, threatened to hit us, and was yelling about it. I can't think of anything else but to cut the knots out, but I think this may mean using clippers on the back of her head. Her hair has been her pride and joy for her entire life and I don't want to take this from her, but I don't know what else to do, I think it will only get worse from here. \nAny tips, either on getting tangles out or how to go about cutting it? She's adamant that she won't have her hair cut.": {

    "text": "Hello! My name is Ann.\nMy team and me are working on a 3-headed electric toothbrush which effectively cleans teeth without any complicated movements needed. We plan to adapt it for people with special needs and eldery health issues. \nToothbrush concept: \n1. It cleans teeth without any efforts and complicated proper movements, because the toothbrush has 3 heads, that cover the tooth from all sides at the right angle and with the right pressure. You just need to move it from tooth to tooth. \n2. Since the brush cleans immediately 3 sides of the tooth, it cleans much faster.\nIf you have any info about what should we take into account to make the toothbrush as effective as possible for people with special needs, please, click on the link below to answer some questions. I would highly appreciate if you could help us.\nhttps://jedibrush.com/special_form",

    "text": "Hey everyone, I'm 22 and new here. My Grammy is about stage 5-6, and my family (me, my husband, and our two young kids) have just moved back to my hometown so I can be the caretaker for my grandparents, mostly my Grammy who is 82. She lives at home with my grandfather, they've been married 60+ years and up until this point he's been able to do most everything for her himself. \nI come over everyday now, about 6-7 hours a day, to help with meals, housework, activities etc. But I'm at a bit of a loss! My Grammy was an avid quilter, loved to crochet, scrapbook, make cards... But I can't get her to do anything! She isn't interested at all in any of those things or even anything in that area. She just wants to sit in her chair. Occasionally she'll read her Guideposts, or watch the Price is Right, but I'm really struggling getting her to do things. I don't want to push her too hard as she can get very testy, but I know it would be good for her to engage in an activity of some sort. \nAny thoughts?",

Dad turns off gas and locks doors ( supplying details to give a frame of reference ).\nShe often talks about going home to check on her parents (gone for 20 years) or kids (I'm her youngest at 34 years old) or whatever. She yells at my dad to take her home all the while saying their current home  is actually her house her dad got for her (it isn't).\nWe are managing, but what's best to say to her? When she pleads to me to pick her up and take her home? Most if the time, I can change the topic and she forgets eventually, but sometimes she gets fixated. Do I go pick her up and drive around? Do I gently remind her she is home? Do I just listen? What's best in your experiences?",

I followed up to see why they were upgraded to the next package. The cable clerk explained that if you click on a channel not in your plan, the system prop asks if you'd like to upgrade by clicking again. This is what happened and between my mom and my stepfather, who struggles with the tv remote, I'm surprised it hasn't happened before. The clerk explained I could fix the upgrade prop with parental control options. Please check your tv, this is such an easy mistake for those with Alzheimers (and even without)!",

My fear is that one day nobody will notice that shes left and we won\u2019t be able to find her. \nThe thing is that she always takes her purse with her, does anyone know of a GPS tracker that doesn\u2019t need to be charged too often and works well, maybe that is compatible with an app. All suggestions are welcome. \nThanks in advance!",

She thought my brother was turning 17. He was 21. She says she didn't vote when she did. It was the week after the election. She said she hasn't been to the special exhibition at a museum. My mother took her there the week before. \nI always just let the moment pass and agree with her, i.e. 'Yes, it's a very interesting exhibition, you should go, I know you like that sort of stuff.' \nMy mum on the other hand is like:\n' Remember we went last week? We went together and you said xyz.'\nWhich approach is correct? She means a lot to me, and it pains me to see this happening to her. This is a terrible disease.

Last time I saw her, she only seems to acknowledge others around her sometimes, often staring off into nothing for a while. She can\u2019t feed herself or go to the bathroom by herself.

She's having trouble recalling certain words and her delusions are worse. She still recognizes us, but it frustrates her when she doesn't remember details or who else visited her that day. She's still convinced she'll get better one day.\nShe's retired, but her husband is not, so she spends most days alone with a few people coming to check on her or give her medications. Boyfriend and I visit every other day to make sure she takes her pills and eats. She ideally needs 24/7 care, but it's not financially possible right now.\nShe told us that during the day, she has nothing to think about. She spends most of her time watching TV, and she's starting to have trouble remembering how to make it play what she wants. She used to be interested in arts and crafts, but it was always socially. I don't know if her fine motor skills are intact.\nI'm worried if she doesn't have anything to do she won't improve at all or she'll decline faster. I plan to cook with her next time we see her. She lit up when I suggested it and went to find some recipes. Otherwise I'm not sure what we could do. I really want something that encourages her mind to work.\nTDLR: if anyone has advice on activities we can give a woman with early onset Alzheimer's, to do alone or with us, it would be greatly appreciated. Or any advice at all on how to support my boyfriend and his family through this difficult time, resources, ect. Thanks in advance.",

    "text": "Hello all, \nMy father was asked by his neurologist to not drive any more this past August. He disagrees with this and feels his driving is fine. I\u2019m on the fence. He scares me a bit, but I\u2019ve definitely been with worse drivers. \nThe language in my dad\u2019s after visit report says, \u201cPlease do not drive. If you\u2019d like a formal drivers test, the DMV is free.\u201d\nI have two questions:\n- I have heard that because he has this diagnosis and recommendation in his medical record, if he got in an accident, they could be sued and lose everything. Is this true? It would be a good argument for him to stop driving. \n\nHow do i get a DMV test scheduled? I\u2019ve called, searched their website, stopped in. No one has any idea what I\u2019m talking about. I want to schedule him for a drivers test to make sure he\u2019s safe. They tell me he isn\u2019t due for a test for a few years. (We live in Wisconsin)\n\nNote: he\u2019s willing to take a DMV test. He wants to prove that he\u2019s safe.",

    "text": "My MIL went to visit a relative for a few weeks so that partner and I could get respite. Unfortunately, her hair never got combed or brushed and is now matted. It's waist length and there are knots all the way up and at the base of her skull. I'm worried that this may be bad for her health, I don't want her getting a fungus under there. We tried soaking it with coconut oil last night and combing it, but we couldn't get all of the knots out and she refuses to help. She got quite agitated, threatened to hit us, and was yelling about it. I can't think of anything else but to cut the knots out, but I think this may mean using clippers on the back of her head. Her hair has been her pride and joy for her entire life and I don't want to take this from her, but I don't know what else to do, I think it will only get worse from here. \nAny tips, either on getting tangles out or how to go about cutting it? She's adamant that she won't have her hair cut.",

    "text": "Basically, my 84 year old grandmother is wearing my mother down. We live in the same house, which is split. My Grandma has a basic apartment to herself as she is still able to manage herself to a degree. Her memory for things has greatly declined, and yesterday she pretty much forgot who her eldest daughter was when my mother (second of 4 siblings) reminded my grandma. \nRegarding my post. She insists that she continues to have a phone. Demands a cell phone or a landline. We have gone through quite a few of each. A flip phone with basic tech to big buttoned land lines. She cannot grasp how technology works anymore. She comes out and gets angry, throws fits saying how she wants a land line \"you have a land line grandma\", how she doesn't understand after we explain it both verbally and in written form. We write extremely legible and simple instructions, that she never follows.\nAfter these confrontations my mom is in tears of frustration and sadness. There's more to my grandma's fading world, but right now my focus is on tech. Could anyone who has experienced similar suggest anything with a voice command option? has Alexa or an echo worked, something that requires no pushing of buttons as she has a light touch and claims to press buttons but ends up turning the phone off in the end. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

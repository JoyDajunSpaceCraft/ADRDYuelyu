"backstory: my grandpa is 83. he had a stroke over 30 years ago that left him disabled. since the late 80‚Äôs he‚Äôs chosen to be home bound. he hates shopping, crowds, getting in the car etc. he will only go to doctor or dentist but nowhere else. he is very out of touch with...everything lol. so this morning he‚Äôs frustrated with his cable. he wants to watch a specific show but he wants the option to pause it for bathroom breaks and fast forward through commercials. i explain his cable package doesn‚Äôt provide that. he doesn‚Äôt have or want to pay for the dvr function.i spent an entire hour going over his tv functions. showing him every possible way he could watch a specific movie or show. he either has to pay to rent, pay for the dvr function, or wait days in order to get it for free. so that brought us to the topic of streaming services. he wants what my husband and i watch (netflix/hulu/sling) but it wants it on his cable üòÖ ?? he was so confused. he doesn‚Äôt understand the internet period. has never even had an email address or cell phone. it‚Äôs like explaining these things to a 2 year old. he just has no grasp on how the world works anymore. so now he‚Äôs frustrated. he thinks i‚Äôm pulling the wool over his eyes. he wants me to preform a miracle but it‚Äôs just not possible unless he forks up the money to his cable company. he does this with a lot of things actually. he still thinks the world runs as it did before he had a stroke, when things were a little more simple/cheap. sigh. it‚Äôs just hard. the generational gap in our home is so large. he thinks we lie but things are much more complex then he can understand anymore :/",1,This is a 
"hi! my niece took our car, and it had mom‚Äôs lift belt in it. i cannot get it back. i used the belt to help my mom in and out of cars (from a car seat to her walker or chair). can anyone recommend a replacement that i can order from amazon? also, mom is having a harder time getting out of her shower chair. even with wall handles. i have the chair at it‚Äôs maximum height setting, so i‚Äôm wondering how to get better traction for her feet. she hates the bath traction strips i put down and insists on having a towel under her feet which is too dangerous. she can only hoist herself up, just barely, from the right side. any slippers or other devices you can recommend would be helpful. we have a walk-in shower but i‚Äôm starting to wonder how many more weeks it will be practical for her. she can get into the shower fine. getting out is dicey.",1,This is a 
"hello alli am a 27 year old caregiver to two elederly grandparents and two aunts with parkinson‚Äôs. me and my wife take turns feeding and helping around the house, i‚Äôve noticed that alexa has a lot of skills that could be useful for elderly folks. asking for weather, time, calling family etc etc. i‚Äôm a self confessed techie and wanted to use that skill to help. i‚Äôve created a few alexa skills to help us around the house as welli was wondering if there is any technology that anyone uses here to aid in caregiving?",1,This is a 
"hi, my mum (55) is diagnosed with als and frontotemporal dementia, and recently came back home after a 5 month hospital stay while she was diagnosed. she is frequently upset, basically crying, repeating phrases like 'i wonder why' over and over again. i have been trying to find things for her to do to take her mind off things. i made her a fidget mat and have tried to show her how to use it, but all she does is fold it up and push it away. i have made puzzles, and tried to use puzzle apps, but again they just get pushed away. she doesn't want to do painting, or help me plant some seeds etc. all she seems to want to do is watch tv and eat, which i would frankly be okay with if she was content, but she's still so upset and anxious. i have tried to ask her what she would like to do, but between the als and the ftd, communication is tough. anyone have any suggestions or advice on how to help her?",1,This is a 
"my wife has been in long term memory care for six months and while generally not aggressive, she does become confrontational when personal care tasks like washroom assistance and dressing happen.  she particularly dislikes shirts being pulled over her head to take them off, so i‚Äôm picking up more button-up tops for her.  i‚Äôve also been looking at adaptive clothing options, so am wondering if anyone here has informed thoughts one way or the other on this topic.  she is not confined to a wheelchair, and is in fact still quite mobile at 61 years old.  any thoughts or shared experiences appreciated guys. ‚ù§Ô∏èthanks",1,This is a 
"my grandmother has moderate vascular dementia. i was her primary caregiver for about seven years, and now i share that responsibility with her daughter (my aunt). the three of us moved into a new house together last september, which of course was a major change that took some getting used to.another major change that's happened recently (last november) was a cat joining our family.my grandmother loves this cat. i find them cuddled up together napping on an almost daily basis. she was very, very withdrawn before we got him, and now she is much more engaged and chatty, both with him and with us humans. when she's talking about the cat she speaks more easily and with a wider vocabulary than i've heard from her in years.but it also frustrates the hell out of her that he's a cat, and can't be reasoned with. she gets very upset when he goes places she doesn't want him to go, and she reacts by loudly yelling at him, demanding that he stop. he is, of course, a cat, and doesn't listen, so she just keeps yelling until someone comes to physically remove him. (she has very limited mobility, so she can't get up and move him herself.) even when i or my aunt do come to deal with the cat, it's often only a few minutes until she starts yelling again. often he's not even doing anything wrong - she's yelled at him for not cuddling with her, for sniffing at the front door (she seems to think he can actually open the door and leave), or for hanging out on the stairs, which we have firmly established as his domain. i understand that i can't get her to stop yelling, at the cat or in general. but for various reasons, it's very upsetting to me to hear loud yelling, even if i know it's not directed at me or a reaction to a serious problem. honestly, this is a problem i need to be working on in therapy - but that's not an option at the moment.does anyone have any suggestions for how to tune out her yelling without preventing myself from being able to respond when she actually needs something? or how to accept that it's not my fault and not directed at me?",1,This is a 
"dad is coming home in 2 days after almost two months in the hospital. he is going against everyone's advice and not moving into the main building where there is ample care, so what tech should i be looking for? i am going to have to hire psw care for him, and i'm a little concerned about strangers in his unit when i am not able to be there. for example, i have young children, and we are now quarantining flowing exposure to a positive case at school for the next two weeks. i've got my eye on a ""seniors"" clock that displays the time, date  and what part of the day it is (morning/afternoon/evening), and i intend to set up medical alert system with a necklace and call button, but i'm thinking about a video camera of some sort. do i just get a video baby monitor? something different? i remember seeing old posts over a year ago about doing this, wondering how those systems are working for others. thanks everyone.",1,This is a 
"we've been living with and caring for my mother in law for three years. she's been in our care for five. we moved in when she kept falling, and could no longer remember to take her meds. she has early onset dementia, congestive heart failure, and is just a horrible person all around. but. my calling has always been caregiver, so i do what i must, and for the most part, it's not awful. i know, thanks to lurking a while, that it could be much worse. hubs's sister has seen ""grandma"" once since she's been in our care. she's impatient and despite being in town frequently, she just can't be bothered. this means no birthday cards, no christmas cards, no contact other than a monthly three minute phone call. however, on mother's day, she sent the old woman a five pound tiramisu from a swanky bakery in nj. grandma didn't even know who it was from until we saw the card. ""happy mother's day from daughter and son in law. "" immediately, i thought of it as the ""guilt cake.""some history: six weeks ago, she called 911 for mild angina. since, she's called them twice for gas. i suggested we set it out, still covered to protect it from the flies, until it thawed. it was frozen solid. she agreed, and we both went about our business. until the cops showed up. apparently, she also called 911 because i took away her tiramisu. the officer who did the welfare check was very sympathetic, and assured me that this happens with dementia patients. however, i'm angry. i have to watch everything she eats, because she'll eat herself literally sick. she's discovered that if she rubs her chest, it sets my husband off. whereas i want her to have a degree of autonomy, and for her to be able to freely reach out to the few people she has left, i also don't want her calling 911 for her amusement. yes, she's bored. she's spoiled. she's an asshole. i'm consistently angry, and we're all tense, and i'm kinda at wit's end, and i'm just venting. if you got this far, thank you. this is a great community, and you've helped me more than you know.",1,This is a

"hi everyone,my father suffers dementia ‚Äî we aren‚Äôt totally sure which kind because he refuses to admit that anything‚Äôs wrong/is too proud to admit that anything is off. he was very successful, professionally and was always praised for his smarts during his career. in fact he has several patents from his career as a fiber-optical engineer, which he earned and is deservedly proud of.anyway. my mother, and his wife of 45 years, recently had open-heart surgery, which was so scary and so complicated. she suffered a stroke as a result, and it was an incredibly scary moment for our family. during her surgery and throughout her hospital stay, i stayed with my father. he had delusions about her whereabouts (suspected she‚Äôd taken off to mexico; it was around the time of the freeze/power outages in texas and i blame ted cruz).it was awful. he‚Äôd wake me up in the middle of the night demanding answers. he was so confused, and so hurt. i did a shitty job explaining. i was so frustrated!but there was an evening where he woke me up, totally lucid. he apologized for what was going on, admitted he knew his mind was waning, and apologized to me and our family for the burden he‚Äôd left us with. i was totally floored. i hugged him, i told him that we loved him, that it wasn‚Äôt his fault, and that it was just as hard on all of us as it was in him. it made me feel like shit, honestly. but it was also so amazing. i documented all of it and reached out to my mom and sister.i...sort of can‚Äôt believe this actually happened. in hindsight, it feels like a dream. but it did happen ‚Äî it really did! has anyone else experienced something like this?i suppose that it doesn‚Äôt actually matter. my father won‚Äôt get any better; he‚Äôll only get worse. but have any of you experienced this moment of clarity? it seemed to me so unreal.",1,This is a 
"i know in my heart my dad has vascular dementia. i am a medical student in a family full of md's. we all agree.  he got covid in april and subsequently has descended into severe behavioral changes with cognitive decline. he is forgetting very basic things.  he has cerebral vasculitis confirmed by mri angiogram (post-covid).  he started cheating on my mom in june with a 35 year old (a few years older than me - his youngest daughter), divorced her in december after 33 years of marriage, moved to another state, and cannot keep a job due to angry outbursts. he is getting paranoid. he keeps thinking he can manage this with hyperbaric chambers and supplements. his reality testing is intact - he knows something is wrong - but refuses to take the appropriate treatment measures. &#x200b;the absolute hardest part is that my dad is and was so abusive. at 8: he threw baskteballs at me, physically abused me, made me live with a 16 year-old-exchange student despite catching him in my room in the middle of the night. he did not kick him out until he was caught being inappropriate with his friends 7 year old daughter. he would shake me and throw me as a kid. he bruised my 4'11"" year old sister. he made her eat pasta until she vomitted as punishment. he held  my foot in hot water while i cried because i ""need to recover as fast as possible so i could play basketball."" at physical therapy he turned the tens unit up as high as it could go on me and refused to turn it down despite my crying to please make it stop. he kicked me out of the house for telling the carpet cleaner to clean the wrong carpet. i went to drug rehab and he taunted me about how he never read the letters i wrote him. he financially and emotionally abused my mother. most people say i got the worst of it. he was obsessed with me playing basketball growing up. his favorite method of punishment was public humiliation. he would constantly threaten to abandon me. he was such a cruel father. he told me that all men would ever want from me is sex. in response to my sobriety, he has frequently told me that i shouldnt expect a congratulations for doing what i am supposed to do. when i moved back in with my parents after divorcing my abusive ex-husband, he mocked me for being afraid him of murdering me and made a rule that i should not talk about the divorced around him because i should just ""get over it."" he left me alone with coach known for preying on teenage girls. even after i told him i did not want to see him because he called me to drink with him. he tricked me into seeing him during a home visit from rehab. when i told him about being sexually assaulted and harrassed by a coworker he told me - i will never find a perfect working environment. trauma does not disappear because of his dementia. it does not undo all of the terrible things he did to me as a child. i do not want to live life in regret that i should or could have done more to help him but i also don't want to endanger my sobriety and mental health (bipolar disorder) by forcing myself into a positiion that re-traumatizes me and harms me. my mother is a saint and has said she will do what she can (go with him to doctors, help him get into a home if needed, etc.) because he is our father. sometimes i wish that he would just go away forever and end everyones suffering including his own.",1,This is a

"hello all, something happened today that i found to be a bit weird and i'm looking for some opinions. first let me give some details. my grandma is the only close family member i have left. she is 92 and in pretty good shape (for her age). she has mild dementia, (not alz.) and needs daily help but not 0-24 supervision. i used to live at hers for a while but now i live at a rental. i call almost every day and visit her 3-4 days a week. i buy her food and stuff from the store. she has caregivers that are free for her because of a kind of support she has. mon-fri someone is here 10am-12, then then usually the lady in my story comes from 4pm-8pm and on weekends it's only the lady, like 2pm-8pm. she wears a button on her wrist that is connected to a box and on that she can could call for help any time. this level of supervision has always been enough so far luckily.let me say i don't know about the laws of caregiving for old people around the world, i'm from middle-europe and i'm not even sure how they work here. but i never fully trusted these people doing the caregiving and especially this lady seems to be egoistic and a bit shady sometimes. you know, the kind of people you talk to and seem kind but give a feeling that they aren't completely trustworthy. her bosses are in the same category. they are from a company hired by a foundation that deals with the type of support my grandma gets. they seem ok dealing with the daily works but i always had a feeling about this woman that she seemed a bit shady along with the entire company she works for... and i heard stories about caregivers trying to get what old people have... i don't know how and what, the flat is under my ownership (couldn't sell it in her life even if i wanted to, just own it) so it's her money that could people want somehow but the whole thing might just be my paranoia.... or just wanting to get her under guardianship since they have already tried this before but didn't succeed. she also made a fuss recently about not liking me getting into the arranging of grandma's medical stuff whenever i feel like it and either she deals with it 100% or gives it up and i have to deal with it 100%. i'm a bit short tempered and she got upset and we fought about this for like 2 hours (she didn't seem to understand that i didn't want to offend her and i had no intention of taking over grandma's medical stuff, just decided to call the doctor for the prescriptipons on an impulse) and after this i decided to avoid her from now on and only talk to her on the phone since i don't really like her personality.so grandma had to go to a new doctor today since her old neurologist resigned and the memory-psychiatrist she belongs to haven't seen her before due to the pandemic. but now she got both shots and the doctor refused to prescribe her meds any more without seeing her at least once. caregiver also said she should definetly go and today they went. the time wasn't good to me so i didn't go despite that i would have loved to be there in person. i called her after and they said everything was ok, her condition is ok still, took one of her pills away and she might not need to go again in the lack of a new problem. the caregiver then told me she came earlier today and so will leave earlier too, so i decided to also visit grandma today and got on a bus. when i got here i wanted to sit on a bench and smoke a cigarette still before i came up and that's when i noticed the caregiver lady across the street a few meters from the house holding a piece of paper and talking to the phone to someone (her boss, i assume). i think she didn't notice me so i tried to hear some of what she was talking about since i was pretty sure she was holding grandma's results from today and telling her boss about it. but of course when i crossed the street a bit further up and stood in the cover of a pillar, before i could have heared anything, she started to head home (i still think she didn't see me). i didn't want to follow her so i came up and was sure her result wasn't going to be here. she took one already before and said that was so she could call them for the meds (and got the appiontment then). but now all her meds are prescribed and still she took the paper. i called her to be sure and she acted like she left it in her bag and took it by accident and will return it next day. but i'm 99% sure she was acting and took it on purpose and i'm also pretty sure that's what she was holding and talking about to someome when i saw her by accident. regardless i said ""ok, i'll read it another day then"". is this normal or am i rightfully afraid that there is something shady going on? is there anyone she's allowed to tell the results to? don't know what's their agenda could be but something about this unsettles me. maybe it's nothing but these people weren't the most trustworthy people anyways and i know there is a lots of shady stuff in the caregiver-business so i'm not sure what to think.sorry for long text and thank you for your replies!",1,This is a

"my grandfather is one of the most outstanding people i have ever met. he never went to college, but was in the navy as an electrician, then built rocket parts for the apollo projects (unknowingly), then worked at a powerplant as one of their lead technicians.as a child, he worked his family's mechanic shop. throughout his entire adult life, he worked roughly 50 head of cattle. he's always been the person we go to when we need something repaired, be it our car, our furniture, or whatever, he was mr. fix-it. all this to say, my grandpa kept busy his entire life and was used to regular projects that we would give him.within the past few years, we've noticed that he's gotten a bit more confused in day-to-day conversation and activities. he is already a man of few words, but we noticed he was more hesitant to talk than usual. when he does talk, it takes him a lot longer to get a thought out than it used to. i asked him to build a bookshelf for me last fall and realized that he can no longer do such things while i was helping him, because he couldn't remember what measurements he had taken, which pieces he had already finished, and had general issues with the spatial comprehension he should've had to do this project. since then, the whole family has stopped asking him to take on projects for us, because we don't want to stress him out. earlier this month, he sold off all of his cattle because he didn't trust himself to take care of them anymore. he no longer allows himself to drive because he's scared he'll get confused while driving. he's gone from being a man that could do anything to a man who can't do anything that he used to enjoy. i'm reaching out for help because we're trying to find something to give him to keep him engaged, something he can do that makes him feel like he has a purpose. it hurts so much to see him feeling like he has no purpose, and i want to help him so much. context and potentially useful info: he has gotten tested for alzheimer's but has not been diagnosed. his evaluation score was a few points off. the dr. has instead diagnosed him with the ""cognitive impairment"" stage, i believe. he is otherwise healthy. he likes sudoku, board games, and taking care of bird feeders on his property although i am not sure how much of those activities he's still able to do to his previous ability.tl;dr: aging grandfather with supposed onset alzheimer's needs activities to feel useful.",1,This is a 
"hey guys, so i grandmother lost her smartphone and now she won't keep bothering everyone about where it is. although, i know that if we give her a new phone she will not like it. how should i handle this? this being alzheimer's, you'll have to repeat that answer often because she'll likely ask it repeatedly. a smart phone is too smart for an alzheimer's sufferer; hell, mine is even too smart for me, and i'm the caregiver. not willing to shell out another $800 for another smartphone doomed to be lost soon, i got dh a low-end model for about $150. so i got him a flip phone (about $30) - same story. now if he wants to make a call, i dial my phone and hand it to him. then she could use it in the wi-fi, but have the calling turned off. we've decided we'll only be getting dad mid/low range samsungs due to his familiarity and their phone finding abilities are a bit more advanced than the usual. several years ago i went to a cell phone store with my children. they gave my kids some of the old former display phones as toys. i don’t know if they still have this or will do this but it might be an option (although obviously the phone wouldn’t work, but that is probably not a bad thing). i agree with all the posts. however i want to add my experience. my lo used her phone for a long time. it made her feel connected to the family and friends she knew around the country. i think she knows what it is... or something. all this to say - balancing quality of life for your lo, yourself, and your pocketbook is tough. best of luck. the best way to handle useless questions (my mom has a lot of them) is to distract. for example:   where is dad? “i don’t know, oh say would you like a cold drink?” stick to the here and now. i don't think she'll notice if it doesn't have service",1,This is a 
"but for the past year or so like clockwork around 8pm he wants to go home and it takes around an hour or more to make him ""stop"" and be content and stay. man it's so taxing. i mean he has incontinence bowel and urinary so i take care of that, and all the other stuff that comes with the territory no problem but this constant ""goin home"" gets me.. we have several different techniques that work with my dad:  the obvious one i take him home, we are lucky that we can leave town drive a short distance and reenter town on a different road. when he says home he means bed (especially at night) so mum takes him up to their room and he settles. a dog walk around the block, again exiting their estate on one road and reentering on a different road to break the cycle. obviously some of these won't fit your situation but please ask any questions and i will try my best to help. sometimes it means they want to go back to when they weren't sick. i'd grab his hand or hug him (to reassure him) and say something like ""ok, we'll head home after we x (insert activity here)"". my grandmother always wants to start the i don’t know why they brought me here conversation. usually she veers back off topic with the questions i’m asking her and forgets the original complaint. it doesn’t make it any less irritating, but it calms her down when i give her the options. my mom does the same thing, but she is already bedridden. i will just say ""we're here,"" and mention the name of community we live in, but in our case it's the same house for 50 years, but sometimes she still mentions europe where she grew up and asks for her mom who also passed 45 years ago. you might have to say something and reference the name of community he is talking about if it's not the home you are at now. it's like a switch in atmosphere, and most patients with alzheimer's respond pleasurably to music; it's an area of the brain that remains functional longer than others. it helps distract them and change their focus from ""home"" to the music. i like u/kitkatinkerbell's suggestions and have used some of the same techniques when helping my sil care for my brother, especially ""taking him home"" by getting in the car, riding several miles and returning, saying ""we're home!"" i admire you so much for caring for your dad! that's such a loving, caring way to honor your father. ...in the day- to-day struggle, i know how much of a strain it can be, how much stress and fatigue you must be feeling. i hope you're finding support with other caregivers who understand your challenges, and i hope you have family or others who can offer relief for you so you can get the rest you need. bless you! cheers to all the hard work you have done to take care of him! since it is always happening at the same time, it may be from a long forgotten routine from years back. try to engage and ask if there is someone they want to see at home, or is there something they need to do? or if they just want to be at home. it may be physical, sensory ,(is it too loud, too quiet? hth",1,This is a 
"fil is in al but not memory care, so he can come and go. i am worried that he’ll over do it and not be able to make it back home and get stranded. he wears a medical alert necklace 24/7 but it doesn’t have a gps locate so i was thinking about adding an air tag with the kind of water resistant cover you use for dog tags. thoughts? now is the time to start prevention measures so that he does not get lost. often seniors that go missing are in early stages. this is when they are most ambulatory and can easily get confused. just last week a lady where i live was still driving and went missing. she was in the early stages and her family was still letting her drive. my mom thought it was ok to let my dad drive shortly after he was diagnosed and he went the wrong way down a street. i put my foot down and said no more driving. my mother's assisted living facility had a system just for this phase of dementia. she wore a bracelet that triggered an alarm if she attempted to through any of the exterior doors. of course, it was an added option that i begrudgingly paid, but it worked quite well. my mother could do anything she liked within the facility (including interior courtyards) but had to have an escort if she left the building. i'm actually surprised your facility is allowing someone with alzheimer's (albeit in the early phases) to be in assisted living without some sort of safeguard. i tried airtags with my kids. it's ok but doesn't give you minute-by-minute updates. it works great if they go to a friend's house after school, but near useless at an amusement park as it doesn't update frequently enough. if your fil got lost, the airtag may tell you where he was 1 minute ago or 30 minutes ago. i am in a similar situation. i use find my friends on my mom’s phone to track her. you can add alerts for when they leave certain places, are not at certain places etc. of course only works if they have their phone on them. i also track her vehicle’s gps. we considered the air tag but being an apple user myself, id have to swap between her apple id and mine to see it which would get difficult. tile is another one you can use, but it does emit a sound when trying to track which could be startling. there’s a lot of ways to track and drawbacks to each. as long as you find one that’s reliable and works for you, all the better. keeping them safe is top priority. i guess he doesn't take a mobile phone around with him? if so there are apps like life360 that will give you tracking at all times. i haven't used apple air tags but have heard stories about how they helped people retrieve their stolen bikes pretty well so its worth investigating. how could you guarantee he always had it with him? &nbsp;   check out these little spark nano gps trackers. they are super inexpensive. my sis got them for her teen's car a while back and really liked it. we'll most likely be getting one for mom soon-ish. i have an airtag for my hubby. (about stage 5-6) i have an iphone as does our three children. the airtag  is assigned to my iphone and shows up on the apple find my ap under the “items” tab. i have activated the “share my location” option on my phone with each of my kids. they can see where my hubby and i are. this is a safety support for both of us. i put the airtag inside hubs wallet as he always puts his wallet in his pants and i secured in place with double sided tape. this has worked well for us.",1,This is a 
"he'll take money out, then forget that he took money out and then take more out. (you shouldn't even be driving himself to the bank where the atm. we do the best weekend to stop him but it's not easy to keep track of him 24/7)  he gets a state issue disability check every month. and our mortgage payments are set to automatically withdraw from his account. always has been. takes out 400 to 600 a month to buy pot. in the comments section of a different post someone suggested contacting social services about having his check split between him and someone else. something about how his bank has an overdraft thing. which means social services can't give him a certain amount of money knowing that it's only going to pay off the negative balance and then he won't have any left. i hope i'm explaining this right. i hope i'm making sense. we were trying to ask them to put $400 into his account as an allowance. and then put the rest of it into my mother's account. but because his account's always in the negative, they wouldn't do it. could we ask the bank to cancel the overdraft service? i know typically no one else can make changes to a bank account without the account holder there. but if we explain the medical situation, and we're not asking to take any money from him. or if we had some kind of doctor's note explaining he's incompetent, could we then take that to the bank and put my mom's name on his account as well? sorry if this is long and rambling. the various things you want to do would require him giving you durable poa (legal, business things). i take it you haven't had that discussion yet? what is your mom's role here? if your dad has been diagnosed with alzheimer's, he shouldn't be driving. it would be good if somehow the topic of diminishing capacity could be broached, or you have many large fights ahead of you. cut up his cards with scissors, take his tires off and roll them to a friend's house. seriously, he could kill someone driving. get serious. my dad used to do something similar. he was taking out cash every week because he only understood cash as really money any more. at one point the bank wouldn't even let him take out as much as he wanted. not sure if they were really allowed to do that... but they were aware of his issues. his car got taken away soon after that so i would have to take him to the bank. does he have a poa or anything in place? if not do it now while he's still somewhat with it. i used to have to drag my dad to the bank because he has a trust which makes everything a pain. he would just sit there and smile while i did everything for him. the bank was aware of the situation and was pretty nice about it. i think they're used to elderly customers having issues and in the end if it's a good bank they want to do what is best for their customer. you need power of attorney and to prevent him from getting to the assets in the first place. absolutely file for that asap. explain the situations to his doctors - they may not realize he’s as far gone as he is. you may also need to switch doctors and see someone who can properly evaluate him, because that is exactly why power of attorney was invented. to address situations like this. absence an incompetence hearing, and judgment, you need his signature for poa. you get it set up first, and then take him to the lawyer or whoever can do it for you, in our case, it was the bank. i don't know where you live, but cannabis is one of the most beneficial treatments for alzheimer's patients. far better and safer than anti-psychotic drugs. unfortunately, when it comes time for a care facility, that will not be available to him. that's my opinion and my experience. here's a good article :   move up the day that the money is taken out of the bank so it doesn’t sit there. speak to the branch manager about removing the overdraft protection.",1,This is a 
"short version (i can add info if needed), my fil is stage 4 dementia. roommate almost died and is still recovering. family member who was helping lost her husband. i am the legal guardian and i made arrangements for fil to go into assisted living. he can’t afford in home care and he doesn’t own his house (it’s in a trust, so he can use it until he dies but he doesn’t own it). he initially agreed with the move but now he’s changed his mind. the problem is that his house is rented to help pay for his care and the help he needed to live alone is no longer available. the reasons he gives for wanting to leave al are not grounded in reality. he’s not progressed enough for memory care, but al is optional and so they won’t keep him there against his will. i keep seeing advice not to try to correct someone with dementia, but if he walks out of there i don’t know what to do with him. see if you can visit the place a few times and tell him he lives there and you will be back to move his things there. maybe you and the al social worker could sit down with him and go over all his concerns. additionally, you need to remind him it's not as simple as going back to his old house, because it's rented out to someone else, and the roommate/caregiver is no longer available to help him with day to day affairs. explore options - maybe he would prefer a different al placement? you and the social worker can also go over some of his deluded beliefs (don't call them that in front of him!). show him where the eye drops are, and ask if he'd like someone to administer them to him. my dh who i am trying to put into memory care at present, has had similar delusions. and when he has lost a wallet by leaving it somewhere, he states that someone ""stole"" it. he can't locate most of the things he needs (constantly losing toothbrushes). good of you to look out for this man. my dad is in memory care and went through a similarly tough patch where he was paranoid, angry, argumentative, and distrustful. he worried about people taking his car and money (this included my mom, who he said his lawyer would be contacted, because she needed to get out of his house.) this passed after time, but it was a tough roughly 2 years. keep your fil a little more comfortable by finding lies that will calm him down. i'm constantly saying this to my mother during every conversation i have with her and she's been in memory care for almost a year. now that she is settled (she still isn't happy about it), she fears change and when i bring up finding a new facility for her, the thought of changing her routine scares her and she stops complaining (for a little while)  i was staunchly against medicating my mother for behavioral reasons because i didn't want to lose what little was left of her inside. move him, medicate him one thing i did with my dad is tell him we found him “an apartment with help” that was just a home base for him. i drove back there with him in my car, and when he saw the building, he said, “that’s a bad place.” i parked and he asked, “what are we doing here?” i said, “i need to speak to the lady at the front desk.” “should i stay in the car?” “no, come with me, i said.” he came with me, i checked us both in, walked him to his room, and we said goodbye like everything was fine. also, if he’s paranoid he may not want to take additional medications, but if he’s already taking medications, you could speak to his doctor about adding something for his mood (assuming you have medical poa?). that has helped my dad. good luck! my husband and sil try to logic her out of these delusions with evidence. she refuses to discuss assisted living and lives in the same town as sil. they check on her a few times a week, and my husband will stay with her 2-4 weeks at a time. (we are in another state) the other 2 siblings are no help. (she was also not the nicest person in younger years so they see her 1-2 times a year out of duty.) if he is a danger to himself, you can gain power of attorney and guardianship. my grandmother had moved al twice and both times she has gone through a phase of this when she first moved in. it went on months the first time, but she had progressed by the second move and it lasted a few weeks.",1,This is a

"my dad has been in memory care for a couple of months now. recently he had backpain and wouldn't leave his chair. so they sent him to the hospital to be checked on. they didn't find a source of the backpain (which seemed to go away on its own) but they did find blood clots in the lungs (blood thinners prescribed) and he was dehydrated so they pumped him with liquid. he was in bed for 3 or so days. when i came to pick him up from the hospital he couldn't walk. i was really annoyed that the hospital wasn't helpful in that regard, but i chalked it up to his feet being swollen from the fluids. with a lot of effort we finally managed to get him in the car, and back to the home. so i called today to see how he's doing and they said not great and that he's not walking on his own. apparently they can get him upright with assistance but he can't walk. the memory care doctor will be seeing him tomorrow so i know i just need to sit tight and not karen until then, but i'm just so frustrated. dr. google is telling me older people lose that function a lot faster after bed rest, but it just blows my mind. it’s not uncommon for this to happen after a hospital visit, but it’s dependent on a lot of factors. previous conditions obviously contribute but it could just be the new phase he is entering. or could it pass in the following week, as this happens too. the doctor should be able to determine what’s going on. i know edema causes a lot of issues with this population’s mobility, but exercise and compression socks can help fix that; a pt or ot could be suggested as well. i’d say wait to hear what the doctors says. keep us posted. look into massage. it helps my husband with his arthritic spine. medicare covers it under certain conditions, which includes chronic back pain. also, if your patient has been hospitalized for three days, medicare covers 100% of a nursing home stay as long as discharged directly from hospital to nursing home. (check your insurance but we recently did this.) if you can't swing that, maybe physical therapy. good luck. i had a similar experience with my mom. within a few days of moving into memory care she had several falls and then could no longer walk. that was right around new years and she has not walked since. sorry to say this was the beginning of the end for my grandmother. the muscles deteriorate fast and ingrained muscle memory that is not exercised for a couple days evaporates. remember that alzheimer’s attacks the brain’s ability to make conscious choices first. the decision of lifting your foot to step; planting it firmly, feeling confident enough on the first foot’s ability to bear weight 100% for a moment, that you lift the other… this is where she got frustrated and yelled. we tried asking her sweetly to let us help and she yelled and refused for hours.",1,This is a 
"growing up i didn’t get to see my dads side grandmother a lot. she lived a state over, and so i only got to see her maybe once a summer and over a holiday, unless she drove to see us, and those weeks always went by way too fast. she sold that house and moved to florida when i was in middle school. over my time in high school she developed alzheimer’s, and we only ever talk when i call her, and it’s dependent on her being at the phone or not having lost her phone. and i loved the talks we had. it took her a minute to realize it was me,but when she reconnected those dots she cheered up, unlike any conversation she has had with my dad, mom, or sister the past year, and she started asking all kinds of questions about things i didn’t think she’d know about or remember. after we hung up the phone, i cried, it’s been two hours, and i’m unable to do anything else but think about the conversation we just had. 😭 with alzheimer's, you grieve the loss of your loved one long before they breathe their last breath. i'm sorry you are experiencing this. a lot of elderly people really value cards and letters. you could make a nice difference in your grandmother's life if you would send her one card or letter every week. it probably doesn't come naturally to you because of your generation, but i think it would have a big impact. firstly, i want to say i’m so sorry this is affecting your grandmother and now by extension you so badly. my grandmother developed alzheimer’s when i was in middle school and i spent a good chunk of my teen years being a caregiver. i wouldn’t change my circumstances as i, like you, just wanted to see her. i’m sad reading this because i have been in your shoes (in it again with my own mom atm but this ain’t about me) so i fully understand and feel your pain. as the commenter above me said, alzheimer’s is hell because we are grieving the loss of someone who isn’t physically “gone” yet for a long time. i’d also agree with them that cards and letters would be a nice thing to consider. if this isn’t too personal to ask, can she still read ok? only asking because my mom is at a stage where she’s losing that ability, but i’ve discovered that if i can make her a small painting or piece of art, she really cherishes it and it’s something they can always look at and find new meaning in, and even subconsciously make a connection to you in it in their minds. you can dm me if you ever want to talk to someone, i’m sadly no stranger to this evil illness. i wish i could give you a big hug right now (if you’re into hugs, that is lol) but i hope at least me letting you know that you’re understood and not alone can provide some comfort. sending tons of love to you and your grandma and family 💜",1,This is a 
"hi there, my dad lives in a memory care unit. he has become aggressive with staff which is so opposite his personality. i know it’s just the dementia progression. he got admitted to psych this evening and they called me to tell me they had to restrain him to his bed because he assaulted a nurse. i am the only one responsible for his decision making/care and i just want to know what to expect. this is so painful; i can’t even believe this is a real illness. without having any information on your father's case: what other care options have been tried? we frequently have aggressive patients who only get combative during personal care. the kind choice can be to deal with a smelly resident, and reduce the amount of showers given etc. sometimes hygiene care really can't be avoided, but often the frequently can be turned down by a lot. same goes for 'having to sit at the table' or being woken up/ sent to bed/ interrupted from wandering etc. often the nurses are trying what they think is best, but it's not always what's right for the patient. your permission to adapt his care can go a long way. so sorry you're dealing with this aspect of the disease. is he on any mood stabilizers? i know what you mean about not being able to believe it’s a real disease. i am a nurse and we get situations like your dad very frequently. physical restraints are used temporarily until chemical restraints (mood stabilizer and such) are adjusted to a new level required to keep the patient calm. this stage of the disease lasts for a wide variety of time from person to person, but it doesn’t last forever. some it’s just a short time, they respond to medication quickly, some needs multiple readjustments of medication. allow the doctors to medicate your dad as much as necessary. in my experience, some doctors are too conservative with medication and the patient ends up in physical restraints for days. but finding that balance is hard, because you also don’t want the patient “snowed” or asleep for days due to medications. still, being asleep is better than being awake and restrained. it may trigger him more to have you visit so sometimes it’s a good idea to hold off, but you can check with his nurses about what his mood is prior to and after your visits to see how it affects him. when you do see your dad, try to think of him not as your dad but as someone who is afraid. it may help you to disassociate, at least during the visit. i would sign him up for the cassava sciences pre-screening for their drug in trial. every patient has shown improvement from as little as 27 days. it is on their website. please take a look. link for pre-screening ^^   above is a youtube link of testimonies from patient’s family members that are currently on the drug “simufilam”",1,This is a

"how does everyone handle things with their siblings when it's a parent who needs care? i don't know how to get conversations and plans going about my dad's care without starting a fight. hello,  i had a very similar situation with my sister. i was the live-in caretaker for my mom and step dad and she was in the same city. i was drowning in caring for them, having some mental health issues because of the toll of caregiver fatigue. we sat down with a social worker and talked about how i needed her support. progress was slow, but 4 years later she is my best friend and we depend on eachother a lot. our mom is now in the late stage and in a memory care unit. please give your sibling the offer of support before they reach that point. literally same scenario, my wife and i are the caretakers to my mother in law with mid stages alzheimers. her son who lives 10 mins away visits once or maybe twice a month. hasn't done much for her care and i believe doesn't like seeing his mother in her condition. unfortunately you cannot change them to make them care more, either they are willing or not. it's a bad situation and i would wish all parties put the same effort in. it's like every bad sibling interaction from childhood on is happening again with my sisters. it's tearing us apart and i'm thinking it'll not be repaired. my brain is tired tonight but it's like family roles, our roles as siblings and roles with parents have created patterns that got worse with ailing parents. if i could redo the last few years i'd ensure that my step up sister didn't take on so much. i'd also care less about worrying that i'd step on toes or hurt feelings and care more about stuff just getting done. the sibling who is good with your dad:  support her every way possible. bring meals, do chores, drive dad places, give her money and ask if there's anything else you can do. hint:  most caregivers could you use a respite caregiver so they can get to the dentist or have their hair cut. mention if he's losing weight, is he sleeping well, what goofy thing has he done lately (my dh recently peed in a wastebasket in the night, but didn't remember doing it). don't ask her for help, but at least she's in the loop when possibly bigger decisions need to be made. first we had to identify who our parents had put in charge if any. hunted for papers to find out who was the power of attorney. you could have a social worker come to your parents house with or without a nurse and evaluate your parents needs. once the social worker knows what is needed, a seperate meeting could occur with all family members present to hear what mom and dad need. responsibilities can be assigned to each in the sw presence to avoid conflict. remember though, you need to consider the life of each person. for example, i had a brother who was currently taking care of his inlaws. three of us really worked to help our parents out and we were successful. & tears. where there strengths were with our parents. if you don't have a poa then ask the social worker what can be done to do this. it might take a day in court to be established but will give you legal access to handling their affairs. i hope this helps.",1,This is a

"i have a parent who tells me they've been diagnosed with alzheimer's. my relationship with the parent has been trying for my entire life due to their mental illness and, i believe, extreme narcissism. the issue i have is that i'm on my own and they're in one of the poorest states of the country, so, i'd be looking at some pretty limited options in terms of work and life, to say nothing of the fact that they've never really willingly been there since i graduated in terms of safety net or helping me in my career. the parent has a partner but they're in their 80s so... honestly, and i may get tons of shit for this. i would suggest avoiding completely uprooting your life, career and future for a parent you are not close with, and harbor any amount of resentment towards. i honestly don't believe just bc you birthed a kid or two, that you're entitled to their time/effort and anguish..... especially if you were  a shit parent. and taking care of a much loved relative w/ alzheimer's is hard on the good days. i would see about taking family leave for as long as you can, in order to try and get a sense of what they have going on now/what she needs & how to set things up for management from afar. get medical poa at minimum, switch all physician contact info to you, also look into financial poa if possible. (may be much harder w/ a spouse or partner involved) if she is still fairly self sufficient, i would try and find a facility that starts with assisted living, and has steps for future memory care. (we wish we could have gotten my grandma into her facility sooner, when she was more ""with it"" she's always been very social, and if she had more time to adjust prior to decline, we think she would be more comfortable now) if you can get her set up where she's comfortable, and manage her care from afar i would, in your situation. that or find a facility close to where you are now, and move her there for you. if career prospects and everything is as bad as you say, i think avoiding it would be overall better. they moved closer to me, a nearby city where 2 siblings live so i don't get the brunt of it. it's a lot of work, tons of paperwork and research as they decline. from my own experience, a rocky relationship gets worse. i have a really hard time fighting my own feelings and being kind when i just want to walk away. maybe it'd be different if my mother liked me but who knows. if it's affordable this is the time to look into transitional living, independent to memory care. it can be complex, so much to factor in. oh jeez i'm sorry to sound so negative! it's just a struggle i'm currently dealing with. i have the opposite situation as you, my dad is the kindest, sweetest man i’ve ever known. he’s in an “apartment with help” (memory care) 10 minutes away which is centrally located between my siblings and i. and it can still be really stressful. my mother died suddenly in november 2020. i believe it was due to the stress of caregiving. add to that the narcissism of your parent and other mental health issues you’ve mentioned, and uprooting your life and moving to a place with limited career options sounds like a dream come true for a narcissistic parent and a nightmare for the child of a narcissist. unless they’re willing to give you poa or move to “an apartment with help” i personally wouldn’t move there. if they expect you to move there and be their whipping boy/girl for the rest of their life i would make it clear it’s not happening. and then i would expect them to say what an awful son/daughter you are because that’s what narcissists do. i’m so sorry you have to go through this. please keep us updated! i found a local support group for adult children of alzheimer’s patients through alz.org. if you have to be the primary caretaker, move them to you, or both of you move somewhere with max. options and support. my family and i did exactly this about 1.5 years ago. don't give up your job and social network to become a caretaker to an aging narcissist. nope, you'll simply get verbally abused.. we moved my mil from florida to nc to live with us instead.",1,This is a 
"my dad is 50. i’m his primary caregiver, he has early onset alzheimer’s and every day i see him get worse. every day when i wake up i feel this gaping hole in my chest, and by the time i go to bed at night it’s so bad i can barely breathe from it. had to get therapy for it still working on this. end of last year my wife started asking me things that made it clear that at certain times, she didn't know who i am. ""where do you live? but every day is a little worse: more uncertainty, more people and places gone. (it is right next to the bed). so coping is really, so far, just a matter of keeping perspective. i fear that one day, probably very soon, reality will hit. i think coping is a matter of letting go of how you want it to be and instead, knowing  what to expect.

"nan it’s important to not remind her of the dog’s death if she asks where the dog is. when this happened to my dad, we always made up some excuse like the dog was at the vet or getting groomed. after a while, he forgot about the dog. sometimes it is best to fib for her comfort. you can say she went to the groomers. the excuse doesn’t even need to be a good one since she won’t remember it anyway. say the dog is out for a walk, or the vet, or at the dog park. my first suggestion is: give it time because sad to say, she may forget about her dog or forget how important it was to her. when my mom’s beloved cat passed away she kept forgetting too and would get sad every time. now she barely remembers the cat at all. she has pictures of him and sometimes she says what a great cat he was, but most of the time i don’t think she is clear on how much she loved it so it doesn’t bother her anymore. also, i have a cat now and she focuses on him now. so my 2nd suggestion would be to get her a new dog to help her focus on that, but only if there is someone living with her that can make sure the dog gets fed and walked in case she forgets to. when my mom would ask where he was, i'd choke up and she'd see my reaction and question me even more.",1,This is a 
"my dad received his diagnosis during covid. he had a virtual 2-session “interview” with a neuro-psychologist from the neurologist’s office. granted, the mri/ct did show some atrophy as well, but the actual diagnosis came after this virtual meeting. my dad is 70, isn’t the most social person, and isn’t used to virtual appointments. the whole thing didn’t go well. nonetheless, we toughed through. her findings were that he presents with alzheimer’s and general anxiety. just curious how else someone gets formally diagnosed. i'm a psychologist who diagnoses people with dementia. the gp refers them to us. we test their cognitive abilities (2h assignment) and talk to the family+client (1h). the testscores then get compared to people in their age and education bracket. the dementia diagnosis is usually quite clear from that. this may sound like it's too vague, but you can look up the mmse to get a sense of these types of tests. keep in mind that a score below 25 means something is definitely wrong, as the test is so easy that regular, healthy people should make it flawlessly. being unable to do simple math, remember 3 words, or know what season we're in says a lot about their minds already. this gets combined with the information from the family: can't remember appointments, unlearned how to work the tv, needs help with finances these days, confabulating stories, etc. all of these are outside the norms for normal ageing. i'm not sure i made a comprehensive or coherent response, feel free to ask for clarification. my dad was diagnosed with probable alzheimers, i believe in 2019, after an in person visit with a neurologist who specializes in cognitive decline. i know it involved an mri and i'm pretty sure it involved blood work. imo atrophy on an mri/ct is how the neurologist made the diagnosis. the facetime meetings were just to confirm he had the symptoms. i am not an expert, i just have my wife’s situation to base my opinion on. i started trying to get my wife diagnosed when she was 55. the neurologist said it was not likely she had dementia based on her age. in addition to the ungodly number of tests and appointments with specialists, she had three or four mri/ct scans. i have been told it is very difficult to detect early stage dementia with an mri/ct scan. finally the results from a radiated glucose pet/ct scan was interpreted for lewy bodies. a couple years later based upon her behavior the neurologist changed her diagnosis to ftd. my mother was diagnosed last year (the 1-year mark should pass any day now), about a month before i turned 19. i think they used spinal fluid. i’d had my suspicions of it since i was around 15-16, but getting the diagnosis and having my fears confirmed was like having a brick thrown at me. ♡ my mom was diagnosed after about 2 years of no pricing some mild symptoms (being forgetful, having trouble keeping up with conversations). it was june of 2020 when she got her initial mci diagnosis. we get her reevaluated this year and got mild alzheimer’s diagnosis which is what we were expecting. she currently cannot complete instrumental tasks without assistance (cooking, cleaning, filling pills, some driving) if progressed enough, alzheimer's can be fairly easy to diagnose and would not require more than an initial meeting. that said, i don't put much stock into telehealth/virtual neuropsych evaluations when it comes very early stage symptoms; especially in those of an age that are completely unfamiliar with the concept of virtual doctor visits and videocalls. late last spring my father had a uti. while they were treating the uti he just shut down. was stiff as a board for about a month in the hospital until they brought out other neurologists. in the process of trying to figure out what was going on (turns out parkinson's), they discovered that he does have alzheimers. prior his doctor just kept saying ""he's getting old that's all"".",1,This is a

"nan early onset alzheimer’s runs in my family…i’m 35 and have been taking unisom for the past 2 years…i’ve noticed not being able to remember if i fed my dog or not lately as well as cannot recall certain words (more than feels “normal.”) doing research and unisom is an anticholinergic which is linked to dementia risk…i want to go talk to a neurologist. has anyone gotten tested for the genes that cause early onset alzheimer’s? trying to do all the research i can and of course very worried if i myself will get this terrible disease. wtf. i'm pregnant and the one thing they recommend to sleep at night is unisom. why are people pushing these drugs if they have dementia risks? i was taking kirkland sleep aid (doxylamine succinate, same ingredient as unisom i think) which is considered to increase dementia risk. i stopped taking it and now i sleep like shit again, which is also linked to alzheimer's risk. and yes, i have a copy of the late-onset gene. not sure what to do over here. i exercise like mad to try to make myself sleep, including cardio and weights, but i wake at 2 am every fucking morning. look into the dian network they have great resources. it’s for dominantly inherited alzheimer’s and they have great resources for family members that are concerned they might have inherited it as well as studies and genetic counseling and forums on it. might not be helpful for your specific case but it was for me and my brother as early onset alzheimer’s has been in my family for a few generations. i think you should definitely talk to a neurologist. honestly, low chance but, might have a legal case against unisom if you suffered real harm from their product. medications like unisom( anticholinergic antihistamines) do worsen cognition in the elderly/dementia patients but it is unlikely that it actually contributes to or causes the disease itself. the data suggesting there is a causal link also included anti-depressants, anti-parkinsons drugs, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, and so on and ranged from 55-year-olds to 100-year-olds. the 50+% dementia risk claimed is really talking about those other very powerful drugs and their anticholinergic properties are minimal, tbh. the other aspects of those drugs are likely what is damaging. the 12% difference in these numbers seems in line with the average % of dementia onsets within the age group studied and may just be circumstantial with the aging population. the study showed that antipsychotics have a 70% increased risk of dementia (interestingly 109% increase at lower dose) but this is misleading because the anticholinergic properties of anti-psychotics are minimal and likely unrelated. edit:   here is the study if you would like to check it out. table 5 is most useful. ""a total standardized daily dose (tsdd) was calculated for each patient with a validated assessment based on strength, daily dose, and length of use for each of 56 drugs with anticholinergic properties."" i just went through cognitive testing at my neurologist’s recommendation and they discovered i have eoa. i have other issues that led to the testing but the word searching/aphasia has been going on for over a year or so. the testing is long, a full day’s worth, it’s exhausting, but it was worth it to know where i stood. good luck!",1,This is a 
"any ideas appreciated! this month i (clinical researcher and prior mri training) have been helping my friend desperately look for help for his clearly demented (74 year old) mother (he has no other family). it began over the summer when she had a dizzy episode, syncope, and bad lasting headache (undiagnosed tia?). since then, she’s been declining rapidly and now constantly perseverates and forgets after 5 min. pcp told her to follow up in a year! i told my friend to request scans/neuro tests, and then i read through all the reports: mri shows significant atrophy, no tau, spinal tap shows cognitive recovery in following few hours and then return to dementia, neuropsych scores are severe in learning/memory/visual, and neurology eval says “alzheimer’s”. but she was ultimately diagnosed as “mild neurological disorder” and won’t get meds until she becomes severe. my friend said he was told there’s nothing else they can do (which is disgusting of our health care system), so i’ve been compiling lists of top neurologists and clinical trials. what else can be done for her that i’m missing?? thank you!! i’m in uk so it’s probably different but even now my dad is diagnosed with alzheimer’s rather than mci which is all they’d say initially, it hasn’t unlocked anything. the only thing he is prescribed is anti depressants. afaik there are meds which may slow decline but certainly won’t reverse it, and it’s unfortunately a disease with an inevitable decline. i’d suggest as an initial port of call too to start looking in to practical things like power of attorney, sorting financial affairs, looking at what support there will be for carers in home and out of home when the time comes the current approach to alzheimer’s (imo) is shameful. bureaucracy will close the door to alternative approaches and then make you feel stupid for asking. whoa, i thought alzheimer's drugs including memantine and donepezil are most effective in early stages! behavioral interventions are probably more important: adequate nutrition, social contact, fall prevention, things like that. if she's living at home, she's probably endangered. you don't mention where you are or what kind of funding. that is helpful in giving advice. if they are in the us and paying health insurance may as well use that mofo to the fullest.",1,This is a 
"need help please. my daughter is visiting for a long period with her dog. my mother keeps saying it’s ‘her’ dog and gets mad when my daughter takes her dog for a walk or feeds her. mom keeping getting upset and telling everyone to leave ‘her’ dog along. thanks so much. have you considered getting your mother a stuffed animal dog? maybe one that’s the same color as your daughters dog, if you can. that’s what worked with my mom, we got her the joy for all robotic cat that purrs and meows and everything and she’s as happy as a clam. is it possible to have something to distract her when your daughter goes out for walks and move the dogs food bowls somewhere that mom doesn't go often? this disease is frustrating because so often there are no solutions outside of redirection or changing our own behavior we're starting to have this issue with my sister's cat. we live at home with our dad to take care of our mom and lately mom has been claiming the cat is hers and gets authoritative over it whenever we take actual care of it. mom misreads its body language frequently so it's difficult to address her behavior and the cat's at the same time. she has her own stuffed dog and absolutely loves it but chooses the live cat whenever both are in the same room. i usually end up hovering nearby to supervise that their interactions are safe for both but that tends to agitate mom and gets more protective of the cat. how is your mom's balance? if she's able to walk much and the dog's properly leashed trained, maybe see if going out on walks together with your daughter might help? if that's not an option, perhaps keeping the dog and mom separate and out of eye sight during feeding and walking time might work. or ask your daughter to have someone else watch the dog. try not to tell your mom that it's not her dog as that will only make her more defensive. if she starts to get super possessive, maybe the dog should be kept somewhere else close while your daughter visits and can take care of her pet without your mom being upset. i know some patients do well with baby dolls too.",1,This is a 
"so, it’s a bit of a mess of a story, but my paternal grandfather was recently admitted to a facility because of dementia, and his kidneys have begun to fail so he doesn’t have much time left. i am currently 22, and i haven’t seen or heard from him since around 2010 due to my dad making the decision to cut contact with him due to other mental health problems of his to keep both of us safe. i have mental health problems myself, and they of course have gotten a lot worse since these developments. i feel selfish because i know how much being visited means to him right now, but all i do is freeze and lose the ability to speak when in the room with him, and then begin drinking heavily for the rest of the day after that. i’m hoping anyone out there has any suggestions or insight on the best course of action. should i try harder to suck it up and be there for him, both so he’s less alone, and so that i won’t feel like i didn’t do enough after he’s gone? or maybe i should stay away since it’s so high stress on my end and for the people around me worrying about my addiction problems coming back, and i’ll just have the pleasant memories of all the things we used to do together when i was really little. i don’t know him very well anymore but from how i used to know him, i believe he would want me to only remember him as he was when i was little. thank you for reading, i know how awful dementia is, and i’ve handled it before, but its completely different when it’s family. i’m very worried about your stress levels. it’s not worth it if your sobriety is at risk. could you honor your grandfather in some other way, that would not risk your sobriety? if there is a funeral, they will need memory boards. get black tri-fold poster boards at a craft store, and put pictures of your grandfather in better days on it? you could read to him, or bring some lotion and put rub some into his hands and onto his feet. that is very soothing. you could hum a song while doing it. this would be as much for him as it is for you. if you can picture doing these things for him, without your stress levels going up, then maybe you can do it. if picturing this makes you anxious, i feel that it is not safe for you to do it. your grandfather would not want you to risk your sobriety for this. good luck, and please keep us posted. could you try going with your dad? might help take some of the pressure off. also, maybe try not having high expectations when you go. just sitting there with him is more than enough. turn the tv on, read a book. maybe build up to the small talk once you’ve sat there for a little while. you also don’t have to stay long. whatever you can endure is fine. if you are coping after a visit with him by drinking heavily for the rest of the day, you are damaging yourself. you have a responsibility to yourself and the people around you to keep yourself physically and mentally healthy. if your grandfather can still read or has someone who can read to him, you might consider sending a note or card instead of some visits. you want to let him know that he is loved, and you can do it this way. it’s probably better - for him and for you - than physically being present but not being mentally or emotionally present when visiting him. as someone who lives with liver disease, i want you prioritize your own health during this difficult time. i understand it’s hard; my step mother is dealing with dementia herself. the problem is that, there are no warning signs. you won’t feel any symptoms until it’s already too late. the liver is a miraculous organ that helps to regulate hundreds of functions in the body. many don’t realize that the damaged liver itself isn’t always the problem, but instead causes all kinds of other health issues in the body as a result of being diseased. if the disease progresses far enough to cause scarring (cirrhosis), there’s no undoing the damage. it will shorten your life, and you’ll spend that time with significant health issues. so please take care of yourself during this difficult time. if you absolutely have to see your grandfather and risk your sobriety over it, consider having a buddy that doesn't drink and who you trust to stay with you before, during, and for some time after your visit. you could maybe also ask the people who tend to him if there's anything he'd like/need that you could send them? not sure how applicable that would be, but it might be worth it if you could help him and not risk your well-being simultaneously.",1,This is a

""just a bit longer when you get more strength back"" sounds like a fine answer in the meantime. when it comes time for him to move, some people frame the move to memory care as ""your doctor wants you to be in a special rehab until you improve more,"" but that's a case by case thing. we told my dad the house needed construction work and it was dangerous so he had to stay at the home. we never used the words memory care or nursing home and acted like it was a hotel or apartment. he's been there about a month and has stopped asking to go home. quick decline sometimes means uti. some doctors can remember stuff but aren't critical thinkers. did they check? morally, i think keeping the present pleasant and positive is the way to go. i'm caring for my father who has alzheimer's and as much as my brain has conflict with white lies my priority is his immediate comfort. his ability to grasp concepts are declining so keeping things simple is important. best of luck to you, it's a journey that's for sure. don't know what your folks money situation is like, cause every option is costly. is there any possibility of getting your mom some assistance and keeping him at home. wish there were good options, but there really are not. my mom has been in memory care for years and while it is necessary, it's horrible. if you dad is still somewhat functional he will probably be very unhappy. good luck, and prayers for you and your family. no chance of any younger relatives to move in with them? alzheimer's disease does not advance remotely that quickly. has he had a proper work up from a neurologist? i would assume they checked for uti? uti's are notorious for causing complete delirium in elderly patients and can mimic a fast progressing dementia, however most of the time the patient returns to baseline after some time has passed and it has been fully treated. other possibilities would include nmda encephalitis and other autoimmune encephalitis diseases which can progress rapidly. the most common finding though is that the patient has been declining for years but it just went unnoticed because people are so used to covering for them until they're unable to do more simple things. if he hasn't had a proper neurological workup that's what i would recommend. as far as the nursing home, i can't imagine it will go well if he just shows up at a nursing home and no one told him he was going there. it really depends on how well he would probably tolerate that news. but i have seen families just bring their loved one to a nursing home that they never knew they were going to and he became so combative that he was kicked out of the nursing home fairly quickly. i also recommend a very deep research into the nursing homes available as most of them have pretty shady reputations. by any chance did he experience a stroke? my grandmother on my dad’s side (both my grandmothers had alzheimer’s) had a stroke which led to her rapid decline. i would tell him what is going on and get his doctor’s recommendation as to what the next steps should be. if you can and if you have the support for it, i would suggest bringing him home to be cared by family. we did that with my maternal grandmother for 7 years.",1,This is a 
"has anyone dealt with moderate to severe incontinence in a parent with alzheimer's? we've taken my dad to the urologist and he's on 3 different medications to tackle the incontinence from every direction but it doesn't seem to be working as well as we hoped. at this point, the incontinence issue is probably worse than the alz, since he is in fairly early stages of it. any advice would be greatly appreciated! routine helps a lot. after a meal, have him go to the bathroom. every two or three hours, have him go to the bathroom as well. my dad has a lot of accidents at night, so his caregivers get him up after three or four hours of sleep as well. my dad will grumble and be mad about it, but it helps to prevent accidents. we got depends for my mom. she does remember to go to the toilet sometimes - but sometimes it just comes out. and the depends are a lot easier than cleaning up the mess, especially because she doesn't always realize she's made one. she's also tried to wash them in the sink and in the washing machine (they get really big!) and sometimes she will put regular underwear underneath them. but it's still better than no diaper at all. one thing that seems to help my mid-stage partner: reminders. sometimes the sound of my using the bathroom is also a prompt. it sounds ridiculous, but just askng ""do you have to use the toilet"" may be able to break into the zone-out and get action started. of course, then it's on you not to be absent-minded. i increased the nightlight level in the bathrooms. that helped my partner's ability to use the bathroom at night. my advice is to talk about this straightforwardly and buy him some disposable briefs. unfortunately it'll slowly get worse, at some point it'll need diapers for both #1 and #2. constant reminders and a schedule help so you catch it before it happens. at some point they'll start missing the toilet even if they try to go, soil their clothes and not notice and walk around your house sitting on everything my mother in law developed double incontinence at the mid-ad stage - the part of her brain that tells her she needs to go to the toilet has been affected (common in ad). we tried taking her to the toilet more often but she was v reluctant and resistant. it got to the point where we had to get adult pull-ups. in the uk you can get them for free if your gp refers you to the continence clinic. i don't know where in the world you are, but perhaps there's a similar scheme you could utilise? as an aside, elderly people are more prone to utis, and they have a huge effect on dementia patients (my mil would become more aggressive/violent, paranoid, even forgot how to walk) - it's worth testing weekly (i bought the uti strips from amazon). wishing you the best of luck on this journey. yep. my mom would go in her pants while she was walking around. she’s had a couple of minor tias since then and seizures that robbed her of her speech and mobility. got the call today that she had another stroke and prob won’t last much longer. disease sucks father has the same issue, but his incontinence is due to the meds he's on. i live in a different country to my parents, so the only solution we've found is diapers ... dad is on the more affected end of the alzheimer’s spectrum and has a prostate issue. continence garments are a must at this point. routine is key until it doesn’t make an impact. if he is taking any anticholinergic medications for his incontinence it would exacerbate his dementia. typical ones are oxybutynin, detral, and toviaz  myrbetriq is the only incontinence medication recommended for dementia patients since it is not anticholinergic. a condom catheter is another option and of course depends. incontinence is usually pretty tough to treat in dementia. also be on the look out for doctors trying to label him with normal pressure hydrocephalus with his incontinence  it is commonly misdiagnosed in the alzheimer's population. routine can help. diapers too, but call it briefs so they feel less demoralized. a foley may be another option but that increase the risks of an uti. mum is incontinent and it started off slowly. she had some sort of episode the day before she went into hospital (never found out what - we thought it was a stroke, but wasn't) and from that day onwards she was urine incontinent 24/7. adult diapers are now the norm for my mum. it is very distressing for her as she is still aware enough to realise, but not understanding enough to know that it can't be fixed. very sad. forty years of dealing with alzheimer's, yes. i see my comment has been down voted. but, the fact is that out of control infections are the result negligence on the part of so-called ""caregivers."" i understand that it is hard to continually take your parent to the the hospital, but there is no answer on reddit that solves that. chronic infection is a sign of negligence. incontinence is usually due to infection in alzheimer's patients.",1,This is a

"my dad has dementia and is going to need full-time help soon enough. (driving, shopping, etc.) my mother is a half-functioning alcoholic (half the time sober and amazing, half the time binge drinking/in bed.) i wouldn't say they are in denial but they are 100% wanting to kick the decision down the road and don't seem motivated to face it. how would you deal with this situation? i live several hours away. plan a visit with them. prepare for a very difficult but necessary conversation about both of their end-of-life care. tell your mom in advance you plan to discuss this during your visit and ask if she can dig up a copy of her will if she has one, and if she would be willing to “get some things squared away” with you “just in case”. or if you dont think she’d take it well, dont mention it but it may make it easier if she is prepared as well for the discussion. ask her when she would like help caring for your father. at what point will she not want to be his only caretaker? discuss finances available for that care. maybe there is a neighbor or a friend that can stop in for a couple hours a day to watch your dad and do a couple of chores for her, and care could ramp up from there as he progresses. discuss medical proxy, and possibly be prepared to draw up forms to make you the primary person to make decisions on your mother’s behalf in an emergency, rather than your father. discuss what your mother would like the later years of her life to look like. this may also soften her up to the idea of caregivers if she is against them...thinking about her future as a full time caregiver 5+ years down the road. while you’re there, check their house for hazards. people with alzheimers do better in bright light, especially in the winter when the sun sets so early; ensure they have a lot of good light in their house. it also helps prevent falls and injuries since depth perception can go with alzheimers as well. discourage the use of thick area rugs that have edges that can be tripped over, as well as any other trip hazards. offer to install a bar or a chair in their shower if they need that. just do some general things so you know theyre a *little* bit safer on their own. i’m sorry you’re going through this, and it might be hard to have those conversations with your mom but its the only way you can sleep soundly knowing you tried your best to get them to be safe short of uprooting your whole life and moving in with them. i'm in a very similar situation.... my step mother's drinking causes me massive anxiety as well knowing that she's my father's caretaker. i wish i had helpful advice. unfortunately i'm looking for some advice as well as this situation is a train wreck coming. i feel your pain. that’s a double whammy. i don’t know how to approach the drinking because people get super defensive when approached about that. but maybe if you get your mom into some support groups (even informal support groups) for people living with family with dementia she may start accepting his diagnosis and decline and perhaps get motivated to get herself together so she can be a better support for her hubby. the alzheimer’s association is a good resource for formal support groups. for something more informal you could try an online program- this is an nia funded movement program that includes some group interactions",1,This is a 
"i've never met anyone with alzheimer's before, but am visiting my aunt who was diagnosed in 2014 next week. i haven't seen her since 2011. although i will be with her daughter, whom she lives with, i am still nervous-- i know she won't know who i am, but what questions do i ask? how do i introduce myself? thanks in advance for the answers. this may sound crazy, but let her lead the discussion. don't ask questions, and i probably wouldn't even introduce myself -- just be friendly and warm. but let her lead the discussion and just be warm and friendly. follow-up thought: be prepared for her to say things that are uncomfortable, perhaps even to the point of being mean or rude. they both also get/got agitated very easily. also depends on the level but my dad likes to just make really random jokey chat. it’s his way to cover that he doesn’t really know what’s going on. so avoid referential conversations that need them to remember something you said a moment ago, like talking about your job, asking what she did yesterday etc. my advice is to just act like you normally would. they will probably ask you some of the same questions repeatedly, but each time just act like it's the first time they have asked. it's just really sad, my mom is in a memory care facility and all in all, it really sucks. looking after and care for family is necessary, even if it breaks your heart, everytime. you'll have to play it by ear, because you don't know at what stage in her illness she is. people with alzheimer's tend to be different person to person and even day to day. if you have time, a good youtube playlist is teepa snow's [making visits count. ]( (it's like an hour talk in total, it's just broken up into smaller chunks.) he's not great with questions, so we just take turns remarking on things that he takes pleasure in, like the view or the cats or his beloved wife. the conversation doesn't go deep, and we cover the same ground frequently, but that's fine--the point is the togetherness, not some intellectually probing discourse. if you can get tips from the family on things she currently enjoys or appreciates, that's a great place to go, and if not, just note what seems to draw her attention and go on with that. the best thing you can do for the both of you, is to play along. her time is more limited than yours is. just go with the flow. like someone previously said, if they start talking about something that isn’t true just go along with it. my dad and others at his facility really enjoy listening to music so sometimes when he gets frustrated i distract him with music on my phone. i’ve noticed many people at his facility enjoy the little things. i was amazed to see that although my dad doesn’t communicate much, he loves hitting a balloon back and forth. there’s no one way to approach someone with alzheimer’s, i wish there was.",1,This is a 
"i found out that to ""manage"" someone's social security benefits/payments, a power of attorney is not enough - you need to be the individual's representative payee. but i don't know what the ssa means by ""managing"" benefits. does anyone have any experience in needing to ""manage"" the benefits, so that becoming a rep payee makes sense? i don't understand the need, and why a poa wouldn't be enough for most cases? tia! i need to establish rep payee to sign my dad up for medicare in the next month (his diagnosis was poorly timed there). also pisses me off that poa isn't good enough for some financial institutions. i had to get notarized letters of incapacitation and shit to gain access to his assets to pay for care. this took over a month in some cases! just over this crap. for those who have poa, don't assume it won't be a circus to actually be able to use it. i'm rep payee for my parent. it's super annoying, and as you say poa isn't enough. neither is guardianship. you have to specifically go through a process with the social security administration that in my case resulted in the need for a recent statement from a doctor that my parent is incapacitated because the guardianship documentation was not recent enough. you also have to answer questions demonstrating that you're the best person to do it and you have to provide documentation. you also have to sign stuff that says you'll follow all their rules about how you can use the funds on the person's behalf (the managing part). you probably need a new bank account for the person to accept the funds, which you are required to set up direct deposit for, and you have to do a yearly accounting for what you did with the funds. we just added my wife and i to my mom's bank account. so between our poa and being on her account with our own cards, we've been able to handle everything. we are going through this now. my grandmother was the rep payee for my uncle for years. she just had his ssdi sent to his checking account, never filed reports or anything. now ssa just sent a letter saying that since she died, they won't send him money until a new one is identified. yes i have been rep.payee 15 yrs no issues",1,This is a 
"my dad has become increasingly forgetful. he frequently forgets how to get home, or he forgets a conversation that we just had 15 minutes ago. once i remind him, then he remembers. for example, he needs surgery on his carotid artery. i'm arranging it for him. i hung up, called and spoke to his doctor to set a pre surgery appointment. i called my dad back, literally 10 minutes or less later. i said ok dad we have to meet with the surgeon before they will schedule your surgery. your carotid is 80% blocked. stuff like this happens a lot. how do you tell the difference between normal aging, vascular dementia and alzheimers? you leave that to the professionals. get an appointment with a neurologist who specializes in dementia, or go for geriatric assessment at a department of geriatrics. you father's primary care doctor can refer him. it's a good idea to communicate either by mail/email or telephone ahead of time with some of your observations, to clue the doc in that a real assessment is needed. also it's best if you accompany your dad (or someone does), or he's likely to hear what he wants to hear and report back to you, ""doc says to just enjoy myself."" (that's not what doc said!!) alzheimers is a form of dementia. the only way to diagnose alzheimers is post death via autopsy. vascular dementia and alzheimers typically go hand in hand. my mom was dxed with both. my dad got in a pretty serious accident, lucky no one was hurt but two cars were totalled. he was just going to the grocery store about 1/2 mile from his house, his accident was about 3 miles from the store, he forgot where it was. basically alzheimers is the advanced progression of physical impairment of the brain via shrinking and other damage. the current state of the art for diagnosing alz is an amyvid pet scan, which looks for amyloid plaque. it was quite the task getting insurance to pay for it though. my dad was diagnosed w early stage alzheimer’s via a blood test and spinal tap. there are specific markers the dr looks for in those tests. he had several other cognitive & motor tests along the way as well.",1,This is a 
"firstly i want to apologise in case i use any terms or anything incorrectly, i don’t know a lot about alzheimer’s so i’m going with what i’ve read. i (18) have noticed my dad’s changing behaviour since around 2020. at the start of the pandemic specifically he became irritable and argumentative, we assumed it was just him being bored and angry about covid so he was taking it out by saying outrageous things and fighting with me and my siblings about them. in fairness, a lot of his behaviours sound like symptoms of dementia although he has never really gotten “worse”, is always just the same eg he gets very stressed about things like making dinner, giving lifts or going on trips. recently he forgets things like what i’m doing, eg a couple days ago i had to travel to a different city and told him i needed a lift to the bus, and on the day of he forgot and i had to jog his memory quite a bit before he remembered. basically, i can’t tell if this is just him getting old or if it’s signs of early-onset alzheimer’s. or if the term “getting old” actually stems from a misunderstanding of what alzheimer’s is? the thought of it affecting my dad petrifies me and it weighs on my mind a lot. i’m scared to “lose” my dad since i am so close to him and my siblings and i are still pretty young. i don’t want to bring it up with my younger siblings or my mother who works 40+ hrs and is also pretty much full time studying, as i don’t want to scare any of them especially if i’m just overthinking. thank you for taking your time to read :) some of these things could be indicative of dementia, but honestly, what you are describing does not sound like dementia to me. only a doctor can say. forgetting to pay bills, paying them twice because she forgot she paid them already, ordering things she already had, then not knowing where her money would go. issues with short term memory. forgetting what day/year it was, what state she was in, whether she had eaten or not, forgetting recent conversations or events. asking the same questions or telling the same story over and over. hygiene issues. things like not bathing or brushing her teeth for days. when we would bring it up she would insist she had just taken a shower or brushed her teeth. forgetting what to do or how to operate during normal daily activities like using a computer, her phone, using the tv remote, the microwave, etc. she hid it well at first, but over time it became more and more obvious she was struggling. again, i am no doctor, but what you are describing sounds more like age-related forgetfulness, but it's hard to say without getting him to the doctor to be checked. alzheimer’s is really difficult to diagnose just by symptoms so there’s no real way for you specifically know he has it, there’s so many things that have to be ruled out before a neurologist considers it alzheimer’s (coming from someone whose dad was diagnosed with it at 61/62). the symptoms he’s showing could be caused from other things that maybe should be looked at by a primary care doctor first (i’m not sure exactly what but there’s plenty of possibilities)   if he shows more serious signs of forgetfulness you can and should encourage him to go to his primary care doctor and/or neurologist. he will probably fight against going or roll his eyes but if he is experiencing dementia there is help out there to slow things down so getting to the root of it sooner rather than later is a great move. i wouldn’t jump to conclusions but i very much empathize with your situation, hope all is okay with your dad ♥️ i am not an expert but if you are noticing those things at his fairly young age, it is worth looking in to. try talking with your mom about it; this is a lot for you to carry alone. your mom could be noticing things but she’s afraid to worry you about it. ideally you or mom could talk to dad about it. if he is willing to talk w his dr about seeing a neurologist that would be best to sort things out and get treatment if needed. you are an intuitive person and your dad is lucky to have someone like you in his corner.",0,This is a

"i ended up having a talk the week before last with my mom’s (64 f) daycare about her general decline, they agree she has declined, and said they didn’t think it would be any trouble for her to be evaluated and qualify. we had the hospice referral appointment with her pcp last tuesday, and it hit me harder than i was anticipating. so much so, i ended up calling out sick for work the next day, and took a me day while mom was at daycare. the first hospice agency referred to us by the pcp was not a first choice of the woman who runs the support group that i’m in, and i trust her opinion. my mom really qualified without any second thought. they’ll provide a shower chair, a wheelchair and a hospital bed as soon as i have room for them to. i got her a rollator last week that has been helping at daycare. other supplies will be provided as well. of course i just did a pretty recent big restock of diapers and wipes…  i’m a little nervous that i’m not actually going to get the extra help and relief i need. a nurse will come out twice a week, and an aid can come out 5, but only for an hour to get her ready for the day. she can still go to daycare and be on hospice as long as she does not become completely hard to care for in their facility. she will be assigned a social worker who may be able to help me figure out more in home health services or short term respite care. i know i need to see how this even plays out to start. they can arrange a 5-7 day skilled nursing facility stay for respite otherwise. my mom doesn’t understand much anymore. what do i tell her about this? do i keep it simple and just say they’re new friends coming to help, or do i tell her that she’s on hospice? i have a feeling it’s the former, but want to get some input. is this a sign she knows it could be happening, or is it just the insecurities of the disease? i mean, she’ll say it at the most random times sometimes. i could be putting her socks on or getting her out of bed, and she’d say it. i probably need to have a physical scheduled as soon as possible. hey there. i am in a very similar situation, my mom (67) was diagnosed with alzheimer's 7 years ago. she has been on hospice for the last 3 months and they have been wonderful. accept the extra help, yeah you can shower your mom but it's great to be able to hand off some care. caregiver fatigue is a real issue, please make sure you're taking care of yourself. i am deep in this too, message me if you want to chat. it's great for you both that you'll be receiving additional hours & help, well done! i'm in australia so our system is different, idk. probably a 5-day break would be really good for you, give some time to catch up with yourself. best of luck with everything! just put your mom in hospice. tough go. u did wonderfully!!! my dad passed from dementia. mom elected to keep him at home, for familiarity. before mom passed, she & my brother arranged for 24/7 care. i kept praying for our lord to take him home. on day he was brought to hospital, he even complimented an employee of his tie. i applaud your efforts getting your mom into hospice. best of luck.",0,This is a

"my grandmother was diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago, but we knew long before she finally agreed to see the neurologist. since the diagnosis it just feels like everything has now progressed so rapidly. just last week things were bad, but after going away for the weekend i returned to the news from my mother that she had gotten substantially worse in the few days i had been gone. a couple days ago my grandmother was barely capable of holding a conversation, but now she isn’t even able to string together a couple of words coherently. the scariest part is i’m sitting in the er right now, and i can swear i hear the death rattle. she has also been mumbling what sounds like my grandfather’s name. so far we have ruled out a stroke, and they don’t seem to think she has any sort of infection. i just can’t wrap my head around how quickly this is all happening. i just sort of needed an outlet for my feelings with some people that understand. alzheimer's is a fucking awful disease. my first thought was a uti. my mother has alzheimer's and she would get very, very bad when she had an uti. she made sandwiches for my dad who died in 2011. she couldn't read a clock, understand the time, or why it was dark outside. i sincerely hope your grandmother is just going through a bad spell. so sorry for you! my mother is also rapidly getting worse in the last few weeks. stay strong for both of you. every timing is different, my mom has been calling for her mom for a few years now and she died 45 years ago. my mom has been bedridden and immobile for almost 17 months now and her limbs have been ""frozen"" for well over 6 months now. it really does seem like she is near the end now but we said that throughout all of 2021. she is 87 and has been at stage 7 for well over 5 years and with obvious moderate stage dementia for over 15 years. my mom definitely has the prolonged version of the disease and it's been terrible for several years now. memories usually go back to where they remember people from their past, that’s maybe why she’s saying your grandfather’s name. definitely check out the uti connection tho!",0,This is a

nan i hate to be skeptical but.... this person was reportedly diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's in 2014 and this book was published in 2022.  early onset alzheimer's is a more rapid disease. truthfully the vast majority of people diagnosed in 2014 with early onset alzheimer's would likely be deceased by now or completely debilitated. even her first book in 2018 (4 years after diagnosis) is far too along in an early onset alzheimer's disease course to be able to write a book even with assistance.,0,This is a 
"i’m 21 and my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer’s when i was 17/18. i lived with only him from ages 14-18 and feel i missed out on many of those years and potential experiences due to worrying about/caring for my father. i had decided not to go away to college because he would say things like “you’re the only reason i’m here” all the time and ask if i was going to stay with him. i’m having a really hard time knowing what to do right now because i want to go back to a new school across the country next spring. i feel like i’ve made so many decisions based on everyone else’s happiness instead of my own, it feels like it’s been such a battle to survive most of my life, and i’ve finally been figuring things out for myself and feeling better. some things are going on right now with his potential guardianship which has been extremely difficult and is taking me back to those years when i was 14-18, feeling so stuck and helpless. it makes me feel terrible because obviously i want to do everything i can for my father, but i need to think about me. i want to have him in my life and have a good relationship, i want to be able to know what’s going on with him and help to make decisions. i guess i’m wondering people’s thoughts on that, whether you’re my age or someone older. am i being a bad person for wanting to go to school somewhere else? also if anyone has advice about experiencing a parent having alzheimer’s at a young age, or any life advice for someone in their 20s, i would greatly appreciate it. i think if my dad wasn’t sick he would be proud of me and excited for me. he always wanted to make sure i had the ability to do what i wanted with school and careers and express my talents. thinking about that makes me smile but it hurts. - my parents are divorced, my mother greatly cares for my father and they have lunch once a week imo, go. alzheimer's is already stealing what is left of his life. that being said, i'm a 45 year old man, missing out on many things, including things with my own child, to continue caring for my mom who is on hospice and could remain so for god knows how long. it sounds like you have already put your father before yourself. i think you should focus on yourself for a bit. ended up not going to go stay with my mom and try to care for her (no official diagnosis at this point but she was not able to hold a job and had very clear signs. we knew it was alzheimer’s)  you should go to school. my dad has it too. my mom thinks that he's had it for a while, but his symptoms started getting worse when i was 14ish. i'm in my 20s now and i'm in a similar situation to you. do what's best for you. i am glad i lived my life and if i had stayed 24-7 to care for my parent, i would be bitter considering it's a likely possibility for me. i echo every one else here - go and live your life to the fullest you can. i'm hopeful it will be what your father would wish for you. i'm 39 and cared for my dad for about 10 years - we tried to keep him at home for as long as we could but it came to the point that it was no longer safe or dignified for him to remain there. the respite provided to me since he has been in a care home has been significant - i feel like i can live my life again and do things i've been unable to for the past 10 or so years - and it feels good. you deserve to live your life now! you only get one life, you don't owe it to anyone but yourself. please let your parents make their own decisions for their own lives. alzheimer’s destroys everything. but alzheimer’s destroys everything and that will still be true even if you stay. good luck with your decision. live your life. sometimes the kinds of sacrifices that you would need to make can leave you feeling bitter and resentful for many years to come. i don't think your dad would want that for you. don’t do what i did and be afraid to live your life. that being said, you aren't just losing your father to this disease. and what ever you end up choosing, do right by yourself first. you can't 'do right by him' if you are burned out. your health, mental and physical, comes first. don't break your back.",0,This is a 
"would like to hear about everyone's experiences good or bad with small residential assisted living or adult foster care based in a private house. better or worst than long term facilities? do smaller homes have better staff to resident ratio? if you have worked in or own one i would love to hear from you. would love details about your facility and why it's better in your opinion. i have not used either of these, but there was a period where i was looking into them as an option (mom decided to keep dad at home in the end). im not sure but i *think* a major deciding factor would be more about what kind of care the facility is qualified to give, and what kind you need. like some facilities have staff that are allowed to administer medicine, and some may not have staff thats allowed to (patient has to give medicine to themselves). some facilities aren't allowed to keep someone from wandering out, and some have a special status where they can. you might want to see if your state and county have a dept on aging or elderly or dementia. they may have guides describing rules that may be specific for your state or maybe even a handy list of facilities identified by type of care. depending on the level of care, you could eliminate your options quickly.",0,This is a 
"my father (68) has alzheimers and up until recently was being cared for exclusively by my grandmother (87). over the past year, my father's condition has progressively gotten worse and he's started showing signs of anger, anxiety, and aggression. anti-anxiety meds helped some, but it still got to a point where it was no longer safe for either of them to be in that house together and we made the decision to move him into memory care. unfortunately, the transition to memory care did not go well. within 4 days of moving him in he had assaulted another resident, cornered and threatened a staff member, and refused to eat or take his medications, until the facility finally asked for him to be transferred to a hospital because they couldn't handle him. fast forward 6 weeks and in that time, he's been in 3 different hospitals and 2 different geriatric psychiatric facilities. he was transferred back to memory care after the first psychiatric stay when they thought they had figured out his medication, but after 4 days he had assaulted another resident, was tearing pictures off the wall and throwing them, and had defecated on the floor of another resident's room. he's currently on his second geriatric psychiatric stay as they once again try to tweak his meds but i' m not hopeful. we are one week into what is supposed to be a 1-2 week stay so he's going to be discharged soon. the memory care facility he was originally in won't take him back and so far we haven't found any others that will take him. i don't see how he could come home, even with in-home nursing help. i just can't see how it would be safe for anyone. i've checked into some nursing homes but supposedly they are going to cost between 10-15k per month and that's not something we can afford. i don't believe he will qualify for medicaid as he has a pension that would put him over the eligibility requirements. making all this worse is i live on the west coast and am having to manage all of this remotely. this last 2 months have been so draining and we seem to be out of options. what are we supposed to do? i'm posting in hopes that someone maybe has a solution or something i haven't thought of but it all seems so hopeless. with my mom, we had to private pay until she was bankrupt. in her case, the only med that worked to ease her rage (she broke her own and other people's bones in attacks) was injections of haldol. because they had to be injections, we had to have 24-hour skilled nursing, and the doctors reported that it was a must to keep her from being a danger to herself and others. once she was bankrupt, the way medicaid worked was they took her pension and ss and returned it was i think $70 per month for her to have personal spending money. if you haven't talked to someone in medicaid locally, it helps to at least have the conversation with them to see what happens next. i'm really sorry you're going through this, op. i was in the same hopeless boat back in october of last year. my dad has increasingly gotten aggressive. because of covid, no geriatric psych places would even consider taking him in. his doctor at memory care was having no luck tweaking his medications. his facility was kicking him out and we couldn't find a single place within the state that would consider taking a man with ""behaviors"". we began looking out of state. i also asked about hospice and they agreed to have him evaluated. hospice believed my dad was probably suffering from terminal agitation and we signed him on to hospice. they gave him dilaudid but it didn't slow him down one bit. one of my nurse friends (seeing how hopeless the situation was) recommended i ask hospice about contacting aps. they did and got some social workers involved to help us out in finding a new facility. in the meantime, we had to hire 24/7 caregivers to live with him in memory care. somehow we found a facility nearby that would give him a chance as they typically handle people with ""behaviors"". we moved my dad to the new place (having hospice on-board was nice because they provided  a hospital bed). i'm just sharing my experience. reaching out to aps can be scary but we got desperate. nobody would take my dad and i knew if he got discharged anywhere, that his current memory care would not allow him back in. i feel like i truly tried everything. sadly there just aren't many resources for when your loved one gets aggressive/violent. and no, you cannot take him back in to the home with your grandmother. i'm so so sorry. i was in your position only 5 months ago. i'll be thinking about you. what i did was enlisted my friends' help in asking them to make calls to facilities for me. having someone else make those calls and keep a shared spreadsheet was probably the most helpful. i hope you have friends you can call on. such a heartbreaking disease.. so sorry.. you should try posting this question on the forum at agingcare.com the people over there tend to give better advice about these kinds of situations and are more realistic. this is a long shot, but i was just getting a massage today and in the waiting room, i read something in a ""massage therapy"" magazine about alzheimer's and massage. as little as 5 or 10 minutes of gentle massage, head, shoulders, neck, back or hands, reduced agitation and aggression in alzheimer's patients. it can be done by a cna, it doesn't have to be a licensed massage therapist. see if you can get his carers in the hospital to try that every day for a week. i'd also want to know if it happens only in the latter half of the day (sundowning) or if he has a uti. music might be useful. i was able to take care of my spouse who got alzheimer's in 2012. when the violence started the doctor perscribed risperidone .25 mg 3x a day. it was an amazing transformation and helped me be able to do everything at home until passing in 2020.   i got hospice involved in the last year and a half or so, which set us up with a hoyer lift, hospital bed,  and nursing care 3x a week all covered thru insurance and medicare, when walking no longer was an option. when covid started i voluntered to do bedbaths and the nursing was reduced to 1x a week to avoid unneeded traffic and risk of covid. this was during the time when it was so horrible in the nursing homes, before vaccines. i am grateful for the extra time i had, grateful that i didn't need to rely on any of the kids who all had jobs and families, grateful that i didn't need to bankrupt us or move out of this house we have lived together in for 35 years, grateful we never got covid. i miss my spouse so very much. hope this helps and god bless. i'm sorry i don't have a good or cheap suggestion, as we went through it with my mil when she was fist admitted to a mental care facility. we were finally able to get he placed into a facility which was able to manage her, both through medication, and through having ""large"" skilled nurses and aides who could control her outbursts. once a lifetime of savings, the home, everything was gone, medicare stepped in and took over. facility received every dime, social security, navy (spouse retirement) pension, everything except a few hundred bucks a month we were able to use for upgrades in food, cable tv, and a room with a view of the plants/garden outside. what breaks my hear more than anything is i'm on the front edge of this journey with my wife, who was diagnosed with early onset, and is now 67.  i'm not emotionally ready to have to watch the love of my life disappear from me in slow motion while i remain helpless and heartbroken and incapable of making anything better for her. please speak with the hospital social worker (or have his poa do so). the reality is that dad is likely going to need further adjustments of his medications & an onslaught of behavioural approaches to try & find the balance whereby he's not a danger to himself or others. what i know to be true in my province is that a hospital cannot discharge someone who needs constant care if a sufficient solution is not available. is the hospital the right place for him, long term? probably not but until his situation stabilizes, and a home is found, then i would not be accepting responsibility for him to come home. it's an impossible position to be put in, & the system is so very broken & i'm so sorry that your family is having to wade through this walking nightmare. talk to the social worker & reach out to the local alzheimer's society/ society for the aged & ask them for advice as well. sending you such support over the interwebs. xo there’s an anti-psychotic medication that my fil takes that really helped his aggression. if you want to know the name, dm me, i would have to ask the wife. regarding ~~medicare~~ medicaid you should talk to an elder care lawyer. typically, if a person qualifies for  ~~medicare~~ medicaid funded care they pay all their assets first, minus a very small amount, and ~~medicare~~ medicaid covers the rest. this varies from state to state so be sure to find a lawyer in their area. good luck",0,This is a

"okay, so my dad was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. because i gave birth to a child and didn't live super close to my parents i was never able to attend many of his doctor appointments. now i have moved closer and my child is older, so i'm paying closer attention to his health and helping out my mom. one thing that was never made clear to me is what type of dementia he had. so at his last appointment with his neurologist, i asked her what type of dementia is he diagnosed with. and she said, based on his scans it's either alzheimer's or vascular dementia. so is that a thing? i guess i was looking for something definitive. not: maybe this, maybe that. i guess from her perspective it's all under the same umbrella, but from my prospective i'm just confused. yes, it's a thing. my mom also has vascular dementia and alzheimers. remember, alzheimers is a form of dementia so you're right, it's all under the same umbrella. i wish you all the best! eta: there is no definitive way to diagnose alzheimers while the patient is alive, it's only when they die that they can say (via autopsy) that it was alzheimers. another common cause is vascular dementia. a person can also have both. as others have said, alzheimer's can't be diagnosed with 100% certainty until an autopsy. i've read that alzheimer's presents as a slow progression whereas vascular dementia will process periodically with sudden changes. a uti will also appear as a sudden change, but treating the uti will help improve the sudden problem. my grandmother has vascular dementia and dementia. although i did assume they are the same and it's not? interestingly enough, not diagnosed with alzheimers. we went to different doctors and honestly, none were much help. my grandmother is on medication, it's really not improving her symptoms. i think going to get a second opinion will help in the sense of getting the right mix of medications if you don't think the dr. is doing what he can. my so has a dementia, undefined diagnosis at this point. but without an effective treatments or accurate tests, i am not pushing for further diagnostic testing. we are four years into the dementia, i am focused on positive support, seeing that she gets good food, plenty of rest and limit her over stimulation. i give her opportunity to be functional, but step in when she get confused. had a similar chat with my mom’s doc when she was diagnosed. he told me that the only true way to tell if it’s alzheimer’s is to do an autopsy after she passes away. until then, they use standardized testing. i read somewhere that mri scans show shrinking of the brain with alzheimer’s, more so than regular senile degeneration. while i’m assuming vascular dementia shows less blood flow>>>less circulation from kidney disease or diabetes>>>cognitive functional decline",0,This is a 
"my dad has been really struggling with being my moms primary caregiver. he never had to do much of the child raising and i can tell he’s cracking but am not sure how to help him emotionally. has anyone had success finding a counselor for their parent? he looked for support groups once and then never followed up so i think i’ll need to find someone and give him the push. why kind of counselor has training in this kind of thing. would it be a grief counselor or family counselor? any advice is appreciated my biggest help has been a local alzheimer's group, unless people have experienced it themselves they just don't get it. even just sitting and listening to other people has helped me have some perspective on my own situation. i’m the primary for my mom. i have things covered, but from the outside it might look like i’m holding up way better than i am. you know what i’d absolutely melt for? if i came home from work one day and someone had arranged for my mom to be looked after so that they could take me out to dinner as a thanks for everything. i know there’s no medals for this, and i don’t really expect it, but making time to really acknowledge your dad’s dedication might really mean the world to him. go together with him to a support group or 2, whatever you can find, and folk there likely will know of counsellors / therapists specialising in carer support / grief processing. folk often research for support but then not follow through - if you find when & where & tell him you're going together with him, then that breaks the ice & starts him off. or ask your area alzheimers .org &/ dementia .org, they know for sure. good luck! get his blessings before you take the next step—but my 2¢, select the counsellor, set up an appointment, make sure his ""shift"" with mom is covered for the time he'll need, and gently push him out the door with enough time to get there. how to select: if there is a nurse who comes in, then there is some kind of institutional apparatus behind the nurse: hospice, hospital, medi-care/caid… reach out to them for referrals, best kind of counsellor to seek. if not, contact his pcp for a referral. why you need to set wheels in motion: dementia is contagious. caregivers need to remember, sequence, execute millions of adl tasks for self *and* for loved one. lack of self care leads to lack of care for loved one, leads to lack of self-care… vicious cycle. god bless you for caring for the caregiver. my dad was similar, caring for wife & emotionally reserved & struggling with his own issues, and he was a total mess. my dad found a class that he was able to take virtually through the local adult day care center. the class was perfect. the class included video examples, a handout binder broken into sections like ""eating"", and a live instructor that was able to answer questions and also curtail some of the winding stories from other classmates. pm me if you want and i can share the local day care details - there may be something similar in your area. i find it almost impossible to be able to join and attend a specific group, but have gotten a lot of great information from this youtube channel, which i can watch anytime it's convenient for me. [www.alz.org](   this will help you find your local alzheimer's chapter. they have group meetings. he needs to attend. set it up for him. get him there. if he's financially stable, then hire an assistant to help out a few days/nights a week. nobody can be a care taker 24/7 and stay sane. ask the nurse for a list of recommended care takers. the nurse or the social worker can provide this. take care. it's a tough job to take care of the dying but even harder when we love them.",0,This is a 
"do any of you in the pre-diagnosis stage worry that getting a diagnosis will cause your loved one to deteriorate faster? that’s what i’m struggling with. my family and i can tell something is wrong with my dad (and has been for sometime) but he’s already so sad i worry he will give up all hope if he finds out for sure something is wrong. we’ve already had a neuropsych consult and they want him to come in for further testing. i am pushing to get it done but the more adamant i am about it, the more i wonder if it’s even the right choice. i have been insistent that we need to know what we’re dealing with but honestly i don’t know what to think anymore. thanks in advance for any advice. no; a diagnosis will not affect the disease. what i've had happen, though, is my loved one stopped trying to fake being neurotypical. in a word, she appears like someone with more pronounced dementia than previously. that's while she's around me. we talk about dementia—openly, gently, with respect. having a diagnosis helps me know better how to help her maintain her dignity. helps me learn strategies which would violate norms for neurotypical people, but that have now become helpful—completing her sentences, tying her shoes, asking ""do you understand,"" cutting her slack when she can't remember or do something. i've set down my experiences; ymmv. i get you’re worried your dad will feel sadder with a diagnosis, but in my case - my mom knew something was wrong with her, and it upset her not knowing why or what was going on. now that we have a diagnosis, i think it helps her to have an explanation. now when she gets upset because she can’t remember something, i tell her “well mom, it’s because you have alzheimer’s. the alzheimer’s makes you forget.”  it weirdly calms her, i guess because there’s a reason for what’s happening, and knowing what it is in that moment might be helping her confusion. i can tell you from my family’s experience, getting the diagnosis is the right choice. once you have it, you can move forward and get information and help on what to do next. odds are, though, they'll agree it's probably alzheimers. one side note worth mentioning: my mom was also called back for extra testing. at the advice of my bil, an md, my dad asked a lot of questions around what they were looking for specifically, and found out that particular neurologist wanted to enroll my mom in a very expensive drug trial. the extra testing (which my parents would have paid for) only would have shown whether she was a candidate for that trial. so... ask questions. what sort of further testing do they want? neuropsych testing is pretty comprehensive. if his neuropsych testing did not diagnose dementia then he may not have it. severe depression can mimic dementia as well. i experienced something similar to what you describe - i would just say treat it like it’s in your head … at the end of the day, your doing the best you can and make sound judgments while accounting for all evidence. my moms second round of tests showed major decline, enough for the neuro-psych to say “most likely dementia”, and then no follow ups or anything (after a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and small vessel ischemic)  there are times when it seems like a diagnosis makes it worse, mom is relatively lucid and any diagnosis would be perceived by her as straight up gaslighting (hence she refused to see the neuro psych again anyway). but a couple hours later she may think she is in her childhood home and wondering where her parents are …   in sum, i think the diagnosis is critical to get help in the system (i just changed her doctors so she will be more comfortable) - but it may also lead to a lot of crazy fighting (especially if they think they are fine, or constantly forget about the diagnosis). with my one data point, i say no. i have tried changing things up numerous ways to try to manage and try to stay ahead of my wife’s decline. her decline has been a constant steady progression. it seems like every week i noticed a subtle little thing she can’t now do. when she can’t feed herself or use the restroom properly it seems significant, but i see the constant steady decline. staying on a constant schedule of sleep and meds seems to make for much better next days.",0,This is a

"2014-2015 (73/74 years old): father's alzheimer was starting to be more prominent. it starts when he's talking to people, he'd keep repeating what he's saying. 2016 (75 years): he starts forgetting where is he going when driving. like, he would leave from point a to point b, and while on the road, he'd forget where is he going for point b is, and eventually ends up going back to point a. one time, he was going somewhere that's only a 30-minute drive from our house. while on the road, he forgot, he went into circles, and six hours later, he thankfully made it back home.2018 (77 years): he started to forget how to go back to the house from our yard/garden. you'd have to guide him. he used to water the whole yard, but around this time, unless you guide him, he'd only water one area.2019 (78 years): he started to forget how to go from one place in the house to another. let's say how to go to the bathroom from the living, or going to his bedroom. also, this is around the time that you have to give his medicine to him, as he cannot take it by himself. 2020 (79 years), you had start guiding him with personal hygiene, and when taking a shower. you have to make sure he actually gets in the shower, that he actually uses the soap and shampoo, and you have to pick out the clothes he's gonna wear, and set it on the counter. though, he still knows how to put clothes on. he also started losing his perception of time. when he wakes up from an afternoon nap, he thinks it's morning. or he'd wake up my mom in the middle of the night, as he thinks it's already morning. he would wonder out of his air conditioned room, to go some other part of the house, would sit down, and complain that it's hot. i would bring him back to the room. a couple minutes later, he'd do this again. he would also ask where my mother is, i give him an answer. then 30 seconds later, he'd ask the same question again. 2021: about a month or two ago, he's having trouble when you give him a command. let's say if you want him to flick a light switch.   based on the timeline above, what stage is my father at? and how long is this going to last before advancing to the next? also, i've read that people with alzheimer's would live about 8-10 years, or if they're lucky, up to 20 years. how long do you think my father is going to live?i would like to apologize for the dumb questions. i am just curious. especially, when dealing with this everyday. thanks.",1,This is a

my mother in law moved in with us a few months ago when her husband passed. i'm her main caregiver as my husband is an otr truck driver and is gone about 3 weeks per month. mil has several health issues but she is moble with a walker and gets around the house just fine. the problem is her eating habits. she rarely will eat what i cook not refusing out right but saying oh maybe i'll try it later or something like that. meanwhile she eats all the time. like every two to three hours day and night. she doesn't sleep well at night and she also smokes so anytime she wakes up she has a cigarette and usually something to eat. that's what i mean by day and. she will eat anything that's grab and go. like fruits individual snack cakes cookies chips things like that. if we don't have those she resorts to peanut butter and bread . the problem is when i buy those things i'm expecting them to last at least the week but they're gone in two days.not only is this type of diet very unhealthy for her but it's impractical and expensive. at this point i just don't know how to break this habit of hers. i'm afraid if i stop buying the convenience foods she won't eat. or since she does have her own small income she will tell me to just buy the stuff with her money. which doesn't solve the problem of having to go to the grocery store every two days and having her eat all this unhealthy junk. since she moved in with us she also complains about losing her independence. even though it was her idea. so i am leary about telling her what she can or can't do. i'm also trying to get all of her doctors and medication straight since she didn't take care of herself while her husband was ill before he died. i'm sure there's a simple solution for this but i'm so overwhelmed with everything right now i can't see it. any help would be appreciated thanks in advance.,1,This is a 
"my mil (59) has lewy body dementia, she’s at a stage where she can participate in light conversation, but often loses her words and train of thought. she also has delusions and a lot of false memories. she is not capable of forming new memories. the only self care she can do is put her clothes on (usually backwards or inside out) and bring a spoon of food to her mouth. she needs help with every other aspect of her life. she’s been with us for two years. i’m her primary caregiver, a stay at home mom. i’m planning on sending this to her two sisters and my bil, none of which are involved in her care, other than the occasional check-in text. names have been changed.please let me know if you think i should add or change anything? have i over-explained? under-explained? donna - milemma - my 3 year oldgrant - my almost 1 year oldcharles - my husbandezra - brother in lawhey family, i’m so sorry to spring this on you so suddenly. as of today, our home is no longer suitable or safe for donna. i’ve been struggling with this for a while, and we had an  incident today that pushed us over the edge. everyone is ok, but this can’t continue as is. when we first decided to bring donna into our home, i told charles that our boundary would be if she becomes a danger to us or our kids, or if we become a danger to her, then it would be time to find her somewhere else. that time has come. today, while i was helping grant nap (he’s been sick all weekend), emma went into donna’s bedroom, and hit her hand with a toy (metal) hammer, it was supposed to be in the garage, and she was supposed to be going to the bathroom. donna is ok physically. but she’s terrified and disoriented, she had trouble getting from her room to the kitchen table. emma has been dealt with, hammer is gone, of course. but i just can’t help but feel that something is bound to happen again. keeping the two of the apart has been one of my biggest struggles since we’ve moved into this house. emma can operate baby gates and doors, donna cannot. the only ways to keep them separate is either inhumane (locking them both in their bedrooms, not happening) or extremely logistically difficult (what i’ve been doing, constant supervision, made impossible because of grant’s needs, me going to the bathroom, emma’s extremely independent attitude & physical maturity, she’s the has size & capabilities of a 5 year old). now that grant has started to walk, the house is about to undergo another baby-proofing transformation; and it won’t go well for donna. then plan that charles and i have had on the back burner is to find her a skilled nursing facility in city name (the town where charles works and ezra lives. about 20 minutes from our home). we wanted to wait as long as possible to make this transition. please keep us in your prayers, this will be extremely difficult for all of us.",1,This is a

"i will cut to the chase and give you the preface later. i called adult protective services to report self neglect on an 84 year old man i live with. i spoke with a social worker a couple days later and was told that a county nurse will be making a visit within the next couple weeks. she also spoke to the guy who has power of attorney over his medical care (he lives out of state but is planning to move in this house  soonish.) i really need there to be a formal diagnosis for dementia. this man is very stubborn and in denial of everything health related. what would be the best way to do this? he's going to deny everything.i was told by the social worker he hasn't paid all 3 of the utilities for months. he keeps getting shut off notices from the water company but none of them have shut off utilities yet. i'm very surprised nothing has been shut off. he hasn't seen a doctor in several months because his doctor retired. i told him he needs to call his insurance to get a new one but he doesn't listen to me. he's very stubborn and doesn't listen to anyone who tells him he needs to see his doctor. he has a very bad cut on his ankle that looks like it could be mrsa. i expressed to him that i think he has dementia but he denies it even when you tell him about all his memory problems. he loses his money constantly, his car keys were lost for what seemed like forever, he loses his canes for walking, he will ask the same question multiple times within a very short period. he's very moody and grumpy most of the time. he loves to argue with people over the tiniest most trivial things. most recently, he was calling out his dead mother's name while knocking on the guest bathroom door. i had to tell him there was nobody else in the house. most days he's fine but more recently he has started thinking other people are in the house and one time he checked the guest bedrooms because he thought people were in there. he hoards food to the point that when he finally gets to eat something, it has already rotted and expirped long ago. he gets mad when anyone interjects and wants to throw something away. the last jug of milk i saw him throw away had an expiration date of july 2020 and the inside hard yellow slimy curds. he has lost his sense of smell and i'm pretty sure he has no taste either. he doesn't believe anyone else when they tell him his fridge smells bad. he says they have sensitive smells which is not true. one night he went to the grocery store and was gone for a long time. he got taken home by a police officer. he had a blown tire and the cop said he was lost and didn't know where he was. the cop told me he thinks he has dementia and that he really needs to see a doctor because it's going to get worse. and also, he has a suspended license because he failed the written test . recently, he has been having bathroom accidents where he goes in his pants and then it runs down his legs and onto the damn carpet. he refuses to buy adult diapers. my dad bought me a carpet shampooing machine. i moved in here in 2019 for free rent and utilities in exchange for help around the house and yard. i'm not a nurse or caretaker and i don't do anything medical. i mainly do simple things like vacuuming, dusting, raking leaves, trimming small trees, etc. i have no authority over this man.",1,This is a

"i am the covid house companion for a male relative, 78/m, whom i love and care deeply about but with whom interaction is sometimes challenging. over recent years, the man has shown an increasing level of defensiveness and insecurity, and deals with it an increasing childlike manner to the point that our interactions sometimes do not resemble adult interactions. tonight i approach the man as he was washing dishes.  he was cleaning with a sponge tipped wand, cold water and not looking at the dishes, indeed, he was not wearing his glasses. i picked up one of the bowls in the drying rack and found, predictably, that the inside remained covered with food since he was neither looking at them nor using the better tool (a washcloth).  i have confronted him before about how dishes are remaining dirty when he does not bother to look at them and tries to use a sponge wand. he was unable to receive this information.  when i tried to show him that the dishes remained dirty, he refused to look, became upset and left the house. when he feels criticized he has started to say, ""it's not what you say, it's how you say it,"" but he cannot answer how it is wrong when i objectively tell him that the dishes are not clean and that the wand is not cleaning them fully. i tell him that there is nothing mean or abusive about the necessity of pointing out that he is not washing dishes in a way that cleans them, but that i feel that he has a very high level of defensiveness and sensitivity. this sequence has recurred on multiple nights regarding dishes and also is replicated in other contexts. i would love to hear advice or tips about how to deal with defensiveness, sensitivity, and childlike response to being confronted about things that need improvement or correction.",1,This is a

"just had another bout with dehydration with my mother (94, i'm the sole caregiver). previous bouts had led to hospitalizations that were, on retrospect, unnecessary. doctor concurred that it was likely dehydration. while dehydration crises happen less, they still can. i watched her at breakfast and dinner as usual, but simply didn't take note of all those times she'd only drunk a third or so of her 16 ounce glass. i assured myself she'd be fine because i was giving her her usual shake in the afternoon. i was wrong. the onset of symptoms was slow, then swift, until she was trying to eat her napkin for her dinner. couldn't walk. fell, gash on nose. i got all this taken care of without a trip to the er, woo hoo. and went in for the fluids; extra drinks, making sure she drank all of her meal drink, and sure enough, she's back to her baseline for energy, exercises, etc. it most definitely was dehydration.what made me post this (i think i've done this before) was someone's post on here about their father trying to eat his napkin. it just made me wonder if the guy was just dehydrated. obviously, there can be more, much more causing delerium/dementia, but this one you have to look at closely. it seems very clear that dehydration is likely to be a, maybe the, primary malady affecting the elderly in their health crises. and it really may suggest many other problems, when it's this simpler explanation.you have to really, really watch for it, and do the math. how much did they have to drink for breakfast? oh, they poured a full glass, but how much did they actually drink? and for lunch? snack? dinner? if it all amounts to about 6 ounces for the whole day, it's just a matter of time. do the math. they're going to become dehydrated, no question, with just 6 ounces of liquid a day. hydration levels (according to my non-professional opinion) just slowly lower until they reach a critical point. but you don't notice it, like the famous frog in the hot water. i realize it can be incredibly hard to get them to drink. making really good shakes helps me a lot (i don't use ice cream but milk, evaporated milk, ice, flavorings, in a good blender). but as i've noted, i can still miss it. and i'm 99 percent sure many, many people are missing this maybe single most important necessity.so i'm making this public service suggestion. announcements are for professionals. i'm not. but i think what i'm talking about should be easy to see.",1,This is a

"realy don't know how to bring this to a good solution. dad (94) had two pairs of glasses. couple months ago he went for an eye exam and his eyes havent changed, but he wanted a new pair anyway. he asked the guy for a different style of frame cause his old ones tended to slip. so he got a new style and was happy going home. they needed adjustment, all good. then there was something called a 'final adjustment'. then an emergency adjustment. each time the guy looks at me and i shrug and he fixes em and dad's happy. week ago he tells me they gave him double and blurred vision. i ask him today and he doesnt remember that. but he needs to give them back because they slip. cant get a refund of course, he just wanted to give them back. i suggested he get the lenses put in new frames and that he get the old style frames. now he asked for a new style cause the old slipped, now they dont slip but the new ones do. *and you see why i drink*anyway, i suggested he try wearing glasses #3 and if the frames are acceptable he have the guy put his new lenses in them. that is the hope. now my prediction is that in the shop theyre fine. after a few days they dont work. this is playing out to a slow neverending play.  he also told his glasses were a year old, theyre maybe two months. he told me his old pair were from the va and were $35 cause they didnt have a prescription. (?) but the guy told me he made them two years ago.  i cant get real or understandable answers from my dad. these new glasses, with the same prescription as the 2 yearold ones were quite expensive.last question...he's on medicare, don't they cover glasses and eye exams? thanks if you read thru this. i have an it exam friday and i told dad i had scheduled it a week and a half ago and its been a steady stream of issues.  its frustrating and exhausting dealing w/ this, really scrambles my focus.",1,This is a

"dad watched a cat that was sat in the driveway for ten minutes. when asked what he was doing, he stated he was ""waiting for the cat to take off"".  mum, ever the comedian, told him gently ""no darling, cats don't fly. you're thinking of pigs.""dad's condition has taken a steep downward trend. while it's easy to find the humour in some of it, he also asked me about twenty times today if he had children. he has three, myself included. it's easy to see how sadness and desperation can win when it comes to alzheimers. i have noticed my anxiety flares in different ways because of the mental and emotional strain, my brain desperately trying to find something else to blame these negative emotions on. whichever way i look at it, it's really hard watching my intelligent, independent father descend into this awful, scared, lonely place.to counter that, here are my current favourite funny things dad has done because of alzheimer's.  strangely this week theyr all food related aside from the flying cat. complained about the marmalade being out of date - it was piccalilli. he still ate it all for breakfast. spent a while feeding my dog gingernut biscuits while he enjoyed her dog treats. was asked to feed the dog dinner. opened a can of guinness and poured it into the dog bowl. i don't mind that dad doesn't always know who i am. it doesn't matter who he thinks i am as long as he feels safe, happy and loved.  i'll think i'll have to keep repeating this to myself like a mantra as he gets worse.",1,This is a 
"i study in a foreign country (in spain), but i'm at home (in florida) for the summer, and i might stay longer because all my classes are online now.my dad has lost his ability to do most basic tasks but he is still himself, he still knows who i am, he still remembers a lot of details from his life. i only come home once a year so i see his decline in ""jumps."" he is worse than he was last year.he doesn't recognize objects, he can't find his way around the house, and i guess his short-term memory is off. he can't remember things like whether he had breakfast. sometimes he tries to pour himself a cup of water but he's holding the cup upside down and the water splashes all over the kitchen. he urinates all over the bathroom floor because he can't find the toilet. he can't dress himself. he can't use his computer or smartphone, which was always an issue even when he was younger but now he really can't do basic things. i taught him how to listen to the bbc world service, npr, and audiobooks on youtube, which he enjoys and he can sort of do it but he often needs help. he has a lot of difficulty using his phone.he wanted to write about his experiences during his career (he was an attorney and he participated in fighting for civil rights in the 1960s) but i'm not sure if he's still capable of writing a coherent book. it's sort of a tragedy that he can't write his experiences. he sort of can, but he keeps printing out the same three pages over and over again, and he set it to size 20 font and the whole project is becoming an incoherent disaster.my mother is angry with him because when my father was young and strong, he tended towards the abusive side. my mother wanted to divorce him in recent years, but now she has to stay with him because he never bought any kind of medical insurance and there is no one else in the world who will take care of him. my mom works in medicine and she stays home now due to corona (both of my parents are in the highest-risk group) so she takes care of my father all day, including preparing meals and helping him get dressed, but sometimes she is very impatient with him, especially when he does things she told him not to do, or when he doesn't do things she told him to do. my dad was always bad at following basic directions and he often made a lot of poor decisions, so my mom still has a lot of resentment from decades of fights. my mom has always had a short temper, and really both of them contributed to making the house a toxic place over the years. it's one of the reasons why i left, but not the only reason. (i really wanted to live in a place with public transport, pedestrian life, and cold weather.)a lot of my father's mind is still intact. he knows who he is, he knows who my mom is, he knows who i am, and he knows that i am here. he knows that i'm living abroad. there is still a lot of him left. he knows what's going on around him, to an extent. he likes bbc podcasts and he follows along. we went to the supermarket and came home and he remembered details of what we did at the supermarket (he found it impressive that i knew how to buy food).my parents' house has been overly cluttered with shit, and i convinced my mom to give a lot of shit to goodwill. most of the shit was random gifts from random people - glass tigers, giant miniature sailboats, metal apples on metal plates, wooden russian spoons, a large yellow vase with red chinese dragons (this object was very expensive and had been important to my father's mother), little sculptures, decorated plates and bowls, all kinds of objects from all over the world that people brought to us without asking and expected us to keep forever. every solid surface in the house was covered with this garbage. expensive garbage, but garbage nonetheless. the dining room table, the desks, the kitchen counter, the shelves, the dressers, everywhere was covered in stupid objects. thirty years of accumulated garbage ate up all the space, collected dust, cluttered the house. we spent the past two weeks collecting all this garbage into plastic boxes and dumping it off at goodwill. my dad wanted to participate in this cleaning project, but he really couldn't. he kept doing bizarre things like brushing the floor with a small brush instead of using a broom. we have one room that's full of books (which we're mostly planning to give away) and he started cleaning that floor with a wet mop, which was damaging the books. we told him to stop, because first we would take the books to some library and then we would clean the floor, but he angrily insisted to do it anyway because ""oh i won't damage the books."" the thing is, my dad was already like that when his brain was working. he would often do things that made sense to absolutely nobody but him, and he would fight you if you tried to interfere. it's one of the reasons my mom wanted to leave him. in my opinion, he had undiagnosed asperger's syndrome, because in the wikipedia entry for asperger's it describes my dad's personality a lot. as it turned out, he had no idea that he was using a wet mop (because he insisted it was dry), so i replaced it with a dry broom and he just kept sweeping.there are some objects that my dad would not want to throw away, like the large yellow vase from china, or a sprawling set of ancient wine glasses we never use, or a heavy crystal-glass bowl that was a wedding gift from some cousin, but he wasn't really capable of recognizing that we were getting rid of those objects. he just went along with it.i also found something which i thought was sort of incredible - a diary kept by my dad's mother during the years 1929 to 1933, when she was age 19 to 23. my dad asked what it was and i told him, i said ""it's a diary from [her name] from 1929 to 1933,"" and he said, ""oh wow! i want to read it!"" but then i guess he forgot about it five minutes later. it had been in the garage, sitting in humidity and heat, so i brought it to my room and read it. i can't say it was that interesting - she visited cleveland and new york, and she was in love with some guy named ray who is almost certainly dead - but having a 90-year-old diary from a deceased relative written when she was almost younger than the dog is quite remarkable. (the dog has also gotten really old and she doesn't like to play anymore.)there are a lot of little things that are getting worse. in 2015 my dad couldn't find his way to an elevator in a small hotel. now he can't recognize cabinets that he built himself twenty years ago. or he'll hold up an object that's very obviously a simple object like a cup and ask what it is. my mom installed some hooks in the bathroom for holding towels and he ripped them off the walls because he thought they were door handles for a cabinet that didn't exist.i've been staying home because i don't want to collect corona and bring it home, but last night i went out with one of my childhood friends, mike, and we sat at an outdoor table at a taco restaurant. he knows my dad. i told him what was going on, and mike said, ""he's going to start forgetting who you are."" that comment sort of caught me off guard, because i guess it didn't occur to me that it will get worse. it didn't occur to me that it's sort of a big deal that my dad still knows who i am and that i am here.i sort of avoid my parents, especially my dad, when i am home, because old habits die hard. he needs a lot of attention (even when his brain worked he needed a lot of attention) so i tended to stay in my room with the door closed, and now as an adult i'm doing the same thing. i feel like i am wasting this valuable time while my dad's brain is still working at the level that it is.i didn't expect to write this many paragraphs, i thought this would be a short post. but anyway i guess i would like to spend some more time with my dad, but i don't really know how because whenever i'm in his presence i feel overwhelmingly driven to go back to my room and sit in bed and browse instagram or some such stupid bullshit. i guess i'd like to know what are some things i can do during this early stage while he's still there. like how can i take advantage of this time.",1,This is a

"my father (almost 87) was diagnosed with vascular dementia in late 2016. these past few months he's been having problems properly using the bathroom. see, during the evening and night he's really showing confusion, anger, being stubborn and all that, and he absolutely refuses to either face the toilet or get close enough to it, or both. it's gotten to a point where my mom has to use the other bathroom and often has to wash the floor of the one my dad uses. she tries to guide him, gently move him close enough or turn him but nah, he won't do it. he has a diaper so basically he wouldn't even have to go to the bathroom, but he refuses to just pee in his diaper and absolutely insists on going to the bathroom and if someone tries to stop him he'll just attempt to pee wherever he's made it since getting off the bed.what can my mom do about this? or is there anything she can do at all? it's silly tasks like having to wash the floor that have reduced her free time to an absolute 0 and there's not much more she can tolerate especially since the dementia appears to have taken a rapid turn for the worse these past two days.",1,This is a

my grandpa is on the decline with dementia and my grandma is his primary caregiver while she can manage him. i'm visiting for a week helping them get their house ready to sell and compile old photos and records on her computer.one of the biggest issues my grandma has to deal with is his diet coke addiction. whenever he wants a drink instead of grabbing his open bottle next to him he goes to the fridge to get an unopen bottle. next thing you know he has 5 open bottles next to him and gets defensive if you try to combine what's left of them into one bottle or put the warmest ones back in the fridge.my grandma would hide them in boxes or in the back of the fridge so they would be cold when he would want one.

"hello, i'm so grateful for this community. i am having a really rough week  with my dad. i'm currently residing with him two weeks on two weeks off.there are dual challenges, one is that he currently doesn't have running water so i have been pumping well water to boil and clean with. his living conditions are unlivable and i'm getting burned out.second my dad and i have a strained relationship,  and he can be quite manipulative  ex. he wanted miracle whip, and i couldn't find it in the fridge. he found it in the cupboard the next day and poured half of it out to make it look like it'd been used, then left it on the counter,  and told me it was in the fridge where i looked. i called him on it, and he was like yeah,  just fucking with youkind of the snapped the other day. i've been stressed with some issues at home i need to get back for. additionally my hair falls out when i'm stressed.  while i was home my dad had too many of his fentanyl patches and almost od'd. it was a hugely stressful day. the whole time i was away he told me i needed to be back because he was starving, though he has a friend that will get groceries and this was all designed to guilt me. he actually went for a motorcycle ride one day and didn't stop and get bread or anything just chose notmy dad also has this thing where he's obsessed with power. he'll give me a list of chores to do then when i get back he'll ask if i got something not on the list and expect me to get it. he'll refuse the crackers i brought with his soup, then if i don't get the fresh ones fast enough he'll get up to get them and then say how nauseous it made him to get up. he shushed me and snaps at me to do stuff.it has been getting to me. so the other day i cooked him oatmeal on his hot plate because the stove isn't working, and there was a hair in it. i'm pretty sensitive with the stress alopecia- on top of the travel, unlivable conditions,  and stuff at home, my finances have also been hit and i rwasn't paid for july- one of my hairs was in his oatmeal. rather than saying i'm good or can i have something else,  he said you can have your hair back now. i ignored it because i am sensitive , so he repeated it again, and when i went to pick up his dish he was holding the hair - and said you can have this back now. it may seem innocent,  but this man also congratulated my sister for being pregnant - then took photos  in a bikini without her knowledge to show her why he thought she was pregnant. i got upset and told him that was rude,  and i don't appreciate it. he keeps saying how i'm here to work, and this isn't a vacation, and keeps calling me his nurse.i also told him i can come to help. cook, shop, clean. but our goal was to always get him into a home with better amenities,  and then have an hca come to help with the things i'm not comfortable with - toilet trips, bathing, etc. my dad left when i was a teen and i'm not comfortable with the nudity. he's made remarks in the past that have made me uncomfortable- when i was a teen he made me watch a porn because he thought his girlfriend was in it, once was complaining about the doctor touching his prostate roughly, and said ""you would want her to fondle it gently like a guy with your nipples"" went to get an erotic massage while him and i were traveling, and most recently was yelling at me to use the jack like i'm jacking it off. so i'm uncomfortable with it. the other day i heated water for him to have a bath, and went outside for him to have privacy. when i came back in he had me look at  rash, and was nude. i got very upset because it makes me uncomfortable.  now flash to yesterday. he is unable to change himself all of the sudden. i had his friend come help. i've been very guarded and emotional and kind of cold. i feel really uncomfortable but also know he's scared and i'm stressed. i feel like i'm making it worse because i'm so guarded and can't snap out of it, and now he's being really mean and bossy to me  i'm not sure how to snap out of it, or help constructively",1,This is a

"i’m (28) a caregiver (i cater to disabled persons mentally or physically who are young or semi independent/able but still need help. generally under 50) and my client (45) wants me to help them lose weight and get healthy. i had mentioned to them i helped my last client, who had a long list of serious food allergies and conditions, by starting a diet for them to stay at a healthy weight, alleviate their symptoms and even require less medication and is a diet they can sustain long term; i also mentioned i managed to create my own diet plan to help with my own health conditions/disorders and did so successfully so they asked me to take charge of their diet as well. this client is the kind of person that never had an example of a healthy diet/lifestyle and has used only short term fad diets as solutions but they’re not dumb or clueless, just ignorant and stuck in bad habits (also didn’t grow up with the internet). the thing about my method is that my goal is to help them take more control over their health and become more independent. in order to do that, i encourage them to educate themselves (feed a man a fish and he’ll eat for a day, teach them how and they’ll never go hungry). i told them this and that while im happy to cook and shop for them, in order to make it a long term solution, they ‘have’ to educate themselves on healthy habits, nutrition, their conditions and how to cook healthy in a way that works for them and change bad habits. im no teacher but i offered to help teach them along the way and told them they can ask me questions since im much more knowledgeable and experienced on the subject; i also made some notes for them to use as a reference and to get started. my last client refused to do the research as well, making me completely responsible for what they ate, how much and when. i didn’t have a problem with this, but they gained 30lbs and worsening symptoms soon after i left them. i told my new client about this but they still won’t do the work. they continue self destructive behavior using food/drinks they know they shouldn’t have, skip meals and then complain to me they gained weight, cant keep it off or feel sick. i don’t know how else to get across that there’s no shortcuts and if they want to get healthy, feel better and keep off the weight, they ‘have’ to start educating themselves and change habits or they’ll never get better at it. they said they were drawn to the fact i said it can be a safe long term solution but won’t do the work necessary to make it so. i know they’re capable of it so how do i convince the research matters without being a nag or pushy?",1,This is a

"my dad (93), parkinsons, dementia, alzhiemers, sleep disorder, stroke a couple years ago. tied to his walker and sits all day. he takes a half-dozen meds daily. my dad is very independent, has to create his own system and solutions even when nothing is broken. when he drove he had to come up with his own shortcuts, even if it took longer. so he has always insisted on organising his own meds. this consisted of lining up his bottles on the bathroom sink and places one from each on the counter in front.his health went in cycles. 5-7 pretty good days where he gets around on his walker and is present mentally then 2-3 bad days where he barely gets around or is in the wheelchair and is mentally losing or lost. that last badspell he couldnt get up he was so weak, had hallucinations, and couldnt think straight. he has been beset with weakness, sometimes very bad, dependent alot on his sleep. i discovered he had taken his meds improperly and clued in that despite what he insisted he was unable to manage them so i took over. we went to a daily am/pm setup that held a weeks worth. he isnt allowed to touch the bottles or the pillminder. i give him his pills when its time. since then his swings have evened up. physically most days are good and on the weaker days he can still get around. his mental aspect has no real deep lows thos he will still have a day or two where he is somewhat lost.  but overall considering both aspects its a marked improvement.this from a stubborn as hell guy who never wants help even if it kills him. i tried for almost two years to get him using a pillminder at least and at best let me manage it for him. now that he doesnt go out and cant drive he has accepted that i make sure he has his meds, theyre organised and he takes them properly.not tooting my own horn here, saying that if your loved one has any kind of mental issues and you wonder if theyre taking their meds properly, esp if they dont use a proper system, do it for them. unless you supervise you dont know whats going on. it could make a huge difference.",1,This is a 
"just gets impossible to get usable info from my dad. been thru hell trying to find a diet that works for him. been on a fruit, small turkey on toast sandwich and sometimes a hashbrown for brunch. dinner a fruit salad with cottage cheese plus a meat, usually chicken, and potatoes or green vege. food selection is difficult due to the challenges of eating with tremors. water is the only drink now. he seems many days to get stomach upset in the afternoon about an hour or two after he eats. really hard to tell just whats wrong but as far as i can piece together its not loose stool, no blood or anything and normally isnt discolored except when he drinks pepto every day. best as i can understand it he just takes a big bm. he says its not a normal one but i can understand whats wrong.he is upset that sometimes he wakes up at 7am and has to take a big bm. today he did that and just had another one where he said his stool was dark and grainy. no pain or bloating, not runny, no constipation. it isnt that its builds up and then its the bursting of the dam. so he finally accepted to start using metamucil starting tomorrow. thats all i know to try short of insisting he see his doctor and im betting thats the first thing she'd say...try metamucil.so question...hes 93, struggles to drink 3 glasses of water a day and no exercise. hbp and sleep med and dementia med as well. his window of opportunity w/ the fiber supplement will be after brunch. should he start with the full recommended dose? or maybe try a half dose for a few days and see what happens. is this something that you just do for a few days and get straightened out or a maintenance otc. ive only taken it in the short term. any other thoughts welcome, thanks.",1,This is a

"my wife began having major strokes about every two years in 2014.  insurance was getting so high back in alabama i found a job and we moved to jacksonville in 2016. she had recovered well from previous strokes but in 2018 i came home for lunch and found her on the floor, she couldn’t get up or speak. after a month of rehab she improved but her speech was affected with aphasia. in 2019 we were at the coumadin clinic at mayo where she became disoriented and the right side of her body turned red. they ran her over to the er, it wasn’t a stroke.  we asked if they could be more aggressive because she kept having these episodes that present as a stroke. they asked to do a brain biopsy. sounded scary but nothing else was working so we agreed. they did the biopsy 6/4, took a 3/4” cube from her brain.  when she came out of surgery she wasn’t moving her mouth as i gave her ice chips. they said she had trismus (lock jaw) and it should go away. it didn’t. she spent two more horrible weeks there, which is a bad story itself. when she got out she didn’t want anything to do with a doctor or hospital.  she just wanted to be at home. she couldn’t chew and survived on water and protein drinks. eventually she started eating soft foods; quiche, bread pudding and panera mac & cheese sustained her for almost a year. recently she has added chicken noodle soup and pot stickers, easy to swallow.  she can walk short distances, shower in a chair, gets down a couple of small soft meals per day.  she hasn’t spoken since the brain biopsy and her right side is very weak compared to the left.  communication is usually a few misspelled words that i arrange in a sentence. i just lost my job a few days ago, was working from home doing drafting work for a sign company.  we would like to move to atlanta to be near the youngest son who is really into reddit, i’d tag him if i knew how. i’ve heard there are programs that will pay for a person to be a caregiver but haven’t delved into that yet.  that is the purpose of this post, finding some  kind of financial help. she is disabled but did not qualify for full disability, before the strokes started she spent some years as a vendor at an antique mall and didn’t file taxes properly. she is short one year of the required work credits.  because i had a job she did not qualify for ssi. she can file for early retirement in a few months but that won’t be much. i have always been employed and provided insurance. i am reaching to find resources to help in our time of need.  thank you in advance for any ideas.  *edit: attempting tag.  /u/altoecko",1,This is a

"so my mother-in-law was confirmed as having covid-19 last week. thankfully the virus hasn’t hit her hard and she only suffered from mild symptoms, so is on the mend with that. however, her confusion has rapidly increased since she got the virus and i would appreciate some advice/tips to try and help with the problems we have. she hasn’t had a full solid meal in 2 full weeks now and we are having to feed her high calorie milkshakes through a syringe and pretend that it is medicine. she won’t even sip water or drink cups of tea. she also is not tempted by chocolate or sweet things that she usually loves to eat. the only thing we have seen her attempt to drink is a bottle of washing up liquid, which we of course stopped her from drinking. she gets really frustrated when we say to her that she needs to have the full syringe. the hospital won’t take her in because of the viral load in the infectious diseases ward, as they are scared she gets worse/has a worse second wave of the virus. she keeps on trying to leave the house. we have another 10 days until she is able to leave the house and is no longer in isolation according to the hospital. we have had to padlock the door shut, hide keys, blockade the front door with a chair and a sign that explains why she cannot go for a walk with the dog. that seems to stop her from physically leaving the house but it doesn’t stop her from asking about it. we are being asked id say about every minute and a half about her taking the dog a walk. she’s also getting very angry and aggressive and saying that shes leaving regardless of what we say. she also keeps trying to trick us in to letting her out the door to let the dog out for the toilet, while also fully dressed as if she would be going out for a walk herself, which means we are having to sneak the dog out whenever she’s not looking in order for her to have the toilet. does anyone have any tips on how to decrease/help manage this? we are basically having to babysit her every second of every day and are not getting any peace at all. i feel guilty because it’s obviously not her fault, but any tips would be really appreciated as it is driving us mad. thank you in advance.",1,This is a

"taking care of patients with parkinson is not an easy task. you have to be extra careful while attending them as patients often face issues with walking, eating and all other actions which requires muscle movement. here are some caregiving tips for taking care of your loved ones grooming:the stiffness of fingers and hands restrict patients to use their muscles effectively as before. switch traditional brush with an electronic brush. also, avoid touching the back of the patients’ tongue as this may induce gagging. to address excessive drooling always keep a hand towel by your side. along with the traditional brush, switch razors with an electric shaver. aftershaves often cause rashes and redness, therefore, use lotion after a shave.bathing:avoid using bathtubs at any cost as it could lead to tripping hazards. make the patients sit on a safe shower stool and clean them using a hand-held showerhead. for patients suffering from dandruff, you can use a mild dandruff shampoo of a little quantity and ensure a proper rinse. for drying the patient, use a good quality absorbent towel. gently dry off the whole body of the patients, followed by wrapping them dry with the cloth. dressing:dressing accordingly can help a person with parkinson in a great way. always dress the patient in the most comfortable and simplest way. use dresses like elastic waistbands, front opening tops, tube socks while avoiding tights, pantyhose, etc. replacing buttoned outfits with velcro is also a smart choice.in reliable parkinson's care services in houston, tx, the caregivers advise to lay the clothes out before letting the patient go for a bath. it is advisable to let the patients dress as much as possible. ask them to sit down while trying on clothes. additional tips: refrain using shoes with rubber soles.eating:constipation is a common health issue associated with patients with parkinson disease. therefore, try to integrate fiber in their diet regularly. start by adding a slow amount of fiver and increase their fiber intake in a gradual manner. foods that come with fiber include grains, vegetables, fruits, whole bran cereals, etc. patients with parkinson also face trouble while swallowing food. avoid giving them too dry food, instead cook them food which is moist, soft and easier to swallow.as patients are more prone to falling hazards, the likelihood of getting fracture also increases if they lack strong bones. parkinson's care services in houston, tx suggests adding calcium-rich food in the diet plan of the patients. it’s necessary to serve them calcium-rich food at least three times a day. food rich in calcium includes cheese, yogurt, vitamin d-fortified milk, etc.",1,This is a 
"hi all. i'm hoping your collective experience can help me with something.  my husband, children and i live with my mom, who has mild-to-moderate (as of a few months ago, although i think we're moving solidly into moderate) dementia, most likely alzheimer's. she has recently stopped driving, so we are doing all of the household errands now. she did not want to give up driving and really liked running errands by herself, but it just wasn't safe anymore. she really enjoyed going to the grocery store by herself and walking the aisles to do the shopping, and feels she is ""being deprived"" if we will not allow her to do the grocery shopping alone. problem is, she is unable to stick to a list and neither she nor we can afford the gross overstocking she wants to do. she does not believe that we do not need the things she is absolutely convinced we need, no matter what. we just don't have the time to let her do this and then return the extra groceries before she notices, and if they come in the house (there's cold stuff so we can't just leave it in the car or garage to return later, even if we did have time) she opens multiple containers of the same thing, and then we can't return or donate them. this has been an issue for a while. we just don't have the money or storage space or time to keep dealing with this grocery issue, and now that she's not driving we are just not going to take her to the store so she can continue wasting so much money on all this food that is just going to go bad. we can't. she can't afford it, we can't afford it. it's over. but she wants it so bad and we're depriving her. &#x200b;she also really wants brand name convenience foods she's become accustomed to, but that really she couldn't afford and now that we are buying all the household groceries, we can't afford to keep feeding her that way. i'd like to buy a couple of things each week that i know she likes so it's not such a harsh transition, and see if i can get her to try store brand where i can. her appetite is kind of hit or miss so i feel terrible not just buying what she likes, but i just can't. i wish i could but i can't afford it. &#x200b;so my questions: i apologize a lot. i redirect a lot. my sister takes mom for two days and one night every other week, and i have an application in with the area agency on aging for respite care but there's a wait list. i know she can't understand. i will not get her to understand. do you have any suggestions to further help my mom and i through this transitional time of losing the independence of driving, losing an activity she so enjoyed, and losing access to the luxury convenience foods she likes all at once? if you've read this far, thank you just for listening and thank you in advance for any advice.",1,This is a

"these are just a few step-saving ideas of mine.  if you have some to share i greatly would appreciate it.  ever idea might save us all another 100 steps during what is otherwise an over-filled day of work.save an empty water bottle.   when you open the new bottle pour 1/3 of  the water into the old bottle.  the 1/3 full bottle is easier to lift and to get to their mouths when they are laying in bed.  when that 1/3 is gone, refill the bottle with another 1/3.  cycle the bottles, making the next empty bottle into the 1/3 one.  no spills - no mess - and easy for someone with little strength.flavored, non-carbonated waters are easier to swallow than plain water.  so have a bottle of lemon water near the bed for those too-big-to-swallow pills.check with your nurse first!, but usually if  the pill has a defined line across the middle of it you can cut the pill in half safely.  its easier to get down two halves of one huge pill then have them choke on one enormous one ...pin or clip a plastic grocery bag to the bed rail, hand rail, or fitted sheet, right at the level of their extended arm.  you have an instant garbage bag they can reach and you can easily throw away.stock up on those little tubs of puddling, fruit, and jello.  they are great snacks, and can be stack right net to the bed for easy reach.  since some meds, like antibiotics, need something in the tummy you don't have to make another trip to the kitchen.paper and styrofoam plates, and plastic silverware can save you a dozen trips a day.  just throw them away in that clipped grocery bag and dispose of them at the end of the day.  we can all worry about the environmental impact of those things later, right now we are focusing on 'conservation of energy' for the caretaker ... and care receiver.if you don't have a hospital bed or hospital bed table you can pick up a sofa table at walmart that slides its legs under the bed, and rests the table top over the bed.  they are cheap - around $20-25 - and mean that you can place more things within their reach.thank you!",1,This is a 
"so, my grandfather has had alzheimer's for quite a few years, but it has only ever affected his short-term memory. over the last year we've suddenly been having gastro-intestinal issues with him, and it's becoming more frequent. the first was a stomach bleed, which is not really related to his dementia. however, we have had to be more conscious about what he can eat so that his stomach isn't aggravated. we very nearly lost him when that happened. in the last month or two, we've noticed he is not chewing his food anymore. he has always been very greedy with food, with a massive appetite, which i think is making this chewing problem much more serious. an example was when we went out for a meal, and he was literally lunging at the bowls on the table, and before the food had even made contact with the spoon, his mouth was open and ready to have food shovelled into it. he ate two whole bowls of prawn crackers before the starter and main course, and it was honestly a very uncomfortable situation for our family to sit through, and we were very confused about why he was being so greedy and excessive with this. he isn't normally that bad.he went into hospital with a blockage a few weeks ago, and my father has been trying to encourage my grandmother (who is mentally very healthy, but physically not very mobile due to arthritis) to only make him soft meals, which will not block him up. last week he threw up a lot of unchewed food again, and then again today he has been sick. at this point it seems pretty obvious that his food is becoming a problem, and my grandmother is not helping the issue. she certainly understands that he needs small pieces of food, soft food, and healthy food to maintain his overall health. i'm especially concerned about the choking risk of him not chewing, which she seems to miss. my grandmother is actually lying to her children (my dad, aunt, and uncle) about how she chops his food into ""miniscule"" pieces, but we know this is a lie because we have seen the unchopped vegetables etc. she is very lazy and will talk about how they are eating well in front of us, but we have seen ready-meal packets in the bin at her house. i can't understand how she has seen the negative effects of eating certain things for him, and still gives him these things and is lying to us about it. we don't know what to other than constantly telling her what she needs to do. i am in education and her children are all in full-time employment and cannot give him the care he needs day to day, she is the person who needs to and she will not listen.",1,This is a

"if you have a bed bound family member you are caring for you'll need a few things. over the years i came up, through trial and error, with some products that just flat work better. also a few just practical tips. this will be for everyday items, not for beds, mattresses etc.you'll need gloves. my preference is the curad 3g vinyl. they come in various sizes in boxes of 100. some people have a personal preference for nitrile gloves. those are fine too. but with either you'll use a lot of them. guaranteed - you will pull one or three out of the box. never the two you need. 😁disposable washcloths. think really large wet wipes. invaluable for many uses. you can't do better than members mark (yes, sam's club!) premium washcloths. they're just better. they come in a box of 480, which is 5 packets of 48. that'll last you a while. the sam's club stores have them but they're not very good at all on keeping them in stock. i just use amazon.medline z-guard paste. now, this product is a little expensive because you use a lot. but by far the very best product for healing skin problems like chafing. also very good for preventing them. it comes in an orange tube. there's usually a 2 tube option, do that.underpads : there's 2 sizes. 23x36 and 30x36 inches. i use for different things.some people buy bibs for eating. they're washable but after a short period they get so stained they're just not useable anymore cuz they look so nasty no matter how much you was them. i use the smaller underpads as bibs. the armageddon for my wife was hot dogs. i'd cut them up but mustard would go everywhere! the pads help because you can cover the shoulders. but at any rate if you make a big mess you just toss them. i also found a lot of other uses for them. i use mckesson underpads lite uplt2336. they're very absorbant.and the big underpads. i will tell you, after i switched to the mckesson underpads ultra uphv3036 we never had another leak thru to the sheets. they are very absorbant.pro-tip. take two of these and lay them widthwise overlapping in the center of the bed. then take a third one and lay on top of those lengthwise. it seems you're using 3 but you'll rarely have to replace more than 1. maybe 2.diapers, or as they're known in polite society, briefs. definition time - in the industry what we think of as diapers are called briefs. what we would think of as pull-ups are called underwear. it doesn't have to make sense...the prevail per-fit 360 are far more absorbant than any other i ever found. easy to use too. buy a bigger size than you think you'll need.",1,This is a

"everything i've read online has not been productive, so i'm here, as it's been more of ""when someone's at a point of dementia where they can't eat"" but my grandma's more at ""point of dementia where she's stubborn about eating"". she's still fairly functional and cognitive, just very forgetful and her quality of life and cognition has gone down a bit.a bit of backstory is that she grew up poor and deep country and doesn't want to throw out food. she has consistently bought and kept food that she's forgotten she already has and will not throw it out, even when it's rotten and gone bad. she has gotten to the point she has around 40 jars of peanut butter stored. she will not eat any kind of meal, just makes peanut butter sandwich, but stockpiles ingredients anyway. the family doesn't live in her town or even state, we're all visiting for christmas, and we can't get her to eat most of what we cook, she just doesn't want to, says ""well i'm full already."" but then will eat a peanut butter sandwich instead of the food. it's all food she's eaten in the past, even prepared herself, it's not that she doesn't like it. she just won't eat it or make it.since i'm 3 states over, my uncle's family is 2 states up, and my dad's 3 states below her, there's not much proctoring we can do. we're all going to do sort of a tusken raid tomorrow and throw out all the expired food she has because it's gotten to a dangerous point with how moldy and rotten some of it is. i am concerned she's going to just buy more. i'm concerned she's just going to continue eating one peanut butter sandwich a day and call it good. i'm not sure what to do and i can't find anything to do. it's too rural of an area for any kind of meal plans or blue apron type thing, we've already looked.any and all advice would be well appreciated.",1,This is a

"i think she had one 6 weeks ago, and before that it was at 6 months.  she fights my dad every step of the way, tooth and nail.   well yesterday i'd had enough of her crap, and i just made this happen.  because i'm her daughter, she trusts me more.   she can barely walk with a walker due to the cartilage in her knees being completely gone, and knee replacement surgery while she's at this stage of alzheimer's doesn't make much sense, recovery-wise.   every step means severe pain for her.  it appears to be excruciating pain, she literally screams with every step.  it's difficult to know if she's in this much actual pain or if she's just behaving like a baby due to the alzheimer's. got her to the shower, and oh my god, it turned out to be fun!   scrubbed her itchy skin on her back with a stiff brush and fragrant soap and warm water, and she looooooooved it, so we did that for awhile!   after the shower i did her hair for her and it looked all smooth and pretty.    of course she looks in the mirror and goes ""i look like an ugly old lady"" which i totally disagree with.  she's still pretty.  i lotioned her up so her skin heals from the dryness, dressed her, got her downstairs, made her eggs over easy & toast with butter, and tons of fruit.  the past two days i've been there, she's eaten more than i've seen her eat in months and months.  maybe she'll gain back the 2 pounds she's recently lost...we need her to get back up there, weight-wise, she's only 75 pounds these days.anyway, when i'm doing these things with my mom, we talk, about things like scrambled eggs vs. eggs over easy and eggs over medium, and we talk about the ripeness of the blackberries and how good they are.   i tell her that i'm sorry the coffee came out so weak, i was just not used to her coffee maker, and she says ""no, i like the coffee, it's perfect, it's mild but still has a coffee flavor.""   it's these moments when i still feel like she's ""still there"".   i know that she's not really, but at the same time, i feel like she is, on some level.   i'm just happy that we had a full day of it.   i'm actually eternally grateful for that.    poor mom.    i'm also glad to have given my dad a full couple of days of a break.  poor dad!   i don't want to watch my dad work his 83 year old self into the grave.   so ultimately this post might serve to point out that i realize that when i take this kind of care with my mom, it's rather meditative and slow, and an exercise with being in-the-moment, i guess. i guess.  and why not take all the good feelings i can from this.  we deserve it!",1,This is a

"i''m wondering if people out there in redditland can provide some experience and advice on the transition of loved ones from private home to nursing / care home.my mother-in-law has been suffering from a form of dementia (tests are on going) for quite a few years.  she had been living alone since her husband died some 5 years ago and the disease has ever so slowly eating away at her independence and faculties.  a year ago my wife & i moved her from her home in ireland into a small house a few streets away from us (in england) so that we could be on-hand to provide company, assistance and care.  over the last 12 months those three things have changed in order of significance.  we have nurses & companions visiting two times a day to administer meds, food & company and we visit in the evenings after work to walk the dog, stock the fridge, talk and provide evening meal.  at the weekends we can devote much more time and do shopping trips and family meals.it is strange and stressful as someone becomes mentally younger as they get older.  the loss of language and understanding of fundamentals of life such as time and functions of things like cookers, tv remotes, telephones, showers, dog bowls..   yesterday i did a small shop to re-stock the fridge and set about fixing a non responsive tv (usually a two second job!). i said ""how about a cup of tea?"" and asked if the dog had been fed...  simple questions but what a disaster!last week she could have easily fed the dog but not now. she: (coming into the living room holding some gubbins from the bin) ""is this the thing?"" me: ""no, that's not it"" (it is old pasta parcels taken out of the bin where i put it a few days ago). ""let me show you where the dog food is.  that needs to go in the bin - it is not good for the dog""  she: ""oh"".  the pasta shapes fall out of the packaging and all over the floor.  the dog leaps onto them and starts eating them faster than i can pick them up.  they are mouldy and nasty!   i salvage what i can and drop them into the bin again.she: ""there's no...  i don't...  where's food?""me: ""here's the dog bowl and his food"" (pointing to dog bowl & food container on kitchen floor next to dog bed.)she: ""oh, but it is empty""me: ""no, it is filled with food"" (i open the lid & show the food)she: ""oh""i know she can do this - i've seen it many times.  i go back to the living room to work on the tv and return to the kitchen after a short while to see the food in the bowl and the dog eating it.   phew.   i get back to the tv.  now, normally the tv is not functioning because of socket being turned off or some such simplicity but not this time.  we have sound and channel change but no visuals.  i get stuck into this and after checking cables, batteries, sockets, input device and running through a few re-boots i determine that the backlight has gone and the tv is done-for.  dang.  the tv is vital companion for the periods where there is no carer.i go into the kitchen to explain that the tv is broken and that i'll have to pop out and get a new one but i arrive to see a disaster zone in the kitchen.  she has taken out one of the ready meals i had bought (a rather large fish pie) and hand-scooped and squished the contents into the dog bowl.  there is food all over the place!  it's all over the worktops, on her hands and up to her elbows, on her face...  she is busy trying to wipe everything clean with a kitchen cloth but basically speeding fish pie everywhere.   i gasp and let out an involuntary cry of dismay.she: (angrily): ""what's wrong?""me: (deadpan) ""ah, oh, er.. no.  erm, ok.""she: (very angrily) ""i'm giving him his dinner.  there is no dog food!""me: (in dismay).  ""but there is! here it is (shows dog food)""she: ""no, that is empty so i've fed him this and now i'm cleaning""me: ""right, ok""meanwhile the dog is getting stuck into a massive pile of fish pie.  she continues to wipe and wash things.  i check the fridge and see that in fact the fish pie is not the only foodstuff that has been opened.  there is prawn curry too.  so the dog has had crusty pasta, dog food, fish pie and some prawn curry in the space of an hour.  this is going to have an impact...so, things have rapidly changed over the last few months, weeks and days.  her behaviour has become increasingly irrational and we have definitely reached the point where a home with other residents and 24 hour nursing has to happen.  the only alternative is for one of us to give up work to become full-time carers or get a live-in carer but what she really needs is company and a safe environment - not being closeted up in her own home.  not that she will see it that way.  i foresee tantrums and difficulty.as if by magic our preferred nursing home (nicest, friendliest & they take pets!) advised a few days ago that our time on the waiting list is over and we can have a room next week.  we have said ""yes"" and will be moving her on on monday.  we know this will be a huge stressful event and are mulling over how we should announce it and perform it...  any experiences good / bad and advice would be gratefully received.    apologies for the diatribe - i couldn't stop it!&#x200b;summary: dementia getting worse.  what are the do's and don'ts of transferring to a specialist care home?",1,This is a

"i've been caretaking for my father who has fairly advanced parkinson's disease (pd) for a while now. he prefers to keep some autonomy, which can be helpful and take some of the burden off of myself and my family, but has it's own difficulties. as of the last year i've been more closely observing his water and nutritional intake and began to grow concerned about a few things, chiefly not drinking much water and having a very low protein intake.first step, i got a general idea of a minimum daily water intake, found an appropriate container and kept it simple: make sure you drink this entire container (~60 fl.oz.) of water a day to be in a fairly safe place. the next step, we started recording what foods he was eating so that we could enter them into a food tracker so that we could see information such as calories, macronutrients, etc. and have an idea of what needed to be adjusted. it was also a good excuse to get him to challenge himself physically and mentally by learning to input this information on a computer.well, we started. and then it all fell apart. all of a sudden he stops drinking enough water, and more-over, stops using the water jug set out specifically for him. his reason was, ""oh, i thought we were done tracking my water,"" even though nothing of the sort was ever even brought up. it was always intended as a permanent solution to ensure his hydration, but he just out of nowhere comes up with that.now he's drinking very little water, with the worst day recently being something around 16oz of fluid, which i find concerning. when i talk to him about this, there's always some reason or excuse. stuff like: ""well, when we first started tracking my water i was doing really well""""well, yesterday i drank enough water."" (usually not actually the case)""i thought i was doing well.""""i drank a lot of water today,"" (he hadn't, and if i show him the jug of water he finds another convenient excuse)""i didn't know we were still doing that.""""i didn't feel i had to.""""i'm working on it."" (x hours later he hasn't drank more than a sip of any liquid)when confronted with the facts, he just finds another excuse. if i show him how much water is left in the container, he ignores it and changes the subject. if cornered, he simply becomes upset and tries to disengage from the conversation.tracking food and nutrition is almost the same exact thing. he doesn't always meet caloric goals, and he's generally very low on protein. because of his condition with pd, musculature is a big deal since he doesn't have very much to begin with - he is a very small man and very low on weight with very little muscle to boot. he can't really afford to lose weight or muscle mass, but over the last year he's dropped a few pounds, and with his eating trends, it's concerning.reason doesn't seem to work. there's always an excuse. i want to be able to give him some sort of autonomy, but it's beginning to seem like that's simply not realistic. i'm not really sure how to handle this. i can't just force-feed him, and it feels wrong to tell him he has to sit at the dinner table and drink all of his water and eat all of his veggies before he can leave the table. i can't get him to eat or drink the way he should and there doesn't seem to be a way to make sure he's going to. so some support and advice on how some of you have tackled similar situations would be really helpful and appreciated. thanks.",1,This is a

(eg. she used to listen to classical music for hours but now does barely recognize any music and has even less an interest in listening to them. my dad is always the optimist and insists that her condition is better than it is. he will for instance insist that she still always knows where she is or that she still recognizes me, when in fact she stopped recognizing me (as well as him) years ago. but he also a lot more active than my mother and tries to keep up his lifestyle where he regularly travels between two homes and tends to two large gardens. he has hired a part-time carer to support him, but this is mostly to enable him to continue this lifestyle. eg. he takes the carer along to the second home as my mum is nearly unable to travel in a car as opposed to have the carer look after my mum in order to be able to spend a day or so away. the results are that i believe my mother is lacking some of the basic needs of care. i'm hoping to carefully address some of this on my next trip to see them. but as i only see her every two months or so, i'm not really clear what these basic needs are. i have worked on a list which i have added below.i'd be grateful for any feedback on this list, especially omissions and items that i should not concern myself with. i've tried to also list this in my priority order. medication: my mother needs medication 4 times a day. he is managing this and checking that she takes it. he prioritizes the prescribed medication over supplements that she has always taken. my concern is that some of these supplements (esp. st. john's wort) is known to reduce the effects of other medication and i keep asking him why he still wants to give it. my mother also rarely complains about pain at the moment but is habitually prescribed a painkiller (not a very strong one) and i want to address this with the prescribing doctor. liquid: my dad regularly checks that my mother is drinking, but he does not record the amounts. as my mother typically uses a straw, a lot of the water is left/discarded when it is refilled. i'm concerned she may not be drinking enough, though she had 16 refills, they were often far more than half full when discarding the previous drink. i'm trying to get him to record it so he can discuss with a doctor if she needs to be put on a drip. food: it has become very hard to feed my mother. i weighed her intake the last time i was visiting and she had about 80g of bread with ham in the morning as well as 100g of a stew. my parents only eat twice a day now (more about this is the schedule section). i'm trying to convince him to get a microwave as it clearly is too much for him to cook, alongside a delivery service. he tells me he often makes a soup that they have as the main meal for several days in a row. other family members have told me that a meal can be just a piece of cake.schedule: my dad is usually getting up at around 9 am and prepares the breakfast - which always involves getting fresh breadrolls from the bakery and setting a table with a variety of things, most of which remain untouched. he then gets dressed and then helps my mother to get up. on the days i did not get involved, we never had breakfast before 10:30 am and usually not before 11:30. the dinner between 4pm and 7pm and my mother usually goes to bed at 8pm then gets up at 10am, giving here a total of 14 hours in bed. my dad's schedule: my dad often is most productive after my mother is in bed and regularly does not sleep until 3 am. i've asked him to change this and try to get some sleep a little earlier. hygiene: my parents have always hated to shower, but used to go swimming. usually in the non-swimming season they would shower once every two weeks and otherwise wash themselves with a small facetowel. i've felt that this is completely inadequate and have urged him to get his shower changed to a wetroom so she can sit and shower regularly but i'm not sure if this is common. hygiene/clothing: my parents also always had issues with changing clothes regularly. my dad now gives her fresh underwear daily (i used to get scolded as a child for not weearing it 2-3 days), but her other clothes tend to be reused for often 1 week or more. i'm not sure what is common, but the clothes do stink and i felt incredibly uncomfortable around them. i want to prevent this getting to a level where a separation has to be forced, but i'm really looking out for advice how to best change this as well as what changes are the most urgent.",1,This is a 
"my father is in his late 70's and is starting to worsen with his dementia. i hate seeing that because my grandmother had it and it just makes me break down every time my mom talks about it. my question is this: i know there has been some research done on the effects of coffee and dementia. my parents have never been coffee drinkers (which is funny, because all 7 of us brothers and sisters are). if we were to introduce coffee into their daily routine, given that he already has signs of worsening and that he's never really drank coffee before, would it necessarily help? and if so, are we talking about black coffee here, or maybe a little half and half?",1,This is a 
"without getting too detailed i'm trying to find out if my mom has dementia or just major depressive disorder. my mom seemed to have rapid dementia come on in a matter of days concomitant with other issues (dementia happened a couple days before other diagnoses): anemia, low folic acid, low potassium, magnesium, intestinal ulcers, and ultimately breast cancer. there was also some alcohol usage before this but we dont know how much. that being said, it seemed like my mom went from being normal to having severe memory loss in a matter of days. after a few days she kept thinking her mom, who died 10 years ago, was still alive. unable to remember day of the week or what time it is. difficulty remembering things that happened more than 15 minutes ago and so forth. my mom also lost weight, but gained some back after being in the hospital for a month, and after a week in the hospital lost the ability to stand or walk. right now in rehab hospital as of a day ago. throughout all of this we had mris, ct scans etc. doctors did not find anything wrong w her brain as far as they could tell that's not normal for someone in their 60s. it's now been a month and her memory issues have only gotten worse. she keeps thinking she is in another state or that i live in another place. she sometimes forgets my name unless i grill her. the doctor basically told us dementia or alzheimers but could not give any details or a diagnosis of what stage she is at. this has all been extremely frustrating. i always thought these things came on relatively slowly. currently waiting on results of a final test to see if its paraneoplastic syndrome or a couple other things. upon getting her to the rehab hospital the main nurse said its possible it could be major depression coupled w extreme anxiety. i know my mom has been depressed for a while now, and shes always had bad anxiety. it's just i didnt realize and still have trouble believing that those conditions can cause such extreme cognitive deficit. they're ordering a full psych evaluation. i just wanted to post here to see if anyone has any insight. thanks",1,This is a

my grandmother hasn’t been officially diagnosed but every symptom she has is pointing to dementia/alzheimer’s. we go to the doctor next week but that’s not why i’m here. for the past 2 months my grandmother is convinced someone is coming into her apartment in the early morning and using her bathroom. she asked me if someone from her building would be coming in and i told her no and that she’s probably imagining it (her bathroom is in her bedroom so you’d physically have to walk past her). today she called again and asked if a family member of ours came in and slammed the doors and used her bathroom (she doesn’t have any family in the state except me). i am the only person with both keys to her apartment but this answer wasn’t good enough for her and she’s still convinced. do i stop arguing with her and trying to convince her these aren’t real and go along with her?  today i told her to prop a box of cereal against the door when she goes to bed so she could physically see the box wasn’t knocked over in the morning. i’m not a doctor nor psychologist so i’m not sure how to handle this.,1,This is a

"mom and stepdad lived next door for eight years.  i provided them their meals, and they would give their overweight dog about a third of their food.  they'd drop globs of it on the floor, or give him bites from their forks.  at first i asked them not to do that because at that time i cooked for ten adults, and if they did not want all of their portion, there were others in the home that would appreciate extra on their plates.  also, they had an awful roach problem in their home.  when i'd go over in the morning there would be a bunch of them around where they dropped food.  i eventually gave up.  i just shrunk their portions and kept their house as clean as possible.  well, stepdad died (87) and i moved mom (85) and her dog into my house.  when i bring her her meal, she starts to feed her dog immediately.  most of the time i pick up his 45 lbs and carry him into another room and shut the door.  i have three dogs, and they know that grandma will share her food, so then here they come.  we have asked her not to, and she sulks, or makes comments like it's a good thing she didn't starve me when i was small, or some such thing.  i suppose i could shut all the dogs away whenever food comes out, but i guess i'm just angry that it's come to that.",1,This is a

(oh just an aside she had a very 'clear' day.  she knew where she was and what she was doing.  i was looking forward to a good day with her) alright, weird, but alright.  but why do you have your makeup bag?

"my grandmother has been suffering from dementia for the past 3-4 years and it's progressively getting worse and worse. at first she was very aggressive, we had to lock her inside to be sure she won't do anything, she would open the fridge, turn on the tap, turn on the oven, she has been verbally abusing us, shame us, yell at us...the prescribed medications sometimes wouldn't even calm her a bit. right now she has basically the mind of a 2 year old kid, she barely speaks, mostly replies with yes and no's. you have to force her to eat anything that is not meat, sometimes i force feed her. she has urinary and fecal incontinence. i've been trying to explain to my father that she has to wear diapers all the time (he only put her diapers at night), because he thinks it's way easier to remind her to go to the toiled every half an hour. sometimes we bath her three times a day. she has also recently found out a way to take her diapers off and tear them off. sometimes she goes half naked outside. yesterday i was alone with her, she had to go to the toiled, but was too late. she had pooped in herself, i was yelling at her maybe for 10 minutes to take her clothes off so i can bath her, she tried to get a hold on me, but i pushed her away from me and she fell down on the tiles, everything was covered in feces, she managed to drag herself to the hall somehow, i was waiting for my dad to come for hour and a half so he can lift her as she is way to heavy and doesn't know how to rock herself up. he bathed her, i started cleaning everything, took the carpets out washed them, bleached them, pour hot water over them, repeated the same thing on the rest of the dirty place. today my boyfriend was here, we were having a lunch, right before i finish my meal she gets ups to go to the toiled, i set the food aside and go to see what is she doing, the couch, the other carpet, the wood it's all covered in feces, i go inside the toiled and i see her trying to wash her hands, she has pooped right before the sink. at this point i'm starting to loose my sanity, i swear i didn't care that my boyfriend is there, i started crying and yelling at her again to take her clothes off so i can shower her. i am having a breakdown i can't believe i will have to clean the whole thing all over again. my grandmother will not go to shower unless you assault her. i slapped her face, because she doesn't wanna listen, then my dad woke up from all the yelling and i start yelling at him to put diapers on her once already. again cleaning, bleaching, hot water...it's 2 am right now, i've been crying all day, i can't believe what am i doing, i am abusing her, i am hitting her. i have no strength to deal with this anymore. i used to hate my grandmother, she was abusive and she used to hate me, before she suffered from dementia. most days i feel very sorry for her, sometimes she stares at me with such a delusion when i yell at her and gives me that innocent child look that asks what have i done wrong? i understand that this is not her fault and she doesn't know any better. if someone told me before 5 years ago that i would feel sorry for my grandmother i would laugh, i loathed her, but watching her loosing her dignity this way was heartbreaking. i don't know how we will endure this, i feel so bad for my dad having to deal with this, he has been so nervous. i can't stand the yelling every morning, i haven't had a proper sleep since november. i am sick of this all and i feel like an abuser, i just want it to be over. i'm going to move out of the country soon. how will i let my father alone with this? this is so traumatic, we can't do it any longer. sorry this is probably all messy, but i just wanted to vent, i can't think straight today.",1,This is a 
"because of unfortunate circumstances, 1.5 years ago my brother (now27m) and i (now22f) became the primary caretakers of my mother (now58f) with early onset alzheimer's. she's currently towards the end of stage 4. she lives with us full time and we have a hired caregiver who comes in and assists her when we're at school/work. the issue: mom loves sugar and anything unhealthy for her. since mom has moved in with us she's definitely gained a bit of weight (nothing drastic, just enough to be noticeable). this is likely because she's now in a situation where she can afford to eat out or stop for ice cream, whatever. we are happy to make mom happy. after all, it is the little things, right? the thing is, at first she had a good balance. we kept a veggie and fruit tray fully stocked in the fridge and she would eat as much of that as she would anything else. but now she's gotten to the point where it's the same each day. breakfast: sugar filled coffee, pop tarts or a different sugary pastry. one time i came in to find her dipping oreos in her coffee. lunch: a local sandwich shop. she gets one loaded with beef and cheese and dressing and requests and second one for dinner. dinner: second greasy sandwich from earlier. she drinks 3+ cokes a day. lots of sweet tea too. we'll try and encourage her to drink water but she gets mad at us and says she drinks it constantly and we don't know what we're talking about, so most days we just leave it be. my concern: her bad eating is going to create more health problems that will ultimately cause her more stress. my question: how hard do we push? is it worth trying to create healthy eating habits at this point or do we just let her enjoy her time?",1,This is a

"my 83 year old grandma has been living with us for over 10 years and has alzheimers and diabetes. early on it was a real hassle trying to learn how to take care of her and deal with her illnesses but we've adapted and have a much easier living situation. fortunately my grandma still has strong verbal skills, can walk and is only forgetful of very short term events. the biggest dilemma with her is that she has become accustomed to jumping on every opportunity she has to sneak food from our kitchen fridge which is a problem as she doesn't combine normal meals and almost always go for carb heavy items which spikes her blood sugar to incredibly high levels. she won't hesitate to do this even after eating a full meal. we do have preventative measures in place which is primarily locking her door whenever no one is downstairs in the adjacent living room to supervise her. we end up feeling guilty for locking her door for so long that we end up leaving it open but she essentially waits for someone to walk upstairs and rushes to the fridge. though i realize her alzheimers can make her forget when she last ate and that her diabetes can cause her to feel hungry even has food in her stomach their have been many instances where we catch her sneaking food, ask her to put the food back and she proceeds to start eating it right in front of us until we forcibly remove it from her. her main target is often ice cream but we started keeping all of the very diabetic non-friendly food in the garage fridge which has a electronic keypad on it, this resulted in a multitude of unsuccessful attempts from her to access that fridge though she has succeeded on occasion when we forget to lock the garage door. it's these kind of events that tells me she willingly attempts to sneak food most of the time. i setup a small whiteboard next to her that i write down the time for every meal of the day and check whether she ate it. this has been helpful for her from what i can tell but it's questionable. on top of that i don't always remember to update as i'm not her sole caretaker and she sometimes misplaces the marker. no matter how many talks i have with her the one thing i seem incapable of changing are her food sneaking habits. i can understand if she forgets she ate recently but her food sneaking is very intentional. only passive security measures such as locks have been able to truly prevent her from sneaking food and even then only if we lock it which we sometimes forget. besides that the only other issue is her excessive knocking on her bedroom door. almost every time it's to inquire for her next meal which she likely already had recently. her balance has been getting slightly worse though this is most notable when she has low blood sugar which has led to some nasty falls. however through constant reassurance and reminders she now uses her walker regularly but even so still tends to fall with or without with blood sugar fluctuations. i make sure to be nearby when she has to travel through the house.",1,This is a

"catswearhats i work with clients like this frequently. the montessori tasks are great, such as the folding towels example. some of the others i have found successful are in this article: 1. prep tables with materials for activities such as puzzles, sorting exercises and other games. 2. lay out a basket of clean towels to fold. 3. have a basket of clean socks that need to be matched and folded. 4. put out a bin of plastic plumbing tubes that can be connected and put together. 5. for advanced dementia patients who may take comfort in holding dolls, a series of dolls and doll clothes can make for a pleasurable activity. 6. for those who enjoy cooking or baking, a safe kitchen environment and baking ingredients.  depending on the client, talking about their childhood can be successful. asking questions such as where were you born? did you grow up on a farm? and then go from there depending on their answers. simple oral quizzes, keeping in mind their level of functioning, is great too! we have whole binders where i work, but i'll see if i can find an example online... k like this: 1 a cake named after a baseball play2 president carter’s favorite cake3 integrated cake named after a stone4 cake that is like a babies5 a 16 ounce cakeanswers # 1 bunt cake # 2 peanut cake # 3 marble cake # 4 bottom cake # 5 pound cakei find that when all else fails, everybody loves taking about food. talk about what her favourite thing to cook is, does she like sweet or savoury? things like that.and in crisis moments, i find that validation therapy is effective. live in her world. if she is concerned about something, try to help her with it, validate that those feelings she is experiencing are real, before trying to redirect her to something else. if you have any additional questions or anything, feel free to pm me! i just came off a co-op rotation working with alzheimer's clients, and am still there on a part time basis while i compete my studies. it can be stressful at first in an environment like this, but you'll hit your stride and do great! :)",1,This is a

"i've seen comments from others with this problem . . . i'm  frustrated, hurt, and aggravated rn, so forgive me if this is all over the place.my mil (mid-70s) is in the beginning-ish stages of dementia. we have a neuro &amp; neuro-psych that she sees regularly. summer of 2020 after a car accident, her driving ability was medically evaluated (she's cleared to drive). though, fortunately, she doesn't drive much. she lives on her own. husband goes over at least once a week to hang out, do things around the house, and -important- to fill her pill box for the week (heart, bp, blood thinners, etc etc). home health aide comes once a week. she and i speak  once or twice a week for over an hour at a time. mil and her widowed neighbor speak every day on the phone and keep tabs on each other. she also texts dh every night when she's upstairs in her bedroom. she's physically frail. a hip replacement a few years ago (retirement happened at the same time), a knee replacement is in the works, and other joint/ arthritis issues. mil also doesn't have many friends &amp; the only real hobby she's ever had she can't do bc of arthritis in her hands. her gp - who sucks and i've nicknamed ""dr. feelgood"" - keeps giving her oxycodone for the pain (i know). she's become obsessed with it to the point she ends up misplacing it by putting it in ""safe"" places and forgetting etc. now, we get to the problem. she's always been someone who gets into her head and becomes anxious when she has too much time on her hands. this has obviously worsened.  she picked up her meds including oxycodone early this week. all the meds in their own paper bags etc. monday, dh went to do the thing, including dealing with getting all the meds our of their paper bags and putting them in her weekly am/pm pillbox. note: the oxy doesn't go in this pillbox. the next day, she and dh were texting all morning about missing oxy pills from the bottle. i didn't know this, so when he left for his daily walk, i called her to chat. we chatted for a while, i mentioned how the past 2 days had been terrible for migraine. next thing i know, she says ""this is going to sound accusatory."" explains how she's missing 21 pills and the only ""reasonable"" explanations could be that either the drug store screwed up or dh took them for me. i was pissed. but, calmly &amp; firmly told her that her son would never do that. i then hear her say ""oh, hi"" then to me ""he's here."" ok, not knowing this has been ongoing, i shoot dh a quick text about it.when he got home, he explained that he remembered there was a pill bottle lid that was on cock-eyed, so he went out to the garage garbage and found the bag that had all the paper bags from her scripts in it. he found about 15 loose oxy in one of the white paper bags. he brought them in, explained how he'd found them. she says (and the story changes) essentially she opened the oxy bag and bottle in the car ""to check it."" for what, who knows. whatever. he also bought a monthly pill box specifically for the oxy and split them all up. we think all is well. yesterday evening she calls. apparently, she'd been perseverating on this since tues afternoon and still thinks he took pills as there are still a few missing. he calmly tells her again what he'd done, how he'd found the missing pills &amp; that some may have made their way out of the paper bag into the actual garbage, and no, he didn't dig thru all that. nope, he took them. dh has the patience of a saint. he has to be extremely frustrated or hurt, to raise his voice. she knows this. he finally lost his cool and raised his voice to her/ yelled. it kind of snapped her back. he ended up telling her how he's very careful not to bring up the dementia often as reasons for things as he doesn't want to make her feel bad, but she needs to entertain the possibility that it's that. she seemed to take this to heart, it made sense, sincere apologies all around. 10 min later she texts about how she's going to go look in the garbage. fine. she didn't text last night before bed as she does every night. home health aid is there today, so we know she's fine otherwise the aid would have called. i know we've got to figure out something re: oxy and her behavior surrounding it. we're trying, but all the cajoling from us and her neuro changes nothing. her gp is old, seemingly doesn't care, and loves the sound of his own voice. she sees her neuro every 6 mths (all doc appts are with dh). fortunately, i also see this neuro and have a long established relationship. my next appt is soon &amp; i plan to talk to him too. all that to say, what do we do with all this? do we need to bring up the dementia sooner when she gets like this? she's not to the point where redirecting works. she's also a very intelligent woman who will not be ""handled.""  ack. apologies for the length of this  post.",1,This is a

"hi. i’m taking care of my 81 year old aunt who may have had a series of mini strokes or may just be developing dementia. i took her in to see her doctor because she wasn’t eating enough and was getting confused. so he put her on 15 mg of mirtrazapine which i thought was awesome. she started eating more, sleeping better and was just more like herself, although pretty groggy in the morning. a month later, she began taking nameda and she has been doing really well on that but, here’s the weird thing. she’s about 5’3” or 5’4” and weighs 155 pounds. when she first started developing confusion, i noticed she was better on days when she ate a lot — but it’s not like you can eat your way out of a stroke or dementia, right? can anyone think of a reason why my aunt does better on days when she eats a lot?  thanks.",1,This is a

"i'm living with my grandma, who has dementia at about a level 4/5... that is she can still dress herself and bathe herself, wash her own clothes etc. but any complicated task...preparing meals, paying bills, at times even counting... overwhelms and confuses her.  she is often uncertain about the day of the week and repeats herself endlessly within just a few minutes.  her short-term memory can be very bad, but her logic and reasoning skills aren't, she's very aware of what's going on around her, she even still drives because she's always aware of where she is and what the other cars around her are doing, just doesn't always remember where she's going unless you remind her.  she's never had an accident in her life.i have the feeling from reading this sub that i've moved in a lot earlier in the process than most people do... which is great in some ways as i can try to make her life as good as i can for as long as i can, but on the other hand i can't just do as i know is best for her either, a lot of times too it's easy to forget it's the disease because she's always been kind of contrary and resistant to anything new that she doesn't suggest herself, lol.  anyway, she has acid reflux really badly.  this is terrible, but it took me about a week to figure out what was even wrong, because she can be a bit of a hypochondriac... my mom had warned me about it, but it still took me a while to spot the pattern of whenever i went to church, or to spend time with my other grandparents, she would claim her stomach hurt as she either felt embarrassed to not want to attend church, or was jealous of me spending time away from her.   so last week when she said her stomach hurt, i didn't take her seriously and she went and checked herself into the emergency room.  she wanted to leave as soon as i got there, but i convinced her to stay until they finished all the tests.  they found nothing after five hours, and we went home.  but the next day, she was still saying her stomach hurt and then she said her throat was burning and i guessed it was acid reflux.  but she refuses to take tums or pepto bismal most of the time, she says it makes her sick to even look at.  same with water.  i've had to hide the instant coffee and soda, and it's torture trying to get her to eat anything plain, all she want to eat is candy.  which she can go out and buy herself.  she sundowns pretty badly and stays up all night  eating all the stuff you're not supposed to eat for acid reflux then is sick in the morning, both because she wants to lay on the couch and sleep, and because she can't sleep because her stomach hurts her too badly.  she can't understand what's causing the pain and thinks she's sick with an illness that i can catch, so she becomes upset with me being near her, and upset with the food i'm cooking for her because she ""can't eat"" because apparently good food and meds and water make her sick to her stomach to even look at.  another thing is she seems to be too hot and then too cold all the time, like every five minutes she's asking me to check the temperature, and then to either cover her up with a blanket or rolling up her sleeves and then her pants legs claiming she's burning up.  i try to keep the temp around 70, but whenever i leave and come back she's got it at 78 or 64.   i'm kinda at my wits' end here, both my mom and aunt live out of state and are counting on me to take care of her, but she is not allowing herself to be taken care of at all.",1,This is a

looking to see others experiences with issues swallowing. my grandma is stage 6 (maybe now moving into 7) and has aphasia (trouble speaking) and now we think she has progressed to dysphagia. a few weeks ago she seemed to aspirate on a french fry at dinner. luckily she seemed to cough it out (did back blows) and a few days later my mom took her to urgent care to get a chest x-ray. grandma was still wheezing. it came back clear and was told she is just shallow breathing and try having her do deep breaths a few times a day. yesterday i got a call from her senior center that she choked on a pea at lunch. it involved abdominal thrusts and back blows to have her clear it and stop coughing. maybe 30 mins later her coughing had calmed and she could speak. i was just wondering how others handled it. i saw they can do a swallow test. if your lo had to change their food consistency was it a fight? we have a family of 6 (including her) and i'm not sure if she would eat if her meal appears different than what everyone has. we are on the search for a facility this year just because her care is mounting and i'm getting burned out. and this is a new decline i'm dreading.,1,This is a 
my grandmother who has had dementia for the last two years and is rapidly getting worse has been saying she has a cold everyday for the last year. she is constantly wiping her nose that is not runny and just feels run down. we’ve decided it is just one of her things that she focuses on whether it’s real or not. is “being sick” a common thing dementia patients dwell on?,1,This is a

hi all. my dad's been suffering for a few years with dementia. he's probably at his worst in the evenings (sundowning). i try to take him out for a walk when i can but just wondering if anyone can advise anything else to try. he's on a bit of a cocktail of drugs which don't seem to be helping much. we thought maybe cbd oil might calm him but not sure if it's a good idea and might be too expensive without prescription. has anyone given a dementia sufferer cbd oil or found any other solution. thanks.,1,This is a 
"is this a common thing you all have encountered? my family member says foods she once liked now taste like garbage or she chews and chews til she realizes she just can't swallow, usually things like bread. she can often eat a burger patty but she takes off the bun because she has to chew for so long. sometimes she will throw up while eating if, according to her, she eats one bite too many. no doctors can figure out what is causing her nausea and gagging (she isn't choking on food, as far as i can tell) but i'm wondering if perhaps the dementia has begun affecting the part of her brain that controls gag reflex or stomach upset.she takes anti nausea pills and says they help but like i said, it's not always vomiting but just not being able to swallow foods she chews forever and spits back out. and the drastic change in taste. she basically doesn't like any food she once liked anymore so it's getting really hard to find things she will and can eat besides boost drinks.any experience with this or advice you can share with me?",1,This is a

"hi everyone. due to advanced dementia, my grandma needs 24/7 care which includes controlling when and what she eats. this means that we feed her at particular times every day, particular type of food (she has 0 teeth left). however, we have an issue: 1) she forgets whether she has eaten or not 2) i assume, her brain doesn't understand the feeling of being full anymore, and it seems like she is in a state of constant ""hunger"", even if she has just eaten a full meal 5 minutes ago. also, she would literally eat however much food you put on her plate, and i mean it - if she had access, she would just be eating everything non-stop in ridiculous amounts. she is roaming around and ""spying"" on us whenever we do something in the kitchen, thinking that we don't feed her. we started locking the kitchen cupboards, fridge, and the kitchen itself, because we have found her multiple times standing there and just eating plain bread in the middle of the night, etc. she never tells us that she is hungry, never asks for food, and always says ""no"" if you offer her more after she finishes her plate. but we can very clearly see that she thinks she is hungry all the time and thinks that she hasn't eaten anything for who knows how long. this makes it very hard for us to eat in peace because of her hiding around the corner and judging. it also means that we sometimes feel guilty and overfeed her. if anyone has a similar problem, how do you deal with it?",1,This is a 
"my mom is getting progressively more and more resistant to taking medication, especially in the evenings.we've moved what pills we can to other points in the day, but she absolutely has to take two trazodone pills just before bed, or she'll be a complete wreck the next day.the issues:trazodone is incredibly, incredibly bitter. they're ""coated,"" but it's a very thin coating that does nothing to keep the bitter taste sealed. afaik that's the only way it is available. we've been coating them in two additional coats of cake glaze (we tried a pill coat thing, but it was expensive and not great, and most pill-swallowing aids coat the mouth, not the pill, and if you think you're opening my mom's mouth and spraying stuff inside without all hell breaking loose, well...). that mostly works, except....she's started holding the pills in her mouth while swallowing her water. yeah that's right, she'll take the pill, drink the water, swallow, sit for a minute, and then spit out the pills. she's worse than my cats! due to her holding them in her mouth, the cake glaze dissolves and they're super bitter again; even though we'll give her new ones, she's more and more reluctant (understandably).she doesn't reliably eat dessert, so pudding is already iffy, and then the trazodone are so bitter that you really need excessive amounts of pudding to fully cover the taste. she has to take them right before bed, because they knock her out quick. i would be so grateful for any ideas about what to do.",1,This is a

"my grandma used to be an amazing cook and baker.  she suffers from dementia and isn’t able to cook, or even make her own coffee anymore.  despite her condition, every time she sees me she asks what can she cook for me. when i tell her that i’m fine, she insists. comically enough, when i sometimes accept her offer (just for laughs) she would say something along the lines of “just let me know how to make it, and i’ll do it for you!”.   before every birthday she would ask me which cake i would like, in addition to her usual gift.   she always told me that i shared her sweet-tooth, and would in fact bake two cakes. one for the birthday party itself to be shared with all of the guests, and one just for me- so i could continue enjoying it for days.   my favorite cake by far was her amazing banana cake. no one in the family is able to recreate her recipe, despite our best efforts.   iphones have this feature that every so often it would make a small montage of a few random pictures of videos. today a six years old video popped up. the video showed my mom and grandma working in the kitchen, and when my grandma looked up at the camera she said “working on your birthday cakes!”.   i just can’t believe how far she has changed in such a short time. she is still loving and funny, but honestly, it’s not the same person.  this dieses is awful. i believe that we have the best of it because we were able to get her a full time caretaker, and have her live just next door. it’s still unbelievably difficult seeing her bewildered  and confused eyes every so often. i just miss my grandma.",1,This is a

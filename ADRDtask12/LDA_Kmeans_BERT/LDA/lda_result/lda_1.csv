"hello, all! i've recently moved my mom into assisted living, which takes a significant load off of my shoulders. however, she recently experienced her first fire drill there, and long story short, the ear shattering noise added extra stress which put her into a fib. we asked if they could give us a heads up before fire drills so she could get out of the building, but it looks like that isn't going to happen. what can we use to block out the noise other than ear plugs? she really doesn't mind if she can hear it, but it's so loud that she'd like to avoid feeling like she is at a club. i'd love your tips. thanks!"," there are lots of options these days, they even make ones designed for just sleep. most of them are on the expensive side, but i think sony by far has the best noise canceling tech around. including cute features like filtering out voices.but if its as bad as you say, it might take something more robust like shooting earmuffs. all the sleep bands i've ever seen were just blutooth headphones so you could play music and they'd do some muffling on their own i think it be to weak fix it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/n2na9c/tips_on_noise_cancelling_headphones/,1,"hello, all! i've recently moved my mom into assisted living, which takes a significant load off of my shoulders. however, she recently experienced her first fire drill there, and long story short, the ear shattering noise added extra stress which put her into a fib. we asked if they could give us a heads up before fire drills so she could get out of the building, but it looks like that isn't going to happen. what can we use to block out the noise other than ear plugs? she really doesn't mind if she can hear it, but it's so loud that she'd like to avoid feeling like she is at a club. i'd love your tips. thanks!  there are lots of options these days, they even make ones designed for just sleep. most of them are on the expensive side, but i think sony by far has the best noise canceling tech around. including cute features like filtering out voices.but if its as bad as you say, it might take something more robust like shooting earmuffs. all the sleep bands i've ever seen were just blutooth headphones so you could play music and they'd do some muffling on their own i think it be to weak fix it.",1
"backstory: my grandpa is 83. he had a stroke over 30 years ago that left him disabled. since the late 80’s he’s chosen to be home bound. he hates shopping, crowds, getting in the car etc. he will only go to doctor or dentist but nowhere else. he is very out of touch with...everything lol. so this morning he’s frustrated with his cable. he wants to watch a specific show but he wants the option to pause it for bathroom breaks and fast forward through commercials. i explain his cable package doesn’t provide that. he doesn’t have or want to pay for the dvr function.i spent an entire hour going over his tv functions. showing him every possible way he could watch a specific movie or show. he either has to pay to rent, pay for the dvr function, or wait days in order to get it for free. so that brought us to the topic of streaming services. he wants what my husband and i watch (netflix/hulu/sling) but it wants it on his cable 😅 ?? he was so confused. he doesn’t understand the internet period. has never even had an email address or cell phone. it’s like explaining these things to a 2 year old. he just has no grasp on how the world works anymore. so now he’s frustrated. he thinks i’m pulling the wool over his eyes. he wants me to preform a miracle but it’s just not possible unless he forks up the money to his cable company. he does this with a lot of things actually. he still thinks the world runs as it did before he had a stroke, when things were a little more simple/cheap. sigh. it’s just hard. the generational gap in our home is so large. he thinks we lie but things are much more complex then he can understand anymore :/", i have similar issues trying to explain these things and i would get so distressed thinking it was a failure on my part. untill i just had a realization that it's never going to click so why stress them out and me. i never give like this but it has made life simpler.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/n19k2t/explaining_netflixhuluetc_to_someone_out_of_touch/,1,"backstory: my grandpa is 83. he had a stroke over 30 years ago that left him disabled. since the late 80’s he’s chosen to be home bound. he hates shopping, crowds, getting in the car etc. he will only go to doctor or dentist but nowhere else. he is very out of touch with...everything lol. so this morning he’s frustrated with his cable. he wants to watch a specific show but he wants the option to pause it for bathroom breaks and fast forward through commercials. i explain his cable package doesn’t provide that. he doesn’t have or want to pay for the dvr function.i spent an entire hour going over his tv functions. showing him every possible way he could watch a specific movie or show. he either has to pay to rent, pay for the dvr function, or wait days in order to get it for free. so that brought us to the topic of streaming services. he wants what my husband and i watch (netflix/hulu/sling) but it wants it on his cable 😅 ?? he was so confused. he doesn’t understand the internet period. has never even had an email address or cell phone. it’s like explaining these things to a 2 year old. he just has no grasp on how the world works anymore. so now he’s frustrated. he thinks i’m pulling the wool over his eyes. he wants me to preform a miracle but it’s just not possible unless he forks up the money to his cable company. he does this with a lot of things actually. he still thinks the world runs as it did before he had a stroke, when things were a little more simple/cheap. sigh. it’s just hard. the generational gap in our home is so large. he thinks we lie but things are much more complex then he can understand anymore :/  i have similar issues trying to explain these things and i would get so distressed thinking it was a failure on my part. untill i just had a realization that it's never going to click so why stress them out and me. i never give like this but it has made life simpler.",1
"hi! my niece took our car, and it had mom’s lift belt in it. i cannot get it back. i used the belt to help my mom in and out of cars (from a car seat to her walker or chair). can anyone recommend a replacement that i can order from amazon? also, mom is having a harder time getting out of her shower chair. even with wall handles. i have the chair at it’s maximum height setting, so i’m wondering how to get better traction for her feet. she hates the bath traction strips i put down and insists on having a towel under her feet which is too dangerous. she can only hoist herself up, just barely, from the right side. any slippers or other devices you can recommend would be helpful. we have a walk-in shower but i’m starting to wonder how many more weeks it will be practical for her. she can get into the shower fine. getting out is dicey.","here's a really basic gait belt similar to what you get from the hospital. i've found that the fancy ones with the hand grips and different features are too slippery and open up making it a fall risk.my dad uses this shower chair which sits much farther out so that he can sit while outside the shower, spin his legs around, and scoot over.also early on in his recovery my dad had issues lifting his legs and walking. this device helped him spin to sit and stand. it's basically a lazy susan for people. it does need someone to assist. she may not be able to do it on her own. there are a few good ones i found, i used the search term ""gait belt"" i dont have any personal experience with any of those, though. i'm wondering if some pool or water shoes would work for what you need for grip though. they can be fairly easy to get on and off, and pairs i've used in the past are pretty grippy. might be worth a look. crocs. they make slippers that work well for my dad as shower shoes. my preference for a gait belt is the one with various handles as it gives me more options by which to grip a patient without hurting them.as for showers, look into getting a transfer bench. i have one elderly, below the knee amputee and that is how i get her in and out of the shower.  the shower has a handheld so she can essentially rinse herself off, after i soap her up.   once she is out and dried, its up and back into the wheelchair. i have a ""security pole"" right outside the shower for her to grab on. and she wears shower shoes for better grip.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/mypssk/patient_transfer_beltsshower_shoes/,1,"hi! my niece took our car, and it had mom’s lift belt in it. i cannot get it back. i used the belt to help my mom in and out of cars (from a car seat to her walker or chair). can anyone recommend a replacement that i can order from amazon? also, mom is having a harder time getting out of her shower chair. even with wall handles. i have the chair at it’s maximum height setting, so i’m wondering how to get better traction for her feet. she hates the bath traction strips i put down and insists on having a towel under her feet which is too dangerous. she can only hoist herself up, just barely, from the right side. any slippers or other devices you can recommend would be helpful. we have a walk-in shower but i’m starting to wonder how many more weeks it will be practical for her. she can get into the shower fine. getting out is dicey. here's a really basic gait belt similar to what you get from the hospital. i've found that the fancy ones with the hand grips and different features are too slippery and open up making it a fall risk.my dad uses this shower chair which sits much farther out so that he can sit while outside the shower, spin his legs around, and scoot over.also early on in his recovery my dad had issues lifting his legs and walking. this device helped him spin to sit and stand. it's basically a lazy susan for people. it does need someone to assist. she may not be able to do it on her own. there are a few good ones i found, i used the search term ""gait belt"" i dont have any personal experience with any of those, though. i'm wondering if some pool or water shoes would work for what you need for grip though. they can be fairly easy to get on and off, and pairs i've used in the past are pretty grippy. might be worth a look. crocs. they make slippers that work well for my dad as shower shoes. my preference for a gait belt is the one with various handles as it gives me more options by which to grip a patient without hurting them.as for showers, look into getting a transfer bench. i have one elderly, below the knee amputee and that is how i get her in and out of the shower.  the shower has a handheld so she can essentially rinse herself off, after i soap her up.   once she is out and dried, its up and back into the wheelchair. i have a ""security pole"" right outside the shower for her to grab on. and she wears shower shoes for better grip.",1

something different? i remember seeing old posts over a year ago about doing this, wondering how those systems are working for others. thanks everyone.","i got a couple echo's for my parents' apartment and set up the emergency calling. if anything were to happen, they could shout at the echo for help and it would call, text, and alert me through the app. my parents could talk to me through the echo. i'm using a couple of blink mini cams now for more than six months. they can be set to motion trigger if armed, which i use at night to monitor for intrusion and also to make sure that my dad is getting up every day, or you can just use the phone app to pop in and view as needed. they also support 2 way audio which i was thinking could be helpful in the event of a fall -- i'd be able to announce that i'm calling for help, for example. this might or might not work ok for monitoring of a busier residence where you want to have video of what helpers are doing because it's not a continuous video monitoring solution -- it's better for more of a burst of activity solution. r/homesecuritysystems might have some better ideas for your specific situation. we have ring cameras set up for my 94yo mom and they're working pretty well - they detect motion.   my sister and i split the nights.  mom likes to put a cloth over the camera in her room for when she changes.  she also takes it into the bathroom with her, aims it at the wall, for when she showers - then we can listen in case she runs into trouble.  we have 4 cameras set up plus the ring doorbell (3bdrm, 3 level home).  however, my mom would not wear a medicalert neckless because she said that it kept calling for help when she didn't need help.  she really likes saying goodnight to us at bedtime. get a few wyze cameras (you can talk through them also, they allow memory cards so you can scrub the video ). they have different kinds. get a ring peep hole camera or door bell camera so you are alerted if he comes or goes. i got my father that morning ect. clock and he loves it. i'm a former executive director for assisted living. just a reminder that our seniors often struggle with both using and understanding alexa/echo. i've used my google home cameras and can broadcast/view my folks' house in florida from anywhere. accidents often happen in the bathroom, though, and no one wants a camera there!  :) some of the personal emergency companies have devices which will detect a fall and can alert ems. greatcall comes to mind, but i'm sure lifealert and others have options. fairly inexpensive (in the $50/mo range).  making sure he's wearing it, and keeping it charged, can be a problem.newer age tech involves audio rather than relying on video which has blind spots. artificial intelligence can learn his routine, recognize unusual sounds (including noticing that his voice seems distressed/happy, or there's an unknown person in the unit), and can alert the family. not sure if they're marketing to the public yet, but a particular product comes to mind. i know they're available through a home care company. if you're interested, i'll reach out and get more info for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/m1r3at/what_tech_should_i_get_to_keep_dad_safe_granny/,1,"dad is coming home in 2 days after almost two months in the hospital. he is going against everyone's advice and not moving into the main building where there is ample care, so what tech should i be looking for?

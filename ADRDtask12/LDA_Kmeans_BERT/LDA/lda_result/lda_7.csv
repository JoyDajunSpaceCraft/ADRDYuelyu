"hello all, something happened today that i found to be a bit weird and i'm looking for some opinions. first let me give some details. my grandma is the only close family member i have left. she is 92 and in pretty good shape (for her age). she has mild dementia, (not alz.) and needs daily help but not 0-24 supervision. i used to live at hers for a while but now i live at a rental. i call almost every day and visit her 3-4 days a week. i buy her food and stuff from the store. she has caregivers that are free for her because of a kind of support she has. mon-fri someone is here 10am-12, then then usually the lady in my story comes from 4pm-8pm and on weekends it's only the lady, like 2pm-8pm. she wears a button on her wrist that is connected to a box and on that she can could call for help any time. this level of supervision has always been enough so far luckily.let me say i don't know about the laws of caregiving for old people around the world, i'm from middle-europe and i'm not even sure how they work here. but i never fully trusted these people doing the caregiving and especially this lady seems to be egoistic and a bit shady sometimes. you know, the kind of people you talk to and seem kind but give a feeling that they aren't completely trustworthy. her bosses are in the same category. they are from a company hired by a foundation that deals with the type of support my grandma gets. they seem ok dealing with the daily works but i always had a feeling about this woman that she seemed a bit shady along with the entire company she works for... and i heard stories about caregivers trying to get what old people have... i don't know how and what, the flat is under my ownership (couldn't sell it in her life even if i wanted to, just own it) so it's her money that could people want somehow but the whole thing might just be my paranoia.... or just wanting to get her under guardianship since they have already tried this before but didn't succeed. she also made a fuss recently about not liking me getting into the arranging of grandma's medical stuff whenever i feel like it and either she deals with it 100% or gives it up and i have to deal with it 100%. i'm a bit short tempered and she got upset and we fought about this for like 2 hours (she didn't seem to understand that i didn't want to offend her and i had no intention of taking over grandma's medical stuff, just decided to call the doctor for the prescriptipons on an impulse) and after this i decided to avoid her from now on and only talk to her on the phone since i don't really like her personality.so grandma had to go to a new doctor today since her old neurologist resigned and the memory-psychiatrist she belongs to haven't seen her before due to the pandemic. but now she got both shots and the doctor refused to prescribe her meds any more without seeing her at least once. caregiver also said she should definetly go and today they went. the time wasn't good to me so i didn't go despite that i would have loved to be there in person. i called her after and they said everything was ok, her condition is ok still, took one of her pills away and she might not need to go again in the lack of a new problem. the caregiver then told me she came earlier today and so will leave earlier too, so i decided to also visit grandma today and got on a bus. when i got here i wanted to sit on a bench and smoke a cigarette still before i came up and that's when i noticed the caregiver lady across the street a few meters from the house holding a piece of paper and talking to the phone to someone (her boss, i assume). i think she didn't notice me so i tried to hear some of what she was talking about since i was pretty sure she was holding grandma's results from today and telling her boss about it. but of course when i crossed the street a bit further up and stood in the cover of a pillar, before i could have heared anything, she started to head home (i still think she didn't see me). i didn't want to follow her so i came up and was sure her result wasn't going to be here. she took one already before and said that was so she could call them for the meds (and got the appiontment then). but now all her meds are prescribed and still she took the paper. i called her to be sure and she acted like she left it in her bag and took it by accident and will return it next day. but i'm 99% sure she was acting and took it on purpose and i'm also pretty sure that's what she was holding and talking about to someome when i saw her by accident. regardless i said ""ok, i'll read it another day then"". is this normal or am i rightfully afraid that there is something shady going on? is there anyone she's allowed to tell the results to? don't know what's their agenda could

"so, i'm not sure if i (31) should be worried about this or not, as my mom gets older. my mom (55) is getting more and more aggressive behind the wheel. like, she can't drive without criticizing others or feeling like everyone is out to get her. she's started being less cautious about other drivers, insisting that she has the right of way and if she did get into an accident, she would be in the right. it's toxic to hear about how other drivers are terrible and she's the only person who knows how to operate a vehicle safely /s.example: today, mom and i ran errands and someone ran (or rolled) through a stop sign as we were making our way out of the parking lot (we did not have a stop sign and the guy was turning into the lane to get to the stores we went past). he didn't stop and she could see that. she clearly had enough time and space to stop, but even though the guy was clearly not stopping or even seemed to care about her 10 second horn toot, she kept moving forward as if she wanted to hit him (and parade around that she had the right of way and all). this isn't the only incident -- someone was obviously turning into a parking spot aisle and she rolled forward as the other car was turning. she's not wrong, i guess, but it just seems really aggressive to me and sometimes being right is more trouble than it is worth.my mantra for driving is to drive defensively -- if i was driving, i would have stopped immediately after seeing he didn't. it's like my mom is more interested in being ""right"" as opposed to being safe. i honestly don't feel comfortable driving with her because of her verbal aggression and tendency to put being ""right"" above being safe. i don't have a car of my own to drive -- a personal choice and possibly because of how unappealing she makes driving sound -- and she drives a stick anyway. i usually walk to where i need to go or use lyft which comes with its own set of issues, but i digress.anyway, am i overreacting or will this get worse as she gets older?"," next time she does something like that leave the car. doesn't matter where you are, leave immediately. take a lyft home.she may accidentally injure or kill someone with that aggressive bs.chances are the only way she might understand how serious it is is if you go nuclear.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/mjotov/increased_driving_aggression/,1,"so, i'm not sure if i (31) should be worried about this or not, as my mom gets older. my mom (55) is getting more and more aggressive behind the wheel. like, she can't drive without criticizing others or feeling like everyone is out to get her. she's started being less cautious about other drivers, insisting that she has the right of way and if she did get into an accident, she would be in the right. it's toxic to hear about how other drivers are terrible and she's the only person who knows how to operate a vehicle safely /s.example: today, mom and i ran errands and someone ran (or rolled) through a stop sign as we were making our way out of the parking lot (we did not have a stop sign and the guy was turning into the lane to get to the stores we went past). he didn't stop and she could see that. she clearly had enough time and space to stop, but even though the guy was clearly not stopping or even seemed to care about her 10 second horn toot, she kept moving forward as if she wanted to hit him (and parade around that she had the right of way and all). this isn't the only incident -- someone was obviously turning into a parking spot aisle and she rolled forward as the other car was turning. she's not wrong, i guess, but it just seems really aggressive to me and sometimes being right is more trouble than it is worth.my mantra for driving is to drive defensively -- if i was driving, i would have stopped immediately after seeing he didn't. it's like my mom is more interested in being ""right"" as opposed to being safe. i honestly don't feel comfortable driving with her because of her verbal aggression and tendency to put being ""right"" above being safe. i don't have a car of my own to drive -- a personal choice and possibly because of how unappealing she makes driving sound -- and she drives a stick anyway. i usually walk to where i need to go or use lyft which comes with its own set of issues, but i digress.anyway, am i overreacting or will this get worse as she gets older?  next time she does something like that leave the car. doesn't matter where you are, leave immediately. take a lyft home.she may accidentally injure or kill someone with that aggressive bs.chances are the only way she might understand how serious it is is if you go nuclear.",7

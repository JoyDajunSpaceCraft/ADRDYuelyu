"so this is my first and probably only post, (since i want to stop being so scared of this damn demon spawn!), but i have a question. my family has never had a history of dementia. my mother and her family members have told me over the years that the family line has never had dementia. my grandmother (whose's around 80 now) can recall stories from as far back as 1950. and according to my mom, my grandfather (who died 3 years before i was born) stayed alert and sharp until he passed away in his 90s. my ex father's family side also had no sign of dementia.&#x200b;but do i have a chance of getting dementia still? i've read that it's genetic but after listening to everywhere at the end of time, i've been terrified of dementia. i just wanna know if i'll have it or not, with the knowledge my family has given me."," by age 85, 50% of people have dementia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mkvuvx/i_have_a_question/,1,"so this is my first and probably only post, (since i want to stop being so scared of this damn demon spawn!), but i have a question. my family has never had a history of dementia. my mother and her family members have told me over the years that the family line has never had dementia. my grandmother (whose's around 80 now) can recall stories from as far back as 1950. and according to my mom, my grandfather (who died 3 years before i was born) stayed alert and sharp until he passed away in his 90s. my ex father's family side also had no sign of dementia.&#x200b;but do i have a chance of getting dementia still? i've read that it's genetic but after listening to everywhere at the end of time, i've been terrified of dementia. i just wanna know if i'll have it or not, with the knowledge my family has given me.  by age 85, 50% of people have dementia.",9

"hello, i'm working on writing a paper for school based around dementia. i havn't written a paper in years and i wanted to share what i have thus far. all of this is based around my personal experiences and what i've picked up on working with patients/residents who are suffering from dementia. after a few years of work experience in a couple nursing homes i am looking to use what i have learned to hopefully shine some light on what dementia is and how to interact and assist those who are affected.i have not had a chance to look up and fact check any of this yet as it's all just off the top of my head and annecotdal experience but i'm curious what some people who have family members with dementia think. thank you for your time, here's what i have so far.they're are many different types of dementia with 70% of cases being diagnosed as alzheimers while their is also lewy body dementia (dlb-dementia with lewy body), and vascular dementia. it is most common after the age of 65 but can happen in even earlier years, exessive alcohol intake is known to damage the pre-frontal cortex overtime which can lead to dementia even sooner such as in your 50's.dementia is a vast spectrum, every case of dementia is particularly unique to the individual as it is a very wide spectrum of both symptoms and behaviour stemming from the nature of the illness being brain failure in different regions of the brain. depending on which areas begin to shutdown will affect the behaviour of the patient, such as if the pre-frontal cortex is failing then executive functioning will suffer and the patient may start to have trouble communicating as well as staying focused on tasks.dementia is a blanket term that describes the progressive loss of brain function and issues may arise with simple tasks such as brushing teeth or remembering to flush the toilet as well complex tasks like remembering dates and managing money.dementia starts off slow and only  progressesivly worsens with age and time, never improving. although symptoms such as hallucinations, aggression and agitation can be managed with medication there is no known  reverse or cure currently. they're other ways besides medication that can help reduce symptoms such as music to help soothe the mind. appreciation and recognition of music is thought to be one of the last aspects of the mind to falter. often times people with dementia love listening to old time classics they enjoyed in their youth, and it is not uncommon for quiet classical music to be played when a resident is palliative and nearing end of life. converserly a quiet environment can also help reduce stress, as sensory overload from too much going on can be disorientating. physical contact like handholding when escorting someone somewhere can reaffirm a feeling of connection. although care must be taken as some residents/patients may be physically strong and unable to control their impulses and accidentally or intentionally hurt you. being a careaide has one of the highest risks of recieving injury, even greater than say being a police officer, a tree faller, a security bouncer etc. having a toy like say a baby doll, can help comfort the eldery as well having a tactile object to hold can help distract them as well as potentially bring back memories of a time when they had to nurture their own youth. a warm blanket can be a very powerful tool as when someone ages blood flows slower throughout the body causing many residents to be in a perpetual state of feeling chilled sometimes with even many layers of clothing on. some residents may prefer more simple shows such as cartoons intended for children as the plot is easier to follow, as well as shows about nature such as planet earth where there is no plot to follow but is instead relaxing.giving a resident with dementia small simple tasks can help stimulate their mind which helps slow the progression of the disease and give feelings of accomplishment. tasks such as folding laundry, or collecting dirty dishes or say setting a table for dinner can make a resident feel valuable/useful. we never lose our desire for agency, and oftentimes without a purpose we can fall prone to depression. this is still very true and perhaps even more relevant when one has a mental illness such as dementia. it is not uncommon for people with dementia to fall into depressive tendencies so we must make an effort at all times to help enrich their lives and remind them they are loved and not a burden.it's important to try and include someone with dementia in day to day living and still treat them as if they are an adult, even if parts of their mind is failing. ask how their day is going, if they like the weather outside, what type of food do they like, while remembering to try and keep the questions simple without much nuance.we can easily fall victim to assuming we are an authority figure over these people due to their constant need for care, such as needing help with showering, eating and having their meals cooked, changing clothing, being escorted to bed, etc. though the truth is that while we are their guardians and caregivers they are still an adult with their own sense of autonomy and while we may be at a job and in a hurry to complete it, this is their home and with that their progression of time will feel vastly different than ours.we can not forget these people have lived a very long life and still want to be treated with the dignity of being an adult. a mistake i often see is people saying the job is just like taking care of babies, or is as simple as ""wiping someone's ass"", this is a fallacy as a baby is fresh and new to the world, while an eldery person has been around a very long  time, longer than the caregiver for certain.in order to facilitate communication it is important to keep conversation simple and to the point. avoid long winded explanations and instead approach the patient in a calm and quiet manner and refer to the resident by their name as the name is one of the last things generally forgotten. ask yes or no questions and remember that body language is 80% of communication, so maintain eye contact and be assertive while speaking loudly, as much of the time they will be hard of hearing and ask you to repeat yourself. it's important to remain calm at all times and understand it may take rephrasing of questions in order to effectively get your point across.with the limited brain functions of the patient we need to not take things personally, we have no idea what is really going on in someone's mind and an outburst of rage may simply be because of a misunderstanding. i need to edit this quite a bit and move stuff around but i'm on my phone and waiting until i get on my laptop to switch stuff around. i'll need to end on some kind of note though i havn't decided how yet, of you've read this far thanks i really appreciate it. i hope i've made some sense in all this and you've

dementia. i havn't written a paper in years and i wanted to share what i have thus far. all of this is based around my personal experiences and what i've picked up on working with patients/residents who are suffering from dementia. after a few years of work experience in a couple nursing homes i am looking to use what i have learned to hopefully shine some light on what dementia is and how to interact and assist those who are affected.i have not had a chance to look up and fact check any of this yet as it's all just off the top of my head and annecotdal experience but i'm curious what some people who have family members with dementia think. thank you for your time, here's what i have so far.they're are many different types of dementia with 70% of cases being diagnosed as alzheimers while their is also lewy body dementia (dlb-dementia with lewy body), and vascular dementia. it is most common after the age of 65 but can happen in even earlier years, exessive alcohol intake is known to damage the pre-frontal cortex overtime which can lead to dementia even sooner such as in your 50's.dementia is a vast spectrum, every case of dementia is particularly unique to the individual as it is a very wide spectrum of both symptoms and behaviour stemming from the nature of the illness being brain failure in different regions of the brain. depending on which areas begin to shutdown will affect the behaviour of the patient, such as if the pre-frontal cortex is failing then executive functioning will suffer and the patient may start to have trouble communicating as well as staying focused on tasks.dementia is a blanket term that describes the progressive loss of brain function and issues may arise with simple tasks such as brushing teeth or remembering to flush the toilet as well complex tasks like remembering dates and managing money.dementia starts off slow and only  progressesivly worsens with age and time, never improving. although symptoms such as hallucinations, aggression and agitation can be managed with medication there is no known  reverse or cure currently. they're other ways besides medication that can help reduce symptoms such as music to help soothe the mind. appreciation and recognition of music is thought to be one of the last aspects of the mind to falter. often times people with dementia love listening to old time classics they enjoyed in their youth, and it is not uncommon for quiet classical music to be played when a resident is palliative and nearing end of life. converserly a quiet environment can also help reduce stress, as sensory overload from too much going on can be disorientating. physical contact like handholding when escorting someone somewhere can reaffirm a feeling of connection. although care must be taken as some residents/patients may be physically strong and unable to control their impulses and accidentally or intentionally hurt you. being a careaide has one of the highest risks of recieving injury, even greater than say being a police officer, a tree faller, a security bouncer etc. having a toy like say a baby doll, can help comfort the eldery as well having a tactile object to hold can help distract them as well as potentially bring back memories of a time when they had to nurture their own youth. a warm blanket can be a very powerful tool as when someone ages blood flows slower throughout the body causing many residents to be in a perpetual state of feeling chilled sometimes with even many layers of clothing on. some residents may prefer more simple shows such as cartoons intended for children as the plot is easier to follow, as well as shows about nature such as planet earth where there is no plot to follow but is instead relaxing.giving a resident with dementia small simple tasks can help stimulate their mind which helps slow the progression of the disease and give feelings of accomplishment. tasks such as folding laundry, or collecting dirty dishes or say setting a table for dinner can make a resident feel valuable/useful. we never lose our desire for agency, and oftentimes without a purpose we can fall prone to depression. this is still very true and perhaps even more relevant when one has a mental illness such as dementia. it is not uncommon for people with dementia to fall into depressive tendencies so we must make an effort at all times to help enrich their lives and remind them they are loved and not a burden.it's important to try and include someone with dementia in day to day living and still treat them as if they are an adult, even if parts of their mind is failing. ask how their day is going, if they like the weather outside, what type of food do they like, while remembering to try and keep the questions simple without much nuance.we can easily fall victim to assuming we are an authority figure over these people due to their constant need for care, such as needing help with showering, eating and having their meals cooked, changing clothing, being escorted to bed, etc. though the truth is that while we are their guardians and caregivers they are still an adult with their own sense of autonomy and while we may be at a job and in a hurry to complete it, this is their home and with that their progression of time will feel vastly different than ours.we can not forget these people have lived a very long life and still want to be treated with the dignity of being an adult. a mistake i often see is people saying the job is just like taking care of babies, or is as simple as ""wiping someone's ass"", this is a fallacy as a baby is fresh and new to the world, while an eldery person has been around a very long  time, longer than the caregiver for certain.in order to facilitate communication it is important to keep conversation simple and to the point. avoid long winded explanations and instead approach the patient in a calm and quiet manner and refer to the resident by their name as the name is one of the last things generally forgotten. ask yes or no questions and remember that body language is 80% of communication, so maintain eye contact and be assertive while speaking loudly, as much of the time they will be hard of hearing and ask you to repeat yourself. it's important to remain calm at all times and understand it may take rephrasing of questions in order to effectively get your point across.with the limited brain functions of the patient we need to not take things personally, we have no idea what is really going on in someone's mind and an outburst of rage may simply be because of a misunderstanding. i need to edit this quite a bit and move stuff around but i'm on my phone and waiting until i get on my laptop to switch stuff around. i'll need to end on some kind of note though i havn't decided how yet, of you've read this far thanks i really appreciate it. i hope i've made some sense in all this and you've learned something...also hoping its not just a tangential tangled  weave of confusing webs of word salad spat onto a page. thank you, and i wish you all lots of love. it can be incredibly draining and sad to see loved ones decline but they still have so much love and life left to give if there is someone there to receive it. were all a little lonely and desire connection ❤  truthfully i was unable to process most of what you wrote, but that is not surprising since i cannot understand most of what i am writing -- while i am writing it.  i write much better than understanding what i am reading, just as i speak much faster than what i understand the spoken word.did i see something about hallucinations.  i experience hallucinations along with a good percentage of my friends affected by lewy body dementia .  i wrote this on hallucinations, and it has been

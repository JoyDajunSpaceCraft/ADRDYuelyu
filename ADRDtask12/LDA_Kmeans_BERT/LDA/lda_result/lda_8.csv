"iâ€™m struggling with conflicting feels regarding my mom. i adore her. sheâ€™s a great person, funny, supportive, and well i could go on for hours. sheâ€™s my mom and i love her. but iâ€™m struggling because sheâ€™s so timid now. her physical health and depression have done a number on her. sheâ€™s almost like a beaten animal. her self-confidence is non-existent. she worked from home for many years  and now never wants to go out. she wonâ€™t ask for things because she doesnâ€™t want to ruffle any feather. at times iâ€™ve watched her literally recede into herself and it hurts my heart. because of her depression and low self esteem she hasnâ€™t taken care of herself in years. she just turned 62 but she looks like sheâ€™s in her 80s. sheâ€™s really self conscious of her weight and hair loss. but this is the south, many people are overweight. iâ€™ve tried taking her shopping and giving her some fashion advice for bigger women. but shes not comfortable because she just sees her fat. as for her hair, iâ€™ve tried buying her wigs. but sheâ€™s dissatisfied because they donâ€™t look like her. this is really hard for me to say, but iâ€™m embarrassed to show her off. i hate that i feel this way. sheâ€™s clearly struggling mentally and iâ€™m over here thinking these terrible things.i want to help her or at the very least be supportive. iâ€™ve tried doing little things to boost her confidence but it never works. i want to help her but i just donâ€™t know how. and itâ€™s starting to really get to me because i just want her to be confident and happy.", wait until she starts forgetting who you are,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nnya85/mom_lacks_any_confidence_and_its_hard_to_watch/,1,"iâ€™m struggling with conflicting feels regarding my mom. i adore her. sheâ€™s a great person, funny, supportive, and well i could go on for hours. sheâ€™s my mom and i love her. but iâ€™m struggling because sheâ€™s so timid now. her physical health and depression have done a number on her. sheâ€™s almost like a beaten animal. her self-confidence is non-existent. she worked from home for many years  and now never wants to go out. she wonâ€™t ask for things because she doesnâ€™t want to ruffle any feather. at times iâ€™ve watched her literally recede into herself and it hurts my heart. because of her depression and low self esteem she hasnâ€™t taken care of herself in years. she just turned 62 but she looks like sheâ€™s in her 80s. sheâ€™s really self conscious of her weight and hair loss. but this is the south, many people are overweight. iâ€™ve tried taking her shopping and giving her some fashion advice for bigger women. but shes not comfortable because she just sees her fat. as for her hair, iâ€™ve tried buying her wigs. but sheâ€™s dissatisfied because they donâ€™t look like her. this is really hard for me to say, but iâ€™m embarrassed to show her off. i hate that i feel this way. sheâ€™s clearly struggling mentally and iâ€™m over here thinking these terrible things.i want to help her or at the very least be supportive. iâ€™ve tried doing little things to boost her confidence but it never works. i want to help her but i just donâ€™t know how. and itâ€™s starting to really get to me because i just want her to be confident and happy.  wait until she starts forgetting who you are",8
"my (34f) wife (32f) decided to end treatment yesterday. she has been fighting cancer for the last 5 years. every treatment seemed to take a chunk of her with it, literally and figuratively. yesterday she was supposed to have her 4th brain surgery that wouldâ€™ve likely left her paralyzed on one side of her body and wouldâ€™ve given her maybe 8 more months to live. with out it she is looking at 2-6. at the last minute she made her decision. she made all 3 of her neurologists cry as she explained to them that the depression that comes after a surgery wouldnâ€™t be worth it at this point. one hugged us both and cried with us and told us she loved us. she just wants to relax into where she is at and let nature do what it does. she even comforted her nurse, who was at a loss for words and hadnâ€™t yet had this experience. my wife is an amazing loving person. i am a little at a loss myself. i also didnâ€™t want her to have to go through the aftermath of this surgery.. i love everything about this woman.."," powerful experience to have for everyone. im sure the words can only convey a portion of the experience you and your wife are having. as a professional, i see this myself from time to time. much respect to your wife for being brave enough and string enough to make such a choice. you will be in my thoughts and prayers for strength. im sorry life has gone this way for you two. ðŸ’™ if you ever feel the need to vent etc... pm",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nnpdju/its_happening/,1,"my (34f) wife (32f) decided to end treatment yesterday. she has been fighting cancer for the last 5 years. every treatment seemed to take a chunk of her with it, literally and figuratively. yesterday she was supposed to have her 4th brain surgery that wouldâ€™ve likely left her paralyzed on one side of her body and wouldâ€™ve given her maybe 8 more months to live. with out it she is looking at 2-6. at the last minute she made her decision. she made all 3 of her neurologists cry as she explained to them that the depression that comes after a surgery wouldnâ€™t be worth it at this point. one hugged us both and cried with us and told us she loved us. she just wants to relax into where she is at and let nature do what it does. she even comforted her nurse, who was at a loss for words and hadnâ€™t yet had this experience. my wife is an amazing loving person. i am a little at a loss myself. i also didnâ€™t want her to have to go through the aftermath of this surgery.. i love everything about this woman..  powerful experience to have for everyone. im sure the words can only convey a portion of the experience you and your wife are having. as a professional, i see this myself from time to time. much respect to your wife for being brave enough and string enough to make such a choice. you will be in my thoughts and prayers for strength. im sorry life has gone this way for you two. ðŸ’™ if you ever feel the need to vent etc... pm",8

"my great grandma passed this morning. she had a lot of health problems and we were already expecting it to happen within the next week or so. she was struggling extremely the past two weeks, not eating or drinking and having a really hard time breathing. my mom has been her primary caretaker for the past 5 years now. she was named after her and promised never to put her in a home and she succeeded. i took care of her sometimes, and today hit me really hard. i know sheâ€™s at peace now and not suffering, so that helps. feeling her cold hand and watching her body get wheeled out was devastating. iâ€™m not a very emotional person and neither is my father, but we both cried pretty hard. thereâ€™s a lot of family here who have been taking it even harder than us. however, my mom has not cried. sheâ€™s teared up but no crying at all. i know itâ€™s because sheâ€™s taking care of the memorial and such, but iâ€™m very worried about her. my (great)grandma has been a huge part of her life since she was a kid and especially since she started taking care of her. i guess my question is how can i comfort my mom when the death finally hits her. she hasnâ€™t fully processed it yet but i know sheâ€™s going to break down when she does, so if anyone has any tips as to how i can ease her pain that would be greatly appreciated.(tldr my great grandma passed. mom has been her caretaker for past 5 years. the death has not fully hit her yet. how can i comfort her when it does?)", i am so sorry for the passing of your grandma.. be helpful to your mom.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nitij3/today_i_lost_my_97yr_old_great_grandma/,1,"my great grandma passed this morning. she had a lot of health problems and we were already expecting it to happen within the next week or so. she was struggling extremely the past two weeks, not eating or drinking and having a really hard time breathing. my mom has been her primary caretaker for the past 5 years now. she was named after her and promised never to put her in a home and she succeeded. i took care of her sometimes, and today hit me really hard. i know sheâ€™s at peace now and not suffering, so that helps. feeling her cold hand and watching her body get wheeled out was devastating. iâ€™m not a very emotional person and neither is my father, but we both cried pretty hard. thereâ€™s a lot of family here who have been taking it even harder than us. however, my mom has not cried. sheâ€™s teared up but no crying at all. i know itâ€™s because sheâ€™s taking care of the memorial and such, but iâ€™m very worried about her. my (great)grandma has been a huge part of her life since she was a kid and especially since she started taking care of her. i guess my question is how can i comfort my mom when the death finally hits her. she hasnâ€™t fully processed it yet but i know sheâ€™s going to break down when she does, so if anyone has any tips as to how i can ease her pain that would be greatly appreciated.(tldr my great grandma passed. mom has been her caretaker for past 5 years. the death has not fully hit her yet. how can i comfort her when it does?)  i am so sorry for the passing of your grandma.. be helpful to your mom.",8

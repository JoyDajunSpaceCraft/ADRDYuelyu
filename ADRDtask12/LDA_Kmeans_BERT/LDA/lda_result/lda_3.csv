"i am the primary caregiver of an 83 year old female who appears to have abandoned all semblance of respect for family members and household helpmates. she regularly mocks the household nanny, treats children in the household in a vindictive and rude manner, and wants to do nothing the whole day. all she enjoys doing is cooking, and simply doesn’t have a daily routine. she wakes up, washes and dresses and essentially lays idle for the whole day. moreover, she does not want to engage in stimulating activities. i recently purchased her a box of trinkets: puzzles, knitting equipment, books, board games and painting items. she has used nothing i bought her and instead prefers to watch television and, dare i repeat it, be on the dole for the whole day. her table manners have slowly receded into nothingness, she blurts out things all the times, shouts randomly. please advise on ways to help her.", benadryl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nhxgvt/when_the_elderly_lose_mental_faculties_how_would/,1,"i am the primary caregiver of an 83 year old female who appears to have abandoned all semblance of respect for family members and household helpmates. she regularly mocks the household nanny, treats children in the household in a vindictive and rude manner, and wants to do nothing the whole day. all she enjoys doing is cooking, and simply doesn’t have a daily routine. she wakes up, washes and dresses and essentially lays idle for the whole day. moreover, she does not want to engage in stimulating activities. i recently purchased her a box of trinkets: puzzles, knitting equipment, books, board games and painting items. she has used nothing i bought her and instead prefers to watch television and, dare i repeat it, be on the dole for the whole day. her table manners have slowly receded into nothingness, she blurts out things all the times, shouts randomly. please advise on ways to help her.  benadryl",3

"i have a small business where i provide services to seniors. it's mostly just non-medical companionship. i love it, mostly. i was referred a new client last week and was with her for 2 hours on tuesday and 3 hours on wednesday. she's 65 and has cerebral palsy. she may have mild cognitive impairment. i'm not sure. she was asking me for tasks constantly during the 3 hours we were together. things like driving her to get a toy at mcd's, then a balloon, then to the drugstore to look for another toy, then to the library. we were driving for almost 2 hours making stops. when we got home, she was asking me to buy her 3 twelve packs of soda at the store near her condo, then helping her adjust bags in her closet, then sweeping the floor, then sorting her books. it was brutal. 3 hours with her literally felt like 9 hours with my other clients. it was grueling. her sister told me she has tried to set boundaries for her non-stop requests to no avail. how do you deal with nonstop requests for frivolous things?"," you can say ""we have time for two errands, then when we get home, we have time for 2 tasks."" she won't be able to comply at first, but after two errands, yo can say ""we did our two errands, so let's make a list for next time."" same with the tasks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/mru0fp/how_do_deal_with_frivolous_nonstop_requests_for/,1,"i have a small business where i provide services to seniors. it's mostly just non-medical companionship. i love it, mostly. i was referred a new client last week and was with her for 2 hours on tuesday and 3 hours on wednesday. she's 65 and has cerebral palsy. she may have mild cognitive impairment. i'm not sure. she was asking me for tasks constantly during the 3 hours we were together. things like driving her to get a toy at mcd's, then a balloon, then to the drugstore to look for another toy, then to the library. we were driving for almost 2 hours making stops. when we got home, she was asking me to buy her 3 twelve packs of soda at the store near her condo, then helping her adjust bags in her closet, then sweeping the floor, then sorting her books. it was brutal. 3 hours with her literally felt like 9 hours with my other clients. it was grueling. her sister told me she has tried to set boundaries for her non-stop requests to no avail. how do you deal with nonstop requests for frivolous things?  you can say ""we have time for two errands, then when we get home, we have time for 2 tasks."" she won't be able to comply at first, but after two errands, yo can say ""we did our two errands, so let's make a list for next time."" same with the tasks.",3

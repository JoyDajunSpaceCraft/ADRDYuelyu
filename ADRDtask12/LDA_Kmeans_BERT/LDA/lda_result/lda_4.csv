"my gran was moved to a memory care facility last year. she lived with us since 2014. when we cleaned out her mil suite attached to our house, we were left with containers upon containers of shit just thrown together that we didn't have the brainpower to organize at that time. ""i'll get to that later"". well, those boxes are taking up 40 sq ft of space in your basement, and ""later"" is looking a lot more like ""soon"".it's silly to jump into it without a plan. so i made you a plan. i developed your method. you have one less thing to think about now in this emotionally taxing project. get your coffee, and read through this guide. you're going to freakin' conquer this. let's make sense out of that chaos.here we go!determining the scopetake a gander at your stack of bins and boxes. take out each bin and rustle through it. focus on identifying what you’re going to be working with.example: for my gran, we had notes, paperwork, photographs, household items, “memories” (more on that later), and more fucking paperwork.number your containersthis will save your ass later and help keep you organized. number each box and tub. physically. write on those things with a thick ass sharpie “tub” or “box” and then a number. it doesn’t matter where the box came from. it doesn’t matter what order they’re in. just as long as you establish inventory, you’ll be grand.example: i have tub #1—tub #5 and box #1—box #6isolate one box & make roomtake out a container from the collection. place it in a comfortable spot where you have room to move around. you may be getting up and moving from place to place, so make sure your room is clean and clear of obstacles. a clean room is a must. put all the other containers in a separate area away from your organization room. trust me. if you look at it, it will only intimidate you.establishing categoriesyou know the term “when organizing, never touch anything twice”? that’s bullshit in this kind of project. we are taking this rollercoaster in steps. the purpose of, what i call “round 1”, is to separate trash from the important stuff, and put ‘like with like’.you’re going to make an area, preferably with another big empty container, for each category. here are the categories that will mostly encompass everything you’re bound to find in the hoard of miscellaneous small belongings thrown together at the end of a clear out.memoriesphotographspaperworkpaper memories“i have no idea”trashlet me go over each category.""photographs"". every photograph you can imagine. even the printed ones. not the ones in frames. if you want to be really progressive, keep the polaroids seperate from anything else. the two types of chemicals used in the processing of the types of film degrades both of them. portraits, cat pictures, garden pictures, the literal only picture of your great grandfather. all of them.""memories"". these are objects, artwork, books, etc. anything a person keeps for any reason until they leave the earth. or your house. a lot of them are only sentimental to the individual and don’t mean much to you. don’t evaluate this concept yet. focus, remember your categories. move along.""paperwork"". this is the serious shit. your boxes will. will. have paperwork that you do not know if you should keep or not. place every 'document' that is professional correspondence, medical records, housing inspections, homeowners insurance, receipts, etc, into one designated ""paperwork"" box. don't stress yourself out wondering what it actually is and if you actually need to keep it just yet. just determine if it's administrative paperwork or ""paperwork memories"" and sort it first.""paperwork memories"". this can sometimes be easy to determine, and sometimes it can be difficult. because in my gran's final year or so living with us, she clipped everything out of the newspaper from articles on bird care (she has no bird) to saving full page advertisements. there was also a lot... and i mean a lot of notes that she wrote down from day to day that don't make a lick of sense. a grocery list. the word ""hair"". someone's phone number. the name ""nick"". the name ""lenore"". notes from my mother who was her primary caretaker. notes that say ""i'm going to the store. i will be back by 2pm. i love you."". if in doubt, keep it. and go through it later. but these are still paper memories and go in the ""paper memories"" box. this also includes stuff that is obviously important and needs to be stored like college diplomas, yearbook pages, letters from loved ones, cards, etc.""i have no idea"". you will come across some shit that's just... weird. like you really won't have a single idea what to do with it. make a box for your confusion and come back to it way later.“trash” is anything you determine to be trash. if you don't need it, and it doesn't tell a story or represent your mother, let it go. you might not want the scribblings of your parent in their decline of mental capability. you may want to hold onto those pieces a little bit longer. that is absolutely okay.things you will need for sanityyou’re almost ready to go through your first container! you will need a couple of things to keep yourself organized.post-its (brand name. they stick much better)a couple of black sharpies. i say a couple because you will misplace it every single fucking time you put it down and you need to be able to pick up another while the first one is probably sitting under a pile of crap.buy at least 3 boxes of sandwich baggies (sealable) and 4 boxes of freezer baggies (gallon).a notebook on a clipboard and a hoard of pens.trash bags. get the good brand.white mailing labels.file foldersscotch tapeopening pandora’s boxonce you have all of your supplies within arm’s or leg’s reach, your organization room is clear, you have one container, and you’ve had your coffee… put on a playlist. pro tip: nothing sappy or sad. one sad tune is enough to keep you tunneled on a certain object for way too long and emotionally exhaust you enough to cut your organization day short.open the box. take a breath.when you come across any of these things, grab a gallon baggie, slap a blank mailing label on it, and grab a sharpiephotographs or polaroidsadmin paperworkpaper memoriesexample: baggie labeled “tub #1 – photographs” or “tub #1 – admin paperwork”the bulky important paperworkthis is something i learned the hard way. you’re going to come across certain things that take you a couple of minutes to figure out. and they will be bulky, but skirt the line between important admin paperwork and memories.for example: i found scatters of 400 pages of my gran’s book she published in 1998. it took me a good minute to accumulate all of the pages. and they just kept showing up in boxes. for like 3 days, that manuscript was its own category. i threw them all together in the end with the “paper memories” category.label. all. non-obvious. items.the term “when organizing, you should touch everything only once”, has a more important mental and psychological message, which is “when organizing, you should determine what something is, only once”.that folder in tub #3 that just says “west palm beach”. at first glance, you don’t know exactly what’s in that thing. could be anything, really. so take a look inside. grab a pen and a notebook on a clipboard. write down the contents of the folder.for example: on my notebook, the “west palm beach” folder had homeowners insurance, property tax assessments, receipts, email correspondences, inspection reports, final floorplan, and a couple of other things i don’t really remember.grab a post-it note, or a piece of paper big enough to tape onto the outside of the folder. write down, in sharpie, on the note, the contents of what is in that folder.why: when you go through the collection’s stack of paperwork during “round 2”, you won’t have to spend critical time and energy determining the contents of every folder. when you have big bold labels on stuff, you’re saving your brain from expending energy doing critical thinking later on. you really don’t want to have to pick up the same stack of “west palm beach” 3 times, and every time having to flip through it to figure out the contents. do the dirty work the first time, and you will save yourself the trouble later.use those baggies!so many things can fit into baggies! notes. tiny school portraits. business cards. newspaper articles. they can all fit into baggies! label the bag with a the container number they’re in along with the category they belong to, and fill those babies up!method established. work through your collection.go ahead and sort the rest of the containers into your designated categories.sort yourself as you sort their stuffnever let your piles become super crazy and unorganized. if you have a hoard of labeled baggies just sitting around without being put into their main category, take the time to place them there. it is really easy to let the process take over your entire room/house/life. don’t let it. clean as you work.rome wasn’t built in a dayremember:  it will take days, maybe even a few weeks, to go through every single thing. especially if you're getting rid of their clothes and food and dishes, furniture, etc as well. you may have put off the boxes and tubs because of the physical and mental and emotional exhaustion it creates. you need to give yourself breaks, remember to drink water, and remember to drop everything and come back to it if it's just getting to be too much for you. you have time. and the process takes time. so take. your. time.just as an aside: i really, really want to emphasize a practice of self-care that i had no idea existed until this: taking your time. it's easy to have a cup of coffee and rush through half a box, but you will be burned out, exhausted, and super irritable every single time. taking your time will help you be more organized and will let your brain go through the process with ease rather than make it feel like it's some sort of race. you will thank yourself. remember to eat. don't become too tunnel visioned. don't get too caught up in what you find. and do not try to create more categories unless you absolutely need to.“round 2”you will end up with containers filled with categories rather than containers filled with “uhhhhh”.the photo container will be a whole project within itself. save that baby for last.sit down with a category and start figuring out if you need to keep it, keep it and digitize it, shred it, or toss it. the digitization process is also another project within itself. if you determine you need to digitize a document, shove a label on it saying “digitize”, a label of description of the contents, and then put it in a new “digitize” category.i have a method for digitizing and organizing your documents that i will probably write up another time (i’m still doing this and figuring out a solid method. i’m not finished, and i won’t be for a while).like with likeput things related to each other in their own folder. in “paper memories”, you will need to determine sub-categories.example: “paper memories” went from a box of loose papers to \~7 sub-categories such as “phyllis’s education” “love letters from nick” “children’s artwork” “cards” “notes” and a couple others.another example: “paperwork” went from a box of loose papers to a crazy amount of sub-categories including “sale of west palm beach house” “medical records 2016” “receipts” “bank statements” “lawyer” “miss kitty’s vet records”, etc.bonus round: “photos”once you finish everything but the photographs, you can move to the photos. but you will have trained yourself enough through the first process to know how to sort the photos. and it's basically along the same lines as subcategorizing the other categories. i have about 2000 photos, and i think i have even more at the bottom of another box. so far, i have 34 categories of photos. everything from ""roeltgen family 1996 - 2006 sonora house, tx"" to ""cindy's wedding"" to ""strange photo tour of cindy's house"" to ""granny pre-1985"".i’m still working on photos. it’s a trip. but it is super rewarding.all in all…you will become much more comfortable with the entire sorting process the more you go through them. and it will get much, much easier.i wish you the best of luck. may the organization gods smile upon you. you’re not a robot. you will get through this. and i am so, so, so sorry for your loss."," you forgot one last rule: after you're done with mom's/dad's/gran's/gramp's stuff...organize your own.  get a file cabinet for the paperwork, because you may still be using it or need it.  and get your legal documents done while you're at it.  even before mom moved to assisted living, i did this with every paper i could find.  got photos, too.  but her ""stuff""?  with covid and distance (giving a time constraint), i didn't get to get her most of her stuff.  this led me and my husband to discuss what we would want--mainly the stuff in our living room and computer: framed photos and digitized photos, a few piece of furniture and shelves to hold the stuff on.  paperwork is already in a file cabinet, with legal and tax papers stored separately.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/mitm0u/making_sense_out_of_chaos_a_detailed_guide_on_how/,1,"my gran was moved to a memory care facility last

notes. tiny school portraits. business cards. newspaper articles. they can all fit into baggies! label the bag with a the container number they’re in along with the category they belong to, and fill those babies up!method established. work through your collection.go ahead and sort the rest of the containers into your designated categories.sort yourself as you sort their stuffnever let your piles become super crazy and unorganized. if you have a hoard of labeled baggies just sitting around without being put into their main category, take the time to place them there. it is really easy to let the process take over your entire room/house/life. don’t let it. clean as you work.rome wasn’t built in a dayremember: rome wasn't built in a day. it will take days, maybe even a few weeks, to go through every single thing. especially if you're getting rid of their clothes and food and dishes, furniture, etc as well. you may have put off the boxes and tubs because of the physical and mental and emotional exhaustion it creates. you need to give yourself breaks, remember to drink water, and remember to drop everything and come back to it if it's just getting to be too much for you. you have time. and the process takes time. so take. your. time.just as an aside: i really, really want to emphasize a practice of self-care that i had no idea existed until this: taking your time. it's easy to have a cup of coffee and rush through half a box, but you will be burned out, exhausted, and super irritable every single time. taking your time will help you be more organized and will let your brain go through the process with ease rather than make it feel like it's some sort of race. you will thank yourself. remember to eat. don't become too tunnel visioned. don't get too caught up in what you find. and do not try to create more categories unless you absolutely need to.“round 2”you will end up with containers filled with categories rather than containers filled with “uhhhhh”.the photo container will be a whole project within itself. save that baby for last.sit down with a category and start figuring out if you need to keep it, keep it and digitize it, shred it, or toss it. the digitization process is also another project within itself. if you determine you need to digitize a document, shove a label on it saying “digitize”, a label of description of the contents, and then put it in a new “digitize” category.i have a method for digitizing and organizing your documents that i will probably write up another time (i’m still doing this and figuring out a solid method. i’m not finished, and i won’t be for a while).like with likeput things related to each other in their own folder. in “paper memories”, you will need to determine sub-categories.example: “paper memories” went from a box of loose papers to \~7 sub-categories such as “phyllis’s education” “love letters from nick” “children’s artwork” “cards” “notes” and a couple others.another example: “paperwork” went from a box of loose papers to a crazy amount of sub-categories including “sale of west palm beach house” “medical records 2016” “receipts” “bank statements” “lawyer” “miss kitty’s vet records”, etc.bonus round: “photos”once you finish everything but the photographs, you can move to the photos. but you will have trained yourself enough through the first process to know how to sort the photos. and it's basically along the same lines as subcategorizing the other categories. i have about 2000 photos, and i think i have even more at the bottom of another box. so far, i have 34 categories of photos. everything from ""roeltgen family 1996 - 2006 sonora house, tx"" to ""cindy's wedding"" to ""strange photo tour of cindy's house"" to ""granny pre-1985"".i’m still working on photos. it’s a trip. but it is super rewarding.all in all…you will become much more comfortable with the entire sorting process the more you go through them. and it will get much, much easier.i wish you the best of luck. may the organization gods smile upon you. you’re not a robot. you will get through this. and i am so, so, so sorry for your loss.  i pick up montgomery’s card and actually finger it, for the sensation the card gives off to the pads of my fingers.“nice, huh?” price’s tone suggests he realizes i’m jealous.“yeah,” i say offhandedly, giving price the card like i don’t give a shit, but i’m finding it hard to swallow.___^(*bot. ask me who i can see.* |) [^(opt out)](",4

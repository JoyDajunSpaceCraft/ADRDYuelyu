"i know in my heart my dad has vascular dementia. i am a medical student in a family full of md's. we all agree.  he got covid in april and subsequently has descended into severe behavioral changes with cognitive decline. he is forgetting very basic things.  he has cerebral vasculitis confirmed by mri angiogram (post-covid).  he started cheating on my mom in june with a 35 year old (a few years older than me - his youngest daughter), divorced her in december after 33 years of marriage, moved to another state, and cannot keep a job due to angry outbursts. he is getting paranoid. he keeps thinking he can manage this with hyperbaric chambers and supplements. his reality testing is intact - he knows something is wrong - but refuses to take the appropriate treatment measures. &#x200b;the absolute hardest part is that my dad is and was so abusive. at 8: he threw baskteballs at me, physically abused me, made me live with a 16 year-old-exchange student despite catching him in my room in the middle of the night. he did not kick him out until he was caught being inappropriate with his friends 7 year old daughter. he would shake me and throw me as a kid. he bruised my 4'11"" year old sister. he made her eat pasta until she vomitted as punishment. he held  my foot in hot water while i cried because i ""need to recover as fast as possible so i could play basketball."" at physical therapy he turned the tens unit up as high as it could go on me and refused to turn it down despite my crying to please make it stop. he kicked me out of the house for telling the carpet cleaner to clean the wrong carpet. i went to drug rehab and he taunted me about how he never read the letters i wrote him. he financially and emotionally abused my mother. most people say i got the worst of it. he was obsessed with me playing basketball growing up. his favorite method of punishment was public humiliation. he would constantly threaten to abandon me. he was such a cruel father. he told me that all men would ever want from me is sex. in response to my sobriety, he has frequently told me that i shouldnt expect a congratulations for doing what i am supposed to do. when i moved back in with my parents after divorcing my abusive ex-husband, he mocked me for being afraid him of murdering me and made a rule that i should not talk about the divorced around him because i should just ""get over it."" he left me alone with coach known for preying on teenage girls. even after i told him i did not want to see him because he called me to drink with him. he tricked me into seeing him during a home visit from rehab. when i told him about being sexually assaulted and harrassed by a coworker he told me - i will never find a perfect working environment. trauma does not disappear because of his dementia. it does not undo all of the terrible things he did to me as a child. i do not want to live life in regret that i should or could have done more to help him but i also don't want to endanger my sobriety and mental health (bipolar disorder) by forcing myself into a positiion that re-traumatizes me and harms me. my mother is a saint and has said she will do what she can (go with him to doctors, help him get into a home if needed, etc.) because he is our father. sometimes i wish that he would just go away forever and end everyones suffering including his own."," in a similiar boat but its my mom that has dementia shes a saint love her to end of this world. my pops has been an alcoholic all his life only he never hurt me when i was younger he hurt my mom and  my oldest brother. about two or three years ago he punched me in the face he was drunk. so drunk (at the shop) that he could barley punch so it didnt hurt physically it did mentally.whats been bothering me is my moms sick with dementia. my pops is choosing to not be there metally (drunk) he literally has been drinking so much he was shitting in a pan in his bed like hes giving up he has no energry because he doesnt do anything but sit around and drink move from bed to chair. its just sucks because my mom didnt choose to have dementia but my father drinks like he doesnt want to be there, like hes drinking to not remember. like i know lifes not perfect but nothing comes out of drinking or using.i recently quit pot due to anxiety of idk everything and too add on top of that my brother that is older than me ( im the youngest the 4th) the 3rd my brother is startinh to be an alcoholic i can see my dad in him when he drinks, he also punched me in the face while drunk ironic right. that one hurt shit he was close to knocking me out. i didnt hit back as much as i wanted to im also taller n heavyer than him. earlier in that night that he punched me, he pushed me and he fell back hitting his head on the ground literally knocking his self out. it scared the fuck out me looking into eyes without life.so when ever hes drinks he scares me not just in a voilent way im worried about his own health like he will do somthing stuiped fighting the wrong person or whatever. he moved back home recently for other reasons but has been alot help with mom which is great i needed help. it just piss me off that all these people in my life choose to be  dysfunctional and mom didnt. ugh cryin while writing this. mans gonna fall off the planet when one of my parents passes i hate to say it but its gonna happen one day.i want to move out but mom needs me. at times i wish he didnt move back in but he helps with mom. just is scary when hes drunk. today i asked why hes drinking its sunday, and he got all up in my face like you got a problem. bottle a day since friday. he was stumbling when i got home at 4pm from beers n went out n got a bottle (gf drove him yay) yay life im struggling keeping my self sane. fmlanyways if you read all that thank you and im sorry i ranted that whole story. your not alone in the fight of life..... sane life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mf75dx/my_dad_apoe4_covidrelated_cerebrovasculitis/,1,"i know in my heart my dad has vascular dementia. i am a medical student in a family full of md's. we all agree.  he got covid in april and subsequently has descended into severe behavioral changes with cognitive decline. he is forgetting very basic things.  he has cerebral vasculitis confirmed by mri angiogram (post-covid).  he started cheating on my mom in june with a 35 year old (a few years older than me -

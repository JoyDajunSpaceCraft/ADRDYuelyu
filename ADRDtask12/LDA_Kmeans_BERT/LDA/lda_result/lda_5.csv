"my dad has dementia and requires complete around-the-clock care. i took care of him for 8 months without any help, until it made me so burned out/depressed that i had a mental breakdown. my mom stepped back in at this point and became his caregiver while i took a month off for myself. mom refused to put him in a nursing home up to this point.well--surprise!--mom got hurt while taking care of him, which meant i had no choice but to step back in. my mental health went right back to where it was previously. luckily, this time, mom agreed to put him in a care facility. i got the ball rolling on that. got him on hospice. it looked like he would be cleared for a facility soon.i booked him a respite stay at a nearby nursing home to give myself a little break. mom went to visit him during this time. she said it was heartbreaking to seem him in that state, and his eyes ""looked dead."" i rebutted that dad has severe dementia and is on hospice, and his care is beyond what we can provide at home... it's sad, but a nursing home is our best option right now. mom still decided that he will stay home, despite all my efforts.well, i've told her that i can't continue being his unpaid caregiver. i want to live my life and focus on my mental health. i'm tired of having this heavy burden on my shoulders--especially after trying to hard to set him up in a nursing home, only for mom to change her mind last minute. it's painful to set a boundary, but i had to do it.i still can't help but fill extremely guilty. my mom is not physically capable of caring for him properly, but she is incredibly stubborn. she will literally take care of him until she can no longer walk, and then i will have to figure out how to put two parents in a nursing home. it's incredibly frustrating. am i being terrible for refusing to help with dad's care?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nlw61t/am_i_wrong_for_refusing_to_take_care_of_my_father/,1,"my dad has dementia and requires complete around-the-clock care. i took care of him for 8 months without any help, until it made me so burned out/depressed that i had a mental breakdown. my mom stepped back in at this point and became his caregiver while i took a month off for myself. mom refused to put him in a nursing home up to this point.well--surprise!--mom got hurt while taking care of him, which meant i had no choice but to step back in. my mental health went right back to where it was previously. luckily, this time, mom agreed to put him in a care facility. i got the ball rolling on that. got him on hospice. it looked like he would be cleared for a facility soon.i booked him a respite stay at a nearby nursing home to give myself a little break. mom went to visit him during this time. she said it was heartbreaking to seem him in that state, and his eyes ""looked dead."" i rebutted that dad has severe dementia and is on hospice, and his care is beyond what we can provide at home... it's sad, but a nursing home is our best option right now. mom still decided that he will stay home, despite all my efforts.well, i've told her that i can't continue being his unpaid caregiver. i want to live my life and focus on my mental health. i'm tired of having this heavy burden on my shoulders--especially after trying to hard to set him up in a nursing home, only for mom to change her mind last minute. it's painful to set a boundary, but i had to do it.i still can't help but fill extremely guilty. my mom is not physically capable of caring for him properly, but she is incredibly stubborn. she will literally take care of him until she can no longer walk, and then i will have to figure out how to put two parents in a nursing home. it's incredibly frustrating. am i being terrible for refusing to help with dad's care?",5
"hello all. has anyone moved a loved one into memory care? wondering if having someone make a visit to the home for some backup is a possibility. i emailed a few places but currently waiting for a response. this is extra difficult as my mother never learned english, adding a whole new layer to the challenge. mother is incredibly difficult, (always has been, but more so now of course.) and convincing her that this is best is impossible for me. she sees me as the enemy, trying to ""get rid of her"". i've put in a good fight spanning over 10 years, but i am completely done. no job due to caring for her 24/7. mentally, and emotionally sick. physically, i am 47, but might as well be her age. any input would be greatly appreciated. take care, everyone."," what languages does your mom speak? are you in the us?you’re in a tough spot and i’m sorry. remember your mom doesn’t see you as the enemy; her condition sees you as the enemy. meaning, don’t take it personally when she says those things, bc it’s her condition and impaired mind talking.you deserve to have your own life and take care of yourself, don’t forget that too. if you’re in the us, try looking for a local “office of aging and disability” for help, assistance, anything as many counties have that office.perhaps if there’s a care facility that caters to an ethnolinguistic population , that would be great too if you can find one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nb1thj/convincing_mother_to_go_into_memory_care_i_know/,1,"hello all. has anyone moved a loved one into memory care? wondering if having someone make a visit to the home for some backup is a possibility. i emailed a few places but currently waiting for a response. this is extra difficult as my mother never learned english, adding a whole new layer to the challenge. mother is incredibly difficult, (always has been, but more so now of course.) and convincing her that this is best is impossible for me. she sees me as the enemy, trying to ""get rid of her"". i've put in a good fight spanning over 10 years, but i am completely done. no job due to caring for her 24/7. mentally, and emotionally sick. physically, i am 47, but might as well be her age. any input would be greatly appreciated. take care, everyone.  what languages does your mom speak? are you in the us?you’re in a tough spot and i’m sorry. remember your mom doesn’t see you as the enemy; her condition sees you as the enemy. meaning, don’t take it personally when she says those things, bc it’s her condition and impaired mind talking.you deserve to have your own life and take care of yourself, don’t forget that too. if you’re in the us, try looking for a local “office of aging and disability” for help, assistance, anything as many counties have that office.perhaps if there’s a care facility that caters to an ethnolinguistic population , that would be great too if you can find one.",5

"my 91-year-old mom has been to easter services probably every year of her life until now. she is not allowed out of her facility, which is once again on lockdown because of a positive covid case, and no one is allowed inside except employees. however, the administrator gave me permission to create a short, simplified easter service for the 25 people in the memory care unit. it's a 3-page service with the resurrection story from john, youtube hymns and matching lyric sheets, plus an abbreviated communion. one leader (activity director) can conduct the service. if anyone else would like to use this, i am happy to share this 7-page word document."," that is so sweet of you! my dad is 77 and in the later stages of als so i’m going to find him an online service, his little church doesn’t do online and he’s too weak to go. i’m so sorry she has to up back on lockdown, this will mean a lot to her and the other residents ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/mj32u0/easter_service_content_for_nursing_facilities_on/,1,"my 91-year-old mom has been to easter services probably every year of her life until now. she is not allowed out of her facility, which is once again on lockdown because of a positive covid case, and no one is allowed inside except employees. however, the administrator gave me permission to create a short, simplified easter service for the 25 people in the memory care unit. it's a 3-page service with the resurrection story from john, youtube hymns and matching lyric sheets, plus an abbreviated communion. one leader (activity director) can conduct the service. if anyone else would like to use this, i am happy to share this 7-page word document.  that is so sweet of you! my dad is 77 and in the later stages of als so i’m going to find him an online service, his little church doesn’t do online and he’s too weak to go. i’m so sorry she has to up back on lockdown, this will mean a lot to her and the other residents ❤️",5

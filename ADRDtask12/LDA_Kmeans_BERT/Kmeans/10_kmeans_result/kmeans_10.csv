"what is the best way to find in home care for elders in need of companions?  what should you expect to pay for 24/7 for a week at a time, rotate on 1 off 2?  what is a must to know or do in contract?  commercial providers or direct contract?  thanks in advance for your thoughts 😊"," it depends on what your need is. if 24/7 care is needed, then every other week wouldn't be very helpful. i think people usually start with just a couple hours a day, a couple days a week. ?then 8 hours a day if they need more. if there isn't a need for constant monitoring in the middle of the night. by the time you get to 3 shifts of constantly supervised 24/7 in-home care, the cost of it gets to be more than a nursing home or assisted living home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/mr4c3y/guidance_on_in_home_support/,1,"what is the best way to find in home care for elders in need of companions?  what should you expect to pay for 24/7 for a week at a time, rotate on 1 off 2?  what is a must to know or do in contract?  commercial providers or direct contract?  thanks in advance for your thoughts 😊  it depends on what your need is. if 24/7 care is needed, then every other week wouldn't be very helpful. i think people usually start with just a couple hours a day, a couple days a week. ?then 8 hours a day if they need more. if there isn't a need for constant monitoring in the middle of the night. by the time you get to 3 shifts of constantly supervised 24/7 in-home care, the cost of it gets to be more than a nursing home or assisted living home.",10
"hey all, firstly i want to show some love to all us caregivers doing the hardest job we've ever loved. shout out to the strength and vulnerability we all share here. secondly, does anyone have any advice or knowledge about assisted living when on either plan? my mom is declining rapidly and it's to the point that instead of living with me, i'm taking more care of her than i can handle as an only child working 15 hour days. she can do some thing independently and i'm totally willing to help her as i can. do her laundry, cook, shop for her, help her shower; but a nursing home will take a huge chunk of her quality of life away. she's only 65 and i really feel that she would be completely miserable there. we've had terrible experiences in nursing homes when she's gone for rehab from injuries and i really fear about that happening again. she's not one to speak up much because she ""doesn't want to get anyone in trouble"" however, i need my life back. i'm 31 and have been by her side for the last 5 years. i'm exhausted and truly can't see my life getting any better financially, emotionally or mentally; than hers if things stay this way . she just needs more and i'm lost on how to help.does going to a facility mean she loses her ssdi, car (as just an asset), life insurance and bank account? i don't want her to feel like everything has been ""taken"" from her because she truly is an angel and has worked so hard for so long to achieve goals. thank you for any and all help, i appreciate everyone!"," i've been looking into this and just doing my own research for my family. here's a [link with a few basics]( from the american council on aging, their site has a lot of information so that you can take a list of questions to an estate planner or elder law attorney to get it set up for you correctly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/mnigqb/help_understanding_medicaidmedicare_for_moms/,1,"hey all, firstly i want to show some love to all us caregivers doing the hardest job we've ever loved. shout out to the strength and vulnerability we all share here. secondly, does anyone have any advice or knowledge about assisted living when on either plan? my mom is declining rapidly and it's to the point that instead of living with me, i'm taking more care of her than i can handle as an only child working 15 hour days. she can do some thing independently and i'm totally willing to help her as i can. do her laundry, cook, shop for her, help her shower; but a nursing home will take a huge chunk of her quality of life away. she's only 65 and i really feel that she would be completely miserable there. we've had terrible experiences in nursing homes when she's gone for rehab from injuries and i really fear about that happening again. she's not one to speak up much because she ""doesn't want to get anyone in trouble"" however, i need my life back. i'm 31 and have been by her side for the last 5 years. i'm exhausted and truly can't see my life getting any better financially, emotionally or mentally; than hers if things stay this way . she just needs more and i'm lost on how to help.does going to a facility mean she loses her ssdi, car (as just an asset), life insurance and bank account? i don't want her to feel like everything has been ""taken"" from her because she truly is an angel and has worked so hard for so long to achieve goals. thank you for any and all help, i appreciate everyone!  i've been looking into this and just doing my own research for my family. here's a [link with a few basics]( from the american council on aging, their site has a lot of information so that you can take a list of questions to an estate planner or elder law attorney to get it set up for you correctly.",10

i'm looking to get a fitness tracker (or something like it) for my aunt. i want to keep track of her heart rate and sleeping when i'm not there. she doesn't have a smart phone but does have wifi. i would need something that i could look at the stats when i'm not there. any suggestions?,"not what you are asking for, but possibly helpful - we set up lots of cameras and door alarms and motion detectors so we would know if she went outside or fell. we also set up alexa dots in each room. we could drop in on her. we set reminders. we made signs telling her what to say. it all worked for a while. yes we have the alexa echo on two rooms, adding it to a third soon, just wanted her to get used to them. she's having a hard time remembering that she can get them to do things even with the signs, but she enjoys the old pictures and we can still drop in. what kind of cameras did you use? we have the issue that she's in an apartment so it's hard to wire anything in, and there aren't a lot of plugs/she tends to unplug things of she doesn't know what it is. plus she would flip if she knew we had cameras. we used the alexa to set reminders to drink and take her medicine. i set reminders that said what the day a d date were. i could use the alexa and the cameras to help her fix her remote and hang up the phone. as needs changed we adapted. they gave her independence and us peace of mind for a good while. now i have playlists that run all night. it keeps her anxiety down. we have wyze cams. they are inexpensive plug and plays. we told her they were alarms to keep anyone from getting in without us knowing. she didn’t really know they were cameras. they have little door alarms and motion detectors as well. occasionally she would unplug, but they soon became part of the background. i live with her now. i now have two cameras and bed alarms in her room. i keep my phone open showing her all night. if she trips an alarm i can look over and see if she is getting up, or starting to fall if the bed or whatever. sometimes she is just turning over. it saves me from getting up more than needed. good luck. great info, thank you so much! just a warning about wyze cams.  i read they have a greater delay in motion  notification then many cams.  i cant remember the delay time but for me it was too long as i had to know right away when my dad got out of bed due to medical reasons. we use a bed alarm as well. it works when wifi and electric is down. we try and have layers of protection. thanks, yeah we had looked into that too but he's all better on that medical issue fortunately.  that was a killer as i barely slept during that time.  hope you're not dying from the lack of sleep. the samsung galaxy watch 3 can operate without a cell phone nearby if you get a data plan and the lte model.  apple watch is another alternative though you need an iphone to set it up.  samsung watch can monitor sleeping habits and it can measure heart rate.  i'm not sure if it will send you an alert if the heart rate is irregular tho. it also has fall detection so if she falls, it'll notify  emergency services and you.    she still needs to wear it tho.theres also subscription emergency services which offer fall detection and if she pushes a button, a private company will speak with her and manage all emergency response.  the issue here with my dadnisnthatnwithndementia, i don't think he'll remember to push the button.i videotape my dads great room to make sure he ate his breakfast completely and if he didn't, i push him to eat more later in the day.  you can video and playback her sleeping if you want. do you have a suggestion for a camera? been having a hard time finding one that would work. she has a life alert type thing and has fallen or had issues but will not press it. she always thinks she's fine or she can figure it out herself and doesn't want to bother anyone for help. i've heard about the fall detection in smart watches and it seems great, but i don't have an iphone and we are trying to avoid another monthly fee, but i appreciate the suggestions! i suggest not eufy cameras if you are using alexa.  i cant trigger routines with the cameras when they detect motion.  i tried the blink mini too because i need routines but i had troubles getting the routines to work with those too even though they should have been seamless as they are amazon brand.i don't have a particular brand suggestion, but i do suggest you look for cameras that specifically can trigger routines if you think there might even be a slim chance you need routines triggered in the future.  also, if you think allowing multiple users to have different levels and times of access is important, id make sure the camera can do that as well. i want to higher a caregiver and give them camera access during certain hours of the day only.  but blink minis don't allow for different users and eufy cams allow different users but don't allow restrictions based on time of day.  although, i'm just getting an extra eufy came and then putting a smart plug in that turns the cam off during certain hours a day as a work around. miss cheaper than the more expensive cameras that can do all the stuff i want.fyi, ou can get samsung smart watch 3 and not get a data plan if you wanted.  i only suggested the data plan because if she left an area with wifi, then some of the watch functions wouldn't work but i think it should still work within wifi.    that doesn't require an iphone and you could just get the wifi version if you dont want a monthly fee.  do a little research on the watch if you choose to buy tho cause i haven't actually gotten it yet.just an fyi, the fee is just $10 a month typically  for data with most plans.  though like i said, if you're in wifi you don't need it.  $5 per month if you are on magenta or above plan on tmobile.  but yeah, i'm debating getting the plan myself (will research more later) as i don't have a magenta plan.  i'm going to get the lte version tho just in case i change my mind. good to know, i will definitely look into the samsung smart watch. thank you! i forgot to discuss cameras so i edited my last comment just as an fyi. i think what i can do is get a smart phone without a sim card and hook it up to the wifi at her place. then i can have the app for whatever fitness tracker i get on the phone and it will be able to upload the data from the tracker to the phone and then the data will be accessible online through whatever app the tracker links to. i'll have to do a little testing and some more research for which trackers upload to apps that are accessible remotely but i have some faith this will work i use my brain and a notebook. it's worked for several decades. that would work if someone was there all the time to check her heart rate, however there isn't. we've made sure her environment is safe for her and i'm just looking for something to give me peace of mind when i'm not there. well, why do you need (want) to keep track of it? i think it gets to a point where we impose this nonsense on ourselves and it isn't healthy.for example, my wife has dementia and she's going to die - maybe within the next year. is it necessary to know every blip and fart in real time? it isn't going to change the outcome. i'm very serious about that question as it takes a real effort to modify your thinking. i think i've taken a fairly hand off approach. my aunt wishes to remain in her home, living alone, until she dies. that may not be the actuality of it, but i'm going to do what i can to make that happen. knowing how much she's actually slept and what her heart rate is can help us guide her to get what she needs to feel better. she has blood pressure issues so being able to track it will let us know if bringing her to the doctor is necessary. i'm assuming that your wife is probably getting more constant care/supervision than my aunt is. we are lucky enough to have technology that can help us monitor her, thus keeping her in her own home for as long as possible. while it seems that you don't have any actual help with my question, i did figure it out on my own, using my brain, as you had suggested earlier. well, are you trying to avoid the use of a smartphone completely, or just avoiding her having one?

we have the issue that she's in an apartment so it's hard to wire anything in, and there aren't a lot of plugs/she tends to unplug things of she doesn't know what it is. plus she would flip if she knew we had cameras. we used the alexa to set reminders to drink and take her medicine. i set reminders that said what the day a d date were. i could use the alexa and the cameras to help her fix her remote and hang up the phone. as needs changed we adapted. they gave her independence and us peace of mind for a good while. now i have playlists that run all night. it keeps her anxiety down. we have wyze cams. they are inexpensive plug and plays. we told her they were alarms to keep anyone from getting in without us knowing. she didn’t really know they were cameras. they have little door alarms and motion detectors as well. occasionally she would unplug, but they soon became part of the background. i live with her now. i now have two cameras and bed alarms in her room. i keep my phone open showing her all night. if she trips an alarm i can look over and see if she is getting up, or starting to fall if the bed or whatever. sometimes she is just turning over. it saves me from getting up more than needed. good luck. great info, thank you so much! just a warning about wyze cams.  i read they have a greater delay in motion  notification then many cams.  i cant remember the delay time but for me it was too long as i had to know right away when my dad got out of bed due to medical reasons. we use a bed alarm as well. it works when wifi and electric is down. we try and have layers of protection. thanks, yeah we had looked into that too but he's all better on that medical issue fortunately.  that was a killer as i barely slept during that time.  hope you're not dying from the lack of sleep. the samsung galaxy watch 3 can operate without a cell phone nearby if you get a data plan and the lte model.  apple watch is another alternative though you need an iphone to set it up.  samsung watch can monitor sleeping habits and it can measure heart rate.  i'm not sure if it will send you an alert if the heart rate is irregular tho. it also has fall detection so if she falls, it'll notify  emergency services and you.    she still needs to wear it tho.theres also subscription emergency services which offer fall detection and if she pushes a button, a private company will speak with her and manage all emergency response.  the issue here with my dadnisnthatnwithndementia, i don't think he'll remember to push the button.i videotape my dads great room to make sure he ate his breakfast completely and if he didn't, i push him to eat more later in the day.  you can video and playback her sleeping if you want. do you have a suggestion for a camera? been having a hard time finding one that would work. she has a life alert type thing and has fallen or had issues but will not press it. she always thinks she's fine or she can figure it out herself and doesn't want to bother anyone for help. i've heard about the fall detection in smart watches and it seems great, but i don't have an iphone and we are trying to avoid another monthly fee, but i appreciate the suggestions! i suggest not eufy cameras if you are using alexa.  i cant trigger routines with the cameras when they detect motion.  i tried the blink mini too because i need routines but i had troubles getting the routines to work with those too even though they should have been seamless as they are amazon brand.i don't have a particular brand suggestion, but i do suggest you look for cameras that specifically can trigger routines if you think there might even be a slim chance you need routines triggered in the future.  also, if you think allowing multiple users to have different levels and times of access is important, id make sure the camera can do that as well. i want to higher a caregiver and give them camera access during certain hours of the day only.  but blink minis don't allow for different users and eufy cams allow different users but don't allow restrictions based on time of day.  although, i'm just getting an extra eufy came and then putting a smart plug in that turns the cam off during certain hours a day as a work around. miss cheaper than the more expensive cameras that can do all the stuff i want.fyi, ou can get samsung smart watch 3 and not get a data plan if you wanted.  i only suggested the data plan because if she left an area with wifi, then some of the watch functions wouldn't work but i think it should still work within wifi.    that doesn't require an iphone and you could just get the wifi version if you dont want a monthly fee.  do a little research on the watch if you choose to buy tho cause i haven't actually gotten it yet.just an fyi, the fee is just $10 a month typically  for data with most plans.  though like i said, if you're in wifi you don't need it.  $5 per month if you are on magenta or above plan on tmobile.  but yeah, i'm debating getting the plan myself (will research more later) as i don't have a magenta plan.  i'm going to get the lte version tho just in case i change my mind. good to know, i will definitely look into the samsung smart watch. thank you! i forgot to discuss cameras so i edited my last comment just as an fyi. i think what i can do is get a smart phone without a sim card and hook it up to the wifi at her place. then i can have the app for whatever fitness tracker i get on the phone and it will be able to upload the data from the tracker to the phone and then the data will be accessible online through whatever app the tracker links to. i'll have to do a little testing and some more research for which trackers upload to apps that are accessible remotely but i have some faith this will work i use my brain and a notebook. it's worked for several decades. that would work if someone was there all the time to check her heart rate, however there isn't. we've made sure her environment is safe for her and i'm just looking for something to give me peace of mind when i'm not there. well, why do you need (want) to keep track of it? i think it gets to a point where we impose this nonsense on ourselves and it isn't healthy.for example, my wife has dementia and she's going to die - maybe within the next year. is it necessary to know every blip and fart in real time? it isn't going to change the outcome. i'm very serious about that question as it takes a real effort to modify your thinking. i think i've taken a fairly hand off approach. my aunt wishes to remain in her home, living alone, until she dies. that may not be the actuality of it, but i'm going to do what i can to make that happen. knowing how much she's actually slept and what her heart rate is can help us guide her to get what she needs to feel better. she has blood pressure issues so being able to track it will let us know if bringing her to the doctor is necessary. i'm assuming that your wife is probably getting more constant care/supervision than my aunt is. we are lucky enough to have technology that can help us monitor her, thus keeping her in her own home for as long as possible. while it seems that you don't have any actual help with my question, i did figure it out on my own, using my brain, as you had suggested earlier. well, are you trying to avoid the use of a smartphone completely, or just avoiding her having one? if the latter you could pair an iwatch with your phone for remote access. i would trust any of the apple devices more than windows. the issue with that is it won't give the data real time because it needs the phone there in order to access the data on the watch. so i would only be getting data from the time i wasn't there. the issue we wanted to avoid was another monthly fee for a cellphone she won't use, buri think i figured out a work around, i posted it below",9

$30 per month. if purchasing this type of tracker, be wary of the low upfront prices. gps alert beacons:the most well known brand in this category is spot. these trackers are designed to work practically anywhere and are a great lifeline for hikers and outdoors enthusiasts. the're usually designed to only send out an alert if a button is pressed. they can also send prerecorded messages. great for outdoor sports, not great for elderly parents who will forget to press the sos button. expensive, but worth their weight in gold if you're hiking solo. gps trackers with motion sensing and regular interval position updatesthis last category use the same 2g/3g/4g networks as the real time trackers, but either only activate when they sense motion, or send regular less frequent updates about their position. these trackers are great for theft prevention and recovery, as well as tracking people. you won't get the picture perfect map of every step your mother's taken throughout her day, but you'll get a ping every few minutes. the biggest advantage here is that battery life can be extremely good. there are a handful of companies out there which make trackers like this, (disclaimer: my own included) and some are the right size/shape to be tied into clothing, slipped into a pocket or handbag. i think this is the category where you should be looking. are you based in the u.s. or u.k.?some of our customers are definitely using our trackers to keep an eye on their elderly parents/grandparents and, from what we've seen, they're working well. we didn't design specifically for this use, but i'm glad our products are helping families like this. as i don't know this subreddit's rules, i'm going to avoid linking to anywhere, but feel free to dm me or google my company. matt from invoxia i came here to ask this. i want to help my step father.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/llduii/best_gps_tracker/,1,"i'm looking around for a gps tracker for my elderly mother who adimently insists she wants to stay in her own house regardless of what it means for her and her health, but at night goes wandering becuase she dosen't know where she is.i want her to still have her own independence and go out in her own garden, but any further i'd like to be notified on my phone, as she's wandered off for miles before.which gps trackers have people on here had experience with. preferably a one i can put my own sim card into hi /u/william444555, i'm sorry to hear about your mother. that's a really rough situation to be in. my grandmother suffered from dementia throughout her 90s (she made it to 96!) although thankfully she didn't tend to wander. that balance between independence and security is really tricky.i know a bit about these things as i work for a company which makes gps trackers. maybe i can contribute to the discussion. *here's an overview of the different types of trackers on the market today.*bluetooth trackers: there are lots out there but the best known are tile and samsung's tag. they great for finding your keys when you've misplaced them at home. within a range of 30 or so yards, they can be incredibly accurate. as more and more people use them, you will also be able to locate your tile/tag remotely using data collected from passers-by. great for keys and small items you often misplace, not so great for vehicles or people. real time gps trackers: there is a pretty wide range of trackers in this category and most are focused on vehicle tracking. a large number of the cheaper options are the same 2 or 3 models rebranded and resold by different companies under different names.these trackers ether use 2g/3g (or rarely, 4g) networks to constantly update their location. for vehicles they can be hardwired in. however, outside of use in a vehicle, because they are updating all the time, their battery life is very short (or they use a massive battery to compensate). these sort of trackers are great for keeping an eye on your fleet of delivery vehicles to know where they are at every second, or for tracking your bike route across town. there are some wearable trackers (watches, etc.) which are mostly marketed for use with children that function in a similar way. again, battery life is the limiting factor and they typically need to be charged every day. many companies selling this type of tracker are looking to make a profit off the monthly subscription, and not the sale of the hardware. in the u.s. these subscription costs can range anywhere from $15 -

my mom is recently widowed and is nearly 80.  she wants to continue living alone where she is now but has asked me to research the devices that are worn around your neck and will alert others if a fall or accident.  any suggestions or types or service plans to consider?  thanks.,"i have  for my dad. luckily he hasn't needed to use it. the fall alert feature on it's own from what i was told by a few people is not worth it unless the family member falls all the time or has epilepsy or something like that.i do think lifealert is better becasue of faster response time. he used to have that but cancelled his plan when he went to assisted living for some time but they doubled their price so it's real expensive. the cheapest might be to get a wyze camera.  ask her not if she minds being spied on but if she would like a security camera, “for the living room”.  $25 for the camera, plus any internet connection, no month to month fees.  with sound enabled a yell from anywhere in a small house should be audible by the camera.  you can even tell her for privacy reasons that you’re leaving the audio off unless you don’t hear from her for a few hours.    or if she’s really into privacy you could put it by the front door and just use it as a security camera but still have the audio enabled in case she needs to yell for help.  just a thought.  only you and someone with an administrator password can login and view the video, it’s reasonably private, but of course do your own research.  good luck. wouldn't somebody have to be monitoring that, though? i would feel terrible if we had a camera like that, and grandma fell, but i was out all day running errands or something and missed it until i got back. oh yeah, for sure, but i find it at least as likely that a fall would incapacitate such a woman to a degree she couldn’t push a button, even one around her neck, in which case monitoring would be the way to go.  i think with all these things you have to weigh the pros and cons, and it definitely might not be for you.  that said there are motion detectors and if you know your mom regularly goes in and out of an area and that motion detector isn’t set off then you would get notified or not that she was moving.. there are also audible alerts.  good luck. yeah, i agree. plus, a lifealert doesn't help if somebody has a stroke, as my aunt did. yeah this seems like a terrible idea. my mil has a lifeline. touchy little bugger but at least we know it works. it is less than $100 a month. she had a hard time wearing it in the beginning, but now she wears it all the time. insurance covered one for my dad. i am a retired paramedic.  we responded all the time to calls from life alert.  they stayed on the box with the person until we arrived and then would ask us to reset the box when we were with the person.  i am now at the age that i am looking for one for me.  i am still active so i need one with gps.  don't have an answer for what is best, but i will say i have had lots of first-hand knowledge with life alert. she may be more comfortable with a watch. my dad had the necklace (inside) and the watch (outside). i looked at a bunch of these for my mom. i went with great call mobility device. it can be used outside the house. it's verizon service. if it's lost or broken, it's the cost of the device (under 100) and sign back up for the service. some companies don't tell you it could be hundreds of dollars to replace the device. it's easy to charge by laying it inside a charging untit. you can set it up on the computer with lots of details. i put a lockbox on the front gate with the hopse key in it. the service has the pin number for it and instructrions about the dog. we've stationed ring cameras around my mom's place.  they have motion sensors and we can look in on her from anywhere.  mom did not want to wear one of those devices.  she had one previously and didn't like it.   mom also has an emergency cell phone like this:  she does wear that on a lanyard apple watch has this feature. just fyi, my mother-in-law bought an apple watch just for this feature. it went off when she was making her bed, but then a couple of months later, she fell and broke her leg when she was outside with her dogs and it didn't go off. she had to yell to her practically deaf husband to come get her. it took a while. she doesn't trust it now anymore. there are other smartwatches out there that have an sos call function built-in, alongside fall detection.  i've not used any but have been researching it myself and seen a few interesting options out there.  so maybe worth still looking down this route, op. mil used the phillips alert service for many years before she passed. it worked very well in her rural area and was a reasonably priced monthly subscription. but she had to remember to  put the necklace on every day. in this months issue of consumer reports, that i read last night, they have reviewed and rated many of the health alert services, i'm at work so don't have the issue with me, but you may be able to see the report on line.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/l9trnq/device_around_neck_to_alert_of_falls/,1,"my mom is recently widowed and is nearly 80.  she wants to continue living alone where she is now but has asked me to research the devices that are worn around your neck and will alert others if a fall or accident.  any suggestions or types or service plans to consider?

my dad has very recently been diagnosed with alzheimer's. he is 63 and has never had any health issues before this so has never had to take regular medication.my mum passed away 6 years ago so he lives alone and unfortunately i live an hour away.he is struggling to remember to take medication. any solutions?we have a monthly pill box (i can't get home weekly so this is the best solution). we have amazon alexa with an alarm going off at 10am and he knows this is to remind him but he still doesn't go and take them.he's now changed medication and has to take one pill morning and evening which is now an issue as he doesn't remember the evening one.he won't accept outside help yet as he's literally only been diagnosed for 3 months and has barely even told his friends yet. also are there any groups or places you go to chat about your situation? i think i would like someone to chat to about it all as its happened all of a sudden and it's a lot to take in.thanks for any replied and apologies for the long post.,"we bought a round medelert off amazon. it has a lock and moves to the next section. when it moves to the section, an alarm goes off (it's loud) and it continues to go off until the unit is picked up and turned over or for 30 min. you wouldn't have to lock it, but we do because he has doubled up before. it works for us. this looks exactly what we need. thank you so much! there are several options including the one just mentioned. my dad uses the built-in alarm in his phone to tell him when to take meds. then his meds are arranged in a weekly pill box divided by morning and evening meds. he's not good at using his phone and sometimes it's not even switched on. i think the one mentioned above will be perfect. thanks for the advice. there are services that will call him when he's supposed to take his medicine and they can actually stay on the phone with him while he goes and gets the pills and takes them. many are part of insurance companies, so you might start there with a call to see if they offer the service. if your dad is able to use computer or ipad, i am very partial to www.dementiamentors.org , for us as persons living with dementia .  there is also video zoom chat as a family on harry's friday night chat with forget-me-not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l8w0uv/remembering_to_take_medication/,1,"my dad has very recently been diagnosed with alzheimer's. he is 63 and has never had any health issues before this so has never had to take regular medication.my mum passed away 6 years ago so he lives alone and unfortunately i live an hour away.he is struggling to remember to take medication. any solutions?we have a monthly pill box (i can't get home weekly so this is the best solution). we have amazon alexa with an alarm going off at 10am and he knows this is to remind him but he still doesn't go and take them.he's now changed medication and has to take one pill morning and evening which is now an issue as he doesn't remember the evening one.he won't accept outside help yet as he's literally only been diagnosed for 3 months and has barely even told his friends yet. also are there any groups or places you go to chat about your situation? i think i would like someone to chat to about it all as its happened all of a sudden and it's a lot to take in.thanks for any replied and apologies for the long post. we bought a round medelert off amazon. it has a lock and moves to the next section. when it moves to the section, an alarm goes off (it's loud) and it continues to go off until the unit is picked up and turned over or for 30 min. you wouldn't have to lock it, but we do because he has doubled up before. it works for us. this looks exactly what we need. thank you so much! there are several options including the one just mentioned. my dad uses the built-in alarm in his phone to tell him when to take meds. then his meds are arranged in a weekly pill box divided by morning and evening meds. he's not good at using his phone and sometimes it's not even switched on. i think the one mentioned above will be perfect. thanks for the advice. there are services that will call him when he's supposed to take his medicine and they can actually stay on the phone with him while he goes and gets the pills and takes them. many are part of insurance companies, so you might start there with a call to see if they offer the service. if your dad is able to use computer or ipad, i am very partial to www.dementiamentors.org , for us as persons living with dementia .  there is also video zoom chat as a family on harry's friday night chat with forget-me-not.",9

"i again went down the rabbit hole looking for an explanation to suffering from insomnia for 3 years now. the didn't really find anything as always. 3 years ago two things happened, my spouse broke her leg and thus needed much more support. i had a procedure to fix chronic pain, that just gave me new chronic pain that started out sever enough to keep me up at night but since has become more irritating than anything else.  so i'm not sure what triggered this insomnia, do others who are technically on call 24/7 have sleep issues? my spouse almost never asks anything of me during sleep time so there's no logical reason for me to be on alert but i wake up every 1.5 hours and bound out of bed like i'm late for work only to do basically nothing.&#x200b;i used to fall asleep in 10 seconds and sleep through the urban soundscape and only wake for distinct clear voices. so insomnia is the polar opposite of where i was 3 years ago."," stress and noise do it for me.  i bought a fan to block out noise since my dad likes to pray aloud.  that is what i do: stay in the moment.  (i try).  an evening walk helps my sleep as does a warm beverage (chai tea or golden milk); my wind machine fan is great.  certain medications used to cause insomnia but i don't take them anymore.  hypervigilence is something i have to keep in check because this can be a problem too with caregiving, always aware of what is going on to be ready to help.  the worry that comes with caring for an elderly parent: listening and being constantly vigilant. maybe you feel that too?  being a dutiful caregiver requires awareness, attention and action.  this can rev up the central nervous system.  adrenaline rush.  deep restorative sleep is so important: i hope you can have a full night's rest and get back to good sleep!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nknrr2/how_common_is_insomnia_for_live_in_caregivers/,1,"i again went down the rabbit hole looking for an explanation to suffering from insomnia for 3 years now. the didn't really find anything as always. 3 years ago two things happened, my spouse broke her leg and thus needed much more support. i had a procedure to fix chronic pain, that just gave me new chronic pain that started out sever enough to keep me up at night but since has become more irritating than anything else.  so i'm not sure what triggered this insomnia, do others who are technically on call 24/7 have sleep issues? my spouse almost never asks anything of me during sleep time so there's no logical reason for me to be on alert but i wake up every 1.5 hours and bound out of bed like i'm late for work only to do basically nothing.&#x200b;i used to fall asleep in 10 seconds and sleep through the urban soundscape and only wake for distinct clear voices. so insomnia is the polar opposite of where i was 3 years ago.  stress and noise do it for me.  i bought a fan to block out noise since my dad likes to pray aloud.  that is what i do: stay in the moment.

"hi all, my mum is suffering with symptoms of dementia. she refuses to do any tests to confirm whether or not she has it, but it's looking quite certain that it is dementia. she has trouble with short-term memory, but currently her long-term memory is fine. my dad looks after her.it's got to the point where she's refusing to eat, sleep, or take her medication. she has terminal cancer and it causes her a lot of pain, which she is able to express. but she won't take the painkillers to reduce to the pain, and her sleep is very interrupted which makes everything much harder. when she talks, it doesn't make much sense at the moment. she thinks that people are stealing her things, and has started telling off the nurses who come and change her dressing every few days. she walks around the house a lot because she can't sit still anymore, but isn't able to walk too far outside - and wouldn't be able to do this on her own. basically i'm just looking for advice - is there some way i can get her to take her medicine? some of it is in tablet form, others are in liquid form. this will help with sleep and pain, so hopefully once these things are sorted her appetite should come back, and she'll feel a bit better. when she's like this she gets some kind of anxious tick where she pulls at her dressing - i would really like to either stop this tick completely, or at least redirect it to something with no negative consequences (she needs to keep the dressing on). any kind of stress seems to exacerbate her dementia symptoms. looking for literally any tips to help deal with this!"," unfortunately, i am experienced enough to have any helpful advice. but i just wanted to encourage you to stay strong though this process. wish you the best",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mgrmy1/looking_for_some_advice/,1,"hi all, my mum is suffering with symptoms of dementia. she refuses to do any tests to confirm whether or not she has it, but it's looking quite certain that it is dementia. she has trouble with short-term memory, but currently her long-term memory is fine. my dad looks after her.it's got to the point where she's refusing to eat, sleep, or take her medication. she has terminal cancer and it causes her a lot of pain, which she is able to express. but she won't take the painkillers to reduce to the pain, and her sleep is very interrupted which makes everything much harder. when she talks, it doesn't make much sense at the moment. she thinks that people are stealing her things, and has started telling off the nurses who come and change her dressing every few days. she walks around the house a lot because she can't sit still anymore, but isn't able to walk too far outside - and wouldn't be able to do this on her own. basically i'm just looking for advice - is there some way i can get her to take her medicine? some of it is in tablet form, others are in liquid form. this will help with sleep and pain, so hopefully once these things are sorted her appetite should come back, and she'll feel a bit better. when she's like this she gets some kind of anxious tick where she pulls at her dressing - i would really like to either stop this tick completely, or at least redirect it to something with no negative consequences (she needs to keep the dressing on). any kind of stress seems to exacerbate her dementia symptoms. looking for literally any tips to help deal with this!  unfortunately, i am experienced enough to have any helpful advice. but i just wanted to encourage you to stay strong though this process. wish you the best",11
"so this is a bit of an update from my last post. 2 people in my family got sick from their 2nd vaccine shot. step dad, and step grandmother (the patient) this was expected so i managed to plan it out where my sister helped back me for the next few nights and assist so i dont end up having a melt down from the work and lack of sleep. first night was a nightmare. my grandmother was throwing up the entire night so i didnt get a wink of sleep. unfortunately for my stepdad, he had a dizzy spell and fell in the bathroom at 6 am in the morning. luckily, all he got was a bruise forehead and i assisted him back to bed. my sister came around 2 pm to take over while i slept. at this point my gm was throwing punches and stripping off cloths every few moments. she would only call my sister by bitch and not by her name. about 3-4 pm, the fucking bass started to shake the entire fucking house. the neighbor was working on his car and decided to blast music. i kindly asked him to lower it because i had to wake up at midnight to start my second day shift and he kindly told me to fuck off. now i know my laws, technically he is allowed to blast music at 4 pm during the weekend. theirs nothing against the law to do that until it hit 10 pm. i considered complaining to the home owner but he was a different owner then my own. their was really nothing i could do about the noise since i couldn't file a complaint to his home owner or call the cops. they always looks at my gm with distaste since she refers to their son as a ""cute little monkey"" (they are black, unintentional racism? do not know to be honest....) to make matters worse, the abuse my sister is receiving from my gm has made her lost any interest in assisting for the next few days. which i completely understand. luckily my step dad is already feeling a little better but ill be receiving my 2nd vaccine shot in a few days and i feel like we are hitting our limits. well, i have had 2 hours of sleep today and my shift starts in 4 hours so i'm going to bed.

"when mom is having a day when she is friendly and kind to me and her caregiver, she also grunts and moans constantly. it is rough to hear that 24 hours a day. even at night and when eating, she kind of moans. it's difficult to describe this noise (i sleep with ear plugs to block how bad it gets at night). you can try to redirect, etc., but she will always go back to the groaning.but one weird thing is that when mom is aggressive, she doesn't make these noises. on days when she is threatening people, calling people names, etc., there is no grunting and moaning. no clue why this is, but it's a weird phenomenon to observe. today is one of those days where even her medicine is ""poison"" and we're ""trying to kill her"" and all of that. but the moans and grunts? completely silent around here. anybody else ever witness a phenomenon like this?"," a few weeks ago my grandfather and i was sitting down having a pleasant conversation. during the conversation his ability to speak completely disappeared and all he could do was grunt and moan. i ended up calling the ambulance because it but he got so upset with me for because he hates going to the hospital that by the time the ambulance arrived he was talking clearly again. i never connected it to his emotional state  but you could be on to something. also for sleeping i bought some sleep headphones on amazon and play white noise on them to drown out all sorts of sounds, might be something that could help you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m1di07/grunting_noises_and_behavior/,1,"when mom is having a day when she is friendly and kind to me and her caregiver, she also grunts and moans constantly. it is rough to hear that 24 hours a day. even at night and when eating, she kind of moans. it's difficult to describe this noise (i sleep with ear plugs to block how bad it gets at night). you can try to redirect, etc., but she will always go back to the groaning.but one weird thing is that when mom is aggressive, she doesn't make these noises. on days when she is threatening people, calling people names, etc., there is no grunting and moaning. no clue why this is, but it's a weird phenomenon to observe. today is one of those days where even her medicine is ""poison"" and we're ""trying to kill her"" and all of that. but the moans and grunts? completely silent around here. anybody else ever witness a phenomenon like this?  a few weeks ago my grandfather and i was sitting down having a pleasant conversation. during the conversation his ability to speak completely disappeared and all he could do was grunt and moan. i ended up calling the ambulance because it but he got so upset with me for because he hates going to the hospital that by the time the ambulance arrived he was talking clearly again. i never connected it to his emotional state  but you could be on to something. also for sleeping i bought some sleep headphones on amazon and play white noise on them to drown out all sorts of sounds, might be something that could help you.",11

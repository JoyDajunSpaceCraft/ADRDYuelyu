"nearly twenty years ago, when i first began studying alzheimer's disease, i began by looking at all the major hypotheses for alzheimer's disease and found out that almost none of them explained every case of the disease.  only one of them--calcium dysregulation--was present in every case of alzheimer's disease.  so when i read this article today it made me reflect back:does calcium overload mark dendritic spines for destruction?the work supports the decades-old hypothesis that calcium dysregulation is a driver of neurodegeneration, noted christopher norris of the university of kentucky in lexington. “the present work … is yet another example of just how vital the ‘ca2+ hypothesis’ is after all these years, and further cements the visionary status of its early proponents.”there are two sources of excess calcium in the brain.  one is the release of intracellular calcium.  drugs like aricept and anavex 2-73 inhibit this release.  the second which is connected to the first is the influx of extracellular calcium which is usually the results of the over-activation of nmda receptors which is inhibited by namenda.  the first problem decreases with the progression of alzheimer's disease whereas the second increases.  this may be why aricept is only effective for awhile during the early stages of alzheimer's disease whereas namenda is only prescribed during the moderate to late stages of alzheimer's disease.my second step was trying to figure out what caused calcium dysregulation.  i found that there were many types of receptors (g protein-coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, ionotropic receptors) and many factors that contributed to this problem (high glucose levels, high fructose consumption, pesticides, air pollutants, viruses, bacteria, fungi, amyloid oligomers, misfolded tau proteins to name just a few).  unless only receptor or only one factor caused someone's alzheimer's disease, inhibiting any particular receptor or removing any particular factor was likely to make little difference in terms of the treatment of the disease.the final step was to figure out what does excessive calcium trigger cause.  calcium dysregulation leads to oxidants (hydrogen peroxide early on and then to peroxynitrite) and neuroinflammation which results in the production of more oxidants.  in addition to triggering neuroinflammation, peroxynitrite leads to a depletion of critical neurotransmitters needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness, inhibits neurotransmissions, inhibits the regeneration of neurons and synapses, causes dna damage, damages tisssue, and results in the death of neurons.  the only way to largely stablize alzheimer's disease is to scavenge peroxynitrite and to partially reverse the damage that it does to the brain. here are a couple of charts which help to put the above togethe.   (onoo-) is peroxynitrite.  for critics don't focus on me, focus on the scientists who put this together."," first, the top link you’ve provided never links calcium dysregulation to peroxynitration. it discusses how synaptic spines displaying aberrant calcium levels are removed, while neighboring spines are left untouched. they are removed by brain resident and infiltrating immune cells. how the spines are tagged for removal is unclear, but they’re hypothesizing complement tagging or something similar. again, here you making a wild leap to connect calcium dysregulation to peroxynitration, and trying to make it seem like prominent scientists agree with you by invoking their name earlier in the post. the diagram you link undercuts your own hypothesis by showing that peroxynitrates are way downstream in the pathological pathways implicated in alzheimer’s, and there are multiple other pathways driving pathology. so scientists did create these separate bodies of research, but you are the one trying to jam them together, like square pegs in round holes, to fit your hypothesis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l8ug6f/calcium_dysregulation_and_alzheimers_disease/,1,"nearly twenty years ago, when i first began studying alzheimer's disease, i began by looking at all the major hypotheses for alzheimer's disease and found out that almost none of them explained every case of the disease.  only one of them--calcium dysregulation--was present in every case of alzheimer's disease.  so when i read this article today it made me reflect back:does calcium overload mark dendritic spines for destruction?the work supports the decades-old hypothesis that calcium dysregulation is a driver of neurodegeneration, noted christopher norris of the university of kentucky in lexington. “the present work … is yet another example of just how vital the ‘ca2+ hypothesis’ is after all these years, and further cements the visionary status of its early proponents.”there are two sources of excess calcium in the brain.  one is the release of intracellular calcium.  drugs like aricept and anavex 2-73 inhibit this release.  the second which is connected to the first is the influx of extracellular calcium which is usually the results of the over-activation of nmda receptors which is inhibited by namenda.  the first problem decreases with the progression of alzheimer's disease whereas the second increases.  this may be why aricept is only effective for awhile during the early stages of alzheimer's disease whereas namenda is only prescribed during the moderate to late stages of alzheimer's disease.my second step was trying to figure out what caused calcium dysregulation.  i found that there were many types of receptors (g protein-coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, ionotropic receptors) and many factors that contributed to this problem (high glucose levels, high fructose consumption, pesticides, air pollutants, viruses, bacteria, fungi, amyloid oligomers, misfolded tau proteins to name just a few).  unless only receptor or only one factor caused someone's alzheimer's disease, inhibiting any particular receptor or removing any particular factor was likely to make little difference in terms of the treatment of the disease.the final step was to figure out what does excessive calcium trigger cause.  calcium dysregulation leads to oxidants (hydrogen peroxide early on and then to peroxynitrite) and neuroinflammation which results in the production of more oxidants.  in addition to triggering neuroinflammation, peroxynitrite leads to a depletion of critical neurotransmitters needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness, inhibits neurotransmissions, inhibits the regeneration of neurons and synapses, causes dna damage, damages tisssue, and results in the death of neurons.  the only way to largely stablize alzheimer's disease is to scavenge peroxynitrite and to partially reverse the damage that it does to the brain. here are a couple of charts which help to put the above togethe.

"two years into the new year and already one of the best articles on the role of oxidation and alzheimer's disease has come out.  here are some of the highlights:neurogenesis versus neurodegeneration: the broken balance in alzheimer’s diseaseaccruing evidence indicates the role of systemic and brain metabolic aberrations, in addition to the canonical hallmarks, in ad pathogenesis (polis and samson, 2019). the up-to-date description of ad-associated pathology includes neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, instigated apoptosis, and chronic oxidative stress. of note, oxidative damage is one of the earliest events causing and following ad (nunomura et al., 2001). moreover, oxidative damage is strongly associated with neurodegenerative processes and it is a connecting factor between β-amyloidosis, τ-protein hyperphosphorylation, and neuronal loss. oxidative stress due to the disbalance between generation and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ros) plays a key role in β-amyloid-mediated cytotoxicity via a spectrum of molecular events that eventually lead to a substantial neuronal loss, which is a primary hallmark of ad, clinically manifesting in cognitive decline. in healthy individuals, excessive ros production is counteracted by physiological antioxidant mechanisms that incessantly maintain redox homeostasis. however, these mechanisms are inadequate in the ad brain tissue and do not provide the necessary protection against highly reactive species, which disrupt membrane function, impair enzymes, break polysaccharides, and damage nucleic acids...adult neurogenesis is extremely responsive to the brain pathology and correlates with its severity. neurogenesis counteracts neurodegeneration in the aging and ad brains by implicating neural progenitors in the repair mechanisms and replacement of nonfunctional brain tissue. however, the development of ad is followed by an increase in the imbalance between these two counterdirected processes. notably, oxidative stress due to numerous factors seems to be the main cause of this imbalance. the ad brain is under gradually growing oxidative stress, leading to progressive neuron degeneration and, eventually, death and atrophy of susceptible areas. on the other hand, chronic oxidative stress causes neurogenesis decline that further aggravates clinical dementia, which becomes irreversible. therefore, early diagnosis and preventive interventions targeted at neurovascular unit function and ros elimination are the most promising approaches to combat the disease. this can be paired with the following research:glutathione: a molecular whistleblower for alzheimer’s diseasethe hippocampi – the brain centres for learning and memory – are one of the earliest regions to be sabotaged by alzheimer’s pathology. our data revealed that gsh levels plummet in the hippocampi of patients with alzheimer’s as well as those with mci (fig.1). the frontal cortices – brain ceos responsible for a variety of executive functions – are chronologically affected later in alzheimer’s. gsh levels mimic this chronology with no changes in the cortices of mci patients, but significant reduction in those of alzheimer’s patients (fig.1). interestingly, gsh remains unaffected in the cerebellum – a brain region unaffected by alzheimer’s till late stages. it appears gsh decline is not ubiquitous but rather a region-specific phenomenon that appears to precisely map the progression of alzheimer’s in our brains. the loss of balance in the brain between increasing oxidative stress and decreasing antioxidant compounds (especially glutathione) leads to all sorts of problems such as dna damage, mitochondrial failure, neuroinflammation, misfolded amyloid and tau proteins (which further increase oxidative stress), declining levels of critical neurotransmitters, impairments in the regeneration of neurons and synapses, and neuronal cell death.  oxidation and nitration leads to the death of neurons and niitration inhibits the further regeneration of neurons and synapses.  when peroxynitrite--the main nitro-oxidant in alzheimer's disease--is scavengerd it produces water and water is a de-nitrating agent.   thus fewer neurons die and more neurons and synapses are regenerated.  so the whole key to treating alzheimer's disease is to try to restore the antioxidant capacity that the brain has lost.  this approach has been sucessefully employed  to treat alzheimer's disease: the use of a brown seaweed compound (gv-971), anavex 2-73 (blarcamesine), panax ginseng, aromatherapy, and

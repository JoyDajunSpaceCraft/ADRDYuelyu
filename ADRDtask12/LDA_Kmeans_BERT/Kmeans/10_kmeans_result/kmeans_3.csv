"so much for yesterday's fireworks and champagne!today my grandson, who works for a pest control company, stopped by while my wife and little granddaughter were sitting with dad while i went for my covid shot. in my absence, and while my wife was dealing with our granddaughter, the grandson related a few stories to my dad of ant and mice infestations at the place where tomorrow we are scheduled to sign a contract. i returned from my shot to get dad and take him for some banking. on the way there he told me what he thought he had heard, and it was disgusting. all the rooms were crawling with ants, the kitchen was filthy, full of mice, a real horror show. he was considering cancelling tomorrow's appointment.we completed our banking and returned to my wife. i left dad in the car and said ""what in the world did (grandson) say to dad? he's about ready to cancel the appointment tomorrow!""""he said a couple rooms had some ants because people had left food out, and that there had been mice in the kitchen because a 16 year old boy had intentionally attracted them by leaving balls of peanut butter on the floor, but (grandson) dealt with those issues and the place is good to go now.""""would you please come out to the car and straighten dad out? he's considering cancelling the appointment over this."" so she did, but dad didn't seem convinced. and now i have to wait on my fireworks and champagne, because who knows what else could happen before, or even after, 10 o' clock tomorrow morning that might stop me from moving my parents?", thank god. when you mentioned pest control i thought you were gonna say bed bugs.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/m6kjdu/moving_my_parents_special_edition_march_16/,1,"so much for yesterday's fireworks and champagne!today my grandson, who works for a pest control company, stopped by while my wife and little granddaughter were sitting with dad while i went for my covid shot. in my absence, and while my wife was dealing with our granddaughter, the grandson related a few stories to my dad of ant and mice infestations at the place where tomorrow we are scheduled to sign a contract. i returned from my shot to get dad and take him for some banking. on the way there he told me what he thought he had heard, and it was disgusting. all the rooms were crawling with ants, the kitchen was filthy, full of mice, a real horror show. he was considering cancelling tomorrow's appointment.we completed our banking and returned to my wife. i left dad in the car and said ""what in the world did (grandson) say to dad? he's about ready to cancel the appointment tomorrow!""""he said a couple rooms had some ants because people had left food out, and that there had been mice in the kitchen because a 16 year old boy had intentionally attracted them by leaving balls of peanut butter on the floor, but (grandson) dealt with those issues and the place is good to go now.""""would you please come out to the car and straighten dad out? he's considering cancelling the appointment over this."" so she did, but dad didn't seem convinced. and now i have to wait on my fireworks and champagne, because who knows what else could happen before, or even after, 10 o' clock tomorrow morning that might stop me from moving my parents?  thank god. when you mentioned pest control i thought you were gonna say bed bugs.",3

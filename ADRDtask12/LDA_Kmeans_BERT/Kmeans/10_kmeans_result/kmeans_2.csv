"my (28m) wife (26f) can’t work even a part time job without skipping at least two shifts per week.(+ other things)my(28m) wife (26f) cannot bring herself to work even a part time job without taking every other shift off and leaving early on almost all of the others (+other things).i have no clue where to start about this.  i could honestly put this in r/caregiversupport as well but i'm just not sure.  let me preface my post really quick with some information: my wife and i were married 3 years ago on may 5th 2018.  she has bipolar disorder as well as ptsd from watching her mother decline in health and finally pass away from metastasized breast cancer early 2017.  i knew all of this proceeding with marrying her.  now, i have an anxiety disorder myself and for quite some time have been dealing with a great deal of existential depression.  as dumb as that might sound to some, it's really done a number on me emotionally.now, when we were married, my wife was just about to graduate college while i was slightly behind her due to having spent two years abroad as a missionary for the mormon church (we have since left the mormon church).  long story short, my wife graduated, worked full time for 2 months in the summer at an entry level job in her field, said she didn't like it, promptly quit and proceeded to take a part time job at a call center that pays less hourly than i am without a degree.  this was mid 2019 by the way.  all this time my goal was simply to be supportive of her.  i know she struggles and i simply wanted to make sure she knew she had my support.  i figured she would soon enough be back to a different full time job in her field.  our plan had been for my wife to graduate school, begin working full time so i could switch to part time work while finishing up school and move back to full time once i graduated.  once my wife started working part time, however,  college kind of got put on the back burner for me and i ended up taking a break and taking one or two classes at a time because honestly working full time while going to school full time is something i simply cannot do.  i've tried it and it did not turn out well.anyway, back to the story.  time went on and things got more weird.  i could be wrong about this, but i am convinced that my wife became or already was a hypochondriac.  this first started to become clear to me when for her birthday in 2019 we went to an olive garden to use a gift card.  while we sat waiting for our food, i shit you not, one of the small floodlights above us popped and the lining of the light fell on her head.  of course we received the meal for free, but my wife began to complain of concussion symptoms.  then followed a string of expensive doctor appointments as well as a couple of mris for her.  keep in mind this was just a month or so after she quit her full time job for her part time job.  we ended up with a personal injury attorney and they started working on my wife's case to simply get the medical bills paid for.  i come to find out that the lining she was hit in the head with was no more than a couple of ounces in weight, something that had occurred to me at the time of the event but that i had ignored because i wanted to simply support my wife.  the case didn't end up ever going anywhere.  my wife eventually just stopped following up on the things she had to do for it despite me urging her to do so.  luckily the attorney takes their charges if and only if the case is resolved and there is a settlement, but we still had to pay the medical bills.  at this point, my wife had begun taking off practically every other shift and leaving early on most every other day (it's not too busy of a call center so they usually offer for people to go home early) citing nausea, aches, and pains as the reason why she couldn't go to work.  as time went on she started having more medical issues (examples being: appendicitis pain, blood clot pains, lung pains, what she thought was a broken rib from sneezing, etc, etc).   because of this a string of ultrasounds, x rays, urgent care visits, and even er visits happened.  none, i repeat, none of these ended up having any real underlying issue and we were always sent home with a large medical bill without any actual health issue to cite for it.  with each occurrence i have become more and more frustrated about this whole situation, though i suggest we take her to the doctor whenever she feels like she needs to go.  i'm not just going to let her die if she really has something wrong.i was then hit with my own health issues aside from my mental health.  i began having rapid heart movement episodes and had to go get an echocardiogram and some other checkups.  as it turns out i have two congenital heart conditions: wolffe parkinson white syndrome and bicuspid aortic valve.  when we got married i was on my parent's insurance and she was on her dad's and step mother's.  by the time i found out about these heart conditions in summer of 2020 we were both on my insurance from my job and have no hope in the world of affording any kind of operation for either heart defect as our deductible being met is a laughable thought.  i could really use an operation for the wpws and it is relatively non invasive and has a very very high success rate, but that is just not going to happen anytime in the foreseeable future.to this day nothing has changed.  it's been a very long time since my wife's ""concussion"" incident, and a very long time since my wife started working part time.  i've discussed these things and how i feel like i'm the only one really supporting us financially with her gently many times and she always gets super depressed and extremely self critical afterwards. she'll then find shift swaps to get extra hours to ""make up"" for it.  the problem is then as soon as she has some extra hours planned for later in the week she will take another day off and say ""it's okay because i have extra hours on the 15th"" or whatever.  i've tried reminding her that this does not give her ""more hours"" and that it just ends up shifting her schedule around.  she always says she knows this and promises that she'll get even more hours.  spoiler: she doesn't.  she'll do some extra cleaning around our apartment, again acting like it solves the issue.  i don't know how to be appreciative of this but at the same time let her know that what i really need right now is her help with the income, not dishes, so that we can stop living paycheck to paycheck, draining my account to pay rent every month, and using half of my other paycheck to pay the rest of our bills.  i mean, what's the point of being essentially a stay at home mom when you don't have kids and never plan on having kids?  i don't need a stay at home wife that solely i provide for, i need a wife that will help us mutually get to a better place financially.  i can clean things up after work in less than half an hour.  not to mention, i feel like if she can be up and cleaning and making all this food like she does to make up for not working, she would much more easily be able to go sit at a desk and take customer service calls for 4 hours.  i have the same job for eight hours a day in a second language.  i don't know how much longer i can do this alone for.i am a patient, introverted, and very quiet fellow.  i just want to be supportive and i want there to be peace.  that's all i have ever wanted, but this situation i find myself in is changing me into someone completely different and fast. i can't live like this.  i feel like a caregiver instead of a husband.  as time goes by i am also less and less attracted to my wife sexually because i feel like i'm just supporting us by myself and i'm beginning to see her as immature and selfish and i can't help but feel a bit resentful.    i know we promised ""through sickness and health"" but jeez, this feels like torture for me emotionally and mentally.my wife has a tendency of s ideation and has attempted it in the past and honestly if i even mentioned divorce ever i am worried she might do something drastic.  i've noticed is that she's very dependent on me emotionally as well.  she doesn't like it when she has to be alone in a room of our small apartment without me, for example.  seeing this mental state of hers over these past three years really makes me worried in that sense, but i'm not sure if i can keep doing this.  even if i did bring up the topic of splitting up, the problem is that i do not have hardly any family or friends at this point aside from her.  the main reason for which being that i recently left the mormon church and all of my friends and family are mormon.  my parents have cut me off and want nothing do do with me, unfortunately, and my extended family are all on the same page with them.  i've no clue who i would ask for advice from or what i would do.i'll probably post this to am i the asshole as well because i genuinely feel so guilty for feeling the way i do.  i feel like maybe i should simply continue to support her by getting a second job and working 60 hrs a week instead of 40.  all in all, i just feel stuck and would love some advice.  if you have any advice, how would you suggest i proceed? i am currently aware of the divorce rates when bipolar is a factor. should i continue to attempt fixing the situation? thank you in advance!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nhzktv/my_28m_hypochondriac_wife_26f_with_bipolar_and/,1,"my (28m) wife (26f) can’t

to pay the rest of our bills.  i mean, what's the point of being essentially a stay at home mom when you don't have kids and never plan on having kids?  i don't need a stay at home wife that solely i provide for, i need a wife that will help us mutually get to a better place financially.  i can clean things up after work in less than half an hour.  not to mention, i feel like if she can be up and cleaning and making all this food like she does to make up for not working, she would much more easily be able to go sit at a desk and take customer service calls for 4 hours.  i have the same job for eight hours a day in a second language.  i don't know how much longer i can do this alone for.i am a patient, introverted, and very quiet fellow.  i just want to be supportive and i want there to be peace.  that's all i have ever wanted, but this situation i find myself in is changing me into someone completely different and fast. i can't live like this.  i feel like a caregiver instead of a husband.  as time goes by i am also less and less attracted to my wife sexually because i feel like i'm just supporting us by myself and i'm beginning to see her as immature and selfish and i can't help but feel a bit resentful.    i know we promised ""through sickness and health"" but jeez, this feels like torture for me emotionally and mentally.my wife has a tendency of s ideation and has attempted it in the past and honestly if i even mentioned divorce ever i am worried she might do something drastic.  i've noticed is that she's very dependent on me emotionally as well.  she doesn't like it when she has to be alone in a room of our small apartment without me, for example.  seeing this mental state of hers over these past three years really makes me worried in that sense, but i'm not sure if i can keep doing this.  even if i did bring up the topic of splitting up, the problem is that i do not have hardly any family or friends at this point aside from her.  the main reason for which being that i recently left the mormon church and all of my friends and family are mormon.  my parents have cut me off and want nothing do do with me, unfortunately, and my extended family are all on the same page with them.  i've no clue who i would ask for advice from or what i would do.i'll probably post this to am i the asshole as well because i genuinely feel so guilty for feeling the way i do.  i feel like maybe i should simply continue to support her by getting a second job and working 60 hrs a week instead of 40.  all in all, i just feel stuck and would love some advice.  if you have any advice, how would you suggest i proceed? i am currently aware of the divorce rates when bipolar is a factor. should i continue to attempt fixing the situation? thank you in advance!",2

last july i have been quaranting with my 81 yo father who’s had two tias and some cognitive impairment. one of the tia’s was during the pandemic. he has mostly recovered but has way more lingering cognitive issues this time that pop up at random times.  i was thrown in to caregiving without even having a name to express what i was doing until my skip level boss named it as he was expressing sympathy for my situation.  i work a very demanding high profile job and i am super ambitious but all that feels like it is on hold even though i keep grinding forward. it feels like i should be pulling back but i can’t. and i don’t want to. i worked hard to get where i am and my dad gave me incredible privilege through his own sacrifice.  i have been seeing a therapist weekly for over a year

the pandemic. he is a big part of the reason i have my high paying cool job that i love. we’ve taken many road trips together and we could sit and have breakfast and remark on what we were each reading in the paper. i have a lot of wonderful memories of us having brunch he cooked for us.  he has always been a mild mannered guy. so it really breaks my heart when he is cruel to me bc of his cognitive impairment. it’s so hard to remember he doesn’t really mean those horrible things. but he’s like 70% there cognitively so it comes out of left field. he has always loved to debate especially politics but now he becomes fixated on it. we share 99% of the same views. you would never know listening to us. i had to train myself to stop engaging substantively so much and just agree with him.

"i’m struggling with conflicting feels regarding my mom. i adore her. she’s a great person, funny, supportive, and well i could go on for hours. she’s my mom and i love her. but i’m struggling because she’s so timid now. her physical health and depression have done a number on her. she’s almost like a beaten animal. her self-confidence is non-existent. she worked from home for many years  and now never wants to go out. she won’t ask for things because she doesn’t want to ruffle any feather. at times i’ve watched her literally recede into herself and it hurts my heart. because of her depression and low self esteem she hasn’t taken care of herself in years. she just turned 62 but she looks like she’s in her 80s. she’s really self conscious of her weight and hair loss. but this is the south, many people are overweight. i’ve tried taking her shopping and giving her some fashion advice for bigger women. but shes not comfortable because she just sees her fat. as for her hair, i’ve tried buying her wigs. but she’s dissatisfied because they don’t look like her. this is really hard for me to say, but i’m embarrassed to show her off. i hate that i feel this way. she’s clearly struggling mentally and i’m over here thinking these terrible things.i want to help her or at the very least be supportive. i’ve tried doing little things to boost her confidence but it never works. i want to help her but i just don’t know how. and it’s starting to really get to me because i just want her to be confident and happy.", wait until she starts forgetting who you are,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nnya85/mom_lacks_any_confidence_and_its_hard_to_watch/,1,"i’m struggling with conflicting feels regarding my mom. i adore her. she’s a great person, funny, supportive, and well i could go on for hours. she’s my mom and i love her. but i’m struggling because she’s so timid now. her physical health and depression have done a number on her. she’s almost like a beaten animal. her self-confidence is non-existent. she worked from home for many years  and now never wants to go out. she won’t ask for things because she doesn’t want to ruffle any feather. at times i’ve watched her literally recede into herself and it hurts my heart. because of her depression and low self esteem she hasn’t taken care of herself in years. she just turned 62 but she looks like she’s in her 80s. she’s really self conscious of her weight and hair loss. but this is the south, many people are overweight. i’ve tried taking her shopping and giving her some fashion advice for bigger women. but shes not comfortable because she just sees her fat. as for her hair, i’ve tried buying her wigs. but she’s dissatisfied because they don’t look like her. this is really hard for me to say, but i’m embarrassed to show her off. i hate that i feel this way. she’s clearly struggling mentally and i’m over here thinking these terrible things.i want to help her or at the very least be supportive. i’ve tried doing little things to boost her confidence but it never works. i want to help her but i just don’t know how. and it’s starting to really get to me because i just want her to be confident and happy.  wait until she starts forgetting who you are",8

"the universe needs to calm down. i'm 33f and i take care of my parents who are in their 70's. mom has stage iv lung cancer and dad has a bunch of stuff going on. i also had a feral cat have kittens in my yard, shelters are full so i'll have to neuter them and their parents. dogs can't go in the back yard because of kittens, so i'm taking them out on leashes in the front yard. one of the dogs has gi issues and is on a bland diet rn. he had a normal stool, but passed blood with it today.also the kitchen drain line collapsed, and i'm coordinating the repair for my parents because my dad is hard of hearing. plumbers in and out of the house until 5pm. mom asks me to order ubereats, and keeps asking me to as i order food on my phone. dog with gi issues has diarrhea in the house. food arrives as i'm cleaning carpet and mom is anxious about why i'm not eating. dad comes in and demands to get him ice for his drink as i am cleaning up liquid doggie doo. i tell him to get his own and don't put any water down the sink... he put water down the sink after i had the plumber extract all the water for the leak detection specialist who is coming tomorrow.during all of this my older brother who is almost 50, is texting me that i can cook, wash my dirty dishes, and wash my dirty laundry at his house 30 minutes away. i have a portable dishwasher that only uses 4 gallons of water that's easy to dump on my own and a laundromat 5 minutes from my house. i instead ask him to bring paper plates, plastic forks, white rice, and unflavored pedialyte (last two are for the dog), but he wouldn't be able to get it until 8pm (not a big deal). then he says he can't do it because it's too much of an inconvenience for him because he got off work late and needs to go to bed. so i just ordered instacart.i understand the need for rest, but i only get 4 hours a day tops so to me it is more of an excuse so he can feel like he tried instead of actually helping. he has a history of being unavailable, bailing out halfway, and just being difficult. i was in the middle of typing this when my doggo had his accident and i had multiple trips with both dogs on the leash while ordering on instacart. i ate my dinner an hour and a half after it got here. i'm so tired. i still need to clean the mess the plumbers left in the kitchen. fml i need a break.", awesome work. cyber hugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nl717y/dog_piled_rant/,1,"the universe needs to calm down. i'm 33f and i take care of my parents who are in their 70's. mom has stage iv lung cancer and dad has a bunch of stuff going on. i also had a feral cat have kittens in my yard, shelters are full so i'll have to neuter them and their parents. dogs can't go in the back yard because of kittens, so i'm taking them out on leashes in the front yard. one of the dogs has gi issues and is on a bland diet rn. he had a normal stool, but passed blood with it today.also the kitchen drain line collapsed, and i'm coordinating the repair for my parents because my dad is hard of hearing. plumbers in and out of the house until 5pm. mom asks me to order ubereats, and keeps asking me to as i order food on my phone. dog with gi issues has diarrhea in the house. food arrives as i'm cleaning carpet and mom is anxious about why i'm not eating. dad comes in and demands to get him ice for his drink as i am cleaning up liquid doggie doo. i tell him to get his own and don't put any water down the sink... he put water down the sink after i had the plumber extract all the water for the leak detection specialist who is coming tomorrow.during all of this my older brother who is almost 50, is texting me that i can cook, wash my dirty dishes, and wash my dirty laundry at his house 30 minutes away. i have a portable dishwasher that only uses 4 gallons of water that's easy to dump on my own and a laundromat 5 minutes from my house. i instead ask him to bring paper plates, plastic forks, white rice, and unflavored pedialyte (last two are for the dog), but he wouldn't be able to get it until 8pm (not a big deal). then he says he can't do it because it's too much of an inconvenience for him because he got off work late and needs to go to bed. so i just ordered instacart.i understand the need for rest, but i only get 4 hours a day tops so to me it is more of an excuse so he can feel like he tried instead of actually helping. he has a history of being unavailable, bailing out halfway, and just being difficult. i was in the middle of typing this when my doggo had his accident and i had multiple trips with both dogs on the leash while ordering on instacart. i ate my dinner an hour and a half after it got here. i'm so tired. i still need to clean the mess the plumbers left in the kitchen. fml i need a break.  awesome work. cyber hugs",8

"my dad has dementia and requires complete around-the-clock care. i took care of him for 8 months without any help, until it made me so burned out/depressed that i had a mental breakdown. my mom stepped back in at this point and became his caregiver while i took a month off for myself. mom refused to put him in a nursing home up to this point.well--surprise!--mom got hurt while taking care of him, which meant i had no choice but to step back in. my mental health went right back to where it was previously. luckily, this time, mom agreed to put him in a care facility. i got the ball rolling on that. got him on hospice. it looked like he would be cleared for a facility soon.i booked him a respite stay at a nearby nursing home to give myself a little break. mom went to visit him during this time. she said it was heartbreaking to seem him in that state, and his eyes ""looked dead."" i rebutted that dad has severe dementia and is on hospice, and his care is beyond what we can provide at home... it's sad, but a nursing home is our best option right now. mom still decided that he will stay home, despite all my efforts.well, i've told her that i can't continue being his unpaid caregiver. i want to live my life and focus on my mental health. i'm tired of having this heavy burden on my shoulders--especially after trying to hard to set him up in a nursing home, only for mom to change her mind last minute. it's painful to set a boundary, but i had to do it.i still can't help but fill extremely guilty. my mom is not physically capable of caring for him properly, but she is incredibly stubborn. she will literally take care of him until she can no longer walk, and then i will have to figure out how to put two parents in a nursing home. it's incredibly frustrating. am i being terrible for refusing to help with dad's care?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nlw61t/am_i_wrong_for_refusing_to_take_care_of_my_father/,1,"my dad has dementia and requires complete around-the-clock care. i took care of him for 8 months without any help, until it made me so burned out/depressed that i had a mental breakdown. my mom stepped back in at this point and became his caregiver while i took a month off for myself. mom refused to put him in a nursing home up to this point.well--surprise!--mom got hurt while taking care of him, which meant i had no choice but to step back in. my mental health went right back to where it was previously. luckily, this time, mom agreed to put him in a care facility. i got the ball rolling on that. got him on hospice. it looked like he would be cleared for a facility soon.i booked him a respite stay at a nearby nursing home to give myself a little break. mom went to visit him during this time. she said it was heartbreaking to seem him in that state, and his eyes ""looked dead."" i rebutted that dad has severe dementia and is on hospice, and his care is beyond what we can provide at home... it's sad, but a nursing home is our best option right now. mom still decided that he will stay home, despite all my efforts.well, i've told her that i can't continue being his unpaid caregiver. i want to live my life and focus on my mental health. i'm tired of having this heavy burden on my shoulders--especially after trying to hard to set him up in a nursing home, only for mom to change her mind last minute. it's painful to set a boundary, but i had to do it.i still can't help but fill extremely guilty. my mom is not physically capable of caring for him properly, but she is incredibly stubborn. she will literally take care of him until she can no longer walk, and then i will have to figure out how to put two parents in a nursing home. it's incredibly frustrating. am i being terrible for refusing to help with dad's care?",7

little back ground. i am 40 years old and caring for my disabled mother. she suffered a subdural hematoma in 2012 that caused some significant damage to her brain. despite knowing my mother's wishes my dad insisted that the doctors do everything to save her. she survived but my mother was then living her nightmare of needing care 24/7. i was already living back at home because earlier in the year i had to have emergency open heart surgery. my dad and i worked together caring for mom. her impairments are not horrible but significant enough she can not be left alone. fast forward to 2014 my mom has a stroke. we caught it early enough no damage was done. she however required rehab and was in rehab hospital than nursing home till strong enough to come home. when she came home we could tell there was still something wrong but doctors kept telling us there was nothing wrong and we didn't know what we were talking about. for months with multiple trips to er and doctors with no resolution to her condition. finally during another trip to the er was a doctor who i knew personally since i was a child and knew my mom well. i told him. there is something wrong with her. he promised that she would not be released til he figured out what was wrong. he ran every test under the sun. finally deciding final step was to run a spinal tap. boom she had meningitis. she contracted an infection in the hospital/rehab/nursing home that went untreated and went to her brain. again my dad had to option to follow my mom's wishes and to let her go and again did not give her want she wanted. she again came out of it with more damage but her impairments were only slightly worse. again my dad and i care for her together.  my dad is diagnosed with lung cancer in 2019. so now i am caring for both of them. i love my mother with all my heart but my relationship with my dad has never been good. i am a disappointment because i did not fit his ideal of what a boy/man should be because i was gay. so i have massive resent towards my dad because i now must care for him as well. my dad's health declined steadily till he passes away last may. i am now left to care for my mother alone. grief over my dad's passing hit me harder then i thought. neither of my siblings come home for my dad's funeral. i am incredibly lonely. family members who promised to help after my dad passed have all but

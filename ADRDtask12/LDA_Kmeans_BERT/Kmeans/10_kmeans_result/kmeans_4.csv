"so this is my first and probably only post, (since i want to stop being so scared of this damn demon spawn!), but i have a question. my family has never had a history of dementia. my mother and her family members have told me over the years that the family line has never had dementia. my grandmother (whose's around 80 now) can recall stories from as far back as 1950. and according to my mom, my grandfather (who died 3 years before i was born) stayed alert and sharp until he passed away in his 90s. my ex father's family side also had no sign of dementia.&#x200b;but do i have a chance of getting dementia still? i've read that it's genetic but after listening to everywhere at the end of time, i've been terrified of dementia. i just wanna know if i'll have it or not, with the knowledge my family has given me."," by age 85, 50% of people have dementia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mkvuvx/i_have_a_question/,1,"so this is my first and probably only post, (since i want to stop being so scared of this damn demon spawn!), but i have a question. my family has never had a history of dementia. my mother and her family members have told me over the years that the family line has never had dementia. my grandmother (whose's around 80 now) can recall stories from as far back as 1950. and according to my mom, my grandfather (who died 3 years before i was born) stayed alert and sharp until he passed away in his 90s. my ex father's family side also had no sign of dementia.&#x200b;but do i have a chance of getting dementia still? i've read that it's genetic but after listening to everywhere at the end of time, i've been terrified of dementia. i just wanna know if i'll have it or not, with the knowledge my family has given me.  by age 85, 50% of people have dementia.",4

years than cognitiveimpairment and memory problems-memory problems fairly sudden onset eg within 1 to 2 months of hospital admission october 2019 oftenidentifiable onset of cognitive impairment especially during and after hospital stay, which was definitely a shock as she never had to be hospitalized for so long and become so much dependent in life.-often emphasize inability to think,concentrate, and remember, especially when asked questions-signs and symptoms of depression include:-loss of appetite.-loss of interest in cooking, overseeing house cleaning and other chores she used to love.-more silent-less mobile or willingness to move-less pain and discomfort tolerance probably and less temperature tolerance as evident by asking to switch on and off ac in short time-much less patient than beforemuch more 'i dont know' or 'not feeling well ' replies when trying to test cognition or memory---------_------short term memory so bad that she forgets the meds she just took a

hour.ask to fan or ac on off or bedsheet on off in anxietycant be left alone even for few mins, she starts calling and anxiety panic attacks startcombing her hair and massaging her feet with oil somewhat calms mild anxiety, but doesnot do much when severe attack.much more nosepickingshe tries calling me even when im trying to sleep beside her, apathy?,-++------she especially asks for feet massage with oil, something she never asked infact disliked even when i tried to earlier than 10-11 months.few mins in seemingly calm state, even seems asleep but suddenly wakes up and ask for milk or call doctor or says too much ghabrahat or sobunable to do any test properly eg mmse or even 6cit due to extreme anxiety or unwillingnessfrequently repeated phrases include:1 bahut ghabrahat aur bechane hai, dr se baat karo, koi dawai do. dr kiyani ya dr yousaf se baat karo (these two were longtime family doctors and friends of abu ) 70-80% of the time2 saans nai aarah, kuch karo, kuch laga do moun pe (asks for bipap mask, even though oxy meter shows good stats, oxy 90+ and hr 80 or less)3 maine kuch khaya hai aaj? (sometimes within few mins of eating food)becomes angry even if asked to hold spoon to eat or when trying to wash hands and face at bedside.exact phrase test repeated 14 in 30 minskisi dr ko bulao ya uss se baat karo, bahut ghabrahat ho rahi hai, bari tabiat kharab hai----+++---------*bedridden since 1 year, doesnot seem any motivation to get up or even sit, even after informing her repeatedly that all doctors insist she must sit atleast 30-45 angle and stand and walk to rid infections and better respiration.sometimes keep asking for bipap mask even when she is wearing it in anxietymoderately apathetic, especially when more anxietyused to be self sacrificingly caringno specific times of anxiety or panic attacks, so possibly no sundowningno specific timings of sleep, continuous sleep maybe only 2 hours straight, rest fragmented sleep. avg daily sleep 3-4 hours.feels more cold than warm on avg, especially past 3 monthsnot much new talk, most of the time repeated questions or complains or phrasesfew days she when she did got better sleep eg 6-7 hrs, still seemed same***on some days she was very positive and motivated uncharacteristically.especially 8 june, she tried to getup burt couldnot due to weakness but she was moving her legs and arms to exercise while lying. almost whole day she was very positive. could not test or remember how her memory was. i wish and pray everday she becomes atleast like that.14 june abt 70% of 8th june9th july abt 50% and for few hours like 5 afterwards a few days might have been somewhat positive but not that much and only for couple of hours**socially bad behavior with guests she cherished to meet and loved earlier. eg husband of her favorite sister came from karachi but she couldnot turn from left side where she feels less agitation to right side where he was sitting even for few seconds.**mobility was actually not very much since 2 years+, especially after father had to be admitted in hospital for 50 days when he had multi strokes and dementia and cpm central pontine mylosis and recovered from record low sodium 101 couple of years ago--++++++++++main reason for less mobility, since 2 years especially was extreme back pain and breathlessness, weakness. but now i think mental/ mood disorder or illness also had a considerable role.eg she used to love cook and later oversee cooking food for me and father, but after father hospital stay and return she didnot want to.she also used to love going to nearby mart to buy monthly groceries with me, but since i think sep 2018 she was unable to and told me it was due to fatigue breathlessness etc.she often like every other day weep and become very emotional when i refuse to do a certain task due to my own fatiguemight have had delirium when after t2rf condition became better on 31 jan 20 and shifted to another hospital in night. she was weeping very much and complaining and was not accepting anything at all and much more restlessness than usual. that condition lasted for some hours.***she asks for doctor home visit, which never happened even when father was grade 20 officer***not much sense of time, year or monthwakes or try to wakes father and me by calling our names repeatedly which never happened before hospital admitsometimes says pain in whole body but after few mins when asked again says only anxiety***anxiety or panic attacks lasts too long, hours, though not too intense seemingly, such as mostly verbal complaining about not calling dr or repeatedly telling she has too much anxiety so call family dr etc.sometimes say 30-40% she asks for something to eat, but after few mins when i bring it she seems to have forgotten---+----------rarely, when she wakesup from a nap she seems somewhat positive for sometime eg use spoon to eat on her own etckeeps saying ""ajeeb si ghabrahat hai, kuch samaj nai aaraha""eng translation:strange anxiety/ agitation, i dont know what is happening to mealso very prolong stomach pain which even after ct abdomen and pelvis with contrast and consulting with many gastro experts couldnot track and mostly  attributed to being bedridden","i’m so sorry! i found it a little hard to read

almost 24 hrs, so but please pardone me she had various utis from late sep 2019 to a month ago, very hard antibiotic courses, few months ago 2 utis at the same time, klebsiella and some other, trying

"backstory: my grandpa is 83. he had a stroke over 30 years ago that left him disabled. since the late 80‚Äôs he‚Äôs chosen to be home bound. he hates shopping, crowds, getting in the car etc. he will only go to doctor or dentist but nowhere else. he is very out of touch with...everything lol. so this morning he‚Äôs frustrated with his cable. he wants to watch a specific show but he wants the option to pause it for bathroom breaks and fast forward through commercials. i explain his cable package doesn‚Äôt provide that. he doesn‚Äôt have or want to pay for the dvr function.i spent an entire hour going over his tv functions. showing him every possible way he could watch a specific movie or show. he either has to pay to rent, pay for the dvr function, or wait days in order to get it for free. so that brought us to the topic of streaming services. he wants what my husband and i watch (netflix/hulu/sling) but it wants it on his cable üòÖ ?? he was so confused. he doesn‚Äôt understand the internet period. has never even had an email address or cell phone. it‚Äôs like explaining these things to a 2 year old. he just has no grasp on how the world works anymore. so now he‚Äôs frustrated. he thinks i‚Äôm pulling the wool over his eyes. he wants me to preform a miracle but it‚Äôs just not possible unless he forks up the money to his cable company. he does this with a lot of things actually. he still thinks the world runs as it did before he had a stroke, when things were a little more simple/cheap. sigh. it‚Äôs just hard. the generational gap in our home is so large. he thinks we lie but things are much more complex then he can understand anymore :/",,1
"hi! my niece took our car, and it had mom‚Äôs lift belt in it. i cannot get it back. i used the belt to help my mom in and out of cars (from a car seat to her walker or chair). can anyone recommend a replacement that i can order from amazon? also, mom is having a harder time getting out of her shower chair. even with wall handles. i have the chair at it‚Äôs maximum height setting, so i‚Äôm wondering how to get better traction for her feet. she hates the bath traction strips i put down and insists on having a towel under her feet which is too dangerous. she can only hoist herself up, just barely, from the right side. any slippers or other devices you can recommend would be helpful. we have a walk-in shower but i‚Äôm starting to wonder how many more weeks it will be practical for her. she can get into the shower fine. getting out is dicey.",,1
"hello alli am a 27 year old caregiver to two elederly grandparents and two aunts with parkinson‚Äôs. me and my wife take turns feeding and helping around the house, i‚Äôve noticed that alexa has a lot of skills that could be useful for elderly folks. asking for weather, time, calling family etc etc. i‚Äôm a self confessed techie and wanted to use that skill to help. i‚Äôve created a few alexa skills to help us around the house as welli was wondering if there is any technology that anyone uses here to aid in caregiving?",,1
"hi, my mum (55) is diagnosed with als and frontotemporal dementia, and recently came back home after a 5 month hospital stay while she was diagnosed. she is frequently upset, basically crying, repeating phrases like 'i wonder why' over and over again. i have been trying to find things for her to do to take her mind off things. i made her a fidget mat and have tried to show her how to use it, but all she does is fold it up and push it away. i have made puzzles, and tried to use puzzle apps, but again they just get pushed away. she doesn't want to do painting, or help me plant some seeds etc. all she seems to want to do is watch tv and eat, which i would frankly be okay with if she was content, but she's still so upset and anxious. i have tried to ask her what she would like to do, but between the als and the ftd, communication is tough. anyone have any suggestions or advice on how to help her?",,1
"my wife has been in long term memory care for six months and while generally not aggressive, she does become confrontational when personal care tasks like washroom assistance and dressing happen.  she particularly dislikes shirts being pulled over her head to take them off, so i‚Äôm picking up more button-up tops for her.  i‚Äôve also been looking at adaptive clothing options, so am wondering if anyone here has informed thoughts one way or the other on this topic.  she is not confined to a wheelchair, and is in fact still quite mobile at 61 years old.  any thoughts or shared experiences appreciated guys. ‚ù§Ô∏èthanks",,1
"my grandmother has moderate vascular dementia. i was her primary caregiver for about seven years, and now i share that responsibility with her daughter (my aunt). the three of us moved into a new house together last september, which of course was a major change that took some getting used to.another major change that's happened recently (last november) was a cat joining our family.my grandmother loves this cat. i find them cuddled up together napping on an almost daily basis. she was very, very withdrawn before we got him, and now she is much more engaged and chatty, both with him and with us humans. when she's talking about the cat she speaks more easily and with a wider vocabulary than i've heard from her in years.but it also frustrates the hell out of her that he's a cat, and can't be reasoned with. she gets very upset when he goes places she doesn't want him to go, and she reacts by loudly yelling at him, demanding that he stop. he is, of course, a cat, and doesn't listen, so she just keeps yelling until someone comes to physically remove him. (she has very limited mobility, so she can't get up and move him herself.) even when i or my aunt do come to deal with the cat, it's often only a few minutes until she starts yelling again. often he's not even doing anything wrong - she's yelled at him for not cuddling with her, for sniffing at the front door (she seems to think he can actually open the door and leave), or for hanging out on the stairs, which we have firmly established as his domain. i understand that i can't get her to stop yelling, at the cat or in general. but for various reasons, it's very upsetting to me to hear loud yelling, even if i know it's not directed at me or a reaction to a serious problem. honestly, this is a problem i need to be working on in therapy - but that's not an option at the moment.does anyone have any suggestions for how to tune out her yelling without preventing myself from being able to respond when she actually needs something? or how to accept that it's not my fault and not directed at me?",,1
"dad is coming home in 2 days after almost two months in the hospital. he is going against everyone's advice and not moving into the main building where there is ample care, so what tech should i be looking for? i am going to have to hire psw care for him, and i'm a little concerned about strangers in his unit when i am not able to be there. for example, i have young children, and we are now quarantining flowing exposure to a positive case at school for the next two weeks. i've got my eye on a ""seniors"" clock that displays the time, date  and what part of the day it is (morning/afternoon/evening), and i intend to set up medical alert system with a necklace and call button, but i'm thinking about a video camera of some sort. do i just get a video baby monitor? something different? i remember seeing old posts over a year ago about doing this, wondering how those systems are working for others. thanks everyone.",,1
"we've been living with and caring for my mother in law for three years. she's been in our care for five. we moved in when she kept falling, and could no longer remember to take her meds. she has early onset dementia, congestive heart failure, and is just a horrible person all around. but. my calling has always been caregiver, so i do what i must, and for the most part, it's not awful. i know, thanks to lurking a while, that it could be much worse. hubs's sister has seen ""grandma"" once since she's been in our care. she's impatient and despite being in town frequently, she just can't be bothered. this means no birthday cards, no christmas cards, no contact other than a monthly three minute phone call. however, on mother's day, she sent the old woman a five pound tiramisu from a swanky bakery in nj. grandma didn't even know who it was from until we saw the card. ""happy mother's day from daughter and son in law. "" immediately, i thought of it as the ""guilt cake.""some history: six weeks ago, she called 911 for mild angina. since, she's called them twice for gas. i suggested we set it out, still covered to protect it from the flies, until it thawed. it was frozen solid. she agreed, and we both went about our business. until the cops showed up. apparently, she also called 911 because i took away her tiramisu. the officer who did the welfare check was very sympathetic, and assured me that this happens with dementia patients. however, i'm angry. i have to watch everything she eats, because she'll eat herself literally sick. she's discovered that if she rubs her chest, it sets my husband off. whereas i want her to have a degree of autonomy, and for her to be able to freely reach out to the few people she has left, i also don't want her calling 911 for her amusement. yes, she's bored. she's spoiled. she's an asshole. i'm consistently angry, and we're all tense, and i'm kinda at wit's end, and i'm just venting. if you got this far, thank you. this is a great community, and you've helped me more than you know.",,1
"hi everyone,my mother (68) has begun showing a new symptom. she will look in the mirror and see herself, and talk to this ‚Äúother person‚Äù as if she is just meeting them. she also talks to empty areas of the house that she thinks are people (no one is there). has anyone else seen this? i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs harmful since the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù seem to be friendly/nice, just curious of other‚Äôs experiences.",,1
"hi everyone,my father suffers dementia ‚Äî we aren‚Äôt totally sure which kind because he refuses to admit that anything‚Äôs wrong/is too proud to admit that anything is off. he was very successful, professionally and was always praised for his smarts during his career. in fact he has several patents from his career as a fiber-optical engineer, which he earned and is deservedly proud of.anyway. my mother, and his wife of 45 years, recently had open-heart surgery, which was so scary and so complicated. she suffered a stroke as a result, and it was an incredibly scary moment for our family. during her surgery and throughout her hospital stay, i stayed with my father. he had delusions about her whereabouts (suspected she‚Äôd taken off to mexico; it was around the time of the freeze/power outages in texas and i blame ted cruz).it was awful. he‚Äôd wake me up in the middle of the night demanding answers. he was so confused, and so hurt. i did a shitty job explaining. i was so frustrated!but there was an evening where he woke me up, totally lucid. he apologized for what was going on, admitted he knew his mind was waning, and apologized to me and our family for the burden he‚Äôd left us with. i was totally floored. i hugged him, i told him that we loved him, that it wasn‚Äôt his fault, and that it was just as hard on all of us as it was in him. it made me feel like shit, honestly. but it was also so amazing. i documented all of it and reached out to my mom and sister.i...sort of can‚Äôt believe this actually happened. in hindsight, it feels like a dream. but it did happen ‚Äî it really did! has anyone else experienced something like this?i suppose that it doesn‚Äôt actually matter. my father won‚Äôt get any better; he‚Äôll only get worse. but have any of you experienced this moment of clarity? it seemed to me so unreal.",,1
"i know in my heart my dad has vascular dementia. i am a medical student in a family full of md's. we all agree.  he got covid in april and subsequently has descended into severe behavioral changes with cognitive decline. he is forgetting very basic things.  he has cerebral vasculitis confirmed by mri angiogram (post-covid).  he started cheating on my mom in june with a 35 year old (a few years older than me - his youngest daughter), divorced her in december after 33 years of marriage, moved to another state, and cannot keep a job due to angry outbursts. he is getting paranoid. he keeps thinking he can manage this with hyperbaric chambers and supplements. his reality testing is intact - he knows something is wrong - but refuses to take the appropriate treatment measures. &#x200b;the absolute hardest part is that my dad is and was so abusive. at 8: he threw baskteballs at me, physically abused me, made me live with a 16 year-old-exchange student despite catching him in my room in the middle of the night. he did not kick him out until he was caught being inappropriate with his friends 7 year old daughter. he would shake me and throw me as a kid. he bruised my 4'11"" year old sister. he made her eat pasta until she vomitted as punishment. he held  my foot in hot water while i cried because i ""need to recover as fast as possible so i could play basketball."" at physical therapy he turned the tens unit up as high as it could go on me and refused to turn it down despite my crying to please make it stop. he kicked me out of the house for telling the carpet cleaner to clean the wrong carpet. i went to drug rehab and he taunted me about how he never read the letters i wrote him. he financially and emotionally abused my mother. most people say i got the worst of it. he was obsessed with me playing basketball growing up. his favorite method of punishment was public humiliation. he would constantly threaten to abandon me. he was such a cruel father. he told me that all men would ever want from me is sex. in response to my sobriety, he has frequently told me that i shouldnt expect a congratulations for doing what i am supposed to do. when i moved back in with my parents after divorcing my abusive ex-husband, he mocked me for being afraid him of murdering me and made a rule that i should not talk about the divorced around him because i should just ""get over it."" he left me alone with coach known for preying on teenage girls. even after i told him i did not want to see him because he called me to drink with him. he tricked me into seeing him during a home visit from rehab. when i told him about being sexually assaulted and harrassed by a coworker he told me - i will never find a perfect working environment. trauma does not disappear because of his dementia. it does not undo all of the terrible things he did to me as a child. i do not want to live life in regret that i should or could have done more to help him but i also don't want to endanger my sobriety and mental health (bipolar disorder) by forcing myself into a positiion that re-traumatizes me and harms me. my mother is a saint and has said she will do what she can (go with him to doctors, help him get into a home if needed, etc.) because he is our father. sometimes i wish that he would just go away forever and end everyones suffering including his own.",,1
"i am the primary caregiver of an 83 year old female who appears to have abandoned all semblance of respect for family members and household helpmates. she regularly mocks the household nanny, treats children in the household in a vindictive and rude manner, and wants to do nothing the whole day. all she enjoys doing is cooking, and simply doesn‚Äôt have a daily routine. she wakes up, washes and dresses and essentially lays idle for the whole day. moreover, she does not want to engage in stimulating activities. i recently purchased her a box of trinkets: puzzles, knitting equipment, books, board games and painting items. she has used nothing i bought her and instead prefers to watch television and, dare i repeat it, be on the dole for the whole day. her table manners have slowly receded into nothingness, she blurts out things all the times, shouts randomly. please advise on ways to help her.",,1
"my mother came home from rehab on friday. since then nothing happens unless i tell her. ex. let's go potty now. can you move to the table? it's time to go pot your plants. let's go potty again. i put your food on the table. go ahead and eat it before it gets cold.  here's you meds. take them. drink the shake i put in front of you 5 mins ago. remember you should be thinking about where you want to read or call your sister. she is fully competent. has no mental deficits. i feel so much pressure&stress in having to keep the flow of caregiving and control her every move & thought. i literally control everything that happens in our household. mom, the dog & me. does anyone have the same problem or suggestions?",,1

"this morning routine was normal.  but add her delicate emotional state.   we are ready to get up and walk from the room to her chair in the living room, but before she gets up from sitting on the bed she has a cry.   when she steps into the tv room she pauses and has a cry.   when her daughter greets her, she has a cry.  now i'm at work around town.  her daughter, my wife is at work too.  but another daughter arrives to spend the day till we get home from work.  noticing her eating is changing.   she loves what's in front of her, others times she just sees all that food and moans about attempting to eat it.   last 2 days she has had minimal intake.  nagging her in a way, to keep eating.  just a few more bites.  also water intake.  drink more water.  she tilts her body backwards to drink and all that effort and it's just a sip.   she needs more water.  we are after her, we keep reminding her to drink some water, eat your lunch.   finish the banana.",,1
"my grandmother (98 with alzheimer‚Äôs) takes a big extended release tablet that can‚Äôt be cut, crushed or dissolved and doesn‚Äôt come in suspension form. usually she takes her pills pretty easily, but she can‚Äôt seem to understand how to swallow them this morning. i tried demonstrating and explaining different ways, i tried putting it in a spoon with some yogurt, i tried pushing it back on her tongue, but she just pockets in her cheek or under her tongue. it took four of her normal glasses of water to get down two other pills and only because they pretty much dissolved in her mouth. does anyone have any tips or tricks?",,1
"the situation:my paternal grandmother is 87 years old, she has her own little house in our backyard. my mother and i are her care takers eventhough my dad is retired and sits at home all day. her 4 sisters died from alzheimers and she's been getting worse since her husband died in 2019.recently she's been having issues taking her medication. my mother used to fill up her pill box for an entire week and hand it to her sunday night, then she'd either tell us she's out of pills in the middle of the week or she'd have pills left at the end of the week, causing a lot of arguing on whether or not she took her meds/took more than she should.recently we decided to give her the pills everyday so she at least can't take doubles and we have a better eye on it. she still sometimes claims we didn't give her the pills etc but its manageable.now about 3 weeks ago my brother said he noticed our grandma has a bunch of pills in her kitchen cabinet. my dad went to look for them and didn't find anything, grandma was insulted that we think she would hide pills. it was worrying cause ever since her husband died she'd make remarks saying she wishes she was dead too and that she would ""just take some pills and be gone"".but since my dad didn't see the pills, we figured my brother must've seen something else and moved on.now last night at dinner my mother went to the kitchen to get a glass and when she returned she whispered to me that my brother is right, theres a bunch of pills in the cabinet.now we don't know what to do. should i confront my grandma and possibly cause a lot of drama? or should i just take the pills out of the cabinet without saying anything.",,1
"mental issues are kicking in. i find myself treating my grandmother exactly like my daughter. i‚Äôm in three modes: restriction, prevention, damage control. i‚Äôm constantly waiting on the next fall. and dreading it because i know i can‚Äôt do the after care again. or if it will be the last fall. i get mad at the physical therapists when they tell her it‚Äôs okay to not use her walker in her ‚Äúsafe spaces‚Äù because that‚Äôs where she has always fallen. but if i tell her to use her walker, i‚Äôm hindering what little bit of achievement she feels. i‚Äôm forgoing family events, not even bothering to plan things with my kids (3 and soon to be born). i find myself realizing i can‚Äôt be her socialization, her pharmacist, her driver, her therapist, her beauty tech, her landing pad, her nurse, etc anymore because i am struggling to be all that and do it for my kids too. i feel guilty for admitting that i can‚Äôt do it anymore, i feel guilty for not doing more than i already do, i feel guilty for researching assisted living. i feel guilty for wanting freedom, and being petrified of what freedom could lead to because adjusting to anything at her age is so hard.",,1
"so, i'm a caregiver to my spouse, work full time, and have 3 kids (teenagers).  been doing it for a decade at this point.she's got limited mobility, and while she says it's hard for her to get the kids to do anything, we all had a meeting of the minds and a chore chart has helped.  sort of dad's voice when he's away from home, and she can refer to it so we can at least attempt to co-parent rather than it feeling like i'm a single parent and cleaning up after everyone.but, it never seems to fail, stuff only gets kicked into high gear when i walk into the house, and then she starts yelling at the kids why they didn't get their chores done, and then they're rushing around to do them while i'm trying to cook dinner.it really makes me feel like crap when i go home.  ""oh no, dad is home!""i feel like this more of a parenting fail, but when i'm the only parent that can actually ""do"" anything around the house, and the wife plays games all day or sleeps, it's like i have a 4th teenager in the house.",,1
"how do you start the conversation of discussing expectations and when/whether or not you‚Äôll have to eventually put your loved one in a home? my grandmother is nearly 85. she lives with my husband and i. she has parkinson‚Äôs. we are solely responsible for her care. we have a 3.5 year old girl and a baby boy on the way. she forgets her walker, she makes questionable decisions (she will attempt to walk across the floor with her pants around her ankles if she‚Äôs had an accident, without her walker, despite being a fall risk), she refuses to ask for help with the biggest things and often refuses to do the smallest things by herself. the other night, she had another fall. and i knew without any doubt that if she had suffered another break, for any limb or any type that required assistance or surgery, she‚Äôd have to go to a home. because i‚Äôm 9 months pregnant. my kids have to come first. before you ask... there is no other family. her son, my uncle, is in california. my dad is dead. my cousin lives in florida and cares for her own mother (my grandmother‚Äôs sister) and the mother‚Äôs husband. i know this conversation needs to happen. but i also don‚Äôt want it to seem like we are just throwing her to the curb, especially since from the beginning, she has split home repairs with us and paid ‚Äúrent‚Äù monthly. we had a ‚Äúroommate until you need more‚Äù agreement... but we never expected the decline that she‚Äôs had in just less than a year.",,1
"hello all, something happened today that i found to be a bit weird and i'm looking for some opinions. first let me give some details. my grandma is the only close family member i have left. she is 92 and in pretty good shape (for her age). she has mild dementia, (not alz.) and needs daily help but not 0-24 supervision. i used to live at hers for a while but now i live at a rental. i call almost every day and visit her 3-4 days a week. i buy her food and stuff from the store. she has caregivers that are free for her because of a kind of support she has. mon-fri someone is here 10am-12, then then usually the lady in my story comes from 4pm-8pm and on weekends it's only the lady, like 2pm-8pm. she wears a button on her wrist that is connected to a box and on that she can could call for help any time. this level of supervision has always been enough so far luckily.let me say i don't know about the laws of caregiving for old people around the world, i'm from middle-europe and i'm not even sure how they work here. but i never fully trusted these people doing the caregiving and especially this lady seems to be egoistic and a bit shady sometimes. you know, the kind of people you talk to and seem kind but give a feeling that they aren't completely trustworthy. her bosses are in the same category. they are from a company hired by a foundation that deals with the type of support my grandma gets. they seem ok dealing with the daily works but i always had a feeling about this woman that she seemed a bit shady along with the entire company she works for... and i heard stories about caregivers trying to get what old people have... i don't know how and what, the flat is under my ownership (couldn't sell it in her life even if i wanted to, just own it) so it's her money that could people want somehow but the whole thing might just be my paranoia.... or just wanting to get her under guardianship since they have already tried this before but didn't succeed. she also made a fuss recently about not liking me getting into the arranging of grandma's medical stuff whenever i feel like it and either she deals with it 100% or gives it up and i have to deal with it 100%. i'm a bit short tempered and she got upset and we fought about this for like 2 hours (she didn't seem to understand that i didn't want to offend her and i had no intention of taking over grandma's medical stuff, just decided to call the doctor for the prescriptipons on an impulse) and after this i decided to avoid her from now on and only talk to her on the phone since i don't really like her personality.so grandma had to go to a new doctor today since her old neurologist resigned and the memory-psychiatrist she belongs to haven't seen her before due to the pandemic. but now she got both shots and the doctor refused to prescribe her meds any more without seeing her at least once. caregiver also said she should definetly go and today they went. the time wasn't good to me so i didn't go despite that i would have loved to be there in person. i called her after and they said everything was ok, her condition is ok still, took one of her pills away and she might not need to go again in the lack of a new problem. the caregiver then told me she came earlier today and so will leave earlier too, so i decided to also visit grandma today and got on a bus. when i got here i wanted to sit on a bench and smoke a cigarette still before i came up and that's when i noticed the caregiver lady across the street a few meters from the house holding a piece of paper and talking to the phone to someone (her boss, i assume). i think she didn't notice me so i tried to hear some of what she was talking about since i was pretty sure she was holding grandma's results from today and telling her boss about it. but of course when i crossed the street a bit further up and stood in the cover of a pillar, before i could have heared anything, she started to head home (i still think she didn't see me). i didn't want to follow her so i came up and was sure her result wasn't going to be here. she took one already before and said that was so she could call them for the meds (and got the appiontment then). but now all her meds are prescribed and still she took the paper. i called her to be sure and she acted like she left it in her bag and took it by accident and will return it next day. but i'm 99% sure she was acting and took it on purpose and i'm also pretty sure that's what she was holding and talking about to someome when i saw her by accident. regardless i said ""ok, i'll read it another day then"". is this normal or am i rightfully afraid that there is something shady going on? is there anyone she's allowed to tell the results to? don't know what's their agenda could be but something about this unsettles me. maybe it's nothing but these people weren't the most trustworthy people anyways and i know there is a lots of shady stuff in the caregiver-business so i'm not sure what to think.sorry for long text and thank you for your replies!",,1
"i never really got along with my dad. he lives with us and was very independent until he had a fall in 2018. he was diagnosed with parkinsons and it's been downhill since then.we have a caregiver from 8:30 to 3:30 but after that it's me.  weekends it's all me.he has night time incontinence and because of parkinsons he is often constipated. we use a condom catheter, but lately he's been pulling it out in the middle of the night. which means it's a mess in the morning and on a saturday morning i am washing sheets and cleaning him up. we keep telling him to call us before he stands up cause a fall can really do a number on him. but he is stubborn or thinks he will bother us so does it without calling us. my patience is wearing thin and we often get into a screaming match.  i feel so guilty and depressed because i don't have much of a life, can't go out or do anything fun.i know many of you are in the same boat. any tips on how to deal with this.thank you.",,1
"i‚Äôve had many illnesses for many years and was diagnosed with lewy body dementia, on wed last week every time inhaled it felt like 2-3 broken ribs so i went the er thursday am and was told i have pluracy, omg the pain is horrible but it‚Äôs made dementia symptoms worse, i wake up talking, i‚Äôm answering question i hear but nobody speaks, my spasms are 10x worse, nauseated, and more, this is devastating",,1
"during my stay at home, i noticed that my mom tends to forget that she had a conversation with me in the morning and then comes and proceeds to have the same conversation with me in the evening.this is not a regular thing. happens like once a 1/2 weeks. it usually happens with stuff she's a bit happy about to tell me. earlier i used to tell her that she's told me this already but now i don't. i just listen. i was also going through alzhimers and dementia webmd. short term memory loss is one of the earlier symptoms.i am sort of worried about her. she's a working lady and the stress on her job has not reduced but increased.what all steps can i do now to make sure that the rest of her life is happy and comfortable? and what can i do to reduce chances of her getting a brain disease in future?",,1

"i'm in a low place right now.  i can't do this anymore.  we're 5 years past her diagnosis of vascular dementia.  the daily stress of thinking of her and worrying about her and wondering if i'm doing the right thing and how long will her money last her.  and what happens when the money runs out?  how do i care for her then?  what makes this the absolute worst is that i love her so very very much and the feeling of wanting to be free from the burden of her care makes me feel so conflicted and filled with self-hate.  her dementia is caused by a lifetime of high blood pressure, so i have no idea how long her journey will be with this horrible disease or what her progression will look like.  most online guides say the average lifespan after diagnosis is 5 years but that's due to so many people with vascular dementia having issues with strokes.  the pattern of progression is also different for her because it's not step-wise, it's gradual.  i have no idea how far along she is. i thought she was in stage 6 or stage 7 but now don't know.  she's talking pretty well still, can still remember some things pretty well, but she's mostly incontinent and sits in a wheelchair and scoots herself along with her feet.  she sleeps a lot.  she can't get herself out of bed alone but she can still feed herself and drink on her own with a straw. so many of her symptoms are contradictory - i don't know how to prepare or what to prepare for.  i'm in my 30's, she's in her 90's. i have a full time job and a young family and worry about all of them and the issues in my own life too. most of all, she's unhappy and says she's ready to meet jesus.  we both just want to be free.",,1
"my grandfather is one of the most outstanding people i have ever met. he never went to college, but was in the navy as an electrician, then built rocket parts for the apollo projects (unknowingly), then worked at a powerplant as one of their lead technicians.as a child, he worked his family's mechanic shop. throughout his entire adult life, he worked roughly 50 head of cattle. he's always been the person we go to when we need something repaired, be it our car, our furniture, or whatever, he was mr. fix-it. all this to say, my grandpa kept busy his entire life and was used to regular projects that we would give him.within the past few years, we've noticed that he's gotten a bit more confused in day-to-day conversation and activities. he is already a man of few words, but we noticed he was more hesitant to talk than usual. when he does talk, it takes him a lot longer to get a thought out than it used to. i asked him to build a bookshelf for me last fall and realized that he can no longer do such things while i was helping him, because he couldn't remember what measurements he had taken, which pieces he had already finished, and had general issues with the spatial comprehension he should've had to do this project. since then, the whole family has stopped asking him to take on projects for us, because we don't want to stress him out. earlier this month, he sold off all of his cattle because he didn't trust himself to take care of them anymore. he no longer allows himself to drive because he's scared he'll get confused while driving. he's gone from being a man that could do anything to a man who can't do anything that he used to enjoy. i'm reaching out for help because we're trying to find something to give him to keep him engaged, something he can do that makes him feel like he has a purpose. it hurts so much to see him feeling like he has no purpose, and i want to help him so much. context and potentially useful info: he has gotten tested for alzheimer's but has not been diagnosed. his evaluation score was a few points off. the dr. has instead diagnosed him with the ""cognitive impairment"" stage, i believe. he is otherwise healthy. he likes sudoku, board games, and taking care of bird feeders on his property although i am not sure how much of those activities he's still able to do to his previous ability.tl;dr: aging grandfather with supposed onset alzheimer's needs activities to feel useful.",,1
"hey guys, so i grandmother lost her smartphone and now she won't keep bothering everyone about where it is. although, i know that if we give her a new phone she will not like it. how should i handle this? this being alzheimer's, you'll have to repeat that answer often because she'll likely ask it repeatedly. a smart phone is too smart for an alzheimer's sufferer; hell, mine is even too smart for me, and i'm the caregiver. not willing to shell out another $800 for another smartphone doomed to be lost soon, i got dh a low-end model for about $150. so i got him a flip phone (about $30) - same story. now if he wants to make a call, i dial my phone and hand it to him. then she could use it in the wi-fi, but have the calling turned off. we've decided we'll only be getting dad mid/low range samsungs due to his familiarity and their phone finding abilities are a bit more advanced than the usual. several years ago i went to a cell phone store with my children. they gave my kids some of the old former display phones as toys. i don’t know if they still have this or will do this but it might be an option (although obviously the phone wouldn’t work, but that is probably not a bad thing). i agree with all the posts. however i want to add my experience. my lo used her phone for a long time. it made her feel connected to the family and friends she knew around the country. i think she knows what it is... or something. all this to say - balancing quality of life for your lo, yourself, and your pocketbook is tough. best of luck. the best way to handle useless questions (my mom has a lot of them) is to distract. for example:   where is dad? “i don’t know, oh say would you like a cold drink?” stick to the here and now. i don't think she'll notice if it doesn't have service",,1
"but for the past year or so like clockwork around 8pm he wants to go home and it takes around an hour or more to make him ""stop"" and be content and stay. man it's so taxing. i mean he has incontinence bowel and urinary so i take care of that, and all the other stuff that comes with the territory no problem but this constant ""goin home"" gets me.. we have several different techniques that work with my dad:  the obvious one i take him home, we are lucky that we can leave town drive a short distance and reenter town on a different road. when he says home he means bed (especially at night) so mum takes him up to their room and he settles. a dog walk around the block, again exiting their estate on one road and reentering on a different road to break the cycle. obviously some of these won't fit your situation but please ask any questions and i will try my best to help. sometimes it means they want to go back to when they weren't sick. i'd grab his hand or hug him (to reassure him) and say something like ""ok, we'll head home after we x (insert activity here)"". my grandmother always wants to start the i don’t know why they brought me here conversation. usually she veers back off topic with the questions i’m asking her and forgets the original complaint. it doesn’t make it any less irritating, but it calms her down when i give her the options. my mom does the same thing, but she is already bedridden. i will just say ""we're here,"" and mention the name of community we live in, but in our case it's the same house for 50 years, but sometimes she still mentions europe where she grew up and asks for her mom who also passed 45 years ago. you might have to say something and reference the name of community he is talking about if it's not the home you are at now. it's like a switch in atmosphere, and most patients with alzheimer's respond pleasurably to music; it's an area of the brain that remains functional longer than others. it helps distract them and change their focus from ""home"" to the music. i like u/kitkatinkerbell's suggestions and have used some of the same techniques when helping my sil care for my brother, especially ""taking him home"" by getting in the car, riding several miles and returning, saying ""we're home!"" i admire you so much for caring for your dad! that's such a loving, caring way to honor your father. ...in the day- to-day struggle, i know how much of a strain it can be, how much stress and fatigue you must be feeling. i hope you're finding support with other caregivers who understand your challenges, and i hope you have family or others who can offer relief for you so you can get the rest you need. bless you! cheers to all the hard work you have done to take care of him! since it is always happening at the same time, it may be from a long forgotten routine from years back. try to engage and ask if there is someone they want to see at home, or is there something they need to do? or if they just want to be at home. it may be physical, sensory ,(is it too loud, too quiet? hth",,1
"fil is in al but not memory care, so he can come and go. i am worried that he’ll over do it and not be able to make it back home and get stranded. he wears a medical alert necklace 24/7 but it doesn’t have a gps locate so i was thinking about adding an air tag with the kind of water resistant cover you use for dog tags. thoughts? now is the time to start prevention measures so that he does not get lost. often seniors that go missing are in early stages. this is when they are most ambulatory and can easily get confused. just last week a lady where i live was still driving and went missing. she was in the early stages and her family was still letting her drive. my mom thought it was ok to let my dad drive shortly after he was diagnosed and he went the wrong way down a street. i put my foot down and said no more driving. my mother's assisted living facility had a system just for this phase of dementia. she wore a bracelet that triggered an alarm if she attempted to through any of the exterior doors. of course, it was an added option that i begrudgingly paid, but it worked quite well. my mother could do anything she liked within the facility (including interior courtyards) but had to have an escort if she left the building. i'm actually surprised your facility is allowing someone with alzheimer's (albeit in the early phases) to be in assisted living without some sort of safeguard. i tried airtags with my kids. it's ok but doesn't give you minute-by-minute updates. it works great if they go to a friend's house after school, but near useless at an amusement park as it doesn't update frequently enough. if your fil got lost, the airtag may tell you where he was 1 minute ago or 30 minutes ago. i am in a similar situation. i use find my friends on my mom’s phone to track her. you can add alerts for when they leave certain places, are not at certain places etc. of course only works if they have their phone on them. i also track her vehicle’s gps. we considered the air tag but being an apple user myself, id have to swap between her apple id and mine to see it which would get difficult. tile is another one you can use, but it does emit a sound when trying to track which could be startling. there’s a lot of ways to track and drawbacks to each. as long as you find one that’s reliable and works for you, all the better. keeping them safe is top priority. i guess he doesn't take a mobile phone around with him? if so there are apps like life360 that will give you tracking at all times. i haven't used apple air tags but have heard stories about how they helped people retrieve their stolen bikes pretty well so its worth investigating. how could you guarantee he always had it with him? &nbsp;   check out these little spark nano gps trackers. they are super inexpensive. my sis got them for her teen's car a while back and really liked it. we'll most likely be getting one for mom soon-ish. i have an airtag for my hubby. (about stage 5-6) i have an iphone as does our three children. the airtag  is assigned to my iphone and shows up on the apple find my ap under the “items” tab. i have activated the “share my location” option on my phone with each of my kids. they can see where my hubby and i are. this is a safety support for both of us. i put the airtag inside hubs wallet as he always puts his wallet in his pants and i secured in place with double sided tape. this has worked well for us.",,1
"he'll take money out, then forget that he took money out and then take more out. (you shouldn't even be driving himself to the bank where the atm. we do the best weekend to stop him but it's not easy to keep track of him 24/7)  he gets a state issue disability check every month. and our mortgage payments are set to automatically withdraw from his account. always has been. takes out 400 to 600 a month to buy pot. in the comments section of a different post someone suggested contacting social services about having his check split between him and someone else. something about how his bank has an overdraft thing. which means social services can't give him a certain amount of money knowing that it's only going to pay off the negative balance and then he won't have any left. i hope i'm explaining this right. i hope i'm making sense. we were trying to ask them to put $400 into his account as an allowance. and then put the rest of it into my mother's account. but because his account's always in the negative, they wouldn't do it. could we ask the bank to cancel the overdraft service? i know typically no one else can make changes to a bank account without the account holder there. but if we explain the medical situation, and we're not asking to take any money from him. or if we had some kind of doctor's note explaining he's incompetent, could we then take that to the bank and put my mom's name on his account as well? sorry if this is long and rambling. the various things you want to do would require him giving you durable poa (legal, business things). i take it you haven't had that discussion yet? what is your mom's role here? if your dad has been diagnosed with alzheimer's, he shouldn't be driving. it would be good if somehow the topic of diminishing capacity could be broached, or you have many large fights ahead of you. cut up his cards with scissors, take his tires off and roll them to a friend's house. seriously, he could kill someone driving. get serious. my dad used to do something similar. he was taking out cash every week because he only understood cash as really money any more. at one point the bank wouldn't even let him take out as much as he wanted. not sure if they were really allowed to do that... but they were aware of his issues. his car got taken away soon after that so i would have to take him to the bank. does he have a poa or anything in place? if not do it now while he's still somewhat with it. i used to have to drag my dad to the bank because he has a trust which makes everything a pain. he would just sit there and smile while i did everything for him. the bank was aware of the situation and was pretty nice about it. i think they're used to elderly customers having issues and in the end if it's a good bank they want to do what is best for their customer. you need power of attorney and to prevent him from getting to the assets in the first place. absolutely file for that asap. explain the situations to his doctors - they may not realize he’s as far gone as he is. you may also need to switch doctors and see someone who can properly evaluate him, because that is exactly why power of attorney was invented. to address situations like this. absence an incompetence hearing, and judgment, you need his signature for poa. you get it set up first, and then take him to the lawyer or whoever can do it for you, in our case, it was the bank. i don't know where you live, but cannabis is one of the most beneficial treatments for alzheimer's patients. far better and safer than anti-psychotic drugs. unfortunately, when it comes time for a care facility, that will not be available to him. that's my opinion and my experience. here's a good article :   move up the day that the money is taken out of the bank so it doesn’t sit there. speak to the branch manager about removing the overdraft protection.",,1
"short version (i can add info if needed), my fil is stage 4 dementia. roommate almost died and is still recovering. family member who was helping lost her husband. i am the legal guardian and i made arrangements for fil to go into assisted living. he can’t afford in home care and he doesn’t own his house (it’s in a trust, so he can use it until he dies but he doesn’t own it). he initially agreed with the move but now he’s changed his mind. the problem is that his house is rented to help pay for his care and the help he needed to live alone is no longer available. the reasons he gives for wanting to leave al are not grounded in reality. he’s not progressed enough for memory care, but al is optional and so they won’t keep him there against his will. i keep seeing advice not to try to correct someone with dementia, but if he walks out of there i don’t know what to do with him. see if you can visit the place a few times and tell him he lives there and you will be back to move his things there. maybe you and the al social worker could sit down with him and go over all his concerns. additionally, you need to remind him it's not as simple as going back to his old house, because it's rented out to someone else, and the roommate/caregiver is no longer available to help him with day to day affairs. explore options - maybe he would prefer a different al placement? you and the social worker can also go over some of his deluded beliefs (don't call them that in front of him!). show him where the eye drops are, and ask if he'd like someone to administer them to him. my dh who i am trying to put into memory care at present, has had similar delusions. and when he has lost a wallet by leaving it somewhere, he states that someone ""stole"" it. he can't locate most of the things he needs (constantly losing toothbrushes). good of you to look out for this man. my dad is in memory care and went through a similarly tough patch where he was paranoid, angry, argumentative, and distrustful. he worried about people taking his car and money (this included my mom, who he said his lawyer would be contacted, because she needed to get out of his house.) this passed after time, but it was a tough roughly 2 years. keep your fil a little more comfortable by finding lies that will calm him down. i'm constantly saying this to my mother during every conversation i have with her and she's been in memory care for almost a year. now that she is settled (she still isn't happy about it), she fears change and when i bring up finding a new facility for her, the thought of changing her routine scares her and she stops complaining (for a little while)  i was staunchly against medicating my mother for behavioral reasons because i didn't want to lose what little was left of her inside. move him, medicate him one thing i did with my dad is tell him we found him “an apartment with help” that was just a home base for him. i drove back there with him in my car, and when he saw the building, he said, “that’s a bad place.” i parked and he asked, “what are we doing here?” i said, “i need to speak to the lady at the front desk.” “should i stay in the car?” “no, come with me, i said.” he came with me, i checked us both in, walked him to his room, and we said goodbye like everything was fine. also, if he’s paranoid he may not want to take additional medications, but if he’s already taking medications, you could speak to his doctor about adding something for his mood (assuming you have medical poa?). that has helped my dad. good luck! my husband and sil try to logic her out of these delusions with evidence. she refuses to discuss assisted living and lives in the same town as sil. they check on her a few times a week, and my husband will stay with her 2-4 weeks at a time. (we are in another state) the other 2 siblings are no help. (she was also not the nicest person in younger years so they see her 1-2 times a year out of duty.) if he is a danger to himself, you can gain power of attorney and guardianship. my grandmother had moved al twice and both times she has gone through a phase of this when she first moved in. it went on months the first time, but she had progressed by the second move and it lasted a few weeks.",,1
"is there any want to stop/help a grandparent from leaving the house especially at night? i think they’ve tried locks but she figures it out. we bought some of those toddler door handle safety covers and that really did the trick. we also put those cheap slide locks at the base of the door and dad never noticed it to open the door. we had those cheap alarms on the doors but the rest of us would always forget about them and scare the crap out of ourselves when we went out the door. dad wasnt too bad about wandering at night but there was a short time he would get up. double keyed deadbolt. depending how far along your grandparent is, you may try one of those door decals that makes it look like a bookcase or something. also, an alarm on the door is wise. my fil installed double-keyed deadbolt locks and always keeps the keys hidden. door alarms - not terribly expensive and they wake you or an overnight attendant who can then intervene;",,1
"my grandfather has alzheimer’s (or possibly dementia) and is in full care by my grandmother (who admittedly is not the best with pushing for better medical care or testing from doctors). this morning he had an episode where he was laying down in bed, seemingly awake (eyes open and moving) but unresponsive to her calling him, touching him, etc. they took vitals and said that he was all good in that are and my grandfather refused to go to the hospital so they didn’t push it and left. my grandmother took him to his regular doctor today and said that it was just another stage of his decline. i am still concerned that it could be something else because i have never heard of it. i am the first point of contact for them but i am living out of state and trying to do my best from afar. does anyone have any experience with this? or can provide any more insight on what i should be doing next time i am there? my mom had a few episodes like this before we knew she had actual alzheimer’s. i actually think they co tributes to quicker cognitive decline, but the doctors always tested for stroke and other things and said they couldn’t find anything. i do believe it is a form of stroke, maybe medicine just hasn’t caught up with it yet.",,1
"my dad has been in memory care for a couple of months now. recently he had backpain and wouldn't leave his chair. so they sent him to the hospital to be checked on. they didn't find a source of the backpain (which seemed to go away on its own) but they did find blood clots in the lungs (blood thinners prescribed) and he was dehydrated so they pumped him with liquid. he was in bed for 3 or so days. when i came to pick him up from the hospital he couldn't walk. i was really annoyed that the hospital wasn't helpful in that regard, but i chalked it up to his feet being swollen from the fluids. with a lot of effort we finally managed to get him in the car, and back to the home. so i called today to see how he's doing and they said not great and that he's not walking on his own. apparently they can get him upright with assistance but he can't walk. the memory care doctor will be seeing him tomorrow so i know i just need to sit tight and not karen until then, but i'm just so frustrated. dr. google is telling me older people lose that function a lot faster after bed rest, but it just blows my mind. it’s not uncommon for this to happen after a hospital visit, but it’s dependent on a lot of factors. previous conditions obviously contribute but it could just be the new phase he is entering. or could it pass in the following week, as this happens too. the doctor should be able to determine what’s going on. i know edema causes a lot of issues with this population’s mobility, but exercise and compression socks can help fix that; a pt or ot could be suggested as well. i’d say wait to hear what the doctors says. keep us posted. look into massage. it helps my husband with his arthritic spine. medicare covers it under certain conditions, which includes chronic back pain. also, if your patient has been hospitalized for three days, medicare covers 100% of a nursing home stay as long as discharged directly from hospital to nursing home. (check your insurance but we recently did this.) if you can't swing that, maybe physical therapy. good luck. i had a similar experience with my mom. within a few days of moving into memory care she had several falls and then could no longer walk. that was right around new years and she has not walked since. sorry to say this was the beginning of the end for my grandmother. the muscles deteriorate fast and ingrained muscle memory that is not exercised for a couple days evaporates. remember that alzheimer’s attacks the brain’s ability to make conscious choices first. the decision of lifting your foot to step; planting it firmly, feeling confident enough on the first foot’s ability to bear weight 100% for a moment, that you lift the other… this is where she got frustrated and yelled. we tried asking her sweetly to let us help and she yelled and refused for hours.",,1
"growing up i didn’t get to see my dads side grandmother a lot. she lived a state over, and so i only got to see her maybe once a summer and over a holiday, unless she drove to see us, and those weeks always went by way too fast. she sold that house and moved to florida when i was in middle school. over my time in high school she developed alzheimer’s, and we only ever talk when i call her, and it’s dependent on her being at the phone or not having lost her phone. and i loved the talks we had. it took her a minute to realize it was me,but when she reconnected those dots she cheered up, unlike any conversation she has had with my dad, mom, or sister the past year, and she started asking all kinds of questions about things i didn’t think she’d know about or remember. after we hung up the phone, i cried, it’s been two hours, and i’m unable to do anything else but think about the conversation we just had. 😭 with alzheimer's, you grieve the loss of your loved one long before they breathe their last breath. i'm sorry you are experiencing this. a lot of elderly people really value cards and letters. you could make a nice difference in your grandmother's life if you would send her one card or letter every week. it probably doesn't come naturally to you because of your generation, but i think it would have a big impact. firstly, i want to say i’m so sorry this is affecting your grandmother and now by extension you so badly. my grandmother developed alzheimer’s when i was in middle school and i spent a good chunk of my teen years being a caregiver. i wouldn’t change my circumstances as i, like you, just wanted to see her. i’m sad reading this because i have been in your shoes (in it again with my own mom atm but this ain’t about me) so i fully understand and feel your pain. as the commenter above me said, alzheimer’s is hell because we are grieving the loss of someone who isn’t physically “gone” yet for a long time. i’d also agree with them that cards and letters would be a nice thing to consider. if this isn’t too personal to ask, can she still read ok? only asking because my mom is at a stage where she’s losing that ability, but i’ve discovered that if i can make her a small painting or piece of art, she really cherishes it and it’s something they can always look at and find new meaning in, and even subconsciously make a connection to you in it in their minds. you can dm me if you ever want to talk to someone, i’m sadly no stranger to this evil illness. i wish i could give you a big hug right now (if you’re into hugs, that is lol) but i hope at least me letting you know that you’re understood and not alone can provide some comfort. sending tons of love to you and your grandma and family 💜",,1
"hi there, my dad lives in a memory care unit. he has become aggressive with staff which is so opposite his personality. i know it’s just the dementia progression. he got admitted to psych this evening and they called me to tell me they had to restrain him to his bed because he assaulted a nurse. i am the only one responsible for his decision making/care and i just want to know what to expect. this is so painful; i can’t even believe this is a real illness. without having any information on your father's case: what other care options have been tried? we frequently have aggressive patients who only get combative during personal care. the kind choice can be to deal with a smelly resident, and reduce the amount of showers given etc. sometimes hygiene care really can't be avoided, but often the frequently can be turned down by a lot. same goes for 'having to sit at the table' or being woken up/ sent to bed/ interrupted from wandering etc. often the nurses are trying what they think is best, but it's not always what's right for the patient. your permission to adapt his care can go a long way. so sorry you're dealing with this aspect of the disease. is he on any mood stabilizers? i know what you mean about not being able to believe it’s a real disease. i am a nurse and we get situations like your dad very frequently. physical restraints are used temporarily until chemical restraints (mood stabilizer and such) are adjusted to a new level required to keep the patient calm. this stage of the disease lasts for a wide variety of time from person to person, but it doesn’t last forever. some it’s just a short time, they respond to medication quickly, some needs multiple readjustments of medication. allow the doctors to medicate your dad as much as necessary. in my experience, some doctors are too conservative with medication and the patient ends up in physical restraints for days. but finding that balance is hard, because you also don’t want the patient “snowed” or asleep for days due to medications. still, being asleep is better than being awake and restrained. it may trigger him more to have you visit so sometimes it’s a good idea to hold off, but you can check with his nurses about what his mood is prior to and after your visits to see how it affects him. when you do see your dad, try to think of him not as your dad but as someone who is afraid. it may help you to disassociate, at least during the visit. i would sign him up for the cassava sciences pre-screening for their drug in trial. every patient has shown improvement from as little as 27 days. it is on their website. please take a look. link for pre-screening ^^   above is a youtube link of testimonies from patient’s family members that are currently on the drug “simufilam”",,1
"my grandpa has been slowly losing his memories as alzheimer's takes its toll. he's recently been moved into the memory care unit of his nursing home, and myself and the rest of the family do what we can to visit and talk to him regularly. the thing is, grandpa has been a wickedly funny man his whole life, and yesterday he commented on his memory loss and the loops himself. i don't know who needs to hear this today, but growing older and losing one's memory is tragic and funny, all rolled up in a confusing yarn ball. its ok to do both at the same time. i was watching news with my grandma and bringing her cut up apples, smack dab in the middle of an ukranian war segment. i held my breath, this is it, a truth about life is coming. we look for the humor too. my grandma is still in assisted living. she getting closer and closer to needing more care. but so far she's able to stay pretty safe and independent in her little apartment. my grandpa passed almost 10 years ago. my wife and i have found out we are going to be parents. telling my mother in law that she is going to be a grandmother gets her excited everytime. it has its moments very rarely. we skyped with our daughter a few days ago and every time my wife walked past i would show her the phone and it was a new experience every time seeing the kid.",,1
"my grandma got diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia something like that  please tell me how bad it is im shaking she’s only 60   is it true she will only live about 6-7 more years? im 13 she won’t even live to have my first drink with me  is it really one step down from full alzheimer’s??? it's different for each person. i've heard of people who were diagnosed with alzheimer's and still living 20 years later! not the most common outcome, but i think i made my point. if a drink with your grandma was something you were looking forward to, you can do it now. one drink won't hurt anyone, even if you are just 13. i recommend reading the book “somebody i used to know” by wendy mitchell. she was also diagnosed with early-onset dementia around the same age. one possible benefit to an early diagnosis is that decline can be slower. my mother was diagnosed four years ago at 64 and while she has lost some cognitive abilities, her progression so far has been slow. guessing someone with dementia’s longevity is hard, but i would say enjoy the time you have with her now. having a loved one with dementia forces you to really live in the present moment with them. i believe you are asking about frontotemporal dementia (ftd)  with my wife it has been a vicious and fast progressing disease. i know at 13 you are ready to start talking about adult things, but the details and the way this disease changes a person is something everyone should avoid learning about. watching what this disease has done to my wife has been the toughest thing i have had to deal with in my life. my advice to you, is make memories with your grandma now, knowing that very soon this disease will change her into a different and very unpleasant person. all cases are different in terms of speed of progression. know this....your grandma will eventually act out in ways she can't control. remember it's not her, but her diseased brain. cherish the good times.",,1
"how does everyone handle things with their siblings when it's a parent who needs care? i don't know how to get conversations and plans going about my dad's care without starting a fight. hello,  i had a very similar situation with my sister. i was the live-in caretaker for my mom and step dad and she was in the same city. i was drowning in caring for them, having some mental health issues because of the toll of caregiver fatigue. we sat down with a social worker and talked about how i needed her support. progress was slow, but 4 years later she is my best friend and we depend on eachother a lot. our mom is now in the late stage and in a memory care unit. please give your sibling the offer of support before they reach that point. literally same scenario, my wife and i are the caretakers to my mother in law with mid stages alzheimers. her son who lives 10 mins away visits once or maybe twice a month. hasn't done much for her care and i believe doesn't like seeing his mother in her condition. unfortunately you cannot change them to make them care more, either they are willing or not. it's a bad situation and i would wish all parties put the same effort in. it's like every bad sibling interaction from childhood on is happening again with my sisters. it's tearing us apart and i'm thinking it'll not be repaired. my brain is tired tonight but it's like family roles, our roles as siblings and roles with parents have created patterns that got worse with ailing parents. if i could redo the last few years i'd ensure that my step up sister didn't take on so much. i'd also care less about worrying that i'd step on toes or hurt feelings and care more about stuff just getting done. the sibling who is good with your dad:  support her every way possible. bring meals, do chores, drive dad places, give her money and ask if there's anything else you can do. hint:  most caregivers could you use a respite caregiver so they can get to the dentist or have their hair cut. mention if he's losing weight, is he sleeping well, what goofy thing has he done lately (my dh recently peed in a wastebasket in the night, but didn't remember doing it). don't ask her for help, but at least she's in the loop when possibly bigger decisions need to be made. first we had to identify who our parents had put in charge if any. hunted for papers to find out who was the power of attorney. you could have a social worker come to your parents house with or without a nurse and evaluate your parents needs. once the social worker knows what is needed, a seperate meeting could occur with all family members present to hear what mom and dad need. responsibilities can be assigned to each in the sw presence to avoid conflict. remember though, you need to consider the life of each person. for example, i had a brother who was currently taking care of his inlaws. three of us really worked to help our parents out and we were successful. & tears. where there strengths were with our parents. if you don't have a poa then ask the social worker what can be done to do this. it might take a day in court to be established but will give you legal access to handling their affairs. i hope this helps.",,1
"we too have gone to all finger food and an air fryer has helped quite a bit. wife gets ensure for breakfast. i bet dad would love that. thanks for posting! 😊 really nice. for my mom, we found that small portions really helped. 💕 yep, finger-food grazing plates are the way to go! a few years ago i got my mum sporks (spoon/fork) for when cutlery is needed - also makes it easier.",,1
"i have a parent who tells me they've been diagnosed with alzheimer's. my relationship with the parent has been trying for my entire life due to their mental illness and, i believe, extreme narcissism. the issue i have is that i'm on my own and they're in one of the poorest states of the country, so, i'd be looking at some pretty limited options in terms of work and life, to say nothing of the fact that they've never really willingly been there since i graduated in terms of safety net or helping me in my career. the parent has a partner but they're in their 80s so... honestly, and i may get tons of shit for this. i would suggest avoiding completely uprooting your life, career and future for a parent you are not close with, and harbor any amount of resentment towards. i honestly don't believe just bc you birthed a kid or two, that you're entitled to their time/effort and anguish..... especially if you were  a shit parent. and taking care of a much loved relative w/ alzheimer's is hard on the good days. i would see about taking family leave for as long as you can, in order to try and get a sense of what they have going on now/what she needs & how to set things up for management from afar. get medical poa at minimum, switch all physician contact info to you, also look into financial poa if possible. (may be much harder w/ a spouse or partner involved) if she is still fairly self sufficient, i would try and find a facility that starts with assisted living, and has steps for future memory care. (we wish we could have gotten my grandma into her facility sooner, when she was more ""with it"" she's always been very social, and if she had more time to adjust prior to decline, we think she would be more comfortable now) if you can get her set up where she's comfortable, and manage her care from afar i would, in your situation. that or find a facility close to where you are now, and move her there for you. if career prospects and everything is as bad as you say, i think avoiding it would be overall better. they moved closer to me, a nearby city where 2 siblings live so i don't get the brunt of it. it's a lot of work, tons of paperwork and research as they decline. from my own experience, a rocky relationship gets worse. i have a really hard time fighting my own feelings and being kind when i just want to walk away. maybe it'd be different if my mother liked me but who knows. if it's affordable this is the time to look into transitional living, independent to memory care. it can be complex, so much to factor in. oh jeez i'm sorry to sound so negative! it's just a struggle i'm currently dealing with. i have the opposite situation as you, my dad is the kindest, sweetest man i’ve ever known. he’s in an “apartment with help” (memory care) 10 minutes away which is centrally located between my siblings and i. and it can still be really stressful. my mother died suddenly in november 2020. i believe it was due to the stress of caregiving. add to that the narcissism of your parent and other mental health issues you’ve mentioned, and uprooting your life and moving to a place with limited career options sounds like a dream come true for a narcissistic parent and a nightmare for the child of a narcissist. unless they’re willing to give you poa or move to “an apartment with help” i personally wouldn’t move there. if they expect you to move there and be their whipping boy/girl for the rest of their life i would make it clear it’s not happening. and then i would expect them to say what an awful son/daughter you are because that’s what narcissists do. i’m so sorry you have to go through this. please keep us updated! i found a local support group for adult children of alzheimer’s patients through alz.org. if you have to be the primary caretaker, move them to you, or both of you move somewhere with max. options and support. my family and i did exactly this about 1.5 years ago. don't give up your job and social network to become a caretaker to an aging narcissist. nope, you'll simply get verbally abused.. we moved my mil from florida to nc to live with us instead.",,1
"my dad is 50. i’m his primary caregiver, he has early onset alzheimer’s and every day i see him get worse. every day when i wake up i feel this gaping hole in my chest, and by the time i go to bed at night it’s so bad i can barely breathe from it. had to get therapy for it still working on this. end of last year my wife started asking me things that made it clear that at certain times, she didn't know who i am. ""where do you live? but every day is a little worse: more uncertainty, more people and places gone. (it is right next to the bed). so coping is really, so far, just a matter of keeping perspective. i fear that one day, probably very soon, reality will hit. i think coping is a matter of letting go of how you want it to be and instead, knowing  what to expect. (and, of course, acting accordingly)   ^(not sure this is helpful. i think i just wanted to type this out to read it back to myself) i try to remember simple is better. simple answers, simple expectations and try to care for myself. i help my mother with my dad, they live with my husband and myself. i vent regularly to my husband. but i also take antianxiety meds. in started then not long after my dad was diagnosed i did try to wean off them butt i got cancer and went back on. make sure you get assistance. it can be a family member taking over for an evening or an side. you gotta take breaks, even if you do absolutely nothing during those breaks. it's mostly a slow process. my mother struggled with expecting my dad to still be able to do things and communicate but she adjusted. just remember to take care of yourself. my dad got diagnosed at 61/62 for early onset but he was showing signs before that and let me tell you, coping is really hard. try to put yourself in the mindset of ‘they cannot help it, they’re not trying to annoy you’ …being primary caregiver is a huge burden to carry so try to get as much external support as you can. my brothers and i would work from my parents’ house 1-2 days per week to take care of him while my mom worked, my aunts and uncles would all come by as often as possible to help too. he’s now in a nursing home at 66 because he couldn’t walk and my parents house was becoming a huge danger to him but we visit him every day and feel a little lighter knowing he’s in a place where they have the tools and machines to get him through the day. i try to remember simple is better. simple answers, simple expectations and try to care for myself. i help my mother with my dad, they live with my husband and myself. i vent regularly to my husband. but i also take antianxiety meds. in started then not long after my dad was diagnosed i did try to wean off them butt i got cancer and went back on. make sure you get assistance. it can be a family member taking over for an evening or an side. you gotta take breaks, even if you do absolutely nothing during those breaks. it's mostly a slow process. my mother struggled with expecting my dad to still be able to do things and communicate but she adjusted. just remember to take care of yourself.",,1
"nan it’s important to not remind her of the dog’s death if she asks where the dog is. when this happened to my dad, we always made up some excuse like the dog was at the vet or getting groomed. after a while, he forgot about the dog. sometimes it is best to fib for her comfort. you can say she went to the groomers. the excuse doesn’t even need to be a good one since she won’t remember it anyway. say the dog is out for a walk, or the vet, or at the dog park. my first suggestion is: give it time because sad to say, she may forget about her dog or forget how important it was to her. when my mom’s beloved cat passed away she kept forgetting too and would get sad every time. now she barely remembers the cat at all. she has pictures of him and sometimes she says what a great cat he was, but most of the time i don’t think she is clear on how much she loved it so it doesn’t bother her anymore. also, i have a cat now and she focuses on him now. so my 2nd suggestion would be to get her a new dog to help her focus on that, but only if there is someone living with her that can make sure the dog gets fed and walked in case she forgets to. when my mom would ask where he was, i'd choke up and she'd see my reaction and question me even more.",,1
"my dad received his diagnosis during covid. he had a virtual 2-session “interview” with a neuro-psychologist from the neurologist’s office. granted, the mri/ct did show some atrophy as well, but the actual diagnosis came after this virtual meeting. my dad is 70, isn’t the most social person, and isn’t used to virtual appointments. the whole thing didn’t go well. nonetheless, we toughed through. her findings were that he presents with alzheimer’s and general anxiety. just curious how else someone gets formally diagnosed. i'm a psychologist who diagnoses people with dementia. the gp refers them to us. we test their cognitive abilities (2h assignment) and talk to the family+client (1h). the testscores then get compared to people in their age and education bracket. the dementia diagnosis is usually quite clear from that. this may sound like it's too vague, but you can look up the mmse to get a sense of these types of tests. keep in mind that a score below 25 means something is definitely wrong, as the test is so easy that regular, healthy people should make it flawlessly. being unable to do simple math, remember 3 words, or know what season we're in says a lot about their minds already. this gets combined with the information from the family: can't remember appointments, unlearned how to work the tv, needs help with finances these days, confabulating stories, etc. all of these are outside the norms for normal ageing. i'm not sure i made a comprehensive or coherent response, feel free to ask for clarification. my dad was diagnosed with probable alzheimers, i believe in 2019, after an in person visit with a neurologist who specializes in cognitive decline. i know it involved an mri and i'm pretty sure it involved blood work. imo atrophy on an mri/ct is how the neurologist made the diagnosis. the facetime meetings were just to confirm he had the symptoms. i am not an expert, i just have my wife’s situation to base my opinion on. i started trying to get my wife diagnosed when she was 55. the neurologist said it was not likely she had dementia based on her age. in addition to the ungodly number of tests and appointments with specialists, she had three or four mri/ct scans. i have been told it is very difficult to detect early stage dementia with an mri/ct scan. finally the results from a radiated glucose pet/ct scan was interpreted for lewy bodies. a couple years later based upon her behavior the neurologist changed her diagnosis to ftd. my mother was diagnosed last year (the 1-year mark should pass any day now), about a month before i turned 19. i think they used spinal fluid. i’d had my suspicions of it since i was around 15-16, but getting the diagnosis and having my fears confirmed was like having a brick thrown at me. ♡ my mom was diagnosed after about 2 years of no pricing some mild symptoms (being forgetful, having trouble keeping up with conversations). it was june of 2020 when she got her initial mci diagnosis. we get her reevaluated this year and got mild alzheimer’s diagnosis which is what we were expecting. she currently cannot complete instrumental tasks without assistance (cooking, cleaning, filling pills, some driving) if progressed enough, alzheimer's can be fairly easy to diagnose and would not require more than an initial meeting. that said, i don't put much stock into telehealth/virtual neuropsych evaluations when it comes very early stage symptoms; especially in those of an age that are completely unfamiliar with the concept of virtual doctor visits and videocalls. late last spring my father had a uti. while they were treating the uti he just shut down. was stiff as a board for about a month in the hospital until they brought out other neurologists. in the process of trying to figure out what was going on (turns out parkinson's), they discovered that he does have alzheimers. prior his doctor just kept saying ""he's getting old that's all"".",,1

"nan early onset alzheimer’s runs in my family…i’m 35 and have been taking unisom for the past 2 years…i’ve noticed not being able to remember if i fed my dog or not lately as well as cannot recall certain words (more than feels “normal.”) doing research and unisom is an anticholinergic which is linked to dementia risk…i want to go talk to a neurologist. has anyone gotten tested for the genes that cause early onset alzheimer’s? trying to do all the research i can and of course very worried if i myself will get this terrible disease. wtf. i'm pregnant and the one thing they recommend to sleep at night is unisom. why are people pushing these drugs if they have dementia risks? i was taking kirkland sleep aid (doxylamine succinate, same ingredient as unisom i think) which is considered to increase dementia risk. i stopped taking it and now i sleep like shit again, which is also linked to alzheimer's risk. and yes, i have a copy of the late-onset gene. not sure what to do over here. i exercise like mad to try to make myself sleep, including cardio and weights, but i wake at 2 am every fucking morning. look into the dian network they have great resources. it’s for dominantly inherited alzheimer’s and they have great resources for family members that are concerned they might have inherited it as well as studies and genetic counseling and forums on it. might not be helpful for your specific case but it was for me and my brother as early onset alzheimer’s has been in my family for a few generations. i think you should definitely talk to a neurologist. honestly, low chance but, might have a legal case against unisom if you suffered real harm from their product. medications like unisom( anticholinergic antihistamines) do worsen cognition in the elderly/dementia patients but it is unlikely that it actually contributes to or causes the disease itself. the data suggesting there is a causal link also included anti-depressants, anti-parkinsons drugs, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, and so on and ranged from 55-year-olds to 100-year-olds. the 50+% dementia risk claimed is really talking about those other very powerful drugs and their anticholinergic properties are minimal, tbh. the other aspects of those drugs are likely what is damaging. the 12% difference in these numbers seems in line with the average % of dementia onsets within the age group studied and may just be circumstantial with the aging population. the study showed that antipsychotics have a 70% increased risk of dementia (interestingly 109% increase at lower dose) but this is misleading because the anticholinergic properties of anti-psychotics are minimal and likely unrelated. edit:   here is the study if you would like to check it out. table 5 is most useful. ""a total standardized daily dose (tsdd) was calculated for each patient with a validated assessment based on strength, daily dose, and length of use for each of 56 drugs with anticholinergic properties."" i just went through cognitive testing at my neurologist’s recommendation and they discovered i have eoa. i have other issues that led to the testing but the word searching/aphasia has been going on for over a year or so. the testing is long, a full day’s worth, it’s exhausting, but it was worth it to know where i stood. good luck!",,1
"any ideas appreciated! this month i (clinical researcher and prior mri training) have been helping my friend desperately look for help for his clearly demented (74 year old) mother (he has no other family). it began over the summer when she had a dizzy episode, syncope, and bad lasting headache (undiagnosed tia?). since then, she’s been declining rapidly and now constantly perseverates and forgets after 5 min. pcp told her to follow up in a year! i told my friend to request scans/neuro tests, and then i read through all the reports: mri shows significant atrophy, no tau, spinal tap shows cognitive recovery in following few hours and then return to dementia, neuropsych scores are severe in learning/memory/visual, and neurology eval says “alzheimer’s”. but she was ultimately diagnosed as “mild neurological disorder” and won’t get meds until she becomes severe. my friend said he was told there’s nothing else they can do (which is disgusting of our health care system), so i’ve been compiling lists of top neurologists and clinical trials. what else can be done for her that i’m missing?? thank you!! i’m in uk so it’s probably different but even now my dad is diagnosed with alzheimer’s rather than mci which is all they’d say initially, it hasn’t unlocked anything. the only thing he is prescribed is anti depressants. afaik there are meds which may slow decline but certainly won’t reverse it, and it’s unfortunately a disease with an inevitable decline. i’d suggest as an initial port of call too to start looking in to practical things like power of attorney, sorting financial affairs, looking at what support there will be for carers in home and out of home when the time comes the current approach to alzheimer’s (imo) is shameful. bureaucracy will close the door to alternative approaches and then make you feel stupid for asking. whoa, i thought alzheimer's drugs including memantine and donepezil are most effective in early stages! behavioral interventions are probably more important: adequate nutrition, social contact, fall prevention, things like that. if she's living at home, she's probably endangered. you don't mention where you are or what kind of funding. that is helpful in giving advice. if they are in the us and paying health insurance may as well use that mofo to the fullest.",,1
"need help please. my daughter is visiting for a long period with her dog. my mother keeps saying it’s ‘her’ dog and gets mad when my daughter takes her dog for a walk or feeds her. mom keeping getting upset and telling everyone to leave ‘her’ dog along. thanks so much. have you considered getting your mother a stuffed animal dog? maybe one that’s the same color as your daughters dog, if you can. that’s what worked with my mom, we got her the joy for all robotic cat that purrs and meows and everything and she’s as happy as a clam. is it possible to have something to distract her when your daughter goes out for walks and move the dogs food bowls somewhere that mom doesn't go often? this disease is frustrating because so often there are no solutions outside of redirection or changing our own behavior we're starting to have this issue with my sister's cat. we live at home with our dad to take care of our mom and lately mom has been claiming the cat is hers and gets authoritative over it whenever we take actual care of it. mom misreads its body language frequently so it's difficult to address her behavior and the cat's at the same time. she has her own stuffed dog and absolutely loves it but chooses the live cat whenever both are in the same room. i usually end up hovering nearby to supervise that their interactions are safe for both but that tends to agitate mom and gets more protective of the cat. how is your mom's balance? if she's able to walk much and the dog's properly leashed trained, maybe see if going out on walks together with your daughter might help? if that's not an option, perhaps keeping the dog and mom separate and out of eye sight during feeding and walking time might work. or ask your daughter to have someone else watch the dog. try not to tell your mom that it's not her dog as that will only make her more defensive. if she starts to get super possessive, maybe the dog should be kept somewhere else close while your daughter visits and can take care of her pet without your mom being upset. i know some patients do well with baby dolls too.",,1
"so, it’s a bit of a mess of a story, but my paternal grandfather was recently admitted to a facility because of dementia, and his kidneys have begun to fail so he doesn’t have much time left. i am currently 22, and i haven’t seen or heard from him since around 2010 due to my dad making the decision to cut contact with him due to other mental health problems of his to keep both of us safe. i have mental health problems myself, and they of course have gotten a lot worse since these developments. i feel selfish because i know how much being visited means to him right now, but all i do is freeze and lose the ability to speak when in the room with him, and then begin drinking heavily for the rest of the day after that. i’m hoping anyone out there has any suggestions or insight on the best course of action. should i try harder to suck it up and be there for him, both so he’s less alone, and so that i won’t feel like i didn’t do enough after he’s gone? or maybe i should stay away since it’s so high stress on my end and for the people around me worrying about my addiction problems coming back, and i’ll just have the pleasant memories of all the things we used to do together when i was really little. i don’t know him very well anymore but from how i used to know him, i believe he would want me to only remember him as he was when i was little. thank you for reading, i know how awful dementia is, and i’ve handled it before, but its completely different when it’s family. i’m very worried about your stress levels. it’s not worth it if your sobriety is at risk. could you honor your grandfather in some other way, that would not risk your sobriety? if there is a funeral, they will need memory boards. get black tri-fold poster boards at a craft store, and put pictures of your grandfather in better days on it? you could read to him, or bring some lotion and put rub some into his hands and onto his feet. that is very soothing. you could hum a song while doing it. this would be as much for him as it is for you. if you can picture doing these things for him, without your stress levels going up, then maybe you can do it. if picturing this makes you anxious, i feel that it is not safe for you to do it. your grandfather would not want you to risk your sobriety for this. good luck, and please keep us posted. could you try going with your dad? might help take some of the pressure off. also, maybe try not having high expectations when you go. just sitting there with him is more than enough. turn the tv on, read a book. maybe build up to the small talk once you’ve sat there for a little while. you also don’t have to stay long. whatever you can endure is fine. if you are coping after a visit with him by drinking heavily for the rest of the day, you are damaging yourself. you have a responsibility to yourself and the people around you to keep yourself physically and mentally healthy. if your grandfather can still read or has someone who can read to him, you might consider sending a note or card instead of some visits. you want to let him know that he is loved, and you can do it this way. it’s probably better - for him and for you - than physically being present but not being mentally or emotionally present when visiting him. as someone who lives with liver disease, i want you prioritize your own health during this difficult time. i understand it’s hard; my step mother is dealing with dementia herself. the problem is that, there are no warning signs. you won’t feel any symptoms until it’s already too late. the liver is a miraculous organ that helps to regulate hundreds of functions in the body. many don’t realize that the damaged liver itself isn’t always the problem, but instead causes all kinds of other health issues in the body as a result of being diseased. if the disease progresses far enough to cause scarring (cirrhosis), there’s no undoing the damage. it will shorten your life, and you’ll spend that time with significant health issues. so please take care of yourself during this difficult time. if you absolutely have to see your grandfather and risk your sobriety over it, consider having a buddy that doesn't drink and who you trust to stay with you before, during, and for some time after your visit. you could maybe also ask the people who tend to him if there's anything he'd like/need that you could send them? not sure how applicable that would be, but it might be worth it if you could help him and not risk your well-being simultaneously.",,1
"grandfather is on oxygen, doesn't leave the house at all, he doesn't want to deal with her, so he lets her drive and do whatever she wants, she crashed 2 hours away from us and we only found out that she crashed because someone helped her at the crash. i know it’s almost impossible to have a doctor take a license away, i’ve been through it and know other people who have too. i had a customer tell me to they removed the battery and the starter relay from their dads vehicle, that’s what i would do. if they catch on, or you don’t want to hide what you’re doing, tell them. tell them you cannot have your grandmas death, or the death of anyone else, on your conscience because of their negligence. as a mom with a toddler, this scares the hell out of me. would you rather have a mad grandpa and aunt on your hands, or a dead child? maybe i went to worst case scenario, but it happens. remember almost all “accidents” are preventable. i used to drive my grandma anywhere, any time i could to stop her from driving. maybe try to set a schedule so everyone can get grandma where she needs to go. be prepared for people like my shit uncle, who said, it’s not that i can’t help, i choose not to. thanks for caring so much, you’re a good person. what you can do may vary by your state. you can check your state's dmv to see who reports of a medically impaired driver may come from, but in general it would be a doctor or law enforcement. hipaa won't allow them to tell you what, if any, action they take but it doesn't prevent you from giving information to them. i'd keep the message short and succinct with as much supporting detail as you know. in the state of ny, when my dad had his accident and the paramedics/hospital recognized he had a cognitive issue, they filed it with the police and dmv. he was forced to take a road exam with an occupational therapist who works with the motor vehicles agency. only he could pass/fail my dad. removed a lot of the pressure from us on deciding if dad could drive again. he needs to go back every 6 months. see if your state has something like this. now my dad has lost all interest in driving. we had my mom evaluated by an occupational therapist who specializes in driving evaluations for dementia and alzheimer’s patients. you may want to mention, that because of her dx, and now a history of not being capable behind the wheel, your grandfather (or anyone who may have poa) could be held liable for any damages/injuries in any future accidents... try and convince her to stop driving and get other family members on board. report her to the state dmv. they'll take her license away.",,1
"my dad (78)is in the hospital as he has quickly advancing alzheimer’s and he wasn’t eating or drinking enough. it is no longer a medical emergency ( it was)but he’s still not getting around like he was or taking in as much food as he should. my mom can’t take care of him. problem is a few months ago he was so healthy and active and still driving etc. they are recommending a home. when i visit he constantly says he’s doing better and eating, doing his physical therapy etc etc. he’s asking why he’s still there and wants to be discharged. i haven’t told him yet but keep saying “ just a bit longer” and “ once you get your strength back”. or i play dumb like i don’t know either. how do i handle? tia in general, the recommendation is no, don't tell the person with dementia--it would usually be more for the person telling to feel better than for the person with dementia. ""just a bit longer when you get more strength back"" sounds like a fine answer in the meantime. when it comes time for him to move, some people frame the move to memory care as ""your doctor wants you to be in a special rehab until you improve more,"" but that's a case by case thing. we told my dad the house needed construction work and it was dangerous so he had to stay at the home. we never used the words memory care or nursing home and acted like it was a hotel or apartment. he's been there about a month and has stopped asking to go home. quick decline sometimes means uti. some doctors can remember stuff but aren't critical thinkers. did they check? morally, i think keeping the present pleasant and positive is the way to go. i'm caring for my father who has alzheimer's and as much as my brain has conflict with white lies my priority is his immediate comfort. his ability to grasp concepts are declining so keeping things simple is important. best of luck to you, it's a journey that's for sure. don't know what your folks money situation is like, cause every option is costly. is there any possibility of getting your mom some assistance and keeping him at home. wish there were good options, but there really are not. my mom has been in memory care for years and while it is necessary, it's horrible. if you dad is still somewhat functional he will probably be very unhappy. good luck, and prayers for you and your family. no chance of any younger relatives to move in with them? alzheimer's disease does not advance remotely that quickly. has he had a proper work up from a neurologist? i would assume they checked for uti? uti's are notorious for causing complete delirium in elderly patients and can mimic a fast progressing dementia, however most of the time the patient returns to baseline after some time has passed and it has been fully treated. other possibilities would include nmda encephalitis and other autoimmune encephalitis diseases which can progress rapidly. the most common finding though is that the patient has been declining for years but it just went unnoticed because people are so used to covering for them until they're unable to do more simple things. if he hasn't had a proper neurological workup that's what i would recommend. as far as the nursing home, i can't imagine it will go well if he just shows up at a nursing home and no one told him he was going there. it really depends on how well he would probably tolerate that news. but i have seen families just bring their loved one to a nursing home that they never knew they were going to and he became so combative that he was kicked out of the nursing home fairly quickly. i also recommend a very deep research into the nursing homes available as most of them have pretty shady reputations. by any chance did he experience a stroke? my grandmother on my dad’s side (both my grandmothers had alzheimer’s) had a stroke which led to her rapid decline. i would tell him what is going on and get his doctor’s recommendation as to what the next steps should be. if you can and if you have the support for it, i would suggest bringing him home to be cared by family. we did that with my maternal grandmother for 7 years.",,1
"has anyone dealt with moderate to severe incontinence in a parent with alzheimer's? we've taken my dad to the urologist and he's on 3 different medications to tackle the incontinence from every direction but it doesn't seem to be working as well as we hoped. at this point, the incontinence issue is probably worse than the alz, since he is in fairly early stages of it. any advice would be greatly appreciated! routine helps a lot. after a meal, have him go to the bathroom. every two or three hours, have him go to the bathroom as well. my dad has a lot of accidents at night, so his caregivers get him up after three or four hours of sleep as well. my dad will grumble and be mad about it, but it helps to prevent accidents. we got depends for my mom. she does remember to go to the toilet sometimes - but sometimes it just comes out. and the depends are a lot easier than cleaning up the mess, especially because she doesn't always realize she's made one. she's also tried to wash them in the sink and in the washing machine (they get really big!) and sometimes she will put regular underwear underneath them. but it's still better than no diaper at all. one thing that seems to help my mid-stage partner: reminders. sometimes the sound of my using the bathroom is also a prompt. it sounds ridiculous, but just askng ""do you have to use the toilet"" may be able to break into the zone-out and get action started. of course, then it's on you not to be absent-minded. i increased the nightlight level in the bathrooms. that helped my partner's ability to use the bathroom at night. my advice is to talk about this straightforwardly and buy him some disposable briefs. unfortunately it'll slowly get worse, at some point it'll need diapers for both #1 and #2. constant reminders and a schedule help so you catch it before it happens. at some point they'll start missing the toilet even if they try to go, soil their clothes and not notice and walk around your house sitting on everything my mother in law developed double incontinence at the mid-ad stage - the part of her brain that tells her she needs to go to the toilet has been affected (common in ad). we tried taking her to the toilet more often but she was v reluctant and resistant. it got to the point where we had to get adult pull-ups. in the uk you can get them for free if your gp refers you to the continence clinic. i don't know where in the world you are, but perhaps there's a similar scheme you could utilise? as an aside, elderly people are more prone to utis, and they have a huge effect on dementia patients (my mil would become more aggressive/violent, paranoid, even forgot how to walk) - it's worth testing weekly (i bought the uti strips from amazon). wishing you the best of luck on this journey. yep. my mom would go in her pants while she was walking around. she’s had a couple of minor tias since then and seizures that robbed her of her speech and mobility. got the call today that she had another stroke and prob won’t last much longer. disease sucks father has the same issue, but his incontinence is due to the meds he's on. i live in a different country to my parents, so the only solution we've found is diapers ... dad is on the more affected end of the alzheimer’s spectrum and has a prostate issue. continence garments are a must at this point. routine is key until it doesn’t make an impact. if he is taking any anticholinergic medications for his incontinence it would exacerbate his dementia. typical ones are oxybutynin, detral, and toviaz  myrbetriq is the only incontinence medication recommended for dementia patients since it is not anticholinergic. a condom catheter is another option and of course depends. incontinence is usually pretty tough to treat in dementia. also be on the look out for doctors trying to label him with normal pressure hydrocephalus with his incontinence  it is commonly misdiagnosed in the alzheimer's population. routine can help. diapers too, but call it briefs so they feel less demoralized. a foley may be another option but that increase the risks of an uti. mum is incontinent and it started off slowly. she had some sort of episode the day before she went into hospital (never found out what - we thought it was a stroke, but wasn't) and from that day onwards she was urine incontinent 24/7. adult diapers are now the norm for my mum. it is very distressing for her as she is still aware enough to realise, but not understanding enough to know that it can't be fixed. very sad. forty years of dealing with alzheimer's, yes. i see my comment has been down voted. but, the fact is that out of control infections are the result negligence on the part of so-called ""caregivers."" i understand that it is hard to continually take your parent to the the hospital, but there is no answer on reddit that solves that. chronic infection is a sign of negligence. incontinence is usually due to infection in alzheimer's patients.",,1
"mom (91) passed last night. it came on quick. i live out of state and wasn’t able to see her the last three years. she had vascular dementia and had gotten to the stage where i couldn’t talk on the phone with her. i  prayed she would pass easily one day. i didn’t know she was taken to the hospital until she was gone. i was hoping i would get to see her one more time . . and what really sucks , is my husband has alzheimer’s and i can’t travel with him. last time i drove  long distance with him he tried to  find something to cut the seatbelt and he opened the car door while i was driving on the interstate. so going to moms funeral is out of the question. i don’t dare fly with him . i would love to have some closure. just putting it out there because ad sucks. so i’ve been  talking to mom and letting her know how much she has meant to me and all the things i wish i could have talked to her about the last 8 years. i hope she can hear me. i love you mom . and fuck you dementia. my sympathies go out  for those who have also lost someone. we are all dealing with this everyday and i hope you all have bright moments and find your own little space of calm and peace . i’m so sorry for your loss, i hope that peace and closure find you in other ways ♥️ i lost mom last tuesday morning to ad. she had stopped eating and drinking for weeks + she slept almost 24 hours a day. i wanted to hear mom say “i love you son” one more time. i wanted her to say it but i wanted her to mean it too. so sorry for you. a mom couldn’t do anything less. fuck dementia, my mom is 61 and has early onset alzheimer's. i'm afraid to lose it the day she will leave. sorry about your husband too, i'm dealing with that myself right now and wouldn't even consider traveling with him. wishing you gentle moments.",,1
"my dad has dementia and is going to need full-time help soon enough. (driving, shopping, etc.) my mother is a half-functioning alcoholic (half the time sober and amazing, half the time binge drinking/in bed.) i wouldn't say they are in denial but they are 100% wanting to kick the decision down the road and don't seem motivated to face it. how would you deal with this situation? i live several hours away. plan a visit with them. prepare for a very difficult but necessary conversation about both of their end-of-life care. tell your mom in advance you plan to discuss this during your visit and ask if she can dig up a copy of her will if she has one, and if she would be willing to “get some things squared away” with you “just in case”. or if you dont think she’d take it well, dont mention it but it may make it easier if she is prepared as well for the discussion. ask her when she would like help caring for your father. at what point will she not want to be his only caretaker? discuss finances available for that care. maybe there is a neighbor or a friend that can stop in for a couple hours a day to watch your dad and do a couple of chores for her, and care could ramp up from there as he progresses. discuss medical proxy, and possibly be prepared to draw up forms to make you the primary person to make decisions on your mother’s behalf in an emergency, rather than your father. discuss what your mother would like the later years of her life to look like. this may also soften her up to the idea of caregivers if she is against them...thinking about her future as a full time caregiver 5+ years down the road. while you’re there, check their house for hazards. people with alzheimers do better in bright light, especially in the winter when the sun sets so early; ensure they have a lot of good light in their house. it also helps prevent falls and injuries since depth perception can go with alzheimers as well. discourage the use of thick area rugs that have edges that can be tripped over, as well as any other trip hazards. offer to install a bar or a chair in their shower if they need that. just do some general things so you know theyre a *little* bit safer on their own. i’m sorry you’re going through this, and it might be hard to have those conversations with your mom but its the only way you can sleep soundly knowing you tried your best to get them to be safe short of uprooting your whole life and moving in with them. i'm in a very similar situation.... my step mother's drinking causes me massive anxiety as well knowing that she's my father's caretaker. i wish i had helpful advice. unfortunately i'm looking for some advice as well as this situation is a train wreck coming. i feel your pain. that’s a double whammy. i don’t know how to approach the drinking because people get super defensive when approached about that. but maybe if you get your mom into some support groups (even informal support groups) for people living with family with dementia she may start accepting his diagnosis and decline and perhaps get motivated to get herself together so she can be a better support for her hubby. the alzheimer’s association is a good resource for formal support groups. for something more informal you could try an online program- this is an nia funded movement program that includes some group interactions",,1
"i've never met anyone with alzheimer's before, but am visiting my aunt who was diagnosed in 2014 next week. i haven't seen her since 2011. although i will be with her daughter, whom she lives with, i am still nervous-- i know she won't know who i am, but what questions do i ask? how do i introduce myself? thanks in advance for the answers. this may sound crazy, but let her lead the discussion. don't ask questions, and i probably wouldn't even introduce myself -- just be friendly and warm. but let her lead the discussion and just be warm and friendly. follow-up thought: be prepared for her to say things that are uncomfortable, perhaps even to the point of being mean or rude. they both also get/got agitated very easily. also depends on the level but my dad likes to just make really random jokey chat. it’s his way to cover that he doesn’t really know what’s going on. so avoid referential conversations that need them to remember something you said a moment ago, like talking about your job, asking what she did yesterday etc. my advice is to just act like you normally would. they will probably ask you some of the same questions repeatedly, but each time just act like it's the first time they have asked. it's just really sad, my mom is in a memory care facility and all in all, it really sucks. looking after and care for family is necessary, even if it breaks your heart, everytime. you'll have to play it by ear, because you don't know at what stage in her illness she is. people with alzheimer's tend to be different person to person and even day to day. if you have time, a good youtube playlist is teepa snow's [making visits count. ]( (it's like an hour talk in total, it's just broken up into smaller chunks.) he's not great with questions, so we just take turns remarking on things that he takes pleasure in, like the view or the cats or his beloved wife. the conversation doesn't go deep, and we cover the same ground frequently, but that's fine--the point is the togetherness, not some intellectually probing discourse. if you can get tips from the family on things she currently enjoys or appreciates, that's a great place to go, and if not, just note what seems to draw her attention and go on with that. the best thing you can do for the both of you, is to play along. her time is more limited than yours is. just go with the flow. like someone previously said, if they start talking about something that isn’t true just go along with it. my dad and others at his facility really enjoy listening to music so sometimes when he gets frustrated i distract him with music on my phone. i’ve noticed many people at his facility enjoy the little things. i was amazed to see that although my dad doesn’t communicate much, he loves hitting a balloon back and forth. there’s no one way to approach someone with alzheimer’s, i wish there was.",,1
"i found out that to ""manage"" someone's social security benefits/payments, a power of attorney is not enough - you need to be the individual's representative payee. but i don't know what the ssa means by ""managing"" benefits. does anyone have any experience in needing to ""manage"" the benefits, so that becoming a rep payee makes sense? i don't understand the need, and why a poa wouldn't be enough for most cases? tia! i need to establish rep payee to sign my dad up for medicare in the next month (his diagnosis was poorly timed there). also pisses me off that poa isn't good enough for some financial institutions. i had to get notarized letters of incapacitation and shit to gain access to his assets to pay for care. this took over a month in some cases! just over this crap. for those who have poa, don't assume it won't be a circus to actually be able to use it. i'm rep payee for my parent. it's super annoying, and as you say poa isn't enough. neither is guardianship. you have to specifically go through a process with the social security administration that in my case resulted in the need for a recent statement from a doctor that my parent is incapacitated because the guardianship documentation was not recent enough. you also have to answer questions demonstrating that you're the best person to do it and you have to provide documentation. you also have to sign stuff that says you'll follow all their rules about how you can use the funds on the person's behalf (the managing part). you probably need a new bank account for the person to accept the funds, which you are required to set up direct deposit for, and you have to do a yearly accounting for what you did with the funds. we just added my wife and i to my mom's bank account. so between our poa and being on her account with our own cards, we've been able to handle everything. we are going through this now. my grandmother was the rep payee for my uncle for years. she just had his ssdi sent to his checking account, never filed reports or anything. now ssa just sent a letter saying that since she died, they won't send him money until a new one is identified. yes i have been rep.payee 15 yrs no issues",,1
"my dad has become increasingly forgetful. he frequently forgets how to get home, or he forgets a conversation that we just had 15 minutes ago. once i remind him, then he remembers. for example, he needs surgery on his carotid artery. i'm arranging it for him. i hung up, called and spoke to his doctor to set a pre surgery appointment. i called my dad back, literally 10 minutes or less later. i said ok dad we have to meet with the surgeon before they will schedule your surgery. your carotid is 80% blocked. stuff like this happens a lot. how do you tell the difference between normal aging, vascular dementia and alzheimers? you leave that to the professionals. get an appointment with a neurologist who specializes in dementia, or go for geriatric assessment at a department of geriatrics. you father's primary care doctor can refer him. it's a good idea to communicate either by mail/email or telephone ahead of time with some of your observations, to clue the doc in that a real assessment is needed. also it's best if you accompany your dad (or someone does), or he's likely to hear what he wants to hear and report back to you, ""doc says to just enjoy myself."" (that's not what doc said!!) alzheimers is a form of dementia. the only way to diagnose alzheimers is post death via autopsy. vascular dementia and alzheimers typically go hand in hand. my mom was dxed with both. my dad got in a pretty serious accident, lucky no one was hurt but two cars were totalled. he was just going to the grocery store about 1/2 mile from his house, his accident was about 3 miles from the store, he forgot where it was. basically alzheimers is the advanced progression of physical impairment of the brain via shrinking and other damage. the current state of the art for diagnosing alz is an amyvid pet scan, which looks for amyloid plaque. it was quite the task getting insurance to pay for it though. my dad was diagnosed w early stage alzheimer’s via a blood test and spinal tap. there are specific markers the dr looks for in those tests. he had several other cognitive & motor tests along the way as well.",,1
"firstly i want to apologise in case i use any terms or anything incorrectly, i don’t know a lot about alzheimer’s so i’m going with what i’ve read. i (18) have noticed my dad’s changing behaviour since around 2020. at the start of the pandemic specifically he became irritable and argumentative, we assumed it was just him being bored and angry about covid so he was taking it out by saying outrageous things and fighting with me and my siblings about them. in fairness, a lot of his behaviours sound like symptoms of dementia although he has never really gotten “worse”, is always just the same eg he gets very stressed about things like making dinner, giving lifts or going on trips. recently he forgets things like what i’m doing, eg a couple days ago i had to travel to a different city and told him i needed a lift to the bus, and on the day of he forgot and i had to jog his memory quite a bit before he remembered. basically, i can’t tell if this is just him getting old or if it’s signs of early-onset alzheimer’s. or if the term “getting old” actually stems from a misunderstanding of what alzheimer’s is? the thought of it affecting my dad petrifies me and it weighs on my mind a lot. i’m scared to “lose” my dad since i am so close to him and my siblings and i are still pretty young. i don’t want to bring it up with my younger siblings or my mother who works 40+ hrs and is also pretty much full time studying, as i don’t want to scare any of them especially if i’m just overthinking. thank you for taking your time to read :) some of these things could be indicative of dementia, but honestly, what you are describing does not sound like dementia to me. only a doctor can say. forgetting to pay bills, paying them twice because she forgot she paid them already, ordering things she already had, then not knowing where her money would go. issues with short term memory. forgetting what day/year it was, what state she was in, whether she had eaten or not, forgetting recent conversations or events. asking the same questions or telling the same story over and over. hygiene issues. things like not bathing or brushing her teeth for days. when we would bring it up she would insist she had just taken a shower or brushed her teeth. forgetting what to do or how to operate during normal daily activities like using a computer, her phone, using the tv remote, the microwave, etc. she hid it well at first, but over time it became more and more obvious she was struggling. again, i am no doctor, but what you are describing sounds more like age-related forgetfulness, but it's hard to say without getting him to the doctor to be checked. alzheimer’s is really difficult to diagnose just by symptoms so there’s no real way for you specifically know he has it, there’s so many things that have to be ruled out before a neurologist considers it alzheimer’s (coming from someone whose dad was diagnosed with it at 61/62). the symptoms he’s showing could be caused from other things that maybe should be looked at by a primary care doctor first (i’m not sure exactly what but there’s plenty of possibilities)   if he shows more serious signs of forgetfulness you can and should encourage him to go to his primary care doctor and/or neurologist. he will probably fight against going or roll his eyes but if he is experiencing dementia there is help out there to slow things down so getting to the root of it sooner rather than later is a great move. i wouldn’t jump to conclusions but i very much empathize with your situation, hope all is okay with your dad ♥️ i am not an expert but if you are noticing those things at his fairly young age, it is worth looking in to. try talking with your mom about it; this is a lot for you to carry alone. your mom could be noticing things but she’s afraid to worry you about it. ideally you or mom could talk to dad about it. if he is willing to talk w his dr about seeing a neurologist that would be best to sort things out and get treatment if needed. you are an intuitive person and your dad is lucky to have someone like you in his corner.",,0
"there are a lot of you on here that ask for resources to help you as a caregiver. i just wanted to plug that the alzheimer’s association has a free 24/7 helpline that can be translated into over 100 languages. the people answering the helpline calls are all social workers with a masters degree and can help with any question you have - ranging from “what is alzheimer’s” all the way to you being in a crisis and need guidance on how to handle the situation. they can also help connect you to local support, like support groups, care consultants, education, etc. it’s an amazing resource that i highly recommend. thank you so very much this hotline saved me when i was navigating my mom’s first steps into her alzheimer’s. they are so kind and so helpful. if they don’t have the answer, they are great at directing you where to go to get one. 10/10 give them a call if you need help!",,0

"i ended up having a talk the week before last with my mom’s (64 f) daycare about her general decline, they agree she has declined, and said they didn’t think it would be any trouble for her to be evaluated and qualify. we had the hospice referral appointment with her pcp last tuesday, and it hit me harder than i was anticipating. so much so, i ended up calling out sick for work the next day, and took a me day while mom was at daycare. the first hospice agency referred to us by the pcp was not a first choice of the woman who runs the support group that i’m in, and i trust her opinion. my mom really qualified without any second thought. they’ll provide a shower chair, a wheelchair and a hospital bed as soon as i have room for them to. i got her a rollator last week that has been helping at daycare. other supplies will be provided as well. of course i just did a pretty recent big restock of diapers and wipes…  i’m a little nervous that i’m not actually going to get the extra help and relief i need. a nurse will come out twice a week, and an aid can come out 5, but only for an hour to get her ready for the day. she can still go to daycare and be on hospice as long as she does not become completely hard to care for in their facility. she will be assigned a social worker who may be able to help me figure out more in home health services or short term respite care. i know i need to see how this even plays out to start. they can arrange a 5-7 day skilled nursing facility stay for respite otherwise. my mom doesn’t understand much anymore. what do i tell her about this? do i keep it simple and just say they’re new friends coming to help, or do i tell her that she’s on hospice? i have a feeling it’s the former, but want to get some input. is this a sign she knows it could be happening, or is it just the insecurities of the disease? i mean, she’ll say it at the most random times sometimes. i could be putting her socks on or getting her out of bed, and she’d say it. i probably need to have a physical scheduled as soon as possible. hey there. i am in a very similar situation, my mom (67) was diagnosed with alzheimer's 7 years ago. she has been on hospice for the last 3 months and they have been wonderful. accept the extra help, yeah you can shower your mom but it's great to be able to hand off some care. caregiver fatigue is a real issue, please make sure you're taking care of yourself. i am deep in this too, message me if you want to chat. it's great for you both that you'll be receiving additional hours & help, well done! i'm in australia so our system is different, idk. probably a 5-day break would be really good for you, give some time to catch up with yourself. best of luck with everything! just put your mom in hospice. tough go. u did wonderfully!!! my dad passed from dementia. mom elected to keep him at home, for familiarity. before mom passed, she & my brother arranged for 24/7 care. i kept praying for our lord to take him home. on day he was brought to hospital, he even complimented an employee of his tie. i applaud your efforts getting your mom into hospice. best of luck.",,0
"i don’t know if ptsd is the right word i’m sorry if it’s not. in 2020 i lost my grandmother to alzheimer’s and that was hard but just last month i lost my second grandmother to alzheimer’s i was much closer with her and saw her decline first hand since then i’ve been having panic attacks and freak out when my mom or other family members forget things. i’m laying in bed crying worried about having to go through that ever again does anyone else have this problem? this is apparently an evolutionary adaptation to help us see potentially dangerous situations ahead of time, and take appropriate action to avoid the same danger in the future. that's ptsd in a nutshell. (i'm not a doctor or psychologist). another direction might be reaching out to a grief therapist. my sincere condolences on your losses; and big, warm internet hugs to you. other commenter is right, i definitely had diagnosed ptsd when my dad had it and after he died it changed but it was still there. i would also suggest you consider joining a support group. they are free, and they used to be in person, but since covid there are many online:  . the anxiety you describe is similar to what many folks experience.. you may find comfort that its not just you. maybe you can find a good fit for you. . good luck.",,0
"my grandmother was diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago, but we knew long before she finally agreed to see the neurologist. since the diagnosis it just feels like everything has now progressed so rapidly. just last week things were bad, but after going away for the weekend i returned to the news from my mother that she had gotten substantially worse in the few days i had been gone. a couple days ago my grandmother was barely capable of holding a conversation, but now she isn’t even able to string together a couple of words coherently. the scariest part is i’m sitting in the er right now, and i can swear i hear the death rattle. she has also been mumbling what sounds like my grandfather’s name. so far we have ruled out a stroke, and they don’t seem to think she has any sort of infection. i just can’t wrap my head around how quickly this is all happening. i just sort of needed an outlet for my feelings with some people that understand. alzheimer's is a fucking awful disease. my first thought was a uti. my mother has alzheimer's and she would get very, very bad when she had an uti. she made sandwiches for my dad who died in 2011. she couldn't read a clock, understand the time, or why it was dark outside. i sincerely hope your grandmother is just going through a bad spell. so sorry for you! my mother is also rapidly getting worse in the last few weeks. stay strong for both of you. every timing is different, my mom has been calling for her mom for a few years now and she died 45 years ago. my mom has been bedridden and immobile for almost 17 months now and her limbs have been ""frozen"" for well over 6 months now. it really does seem like she is near the end now but we said that throughout all of 2021. she is 87 and has been at stage 7 for well over 5 years and with obvious moderate stage dementia for over 15 years. my mom definitely has the prolonged version of the disease and it's been terrible for several years now. memories usually go back to where they remember people from their past, that’s maybe why she’s saying your grandfather’s name. definitely check out the uti connection tho!",,0

nan i hate to be skeptical but.... this person was reportedly diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's in 2014 and this book was published in 2022.  early onset alzheimer's is a more rapid disease. truthfully the vast majority of people diagnosed in 2014 with early onset alzheimer's would likely be deceased by now or completely debilitated. even her first book in 2018 (4 years after diagnosis) is far too along in an early onset alzheimer's disease course to be able to write a book even with assistance.,,0
"i’m 21 and my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer’s when i was 17/18. i lived with only him from ages 14-18 and feel i missed out on many of those years and potential experiences due to worrying about/caring for my father. i had decided not to go away to college because he would say things like “you’re the only reason i’m here” all the time and ask if i was going to stay with him. i’m having a really hard time knowing what to do right now because i want to go back to a new school across the country next spring. i feel like i’ve made so many decisions based on everyone else’s happiness instead of my own, it feels like it’s been such a battle to survive most of my life, and i’ve finally been figuring things out for myself and feeling better. some things are going on right now with his potential guardianship which has been extremely difficult and is taking me back to those years when i was 14-18, feeling so stuck and helpless. it makes me feel terrible because obviously i want to do everything i can for my father, but i need to think about me. i want to have him in my life and have a good relationship, i want to be able to know what’s going on with him and help to make decisions. i guess i’m wondering people’s thoughts on that, whether you’re my age or someone older. am i being a bad person for wanting to go to school somewhere else? also if anyone has advice about experiencing a parent having alzheimer’s at a young age, or any life advice for someone in their 20s, i would greatly appreciate it. i think if my dad wasn’t sick he would be proud of me and excited for me. he always wanted to make sure i had the ability to do what i wanted with school and careers and express my talents. thinking about that makes me smile but it hurts. - my parents are divorced, my mother greatly cares for my father and they have lunch once a week imo, go. alzheimer's is already stealing what is left of his life. that being said, i'm a 45 year old man, missing out on many things, including things with my own child, to continue caring for my mom who is on hospice and could remain so for god knows how long. it sounds like you have already put your father before yourself. i think you should focus on yourself for a bit. ended up not going to go stay with my mom and try to care for her (no official diagnosis at this point but she was not able to hold a job and had very clear signs. we knew it was alzheimer’s)  you should go to school. my dad has it too. my mom thinks that he's had it for a while, but his symptoms started getting worse when i was 14ish. i'm in my 20s now and i'm in a similar situation to you. do what's best for you. i am glad i lived my life and if i had stayed 24-7 to care for my parent, i would be bitter considering it's a likely possibility for me. i echo every one else here - go and live your life to the fullest you can. i'm hopeful it will be what your father would wish for you. i'm 39 and cared for my dad for about 10 years - we tried to keep him at home for as long as we could but it came to the point that it was no longer safe or dignified for him to remain there. the respite provided to me since he has been in a care home has been significant - i feel like i can live my life again and do things i've been unable to for the past 10 or so years - and it feels good. you deserve to live your life now! you only get one life, you don't owe it to anyone but yourself. please let your parents make their own decisions for their own lives. alzheimer’s destroys everything. but alzheimer’s destroys everything and that will still be true even if you stay. good luck with your decision. live your life. sometimes the kinds of sacrifices that you would need to make can leave you feeling bitter and resentful for many years to come. i don't think your dad would want that for you. don’t do what i did and be afraid to live your life. that being said, you aren't just losing your father to this disease. and what ever you end up choosing, do right by yourself first. you can't 'do right by him' if you are burned out. your health, mental and physical, comes first. don't break your back.",,0
"would like to hear about everyone's experiences good or bad with small residential assisted living or adult foster care based in a private house. better or worst than long term facilities? do smaller homes have better staff to resident ratio? if you have worked in or own one i would love to hear from you. would love details about your facility and why it's better in your opinion. i have not used either of these, but there was a period where i was looking into them as an option (mom decided to keep dad at home in the end). im not sure but i *think* a major deciding factor would be more about what kind of care the facility is qualified to give, and what kind you need. like some facilities have staff that are allowed to administer medicine, and some may not have staff thats allowed to (patient has to give medicine to themselves). some facilities aren't allowed to keep someone from wandering out, and some have a special status where they can. you might want to see if your state and county have a dept on aging or elderly or dementia. they may have guides describing rules that may be specific for your state or maybe even a handy list of facilities identified by type of care. depending on the level of care, you could eliminate your options quickly.",,0
"my father (68) has alzheimers and up until recently was being cared for exclusively by my grandmother (87). over the past year, my father's condition has progressively gotten worse and he's started showing signs of anger, anxiety, and aggression. anti-anxiety meds helped some, but it still got to a point where it was no longer safe for either of them to be in that house together and we made the decision to move him into memory care. unfortunately, the transition to memory care did not go well. within 4 days of moving him in he had assaulted another resident, cornered and threatened a staff member, and refused to eat or take his medications, until the facility finally asked for him to be transferred to a hospital because they couldn't handle him. fast forward 6 weeks and in that time, he's been in 3 different hospitals and 2 different geriatric psychiatric facilities. he was transferred back to memory care after the first psychiatric stay when they thought they had figured out his medication, but after 4 days he had assaulted another resident, was tearing pictures off the wall and throwing them, and had defecated on the floor of another resident's room. he's currently on his second geriatric psychiatric stay as they once again try to tweak his meds but i' m not hopeful. we are one week into what is supposed to be a 1-2 week stay so he's going to be discharged soon. the memory care facility he was originally in won't take him back and so far we haven't found any others that will take him. i don't see how he could come home, even with in-home nursing help. i just can't see how it would be safe for anyone. i've checked into some nursing homes but supposedly they are going to cost between 10-15k per month and that's not something we can afford. i don't believe he will qualify for medicaid as he has a pension that would put him over the eligibility requirements. making all this worse is i live on the west coast and am having to manage all of this remotely. this last 2 months have been so draining and we seem to be out of options. what are we supposed to do? i'm posting in hopes that someone maybe has a solution or something i haven't thought of but it all seems so hopeless. with my mom, we had to private pay until she was bankrupt. in her case, the only med that worked to ease her rage (she broke her own and other people's bones in attacks) was injections of haldol. because they had to be injections, we had to have 24-hour skilled nursing, and the doctors reported that it was a must to keep her from being a danger to herself and others. once she was bankrupt, the way medicaid worked was they took her pension and ss and returned it was i think $70 per month for her to have personal spending money. if you haven't talked to someone in medicaid locally, it helps to at least have the conversation with them to see what happens next. i'm really sorry you're going through this, op. i was in the same hopeless boat back in october of last year. my dad has increasingly gotten aggressive. because of covid, no geriatric psych places would even consider taking him in. his doctor at memory care was having no luck tweaking his medications. his facility was kicking him out and we couldn't find a single place within the state that would consider taking a man with ""behaviors"". we began looking out of state. i also asked about hospice and they agreed to have him evaluated. hospice believed my dad was probably suffering from terminal agitation and we signed him on to hospice. they gave him dilaudid but it didn't slow him down one bit. one of my nurse friends (seeing how hopeless the situation was) recommended i ask hospice about contacting aps. they did and got some social workers involved to help us out in finding a new facility. in the meantime, we had to hire 24/7 caregivers to live with him in memory care. somehow we found a facility nearby that would give him a chance as they typically handle people with ""behaviors"". we moved my dad to the new place (having hospice on-board was nice because they provided  a hospital bed). i'm just sharing my experience. reaching out to aps can be scary but we got desperate. nobody would take my dad and i knew if he got discharged anywhere, that his current memory care would not allow him back in. i feel like i truly tried everything. sadly there just aren't many resources for when your loved one gets aggressive/violent. and no, you cannot take him back in to the home with your grandmother. i'm so so sorry. i was in your position only 5 months ago. i'll be thinking about you. what i did was enlisted my friends' help in asking them to make calls to facilities for me. having someone else make those calls and keep a shared spreadsheet was probably the most helpful. i hope you have friends you can call on. such a heartbreaking disease.. so sorry.. you should try posting this question on the forum at agingcare.com the people over there tend to give better advice about these kinds of situations and are more realistic. this is a long shot, but i was just getting a massage today and in the waiting room, i read something in a ""massage therapy"" magazine about alzheimer's and massage. as little as 5 or 10 minutes of gentle massage, head, shoulders, neck, back or hands, reduced agitation and aggression in alzheimer's patients. it can be done by a cna, it doesn't have to be a licensed massage therapist. see if you can get his carers in the hospital to try that every day for a week. i'd also want to know if it happens only in the latter half of the day (sundowning) or if he has a uti. music might be useful. i was able to take care of my spouse who got alzheimer's in 2012. when the violence started the doctor perscribed risperidone .25 mg 3x a day. it was an amazing transformation and helped me be able to do everything at home until passing in 2020.   i got hospice involved in the last year and a half or so, which set us up with a hoyer lift, hospital bed,  and nursing care 3x a week all covered thru insurance and medicare, when walking no longer was an option. when covid started i voluntered to do bedbaths and the nursing was reduced to 1x a week to avoid unneeded traffic and risk of covid. this was during the time when it was so horrible in the nursing homes, before vaccines. i am grateful for the extra time i had, grateful that i didn't need to rely on any of the kids who all had jobs and families, grateful that i didn't need to bankrupt us or move out of this house we have lived together in for 35 years, grateful we never got covid. i miss my spouse so very much. hope this helps and god bless. i'm sorry i don't have a good or cheap suggestion, as we went through it with my mil when she was fist admitted to a mental care facility. we were finally able to get he placed into a facility which was able to manage her, both through medication, and through having ""large"" skilled nurses and aides who could control her outbursts. once a lifetime of savings, the home, everything was gone, medicare stepped in and took over. facility received every dime, social security, navy (spouse retirement) pension, everything except a few hundred bucks a month we were able to use for upgrades in food, cable tv, and a room with a view of the plants/garden outside. what breaks my hear more than anything is i'm on the front edge of this journey with my wife, who was diagnosed with early onset, and is now 67.  i'm not emotionally ready to have to watch the love of my life disappear from me in slow motion while i remain helpless and heartbroken and incapable of making anything better for her. please speak with the hospital social worker (or have his poa do so). the reality is that dad is likely going to need further adjustments of his medications & an onslaught of behavioural approaches to try & find the balance whereby he's not a danger to himself or others. what i know to be true in my province is that a hospital cannot discharge someone who needs constant care if a sufficient solution is not available. is the hospital the right place for him, long term? probably not but until his situation stabilizes, and a home is found, then i would not be accepting responsibility for him to come home. it's an impossible position to be put in, & the system is so very broken & i'm so sorry that your family is having to wade through this walking nightmare. talk to the social worker & reach out to the local alzheimer's society/ society for the aged & ask them for advice as well. sending you such support over the interwebs. xo there’s an anti-psychotic medication that my fil takes that really helped his aggression. if you want to know the name, dm me, i would have to ask the wife. regarding ~~medicare~~ medicaid you should talk to an elder care lawyer. typically, if a person qualifies for  ~~medicare~~ medicaid funded care they pay all their assets first, minus a very small amount, and ~~medicare~~ medicaid covers the rest. this varies from state to state so be sure to find a lawyer in their area. good luck",,0
if the loss of sense of smell associated with alzheimer’s would be studied towards restoring it first would memory return? does the pineal gland hold the answer? you're not likely to have heard about studies where things like this were researched and found not to be helpful. i’m a research patient. but wouldn’t do the loss smell thing because i smoke. how far outside the box?,,0
"okay, so my dad was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. because i gave birth to a child and didn't live super close to my parents i was never able to attend many of his doctor appointments. now i have moved closer and my child is older, so i'm paying closer attention to his health and helping out my mom. one thing that was never made clear to me is what type of dementia he had. so at his last appointment with his neurologist, i asked her what type of dementia is he diagnosed with. and she said, based on his scans it's either alzheimer's or vascular dementia. so is that a thing? i guess i was looking for something definitive. not: maybe this, maybe that. i guess from her perspective it's all under the same umbrella, but from my prospective i'm just confused. yes, it's a thing. my mom also has vascular dementia and alzheimers. remember, alzheimers is a form of dementia so you're right, it's all under the same umbrella. i wish you all the best! eta: there is no definitive way to diagnose alzheimers while the patient is alive, it's only when they die that they can say (via autopsy) that it was alzheimers. another common cause is vascular dementia. a person can also have both. as others have said, alzheimer's can't be diagnosed with 100% certainty until an autopsy. i've read that alzheimer's presents as a slow progression whereas vascular dementia will process periodically with sudden changes. a uti will also appear as a sudden change, but treating the uti will help improve the sudden problem. my grandmother has vascular dementia and dementia. although i did assume they are the same and it's not? interestingly enough, not diagnosed with alzheimers. we went to different doctors and honestly, none were much help. my grandmother is on medication, it's really not improving her symptoms. i think going to get a second opinion will help in the sense of getting the right mix of medications if you don't think the dr. is doing what he can. my so has a dementia, undefined diagnosis at this point. but without an effective treatments or accurate tests, i am not pushing for further diagnostic testing. we are four years into the dementia, i am focused on positive support, seeing that she gets good food, plenty of rest and limit her over stimulation. i give her opportunity to be functional, but step in when she get confused. had a similar chat with my mom’s doc when she was diagnosed. he told me that the only true way to tell if it’s alzheimer’s is to do an autopsy after she passes away. until then, they use standardized testing. i read somewhere that mri scans show shrinking of the brain with alzheimer’s, more so than regular senile degeneration. while i’m assuming vascular dementia shows less blood flow>>>less circulation from kidney disease or diabetes>>>cognitive functional decline",,0
"my dad has been really struggling with being my moms primary caregiver. he never had to do much of the child raising and i can tell he’s cracking but am not sure how to help him emotionally. has anyone had success finding a counselor for their parent? he looked for support groups once and then never followed up so i think i’ll need to find someone and give him the push. why kind of counselor has training in this kind of thing. would it be a grief counselor or family counselor? any advice is appreciated my biggest help has been a local alzheimer's group, unless people have experienced it themselves they just don't get it. even just sitting and listening to other people has helped me have some perspective on my own situation. i’m the primary for my mom. i have things covered, but from the outside it might look like i’m holding up way better than i am. you know what i’d absolutely melt for? if i came home from work one day and someone had arranged for my mom to be looked after so that they could take me out to dinner as a thanks for everything. i know there’s no medals for this, and i don’t really expect it, but making time to really acknowledge your dad’s dedication might really mean the world to him. go together with him to a support group or 2, whatever you can find, and folk there likely will know of counsellors / therapists specialising in carer support / grief processing. folk often research for support but then not follow through - if you find when & where & tell him you're going together with him, then that breaks the ice & starts him off. or ask your area alzheimers .org &/ dementia .org, they know for sure. good luck! get his blessings before you take the next step—but my 2¢, select the counsellor, set up an appointment, make sure his ""shift"" with mom is covered for the time he'll need, and gently push him out the door with enough time to get there. how to select: if there is a nurse who comes in, then there is some kind of institutional apparatus behind the nurse: hospice, hospital, medi-care/caid… reach out to them for referrals, best kind of counsellor to seek. if not, contact his pcp for a referral. why you need to set wheels in motion: dementia is contagious. caregivers need to remember, sequence, execute millions of adl tasks for self *and* for loved one. lack of self care leads to lack of care for loved one, leads to lack of self-care… vicious cycle. god bless you for caring for the caregiver. my dad was similar, caring for wife & emotionally reserved & struggling with his own issues, and he was a total mess. my dad found a class that he was able to take virtually through the local adult day care center. the class was perfect. the class included video examples, a handout binder broken into sections like ""eating"", and a live instructor that was able to answer questions and also curtail some of the winding stories from other classmates. pm me if you want and i can share the local day care details - there may be something similar in your area. i find it almost impossible to be able to join and attend a specific group, but have gotten a lot of great information from this youtube channel, which i can watch anytime it's convenient for me. [www.alz.org](   this will help you find your local alzheimer's chapter. they have group meetings. he needs to attend. set it up for him. get him there. if he's financially stable, then hire an assistant to help out a few days/nights a week. nobody can be a care taker 24/7 and stay sane. ask the nurse for a list of recommended care takers. the nurse or the social worker can provide this. take care. it's a tough job to take care of the dying but even harder when we love them.",,0
"do any of you in the pre-diagnosis stage worry that getting a diagnosis will cause your loved one to deteriorate faster? that’s what i’m struggling with. my family and i can tell something is wrong with my dad (and has been for sometime) but he’s already so sad i worry he will give up all hope if he finds out for sure something is wrong. we’ve already had a neuropsych consult and they want him to come in for further testing. i am pushing to get it done but the more adamant i am about it, the more i wonder if it’s even the right choice. i have been insistent that we need to know what we’re dealing with but honestly i don’t know what to think anymore. thanks in advance for any advice. no; a diagnosis will not affect the disease. what i've had happen, though, is my loved one stopped trying to fake being neurotypical. in a word, she appears like someone with more pronounced dementia than previously. that's while she's around me. we talk about dementia—openly, gently, with respect. having a diagnosis helps me know better how to help her maintain her dignity. helps me learn strategies which would violate norms for neurotypical people, but that have now become helpful—completing her sentences, tying her shoes, asking ""do you understand,"" cutting her slack when she can't remember or do something. i've set down my experiences; ymmv. i get you’re worried your dad will feel sadder with a diagnosis, but in my case - my mom knew something was wrong with her, and it upset her not knowing why or what was going on. now that we have a diagnosis, i think it helps her to have an explanation. now when she gets upset because she can’t remember something, i tell her “well mom, it’s because you have alzheimer’s. the alzheimer’s makes you forget.”  it weirdly calms her, i guess because there’s a reason for what’s happening, and knowing what it is in that moment might be helping her confusion. i can tell you from my family’s experience, getting the diagnosis is the right choice. once you have it, you can move forward and get information and help on what to do next. odds are, though, they'll agree it's probably alzheimers. one side note worth mentioning: my mom was also called back for extra testing. at the advice of my bil, an md, my dad asked a lot of questions around what they were looking for specifically, and found out that particular neurologist wanted to enroll my mom in a very expensive drug trial. the extra testing (which my parents would have paid for) only would have shown whether she was a candidate for that trial. so... ask questions. what sort of further testing do they want? neuropsych testing is pretty comprehensive. if his neuropsych testing did not diagnose dementia then he may not have it. severe depression can mimic dementia as well. i experienced something similar to what you describe - i would just say treat it like it’s in your head … at the end of the day, your doing the best you can and make sound judgments while accounting for all evidence. my moms second round of tests showed major decline, enough for the neuro-psych to say “most likely dementia”, and then no follow ups or anything (after a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and small vessel ischemic)  there are times when it seems like a diagnosis makes it worse, mom is relatively lucid and any diagnosis would be perceived by her as straight up gaslighting (hence she refused to see the neuro psych again anyway). but a couple hours later she may think she is in her childhood home and wondering where her parents are …   in sum, i think the diagnosis is critical to get help in the system (i just changed her doctors so she will be more comfortable) - but it may also lead to a lot of crazy fighting (especially if they think they are fine, or constantly forget about the diagnosis). with my one data point, i say no. i have tried changing things up numerous ways to try to manage and try to stay ahead of my wife’s decline. her decline has been a constant steady progression. it seems like every week i noticed a subtle little thing she can’t now do. when she can’t feed herself or use the restroom properly it seems significant, but i see the constant steady decline. staying on a constant schedule of sleep and meds seems to make for much better next days.",,0

"2014-2015 (73/74 years old): father's alzheimer was starting to be more prominent. it starts when he's talking to people, he'd keep repeating what he's saying. 2016 (75 years): he starts forgetting where is he going when driving. like, he would leave from point a to point b, and while on the road, he'd forget where is he going for point b is, and eventually ends up going back to point a. one time, he was going somewhere that's only a 30-minute drive from our house. while on the road, he forgot, he went into circles, and six hours later, he thankfully made it back home.2018 (77 years): he started to forget how to go back to the house from our yard/garden. you'd have to guide him. he used to water the whole yard, but around this time, unless you guide him, he'd only water one area.2019 (78 years): he started to forget how to go from one place in the house to another. let's say how to go to the bathroom from the living, or going to his bedroom. also, this is around the time that you have to give his medicine to him, as he cannot take it by himself. 2020 (79 years), you had start guiding him with personal hygiene, and when taking a shower. you have to make sure he actually gets in the shower, that he actually uses the soap and shampoo, and you have to pick out the clothes he's gonna wear, and set it on the counter. though, he still knows how to put clothes on. he also started losing his perception of time. when he wakes up from an afternoon nap, he thinks it's morning. or he'd wake up my mom in the middle of the night, as he thinks it's already morning. he would wonder out of his air conditioned room, to go some other part of the house, would sit down, and complain that it's hot. i would bring him back to the room. a couple minutes later, he'd do this again. he would also ask where my mother is, i give him an answer. then 30 seconds later, he'd ask the same question again. 2021: about a month or two ago, he's having trouble when you give him a command. let's say if you want him to flick a light switch.   based on the timeline above, what stage is my father at? and how long is this going to last before advancing to the next? also, i've read that people with alzheimer's would live about 8-10 years, or if they're lucky, up to 20 years. how long do you think my father is going to live?i would like to apologize for the dumb questions. i am just curious. especially, when dealing with this everyday. thanks.",,1
"issues are: soft diet for dental reasonsslow digestion (bm every other day, does take senocot-s), i think this makes for a sense of fullness lives independently, support workers come in the morning and evening to warm up meals i’ve pre-cooked. i think they do the bare minimum (which i’m not blaming them for, it is a free service, but they don’t sit with him and talk, they heat things up and set the food at the table for him to eat alone). loneliness is a factor he doesn’t want to “be fat”. weight is good but i’m concerned he might lose the ability to digest proper food and obviously is missing nutrition. i sit with him 3 times a week for a hot lunch, he eats about half of it or sometimes doesn’t (not sure if that’s down to bm timing or what).i have tried to blend soups and stews, he finds these visually unappealing. he does seem to get a bowl of oatmeal every morning (2 packets and i’ve asked the psws to add cream)and sometimes has dinner with friends, they say he eats half and only with a lot of encouragement.",,1

"anybody got any tips on keeping very old people warm? they are so bad at generating their own body heat. it's so frustrating trying to keep my mother warm in the winter. she has a thick sheet, an electric blanket, and 2 more layers of blankets on top of her. all the electric blankets are unreliable and they are manufactured to fail or work poorly after a few weeks to a few months. i have bought 3 of them so far. i can't find one electric blanket that will be consistent and reliable for even one year. i hate that so much. they are screwing over my mom just so they can sell a lot more electric blankets. it makes me want to learn how to fix them or make my own electric blanket that won't fail!!! she almost always says her arms are cold, but they feel warm to me. her body feels warm too, but she often says her body is cold. today, i researched what kind of foods will help keep her warm, but most of those are foods she doesn't like to eat. she likes to eat quickly digested, high glycemic foods which don't help her be warm. i need to give her low glycemic foods and put much more fat in her diet, because she eats almost no fat. i'm also trying to give her food with plenty of vitamin c to help her blood vessels & circulation.",,1

my mother in law moved in with us a few months ago when her husband passed. i'm her main caregiver as my husband is an otr truck driver and is gone about 3 weeks per month. mil has several health issues but she is moble with a walker and gets around the house just fine. the problem is her eating habits. she rarely will eat what i cook not refusing out right but saying oh maybe i'll try it later or something like that. meanwhile she eats all the time. like every two to three hours day and night. she doesn't sleep well at night and she also smokes so anytime she wakes up she has a cigarette and usually something to eat. that's what i mean by day and. she will eat anything that's grab and go. like fruits individual snack cakes cookies chips things like that. if we don't have those she resorts to peanut butter and bread . the problem is when i buy those things i'm expecting them to last at least the week but they're gone in two days.not only is this type of diet very unhealthy for her but it's impractical and expensive. at this point i just don't know how to break this habit of hers. i'm afraid if i stop buying the convenience foods she won't eat. or since she does have her own small income she will tell me to just buy the stuff with her money. which doesn't solve the problem of having to go to the grocery store every two days and having her eat all this unhealthy junk. since she moved in with us she also complains about losing her independence. even though it was her idea. so i am leary about telling her what she can or can't do. i'm also trying to get all of her doctors and medication straight since she didn't take care of herself while her husband was ill before he died. i'm sure there's a simple solution for this but i'm so overwhelmed with everything right now i can't see it. any help would be appreciated thanks in advance.,,1
"my mil (59) has lewy body dementia, she’s at a stage where she can participate in light conversation, but often loses her words and train of thought. she also has delusions and a lot of false memories. she is not capable of forming new memories. the only self care she can do is put her clothes on (usually backwards or inside out) and bring a spoon of food to her mouth. she needs help with every other aspect of her life. she’s been with us for two years. i’m her primary caregiver, a stay at home mom. i’m planning on sending this to her two sisters and my bil, none of which are involved in her care, other than the occasional check-in text. names have been changed.please let me know if you think i should add or change anything? have i over-explained? under-explained? donna - milemma - my 3 year oldgrant - my almost 1 year oldcharles - my husbandezra - brother in lawhey family, i’m so sorry to spring this on you so suddenly. as of today, our home is no longer suitable or safe for donna. i’ve been struggling with this for a while, and we had an  incident today that pushed us over the edge. everyone is ok, but this can’t continue as is. when we first decided to bring donna into our home, i told charles that our boundary would be if she becomes a danger to us or our kids, or if we become a danger to her, then it would be time to find her somewhere else. that time has come. today, while i was helping grant nap (he’s been sick all weekend), emma went into donna’s bedroom, and hit her hand with a toy (metal) hammer, it was supposed to be in the garage, and she was supposed to be going to the bathroom. donna is ok physically. but she’s terrified and disoriented, she had trouble getting from her room to the kitchen table. emma has been dealt with, hammer is gone, of course. but i just can’t help but feel that something is bound to happen again. keeping the two of the apart has been one of my biggest struggles since we’ve moved into this house. emma can operate baby gates and doors, donna cannot. the only ways to keep them separate is either inhumane (locking them both in their bedrooms, not happening) or extremely logistically difficult (what i’ve been doing, constant supervision, made impossible because of grant’s needs, me going to the bathroom, emma’s extremely independent attitude & physical maturity, she’s the has size & capabilities of a 5 year old). now that grant has started to walk, the house is about to undergo another baby-proofing transformation; and it won’t go well for donna. then plan that charles and i have had on the back burner is to find her a skilled nursing facility in city name (the town where charles works and ezra lives. about 20 minutes from our home). we wanted to wait as long as possible to make this transition. please keep us in your prayers, this will be extremely difficult for all of us.",,1
"i am korean in case anyone can help or has references. i am getting help from another user and trying fixing things with my husband so i'm very happy for this community. i would like to know if anyone can help my situation until we can get further help. my son and i have always been very very close even though we have not seen each other in a long time before the injury and i wish to not forget him and do what i can for him and make him comfortable.my son is 25. he is slightly underweight because he was recovering from an eating disorder and some damage before the injury. a bit back ago he came home from the hospital after he have suffered severe tbi. he suffers vision problems for which she is getting another appointment in a few days, he can see us and a family member and reacts. he also responds to me talking to him and reading to him even though he cannot understand or speak. he is often dead weight as he gets very confused but he has been a little more alert recently. i would like some help understanding or help with the feeding. i am scared to use a tube because i do not like the sound of it and he has been prone to ulcers and infections before and i know these can cause those problems.he lays down mostly but now for some hours through the day he will sit back reclined with support from pregnancy pillows or sit reclined in my arms. there are more opportunities to try having a meal when sitting but most don't go well. he is capable of opening his mouth for spoon or a suringe. he will move food with his tongue or lightly with his jaw. i cannot get him to take more than 5 bites of food in that time. it will be mashed vegetables or blending rice with a little salt.  he will take a few drinks of gonttomil shake or milk every couple hours, from a serving spoon or a handled lid cup. no soup or juice or shake i make. he will not have water unless it is in the food or milk or gonttomil shake. he had some of his favorite food yesterday which was much easier to keep focus but cannot eat that all the time. he will not eat anything my husband feeds him and he will stop any eating when husband is even at home, fortunately husband is mostly working or going out for the night. son likes a lot of coaxing and responds well but husband told me to not do that.he made a little progress the first week home but has since went back or stopped. i made ice pops and he liked them but could not handle the cold. i bought a mesh pacifier dummy for fruits and vegetables that i can use instead of the spoon ﻿and he seems to enjoy it but cannot do it for very long at one time. he's getting there because now he likes to help hold the handles of his cup by holding my hands, or holding my hand when i put the spoon to his mouth but has a very loose grip.the minimum he will eat is half the shake and some mash from the dummy or five bites. he is not terribly hungry because he will get an unsettled mood swing or fall asleep during feeding or after a failed attempt at eating. i understand he has a small stomach but he needs to eat. the biggest meal he had was at yesterday morning and it had a whole serving of shake, a mash of 2 radishes and cucumber, mashed nashi, and a few bites of my salad and mushroom soup.",,1
"i’m trying to come up with something(s) for my grandma to do to keep her busy. whenever i leave after a visit she asks me what she should do next/what she needs to do and i always tell her “you don’t have anything to do, you can just go rest” or something like that but i can tell that’s not really what she wants to hear. she is constantly rearranging things in her room, throwing away random items that don’t belong in the trash, stealing my grandpa’s belongings, etc. i feel like if we could give her something to do that would let her feel accomplished it could help curb some behaviors. the problem is that she has never had any hobbies. she used to work in her yard but isn’t able to do that anymore. aside from being a busy body and shopping, she really didn’t do anything other than care for her children and then grandchildren.she doesn’t do puzzles or crosswords/word searches, won’t watch tv (i believe because she doesn’t know how to work the remote but won’t ask for help so she insists it doesn’t work and won’t let you near it to try), knows enough that we couldn’t pass a doll off as a baby and doesn’t knit or sew. i’ve thought of getting a bunch of washcloths and telling her they need to be folded? realistically though she’ll end up throwing them away (or over the fence? things keep going missing and my grandpa and i cannot figure out where they’re disappearing to). any suggestions on keeping her mind and body busy?",,1
"i will cut to the chase and give you the preface later. i called adult protective services to report self neglect on an 84 year old man i live with. i spoke with a social worker a couple days later and was told that a county nurse will be making a visit within the next couple weeks. she also spoke to the guy who has power of attorney over his medical care (he lives out of state but is planning to move in this house  soonish.) i really need there to be a formal diagnosis for dementia. this man is very stubborn and in denial of everything health related. what would be the best way to do this? he's going to deny everything.i was told by the social worker he hasn't paid all 3 of the utilities for months. he keeps getting shut off notices from the water company but none of them have shut off utilities yet. i'm very surprised nothing has been shut off. he hasn't seen a doctor in several months because his doctor retired. i told him he needs to call his insurance to get a new one but he doesn't listen to me. he's very stubborn and doesn't listen to anyone who tells him he needs to see his doctor. he has a very bad cut on his ankle that looks like it could be mrsa. i expressed to him that i think he has dementia but he denies it even when you tell him about all his memory problems. he loses his money constantly, his car keys were lost for what seemed like forever, he loses his canes for walking, he will ask the same question multiple times within a very short period. he's very moody and grumpy most of the time. he loves to argue with people over the tiniest most trivial things. most recently, he was calling out his dead mother's name while knocking on the guest bathroom door. i had to tell him there was nobody else in the house. most days he's fine but more recently he has started thinking other people are in the house and one time he checked the guest bedrooms because he thought people were in there. he hoards food to the point that when he finally gets to eat something, it has already rotted and expirped long ago. he gets mad when anyone interjects and wants to throw something away. the last jug of milk i saw him throw away had an expiration date of july 2020 and the inside hard yellow slimy curds. he has lost his sense of smell and i'm pretty sure he has no taste either. he doesn't believe anyone else when they tell him his fridge smells bad. he says they have sensitive smells which is not true. one night he went to the grocery store and was gone for a long time. he got taken home by a police officer. he had a blown tire and the cop said he was lost and didn't know where he was. the cop told me he thinks he has dementia and that he really needs to see a doctor because it's going to get worse. and also, he has a suspended license because he failed the written test . recently, he has been having bathroom accidents where he goes in his pants and then it runs down his legs and onto the damn carpet. he refuses to buy adult diapers. my dad bought me a carpet shampooing machine. i moved in here in 2019 for free rent and utilities in exchange for help around the house and yard. i'm not a nurse or caretaker and i don't do anything medical. i mainly do simple things like vacuuming, dusting, raking leaves, trimming small trees, etc. i have no authority over this man.",,1
my dad has very recently been diagnosed with alzheimer's. he is 63 and has never had any health issues before this so has never had to take regular medication.my mum passed away 6 years ago so he lives alone and unfortunately i live an hour away.he is struggling to remember to take medication. any solutions?we have a monthly pill box (i can't get home weekly so this is the best solution). we have amazon alexa with an alarm going off at 10am and he knows this is to remind him but he still doesn't go and take them.he's now changed medication and has to take one pill morning and evening which is now an issue as he doesn't remember the evening one.he won't accept outside help yet as he's literally only been diagnosed for 3 months and has barely even told his friends yet. also are there any groups or places you go to chat about your situation? i think i would like someone to chat to about it all as its happened all of a sudden and it's a lot to take in.thanks for any replied and apologies for the long post.,,1
"my father and i take care of my mother with advanced ftd at home. she started having swallowing difficulties a over year ago, and up until very recently we were able to follow the advice her doctors gave us to make sure she was able to eat—eliminate distractions, make the environment familiar/comfortable/have mealtime cues, alternate small bites of food with sips of a drink with a straw, and staying upright after the meal ends. the past couple weeks, though, mom stopped feeding herself completely. luckily she still opens her mouth when i lift a spoon or fork up for her, but she doesn't chew or swallow until after taking a drink, and even then only does so about a third of the time and by chewing once or twice before stopping. i've largely switched to soft or liquid food like scrambled eggs and soup along with nutritional shakes, so the difficulty chewing isn't as troubling as the worsening dysphagia. i'd  still like to provide mom with solid food if there's a way for her to still enjoy it safely, so if anyone has an unlikely solution that would help my mom chew i'd appreciate hearing it.i've heard that massaging the throat can help assist swallowing, but i haven't found a resource that explains exactly how to do that and my attempts at figuring it out haven't been helpful. can anyone tell me how this works or point me in the direction of a place i can learn how to do it?thank you for taking the time to read this. i have a feeling that there's not much of anything i can do, but it would be nice to be proven wrong.",,1

"by affected i mean by aging diseases that effect the mind and emotions. i realized that i see part of my mission as caretaker as making sure my dad doesn't go off the deep end. and doesn't make bad decisions that adversely affect health and wellbeing. let me tell ya it can get a tad bit nutty. and i'm sure many of you have seen worse. dad had issues sometimes with his poop. it is almost impossible to understand what the problem is. he will use the wrong words or use them poorly. and the symptoms and issues change from day to day. he may say diahrrea  but then say that suddenly he has to poop and he hurries to the bathroom. he has trouble getting up and walking w/ a walker so he makes it barely. then it all comes out whoosh! so he calls it the d but it isn't. he says he doesnt feel it coming 'til right before and feels thats not normal. he poops once and then its fine. no blood, no weird anything, no cramps or pressure. im guessing his system is old and sometimes acts different. so he tells me tonight  he just wants toast for brunch. i offer to cut out his sausage, no...just toast. sandwich? no...toast. pb on that toast? no...toast. his jello and banana should be fine.i just dont know from what he says that he has an issue. he always expects everything to be the same everytime. he wont or cant admit hes 94. frustrating. of course he didnt tell me earlier that he had a supposed problem today and i ordered sandwiches. which i would have altered his dinner if i'd known. but started him back  on metamucil  a few days ago so could be that. cant get him to leave the pepto alone either. so very set in his ways. thank you, ranting",,1
"i am the covid house companion for a male relative, 78/m, whom i love and care deeply about but with whom interaction is sometimes challenging. over recent years, the man has shown an increasing level of defensiveness and insecurity, and deals with it an increasing childlike manner to the point that our interactions sometimes do not resemble adult interactions. tonight i approach the man as he was washing dishes.  he was cleaning with a sponge tipped wand, cold water and not looking at the dishes, indeed, he was not wearing his glasses. i picked up one of the bowls in the drying rack and found, predictably, that the inside remained covered with food since he was neither looking at them nor using the better tool (a washcloth).  i have confronted him before about how dishes are remaining dirty when he does not bother to look at them and tries to use a sponge wand. he was unable to receive this information.  when i tried to show him that the dishes remained dirty, he refused to look, became upset and left the house. when he feels criticized he has started to say, ""it's not what you say, it's how you say it,"" but he cannot answer how it is wrong when i objectively tell him that the dishes are not clean and that the wand is not cleaning them fully. i tell him that there is nothing mean or abusive about the necessity of pointing out that he is not washing dishes in a way that cleans them, but that i feel that he has a very high level of defensiveness and sensitivity. this sequence has recurred on multiple nights regarding dishes and also is replicated in other contexts. i would love to hear advice or tips about how to deal with defensiveness, sensitivity, and childlike response to being confronted about things that need improvement or correction.",,1

"hi all, my grandfather did another dip decline, and he's having trouble walking, even with a walker. i had to take him to the hospital twice in 10 days for falls----the second one much more minor, but he jammed his toe pretty badly. he's more disoriented lately, more anxious at times, and also quieter, which is outside the scope of his base personality. he is beginning to have chain reactions from dehydration, and had some problems giving buspar a try for anxiety. last week (and last night but to a much lesser extent) his dehydration from being a brat about drinking water caused a change reaction; namely, rising creatinine levels in his kidneys, and then a subsequent rise in his troponin levels, an enzyme in his heart. i notice that his legs blew up last night, swelling with fluid puffing his calves, ankles and feet up. i know that can be a sign that heart failure is on the way----its not surprising but this is a fast decline and i'm just getting nervous. i have several appointments over the next month (cardiologist, neurologist, primary care doctor, np home visit) so i will know what's going on with some medical confirmations if he is approaching heart failure (he is already in stage 2 kidney failure). i'm obviously sad because he went off a new cliff and i know it will only progress probably faster and faster. his decline has been extremely fast----he could still drive last june, and have conversations that were still sensical. vascular dementia is rough, but maybe less cruel. we are keeping him home still (we're blue collar irish catholics, please, no comments about placement at the moment). we have an arsenal of home health care and likely the option for home hospice as soon as the need arises. does anyone have any experience with vascular dementia and potential heart failure brewing? i just have such a bad feeling about this dip, like we're going to be approaching the end by the end of the year. :(",,0

"thank you to everyone on this subreddit for their helpful advice and kind words.   all of you are dealing with a difficult and cruel disease.my 85 year old mother was experiencing severe pain at the beginning of the month.   her dementia was pretty advanced and i had noticed even more of a decline in the last six weeks- more weight loss, more confusion, less interest in the few things she still enjoyed.   but one day we found her standing in her bathroom, in terrible pain.  a staffer and i were helping her on the toilet and she began to scream like a woman in labor.  long, sustained screams of agony.   thank god for hospice.  she had a standing order for as-needed morphine and it was agreed, she needed it.   we wondered if she had gotten up in the middle of the night, fell, hurt herself but was able to get back into bed and woke up wondering where she was and why she was in searing pain.   after that, with the loving care of memory care and hospice, we made the decision to keep her on round the clock morphine and lorazepam.  no pain, no anxiety.  we did not want to awaken her enough to eat or drink because the pain was unrelenting and the screaming began anew.i hate that dementia robbed her of so much in her life, removed the joys of traveling, recalling trips via her photographs, made beloved outings to thrift stores into scary and bewildering experiences.  she was keen on movies and movie stars but that interest faded when she could no longer follow the plots of films.  we found ways to bring joy along each step of her decline.   when she could no longer do counted cross stitch, she loved painting wooden bird houses.   when she couldn't shop, i would bring her clothing catalogues.   i played her favorite music on my phone and showed her lots of pictures of a great grandchild.if i have any advice for those here it is this1.  take care of yourself.  stress can cause enormous damage to your health.  self care is not to be found in a half gallon of your favorite ice cream.  walk and exercise when you can.  eat healthy foods.  look for stress reducing activities in your life.  ask others for help if you can.2.  utilize hospice early.  my mother entered hospice about 9 months ago as she was steadily losing weight.  the extra attention with the 1-2 visits a week really made her days better.3.  keep seeking out medications that help.  it's not just for challenging or unsafe behaviors, but to make the person with dementia have happier days. in the last months, days without lorazepam were like scenes from the exorcist.   days with the medication were filled with sunshine and my mother contentedly counted her blessings and raved about all the loving care she was getting.  4.  the end of life can be unpredictable and it can be strange.  the last food and drink my mother had was a bit of her favorite candy on the 7th but she was in no pain or discomfort because of the medications given.  i thought without fluid, she would pass peacefully a few days later.  it was 11 days.  it felt surreal, but hospice says it can happen.  we made sure any unfinished business was taken care of- we had a priest  in to give her last rites, family came into town, we assured her everyone was well.  i even joked that maybe, she had an unfulfilled hit list of mortal enemies and that i would promise to track down and seek revenge on everyone who failed to write her a thank you or return a pyrex dish.be kind to yourselves.  it's hard to make the right decisions at difficult times- when to place a loved one in memory care or forcing a parent or spouse into the car for a neurology visit or forcing yourself to lie to them out of kindness to spare them pain.much love to you all.  i'm thankful the end was peaceful- no more confusion, indignities of diapers, no more pain.",,1

"a little backstory. my mother-in-law is almost 86 years old, she has a long history of mental health illness. she was technically diagnosed with bipolar some 40 years ago, however, i'm not sure that was totally accurate (hers was more of a psychosis episodes). unfortatnely she lives in rural kansas and good psychiatrists (or any for that much) are hard to come by. she was committed several times due to her psychosis. since i've known her for a little over 20 years, she has more or less managed with the help of her husband and maybe some anti-anxiety medication (though none of us are certain she took those), but she has always had a lot of anxiety. she can't even watch a basic tv show without getting anxious. now fast forward to a couple years ago, her memory getting worse and she was diagnosed with dementia (again, this is western kansas, so not a firm diagnosis). my husband's parents hide a lot of details from us, so there could be a more specific diagnosis, but we're not aware of that. my father-in-law has now picked up all household chores, but that has become too much for him, and he has been hospitalized numerous times in the past couple years since he had covid (and she can barely cope when he is hospitalized). also, i should mentioned, there is no family that lives in their town and the closest sibling is three hours away. needless to say, it is time for them to move to an assistant living place. we have found a great one and it is in the same city as my husband's sister! however, my mother-in-law is very anxious about this move and her drinking has become increasingly excessive (she's always been a skotch drinker though). a couple weeks ago i counted her drinking six skotch on the rocks in one evening. she gets so drunk she pisses herself on occasion and has been vomiting as well. and, then when she's drinking, she becomes overly emotional and even more irrational...and then her memory even worse. i'm pretty sure she is drinking nightly and this is her way of coping and self-medicating. it doesn't help that her husband indulges in his bourbon with her every night as well; it's like they have a cocktail party for themselves every night.  of course, we're well past the point of putting her into rehab, but it's more the emotional toll it takes on her when she does drink. my question is: has any caregiver experience this with their dementia parent? how did you manage it?hopefully once we move them, we can get a psychiatrist for her that can help. she's in a very bad mental space right now...and i don't see her coming out of it anytime soon.",,0

(i really really can't, any insights are welcome).time fluctuates for her. sometimes it's as if the funeral just happened, sometimes it feels like months or years ago. she has no memory of the funeral or if she went, or if she was there when he died (she was for both). she's had 2-3 sudden extreme unexplained dizzy spells, but i suspect she forgot where she was or that he was gone, and then ""awoke"" to this reality and was overwhelmed and panicked. (staff in her a.l. memory unit took all vitals, we've been to the dr and ran every test we could think of to rule out stroke seizure heart problems etc..). she appears to be in perfect health.  how can i help her grieve in a healthy way when she has no consistent predictable memory? i try to bring up happy stories when her mood is up and shes already thinking of him, but the dementia is causing grief bombs that are so hard on her it just breaks my heart.  does anyone have any experience or advice?",,1

"last year i noticed some things with my mother that was off with her.  by october, there was a list of things that wasn't quite right. eg:- she ignored a request from her lawyer- there was some social anxiety about a family funeral- she lost her balance at the funeral and fell over- there were episodes of intense anger over very little since 2020- there was some silence from her like a mutism.  no conversation at times- easily bored- she left her bank card behind in the shop. i thought nothing of these stand alone incidents until one day it clicked with me and i began to wonder if she's losing her mind and if she's going senile and perhaps a dementia setting in.then there were other things like invading other family members privacy with eavesdropping and snooping. there was a lack of comprehension on public health matters and at home she would cough and sneeze without covering and containing potential germs.  i remember last summer we were having a meal out after the funeral and she needed to cough.. she turned her head inwards to where i was sitting and coughed into my direction over me and my meal.  then in april of this year, i found some of my underwear amongst her laundry. she never washes my clothes so it looked like she took my underwear as hers. there was an episode from her where it demonstrates poor planning and organising.  we have amily abroad who wanted to come home on holidays and the panic she showed was intense to the degree there was self combustion in anger and rage.  there was definitely some sort of a showtime with her too because she can hide that anger and rage when it suits her and only has it for me, her daughter. i noticed over the past number of weeks that she has been neglecting her health. she has a sore back and sometimes she has some headaches.  she won't go to the doctor about this. she's been eligible for a booster for a number of weeks and she has neglected this too. at this stage i am genuinely concerned about her especially now because she is neglecting her health.  she's not open for me into talking with her. it will lead to an explosion of anger and rage from her and accusations that i am trying to boss her around and i am not trying to boss her around.  when she gets angry she's nasty.  if she was to go to the doctor, she won't be listing these behaviours out to her gp because she's probably unaware of them. chatting with her is out of the question. i am a member of the same practice she goes to.   i am thinking about writing a letter and making an appointment for myself (i have some things to do at the gp myself) and discussing this in person with a doctor and giving them a letter. i am hoping they will invite her in for a baseline of work.",,0

"hello, so i‚Äôve lived with my mother in law for around a year now, we are very close. when i moved in her father was showing early signs of dementia, but over the year has quickly declined to needing a care home now which he is moving into next week. i use to be a dementia care worker so i know the ins and outs well. she just seems very unable to process her father‚Äôs dementia which i understand can be hard, but she is often set on ‚Äòwhen he gets better‚Äô ‚Äòwhen he improves‚Äô and well i know almost for sure that sadly he won‚Äôt be getting any better. the issue is i can see it affecting his care in the future, she is reluctantly putting him in the care home due to his at home carers saying it is now a necessity (he is getting up in the early hours wandering the streets, leaving the oven on etc). she is claiming he will be back home soon, and is only currently planning to pay for a short stay at the care home. i feel as if i‚Äôm intruding when i try and speak to her about him, but for his sake she really needs to change her mindset on the situation and i‚Äôm not too sure how i can help her come to terms, any ideas?",,0

"dad (95) and mom (90) will be married 70 years this october.  mom was diagnosed with dementia about 5 years ago.  dad has always been almost slavishly devoted to her, and mom has always been more aloof but we don't doubt they love each other.  my sister and her husband moved into my parent's home about 4 years ago to keep an eye on them.dad's health took a turn for the worse last month.  he spent about 2 weeks in the hospital. we started to doubt he would make it but thankfully he did.  the problem is mom convinced herself that dad was not around because he was cheating on her with 2 other women.  she was angry and wanted to talk to a lawyer to begin the divorce.  we took her to the hospital to visit and she calmed down, but was angry at us for not telling her he was in the hospital.  no one had hidden this from her, but she didn't remember anyone telling her about it.  meanwhile, dad kept repeating that he just wanted to go home and be with his wife.we hired a woman to take them out twice a week and also to take them to any doctor's appointments that a family member can't get them to.  dad had a follow up visit yesterday, so the woman took my parents.  mom again started up with her insistence that dad is having an affair but now it's with 3 women,  she was very angry and shoved him at the hospital.  my sister has said mom has gotten more abusive but this is the first time she was physical with my dad.my sisters want to put my mom in a home.  i'm the only person against this idea.  they did not do well when they were apart for 2 weeks, and i'm convinced we'll lose both of them.  my sisters counter that dad can visit her often, but i'm insistent that it's not our decision to make.  dad needs to be the one to agree with it or we can't do it.  my sisters think i'm being unreasonable.  they say we have to decide for them. mom is mentally impaired,  this is a fact.  no one ever tested dad's mental wellbeing, and as long as he's not legally impaired then i feel we have to be respectful of his wishes.  i think he's going to resent us if we split them up.this whole situation sucks.",,1

"my grandma, like many of your loved ones, is currently in a locked down adult care facility. no residents may leave, no visitors may enter. they have closed down all the gathering places, the workout room, and dining hall (food delivered to their door). everyone is pretty much stuck in their room.   she's more towards the beginning stages of dementia - unable to live on her own or handle finances and often gets confused, but not yet needing the memory care wing of her facility. she no longer reads books or periodicals partially because it's difficult for her to see and i think she also has a tough time following the storyline. she's quite scared of technology and even refuses to use a computer or cell phone with assistance.   i've been sending drawings and notes from my toddler and calling daily other family members of our very small family are doing the same.    i'm struggling to come up with other ideas for helping her beat the boredom, keep her mind off the chaos, and keep her feeling connected to us and the outside world.  maybe we could brainstorm ideas for our loved ones together?",,0
"my grandma is my grandpas care taker. he hasn’t been formally diagnosed because... well i’m not sure why. the doctor said he just doesn’t meet the diagnosis criteria. my grandpa is the most brilliant man i know. dual major in math and physics and was part of the team at nasa to put the first man on the moon. the fact that he can’t comprehend what he reads and has given up trying to look at directions on paper (as in, directions to put things together) is 100% abnormal for him. he has also started walking by and saluting pictures of his kids and grandkids and then standing in front of my picture when i was little to smile and wave at me. behaviors that are just very very very very abnormal for him. his behaviors have been getting more and more peculiar over time according to my grandma. we all know his mental state is declining and he is aware as well i believe. my grandma is a sweetheart but i am worried she is going to get overwhelmed as things worsen. what programs are usually available for things like this? i know of only the basics with this condition as i am still a new nursing student. i live 1,000 miles away from them and can’t physically help them out. my poor grandma has already told me she sometimes has to remind herself not to raise her voice because she gets frustrated. i don’t want to see her burnout and not enjoy her life. she spent a long time taking care of her own mother and it was very hard on her then as well. just not sure how to help the both of them. it makes me so sad to hear all of this from her. because i don’t want my grandpa to not be the same person anymore and because i don’t want my grandma to feel the heartbreak she is going through... sorry if this was all over the place. i haven’t had much first hand interaction with someone with dementia and am trying to process all of this still.",,0
"hello everyone,i'm writing this after i wrote the wall of text below. my dad is in his late 60's, he was diagnosed with dementia about 3/4 years ago. in the last half year i noticed things going south with my father fast. i felt the need to share my thoughts because i never do. sorry for the way to long and uncoordinated story, it could be way shorter. i tried to rationalize my thoughts and situation(i'd like to think i'm pragmatic and this brings peace to my mind) and just started writng my thoughts. it was kinda fun to do actually, the anonimity helps. english is not my first language so forgive any mistakes  :')growing up my father was always working, he would do anything for you when you needed him, but in day-to-day life we didn't see eachother much and a lot of the care for me and my siblings was done by my mother. when i was young my mother and i didn't get along well, this was mostly my fault for being a stubborn adolescent. i can now realize how much effort she put into helping me grow up but then i tried to put as much distance between us as possible. she can be very controlling and trying to manage things(she pretty much controlled everything in the familiy's affairs). i think a lot of that has to do with my father not taking this responsibility as much and she sorta grew in this position. i know that sounds negative towards her, though i'd like her to relax more i know see means the best, always. after high school i moved to a different city for school. this was around the time my father got the diagnosis. after around a year or so my father had to retire because they started noticing my father forgetting things which made him not suitable for work anymore. now he finally has time to relax, get a hobby etc but all the initiative left my father. he stopped doing anything by himself. expcept his daily routine. we live on a farmhouse and we have horses. it's the on thing he always made time for, it was his only past time activity. he takes care of the horses and does chores outside, while completely living in his own world and sorta 'zoning out'. he loses tools a lot and is probably searching for something he lost about 2/3 hours a day. checking the same spots over and over and looking lost. he reads the newspaper 4 times a day and eats his standard food. he almost never leaves the house and although my mother tries a lot to keep him socialized by inviting people etc, and i try to be there as much as possible. he has to few interractions with people. at this point my mother has to think for two people all the time, she takes control over everything that happens with my father. my father needs some guidance so it somewhat needed, but when my father does something wrong/forgot something she gets angry at him and pushes him a lot. i know she doesn't mean it, and a lot has to do with the fatigue/stress/negative state of mind she's in. i can see it puts my fathers brain in overdrive and it hurting him. lately he can react angrily back aswell, in my entire childhood i can maybe remember one time he got angry. i had to move back to my parents place for a few months because my lease ended and i didn't have anything lined up. this meant long commutes but at least i could spent more time with my parents. my mother had someone to talk to about things, which helped her a lot and i tried spending time with my father. i recently got a new place to live again and tbh i feel like shit for leaving those two alone. i know things will go south again and i hate seeing my parents being unhappy, but travelling 3,5 hours every day next to my internship and being there for other people all the time fuck'd me up. lost weight, slept awful which eats you up in combination with an office job and i seriously hated life all-around. i was in a bad mood and i noticed i sometimes would deflect that on my father... i know at that moment that it's wrong but i get this angry feeling and i gues someone with dementia is an easy target to deflect on. to give this thread some purpose instead of me being emo i'll end with a question.does anyone else experience this? due to fatigue/depresive thoughts getting irritated and putting pressure on the person with dementia when they do something wrong/lost something/forget something? e.g.: he/she loses the car keys. i fucking hate myself afterwards. i want my father to have the best remaining years he can have. much, much love to anyone dealing with this fucked up disease, in a way it spreads to the brains of closed ones of the dement person.",,0

"sorry so long, but dementia is just so complex as you guys probably know.my dad is going to need to go to a nursing home soon, no question about that.  my mom's out of town and i'm by myself taking care of him which has become near impossible.  so i decide to finally go take a look at his financials to put together a budget for what inpatient care will cost if he ends up living another like, 10 years and also thinking about my mom's future.my dad retired very wealthy but was a huge cheapskate.  he worked at the same company as a gm for forty years, and they matched his 401k from his first day there up to the day he retired.  i know this because the accountant from his company is my godmother.  so i went into the basement and got on his laptop to finally see just how much money he has (he kept it all on a spreadsheet that he never let any of us see.  he's always been paranoid about money being stolen from him.)  my mom pays all the bills with automatic pay i set up for her out of their checking account, (she doesn't know anything about finance above what's in this checking account where i have their social security direct deposited into).  the house was paid off long ago.went down to the basement, and i got into the spreadsheet by guessing the correct password for the laptop.  the only document on this mac was the ""secret"" spreadsheet.  i was so relieved, then immediately wasn't.   apparently when he retired, he rolled his entire 401k into a single ira, all of which was documented.  so far so good.  then the bottom fell out.  in 2014 he cashed out the entire ira and his life savings and spread the entire amount into eighteen different savings accounts in ten different credit unions.  he didn't list which credit unions, much less account numbers.  the credit unions were just numbered ""credit union 1-10"" and ""account 1-18"") with the amounts he deposited in each one.  and yes, he was loaded.   there are no paper statements anywhere, no receipts of deposit, no interest statements, and my mom says she's never seen any statements or even junk mail from any credit unions in the mail aside from their checking account.  he must have asked all of them to go paperless or something?   not even a hint or locked document stating which banks he hid all his money in.   and make no mistake, he went out of his way to hide this money.   he has no memory of doing this, of course.  i went through every document in his file cabinet and the fireproof safe.  nothing.him hiding his money, is that a dementia thing?  and finally, we are fucked, aren't we?",,0

"i'm feeling really guilty because i yelled at my father on the phone today, really loud. to preface, i'm not aware that my father has dementia and have not considered it before this. he's in his 80s and my mom sometimes complains that he has a bad memory or that she's frustrated with him, but i really don't know what going on. what confuses matters is that he is an immigrant and english is his second language while english is my first language. i normally speak to him in like 80% our native language and 20% english. today i was on the phone with both my mom and dad and i said in english, ""the garage door is broken."" my mom understood me perfectly. however, my dad did not. this lead to a lot of confusion and conversation because my dad said he thought i said ""the glass door is broken"" and kept trying to work out which door was broken. so probably i said 10-20 more times, ""the garage door is broken"" and variations of that, answering questions about which door i was talking about, just going round in circles. my mom is at the same time berating my dad on why he wouldn't understand what i said. finally it seemed like he got it and we were discussing how the garage door was broken (it would go down and pop right back up). but then after about a minute, he went back to not knowing which door exactly was broken and asking me again which door was broken. suddenly, i just lost my mind. i mean, i lost it. i started screaming in the phone: the garage door is broken! how many more times do you want me to say that? i""ve said it at least 20 times!  i was standing in the open garage and the entire neighborhood heard me and i feel so ashamed i yelled at my father that way. but i just did not get why this really basic information exchange could be so impossible and i have a lot of pent up feelings about not being able to communicate with my parents over the years because they just start screaming at me or just don't get it.  i felt it must be somehow on purpose that he could not understand which door was the garage door. though now that i consider it, why would he do that on purpose? after my horrible yelling, my dad got really quiet and said that since he wasn't there, he really couldn't help me figure out how to fix the door. then we ended the conversation and since then i've been wracked with guilt. my question is, is losing your ability to understand very basic words in a second language a sign of dementia? my dad has lived here over 50 years and worked his entire professional career speaking and writing in english. he reads english language newspapers and magazines every day.  but his english pronunciation and listening comprehension has always been pretty awful. it seems to have gotten to a new level of bad though. a few weeks ago my young niece was saying ""my favorite food is watermelon!"" then she would ask my dad, ""what's my favorite food?"" he \*could not\* answer her. she did it like 5 times. when he retired 15 years ago, he proudly proclaimed that he was retiring from english too. which i was like, whatever. everyone deserves to take a break. but recently it has really gotten so bad and i've found myself really annoyed. i felt like he was doing it all on purpose. but after the incident today, i'm wondering if this is an early sign of dementia? if so, what to do about it? do doctors even do anything about dementia? i'm sorry, i'm totally ignorant about the subject.",,0
"does anyone know of a cell phone dock that would make it function like a normal landline phone? i know there are a lot of cordless phones with bluetooth features but they have both landline and cell phone functions. the problem with those is that the green on button goes directly to the land line. you have to hit a different “cell 1”phone button to answer and use the cell phone. i found some old versions of what i’m looking for but they are no longer available/out of stock.just add some background to this, i moved my mother into an independent living facility where they recently changed their phone system to a voip system and all of the phones in the apartments are wi-fi. you can’t change them out or even add an external answering machine. you can only use those specific headsets. now, they are relatively simple but recently there have been some issues which took down the phone system. my mother has an iphone which is paired with her apple watch that she wears. she doesn’t really know how to use her iphone now but can sometimes receive calls. i just want some kind of dock for the iphone so that she can pick up a receiver and punch in the numbers if she needs to. as it is, her zombie fingers don’t work well on a touchscreen. i’d rather not have to get her another phone (to potentially lose).  getting old is hard.",,0
"my father is 65 and had a brain aneurysm ten years ago, he forgets most things and doesn't try at anything. he sits and watches a broken tv night after night for years, never tries to use streaming even tho he's got it he's ignored it's existence for at least a decade. i'll suggest he should watch something that i know he used to love like the x-files but he'll say ""too scary for me."" he does things that just aren't normal like use his index finger and curl it to say come here, or wave by his head like some kind of fairy. he doesn't know what normal is and doesn't try, he says weird shit like 'i've become more stromg than you can imagine."" as some kind of threat. while i sound harsh, i can't explain most of the hundreds of weird mannerisms he uses, he'll forget my sister's name and call her something else, i told him to just not use her name so he doesn't get confused but then he'll do it anyway and use the wrong name. he used to be a builder with a company that he ran.anyway he did his best today and made some kind of wood sign for the kindergarten my family owns and took it to his father (who suffers bad dementia but is an asshole by nature) and my grandfather rejected it. it was so god damn sad, yea my father is lost in his mind but my grandfather is just such a prick. i wanted to say to my grandfather just fucking accept it, your son made it for you and you're both old men. they treat him like shit and tell my dad to shut up and tell us to make sure he doesn't visit them some days.last year my dad ended up with no car, his old truck from when he ran a building company fell apart. my grandfather told him he'd buy him a second hand truck. my grandfather is a multimillionaire, well they went and bought one with him and then decided to keep it! so now my dad has had no car for a year and my grandfather has 11 two trucks now and got in trouble by the council for having too many cars. yea lots of people don't have cars but what a fucked thing to do, my dad is actually deaf and struggles hard now he can't remember anything. my grandfather does have alzheimer's but he is a prick, long before his memory problems he told me to put my dog down, told me i wasn't his family and just reinvented reality and spreads lies.",,0
"my mom (56 y/o) has dementia, psychosis, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. she was born with mild dementia but throughout her life she hurt herself intentionally, attempted suicide multiple times, which caused severe head concussions. we're 2 brothers and 1 sister, who's been struggling with her since we all can remember (our father died when we were young). throughout her life she's been admitted to multiple psychiatric facilities, to this day she fights her solutions, doesn't want to take her medicine, sometimes even spits them out when she goes to the washroom, doesn't listen to doctors, pretends that she's okay just to get back home and start it all over again. makes up situations to leave the house so she can harass people in the streets, shouts out the balcony and curses everyone out in the neighbourhood, attacks all 3 of us, calls us the dirtiest of names, endlessly. there are months when she's docile, but then there are days when she loses control and doesn't stop for weeks, when she feels tired she goes to sleep, that's how we get our sleep as well. admitting her to a welfare center is not the answer for us, we live in bangladesh, we've never had health insurance, and it's very costly too to admit her somewhere. anyone ever dealt with something similar to this? did you handle it by yourself? i'm the youngest brother, i spend most of my time at home looking after her and dealing with her the most, i'm looking for advice, anything would be helpful. btw, we all talk to her very kindly and patiently, we've tried loads of methods of communication over the last 2 years.",,0
"my mil is still pretty lucid most of the time, but she’s definitely got dementia (along with some movement disorder symptoms) and she has a team of medical professionals working to find the cause of it. she’s “there” enough that a lot of family members don’t really even believe the dementia part of it. we live with her and care for her (when she lets us...she’s in a lot of denial) so we know for sure that something is very wrong. alzheimer’s has been mentioned, although it doesn’t explain the physical symptoms. one thing that doesn’t line up though is that instead of having the hygiene issues i keep hearing about — not wanting to change into clean clothes, for example — she is constantly doing her laundry. as in, several days a week, increasing to that point over a period of several months. to the point where i often have to do my three kids’ laundry during the night and we believe it’s part of the reason the electricity bill has been going up. i’ve suspected for a while now that she’s been having some night time incontinence, which was confirmed recently during a hotel stay, so we assumed that she was washing her sheets after an incident and didn’t want to talk about it. but lately it’s been a lot of clothes. full loads of them, with just one or two days in between. and this is all hers; we do ours separately. is this a thing? is it possible she is forgetting that she did laundry and then washing it again and again, or is it more likely that she’s just trying to give herself something to do when she’s stuck around the house?",,0
"throwaway account because honestly i don't know anything and i don't want this getting back to my account.before i get into it, i don't think he's completely faking it. my dad has been diagnosed with frontal-lobe dementia about 2 weeks ago after losing his memory and being hospitalized for it. it came back after 3-4 days. this isn't the first time it has happened and it took some time getting this diagnosis as he always has a medical condition called dissociate amnesia (which leads to memory gaps and such). we could tell something was different though, as he's lived with da for 30 years and the episodes were different as of recent.anyway, ever since leaving the hospital 2 weeks ago almost every single day he has something wrong with him. he wakes up claiming he doesn't know who he is, where he is, can't do anything has to sleep. he puts on a baby voice and refuses to listen to us. he never did this before the diagnosis. he would have bad days, and there were certainly some he just didn't want to do anything but sleep, but not like this. there's a difference between not wanting to do something and saying you don't even know how to or physically can't. he didn't even know how to use a bottle of water. doctors said that the dementia was 'early on' (whatever that means regarding whats to come). honestly i don't know anything about dementia than what a quick google check can do.at this point i think he's faking it, it's easier to say he doesn't know and go back to sleep, despite our protests, than to handle the reality of it. there are times he talks fine and then you ask how he is and suddenly his voice drops and gets all mopey and he doesn't feel good. but two minutes before he was talking fine?? right now everything revolves around him, if he is having a bad day we can't leave him alone. so my whole life has shut down to be at home 24/7. can dementia act this way so quickly? or is he putting it on? any help would be great. i know i sound like an asshole but i need to know if this is normal behavior. i need to know is this my life now.",,0
"we have seen my grandma change over the last year, and at the end of the year, my mom decided to go to my grandma's doctors to ask about dementia. she stopped using her pill box, and there are bottles of pills piled up, which leads us to believe she is off her meds. she gets stuck in a conversation loop; saying the same thing, or asking the same question over and over. (as an example, we went to a pizza place for dinner, and every minute for a few minutes, she would look at the pizza and say; ""wow, look at that. make sure you take that home, because i can't eat it all."")when speaking to my grandma's doctors, my mom learned that my grandma hadn't even gone to any of her appointments last year. we found this very disconcerting because she still writes the appointments on the calendar and says she called a cab to go and everything was fine.over the past few months we've installed cameras in the common areas of my grandma's house, and my parents travel 3 hours to her house to make sure she gets to her appointments. during this time she's also been receiving speech and physical therapy in her home.yesterday my parents went to see my grandma's primary doctor to get the ""results"" of the all the tests and share the findings of the therapy. he told my grandma that she needs to use a cane, to which she replied, ""if you think i need it doctor"". he also told her to start using the pill box again, to organize her pills, which was met with, ""of course doctor"". (apparently, the results also stated that she does have dementia, but he didn't say what kind or what stage, and completely glazed over it.)after the appointment my grandma said, ""it'll be a cold day in hell when i use a cane. just because i'm 90, everyone thinks i'm old and stupid, and they do things behind my back."" and my parents doubt she'll start using the pill box, since she doesn't really remember how it works.is it normal to take things slow with a patient who has been diagnosed with dementia, and not break it to them right away? is the doctor testing the waters to see where she's at and what she can do on her own?my mom is really stressed out about this, and wants to take my grandma to another doctor. i don't think my grandma would like it, but i also want her to go to a doctor that would give her the support she needs.",,0
"hi, i am a 20 year old college student that lives with my grandma. since about 4 years ago, my family and i have noticed my grandma showing symptoms of memory loss. we have tried going to her primary physician to get some sort of diagnosis but we were constantly told it is part of “normal aging”, but i beg to differ. out of everyone in the family, i typically spend the most time with her on a day to day basis so i notice the changes in her behavior the most. at this point, it is really frustrating and heart-wrenching to see her condition deteriorate. here are some of her behaviors:- repetition (saying the same story/statement/question over and over again)- accusation  (people “stealing” money, food, clothes, jewelry)- paranoia (if we go on vacation or to unfamiliar locations she get scared to be alone in a room/constantly looking for something)- confusion (forgets what the date is/forgets what certain home appliances do)- more active at night (wandering back and forth from her room to living room)- possible hallucination (probably one of the more recent symptoms - thinks people roam around her room/living room at night) my family has expressed that they do not want to get medical help (medication, nursing home, etc), which leads us to just deal with what we have to face. i know it’s hard to tell what type of dementia or if it even is without being a medical professional but, if anyone has/had a loved one with similar symptoms, any tips would be appreciated. thank you.",,0
"im not sure if this is the right place to be posting this. i thought about writing to r/advice, but its late, and i feel as though it wont be taken seriously there. i googled for a dementia subreddit to hopefully get some input from people that maybe have some experience dealing with dementia patients, or know where i could get some help.&amp;#x200b;some background:my grandmother is in her 70's and smoked cigarettes for the majority of her life. over the past many years, it has had detrimental effects on her health and brain, and what doctors have described as dementia caused from literal brain death. along with about 10 other health issues.as far back as i can remember, she has lived with what i guess you could call her common law marriage husband of 30+ years (not my grandfather) lets call him dean. they lived in the next state over, and my family and i didn't really get to see her as much, over the past few years after she got diagnosed. we made visits when we could, but it got really tough to make the travel a regular thing. we knew that dean was taking care of her to the best of his abilities, getting her back and forth to her doctor visits, and making sure she had food, care, and company. my mom spoke to dean on the phone multiple times a week. just for updates, and to keep that connection with my grandmother, because we knew that one day she would be mentally gone. but dean also had some serious health issues, so from what we've learned recently, the care for my grandmother took a nosedive. needless to say, we didn't know how bad that living situation had actually become.&amp;#x200b;current situation:about a month ago, calls stopped being returned, and contact with dean had completely dropped off. about 3 or 4 days went by like this, until we didn't know what to do. my mom called the county police out there, to stop by the house and check in on the situation. we feared the worst.dean was found on the floor, unconscious for what was assumed do be about 48 hours (still in the hospital, and i personally haven't been updated one what exactly happened to him). the house was covered in filth, pet and human excrement, broken glass, mold... like it was some horror type shit. some of the worst living conditions imaginable, and we had no idea. like i said, the visits became less regular over the past few years, because phone contact was pretty much constant, and we thought things were on the up and up. my grandmother was found wandering the house, scared, unstable, and practically emaciated. so since then, shes been removed from that house, brought to a local care facility near us, gone through rehab and doing much better physically.but unfortunately, she is mentally lost. she doesn't recognize anyone and cant hold onto a thought for more than a few seconds. the dementia has advanced rapidly to the fullest stage. we are extremely distraught over the reality that she is just mentally... checked out. its been one of the hardest things ive dealt with in my entire life. i have countless memories of visiting her over summer vacations as a kid. the inside jokes and traditions that we shared. the 2 years that i lived out there during middle/highschool and actually got the chance to see her when i wanted to. the moments that i feel like are lost. she was one of my favorite people in the word and its so fucking difficult to see her like this.&amp;#x200b;where i need help:since going through rehab, the care facility has basically said, shes physically recovered, has been checked by a doctor and it was decided by them that shes ready to be released to the family's care. but she has very special needs. not only with the dementia, but with other medical issues, such as the disorders and bad habits shes developed from basically the anxiety of not knowing who she is. anyway, seeing as how she has only her 2 children (my mother and uncle) and me as her grandchild, we have no other options, but to set aside everything and care for her. which of course we are more than willing to do. but im afraid that we dont have the means to do so. unfortunately she doesn't qualify for any kind of proper mental care facility. not to the extent that she needs. and we are still trying to get enough money together to get some sort of aid to come in on a schedule and help her get to the bathroom, feed her, and everything else that is involved.so heres where we have ended up.she is living with my mother and i, in a small 2 bedroom apartment. we prepped for weeks. got a hospital bed, safety locked all the drawers and cabinets, put extra locks on the doors, got rid of all of our living/dining room furniture so that she could have space to live in the main area of the house. like we are all in on this... but like i said, it still just isnt enough and i dont know what to do. i work a 50 hour/6 days a week schedule, so really 95% of the responsibilities have fallen onto my mother. its only been 24 hours of my grandmother living here, and we have had multiple incidents. she tried to walk out of house on her own twice, shes peed on the floor and bed, injured herself a few times (she has developed this weird habit of picking and peeling her skin, until she draws blood. we noticed it in when she was in the hospital, but its scary and very worrying. apparently in dementia patients, ""picking"" a somewhat common anxiety related disorder). she has terrible mood swings, and threatens us. she has lung issues, also from the smoking, and has to have regular breathing treatment throughout the day, or else she goes into these choking fits. she wakes up every 2 hours, which means the rest of us wake up every few hours. its just.... its bad.&amp;#x200b;tonight after being woken up to the sound of pee hitting the floor, my mother was on the floor in tears. we had a long conversation about this whole situation and were scared. because so much of this is on my mother, im afraid for her sanity, and quality of life. being a 24/7 caretaker to my grandmother in a completely unforgiving, and life halting lonely, depressed situation. she basically said that if this first day or so, is what the future of this situation is going to look like, that she doesnt want to live anymore. thats what scares me the most.&amp;#x200b;without any other help, not enough money to get her outside care, the only thing left is a state run facility or 'home' through medicare, and they are awful, disgusting places, that do not help the patients who live there. we visited some of them in my area, and we were appalled. my grandmother needs constant aid and attention. not a place that is going to put her in a room to fend for herself. she cant do that. and if it one day comes to that, the guilt of putting her there would kill my mother!&amp;#x200b;so i need real advice. or maybe a miracle. idk... something!&amp;#x200b;edit: i know this was really long. at the very least i wanted to get it all out and give a full picture. thank you to anyone who reads the whole thing. any and all advice is appreciated so much!",,0
"so, it’s four am, been up since two thirty from my grandmother crying in horror because she woke up and couldn’t find her husband (he’s in the hospital, this is a daily conversation with her). we’ve been in the process of trying to move her and him to one of the long term care facilities. my grandfather is more for the physical side of things, but my grandmother more for dementia. but either way, we’ve been in the process for a week trying to get her moved in there since he will have to go too. by next week we should have more answers of how and when. i feel awful either one has to go and not live in their home anymore. if it was a perfect world we could have live in care. but it’s at the point they need 24/7 constant care. and am told that’s just not a feasible price. also, we did have my great grandmother’s in this same place when i was little and seem to like this place. well i came to the internet for advice for her nightmares, and hadn’t been at all worried about the care facilities. i know there’s been some bad history with them, but thought things were getting better. until stumbling into one recent post about a bad facility leads to another, and that people who have first hand experience seem to say it’s not that unheard of still?! how common is mistreatment in these places then? that they can seem friendly but in reality they’re not? i thought things we’re gonna be fine care wise for her but now i don’t know what to believe. i’m sorry if i come off in a panic in this post. logically it’s just from lack of sleep, my own mental illness, and just mental wear from caring for her for over a week now (thank gosh have some good support ❤️). but i now do still have genuine worry. i cant keep doing this caring for her 24/7, but don’t want her to go to a broken system. i just need reassurance that surely there’s good facilities, or if something is amiss that we can report it. just want her going to a good place. thank you all so much for just letting me air this out here. just typing this out has calmed me down. plus she’s back to sleep now so i think i finally can relax again.",,0
"my grandpa is just about completely gone. bless my grandmother. she won’t give up. i’ll spare all the details but he is surely in his final stages. my grandma refuses to consider memory care or a home . she’s 20 years younger and still has the strength and wits to care for him 24/7 though some days she calls me crying. he’s aggressive and delusional at this point. last night she called me and he fell asleep on the floor after 2 hours of refusing to get into bed. he can string 5 or so words together at a time but they tend to be nonsensical. my poppa still recognizes my dog. so we’ve filled his life with all things dog. he has a blanket with my dogs pictures, countless framed photos of my dog, a t-shirt with my dogs face on it, a small stuffed animal version of my dog, notepads with my dogs face on them, magazines with similar breeds on the cover. the whole 9 yards. my dog is a belgian malinois, a working dog. he looks just like a german shepherd. i was wondering if anyone has had success with a service dog. perhaps a german shepherd. i feel as if maybe the dog can help with tracking, ensuring my poppa can stand up, maybe dog can redirect some behaviors. sometimes my poppa tries to escape and maybe the dog could alert my nana of this. above all, i think the companionship would benefit my nana too! has anyone had a “dementia “ service dog? any thoughts or insights greatly appreciated!",,0
does this feeling ever get easier? i used to be so grounded in life etc had lots of friends. but feels like i just can’t find where i belong anymore like i’m mentally just coming un done. i’m 30 and this feeling scares me as i used to feel so mentally fine. content with life etc. but since dads diagnosis it seems like everything just get worse. life is so much harder without that one person keeping me grounded and on the right path. i look at happy people who seem to be together and think to myself that used to be me but i can’t relate anymore,,0
"i recently moved in with mom to care for her and am so, so grateful that she has mostly retained her sunny disposition and friendly, outgoing demeanor but the whole no “filter” thing leads to some embarrassing yet funny moments:- she laughingly, randomly told a nurse that i have “so many boyfriends!” i felt strangely compelled to tell the nurse that i am, in fact, straight but then i would just look like either a closet case or a homophobe so i just let it be.-took her to the bird store (she loves birds) and she exclaims to the cashier “you’re so beautiful! scott (me) isn’t she beautiful!?” i immediately assume the cashier thinks this is some pathetic ploy wherein i use my mother to break the ice with a lady i am interested in.-for some reason, she has taken to a mentally challenged young bagger at a local grocery store. she will put her arm around him and declare that he is “her new boyfriend” while he stares at me with confusion and a pleading look for help.-not embarrassing but kinda funny. she hates putin👍 and whenever he appears on tv she comes up with increasingly inventive scenarios in which to assassinate him. the latest is to put him in her bathtub upstairs with “scalding water” and surround him with “men with swords.” sometimes he is joined in the tub with other evil people she sees on tv: school shooters, mothers who killed their own children, etc. it’s sometimes a crowded bathtub.anyway, i guess these are anecdotes from “the lighter side of dementia,” if i can say such a thing. it’s so tough sometimes, but i love her, she was/is a fantastic mom and am just glad i can be here for her.",,0
"hi folks,i’m an only child in their 30s, living across the country from my parents (late 70s). dad has mci (mom and i suspect it has been going on for many years), and was diagnosed with early dementia 2 years ago (no signs of alzheimer’s) and he’s on meds. he does ok, it’s mostly short term memory issues and inability to learn new things. he’s pretty physically fit for his age and he’s allowed to drive 2-3 places still, but my mom has to make sure he remembers to eat, give him his meds at the right time of day, keep otc meds hidden, that sort of thing.mom had to go to the er the other night and was hospitalized for 2 days so my dad went without his meds. since the hospital is one of the few places he’s allowed to drive to and from by himself, she asked him to go home and get her phone charger because her phone was dead. of course, stressful or out of the ordinary situations get him even more frazzled and confused and upset. so twice he brought back just random things. on the second drive, he accidentally turned off his phone ringer (he does this all. the. time.) and no one could reach him. by the time he eventually got back his phone was dead, so they couldn’t call their friend who they would normally call in a situation where they’d need help. mom is the sole keeper of knowledge and does everything for him. i’ve been trying to get her to make a shared online spreadsheet to put all his medical info, important document locations, friends/family phone numbers, etc in case of emergency because someone will need to make sure he takes his very important heart meds and his other meds. but she’s been dragging her heels. he’s always losing his phone, keys, wallet, credit/debit cards, money, hearing aids, etc. she got him an apple watch to monitor his afib and to watch his location when he’s out. but he broke it within 2 weeks. he keeps forgetting pins so he ends up locking himself out of cards, the garage, email, etc. even though she put a card in his wallet with his pins written on it. he doesn’t remember it’s there or he’ll forget how to even use his debit card. he’s ended up getting scammed a few times and is giving money to all sorts of charities (which may or may not be legit). i don’t know. is there anything that can be attached to his wallet/keys/cards/car/phone? i’ve been looking at apple air tags but my mom’s phone isn’t compatible (too old). i tried tile before and he got rid of them and mom doesn’t know the log in. losing everything all the time upsets him, stresses out my mom, but and “aids” upset him too. i’m sorry i’m rambling. i don’t know what i’m asking. i am just feeling helpless being so far away and wish i had more info in case of emergency. i asked two of my friends who are close with my family and live near by if they’d be willing to take care of him in the event of another emergency and i gave them the garage code to get in (unless he puts in the wrong pin again and has to have it changed again), but i don’t know anything about his meds, etc.ugh. i’m feeling useless and helpless and like a bad kid for not being there for my parents.",,0
"i was on the phone with my so the other night and he expressed his and his mums concerns to me about his dads mental state. he’s always been absent minded but it seems to be getting worse, they kinda want to just think it’s because he’s getting older (he’s just turned 60) but they know that’s exactly how it started with so’s grandfather (his dads dad) who passed away from dementia a few years ago. me and so were together when his grandfather passed but our relationship was quite new and his grandfather had been suffering dementia for many years prior. i did my best at the time but didn’t really know what to do other than let him talk about his feeling about the situation, and encourage him to see his grandfather, especially once he was in care. this obviously is very different since we’re just seeing what could be early symptoms, meaning for the next how ever many years so is going to be relying on me for support as things get more difficult. it’s also made more complicated since we live around 200 miles from his parents (we’re in england so that’s half the length of the country) and though his mum wants to move closer to us, his dad is against the idea and is set on moving to scotland (a couple hundred miles in the opposite direction). it’s also hard as his father is a very stubborn man who will not want to go see a doctor, regardless of his families concern for him and that fact that his own father suffered the same. me, so and mil all understand that the earlier he can be diagnosed, the better treatment he can get to slow down the progression, but fil won’t want to hear any of that. so yeah, i’m kinda stuck for what to do. i know my opinion on doctors and such will have no impact on fil, so i just want to be there to support my so. i just don’t really know how to start other than listening to so concerns and encouraging him to talk to his dad about it all. thanks for reading, any advice would be greatly appreciated",,0
"it’s so hard to get my mother n law to wash her hands after she goes to the bathroom.  my wife goes in with her mom to get her to wash her hands, but now my mother n law says they are clean.  she insist only using 2 squares to clean herself then picks the rest of her poop out. after that she wipes her hands on her clothing and refuses to wash her hands. she goes to the bathroom all through the night so when we get up in the morning there’s poop hand prints on the walls, doors, refrigerator, coffee pot , counter tops, door knobs.  she goes through about 15-20 pairs of underwear even with the pads.  she refuses to take a bath. my wife can talk her into taking a bath about every two weeks. we have a dry erase board where we put the date, day and if it’s bath day. she even looks is at her hands with poop on them and says my hands aren’t dirty.  ughso frustrating.  my wife and i have to clean the bathroom every time we walk by just to keep the house from smelling.  every morning she is in the bathroom at least 20 times - i actually think she forgets she just went and goes again.  i got upset with her the other day, she promised my wife she would take a bath as written on her board and she said she didn’t.  i told her she smelled like poop and she was going to make herself sick as well as us too.  so get in there and take a bath.  i’ve resorted to just squirting soap in her hands when she’s not looking just to get her to wash them.  she’s also started scraping the food that she hasn’t eaten back in the pot. so if we have stew or chili, she just scrapes what’s left in her bowl back into the pot.  yuck. not sure what to do.  any suggestions.",,0
"he often writes 2000/2003 on papers now, unaware of the day of the week and confuses photos for videos. he always tells me he loves the hat in my profile photo that pops up on our video calls and would love a hat like mine. i dont know what else to say. please help me improve my dads quality of life.",,0
"i could really use some advice about obsessive behaviors. one of my dads behaviors is constantly checking the boiler. he’ll go add water to it up to 6 times a day &amp; empty it just as many times or more. he does this all day, every day. i understand it’s one of the few things he can still recall to do somewhat but it’s a huge problem. i’ve taken that responsibility on so he doesn’t have to but he does it anyways. sometimes he forgets he’s adding water or emptying water from the boiler resulting in him flooding our basement. this has to be the 5th time in 2 years. he was obsessing over the boiler not working correctly tonight (even though it was fine) &amp; proceeded to empty the boiler &amp; refill it but left the basement because he forget what he was doing, flooding it once again. he had been told the boiler was fine multiple times tonight. i had been trying to stay awake to avoid just this but i dozed off for not even 30 minutes &amp; he managed that. how do i manage this? is there anyway to detract him from being so focused on the boiler? important to note: he’s 56, was diagnosed with dementia in his late 40’s.",,0
"hi all,so sorry about the extremely long post. not sure where to start with this post but its about my father with lewey body dementia, covid and financial questions. he is extremely vulnerable to predators.backstory:my father has been dealing with frequent hallucinations for few years. it was a once in a blue moon thing starting around 2015/2016, that was typically dismissed. then with time, it progressed into a more frequent occurrence. by 2020 50% of our phone calls would be about the spirits in his house and what they had done and how he would use the power of god to dispel them. he comes from a culture that is not big on mental health and a country/continent with comparatively low dementia rates. he was proud of his “visions” as he said god had chosen him as one of the prophesying elders mentioned in the bible. he would insult and act aggressively towards any one who would suggest seeing a doctor. he also developed an obsession with international lottery mail scams which he believed with his whole being would be the key to making him a multimillionaire. he would wire money to them. with what frequency or how much… i don’t know, most likely 1000s+.his only asset is the home he lives in and he would allegedly rent out the basement and a couple rooms for extra income to supplement his social security payments. i was comforted that he was not lonely as he sometimes rents to his “friends” or people he knows from his church. other than that he seemed pretty lucid to me but i didn’t know the severity of his cognitive problems; he seemed more “quirky” than anything else. he has been seperated from my mother for maybe ten years but they have been on friendly terms with once a month contact and live in the same town. i have lived 100-1000 miles away from both parents for about 15 years so contact is less frequent on my end. the quality of his tenants started to get sketchier. a year ago he had a man move in, described as homeless who had gone through a recent operation and needed medical care. i asked why he would take someone in like that. how would he pay? he mentioned this man had relatives in the church he goes to and they pressured him because god is caring. he said this man could pay rent. that was the end of that. he allegedly kicked out that man a few months later and took in another questionable man in the summer of 2020. he kept on mentioning how this man was his true friend because he would listen to him about the spirits and his secrets. then it turned sour because this man didn’t want to hear about the “secrets” or the lottery anymore. this man contracted covid in december and was sent home from the hospital to recover. my father then contracts covid from him and is sent to the hospital. my father had changed his number a couple weeks earlier and hadn’t placed any of his families numbers in there. my father never learned how to use a computer and has trouble with smart phones so any chance of remembering our numbers from memory was nilch.  since he was not able to give out our contact numbers, this “tenant” he contracted covid from was made the point of contact. my mother goes to the house for her monthly visit and is met aggressively by this tenant. he was asking who she was and why she was there. he tells her that my father has been in the hospital for a month and he doesn’t know if he died or got lost because of the dementia. the lack of tact and blatant misinformation was appalling. turns out this man was just a couple days away from being given guardianship over my father, whether this meant power over finances… idk i’m still ignorant over what types of guardianships have what rights. the hospital social worker said that don(not the man’s real name) had already decided that my father was going to be sent to a nursing home permanently after the hospital because the hospital and don both agreed that my father was incapable of dealing with his personal affairs. we showed up just in time to stop this motion. i’m surprised and relieved my father survived. he had a hole in his lungs and was on oxygen. he lost the ability to walk and his leg muscles atrophied. his body was/is recovering but his mind seems to have gotten worse. his convos now make no sense. for a week straight he was talking about how obama was trying to steal his land and how trump would come through. we have to remind him who is talking to him on the phone. and sometimes he asks my mother about their son(she has no sons). he is now in rehab and has regained some movement in his legs. he sounded a bit more lucid on the phone yesterday. honestly i do agree with the hospital’s record of mental incapacity. i recently came across his bank statements from all the way back to 2017. **turns out he has never charged rent to any of the people living/passing through in his house for years.** his basement is alway occupied by a family… right now its a family of 5. the two bedrooms upstairs, occupied by randoms. another room is empty… reserved for this pastor that comes from his country every summer. his home is essential serving as a shelter/halfway house as he gathers people pushed on to him by the church he frequents or people he meets along the way. now it makes sense that don was offended when we called to give him a heads up about rent. he simply just said “i don’t have the money!”. apparently he’s broke because he spent so much money getting movers! this house still has a mortgage and is filthy. cockroaches are also very visible “tenants”.another concerning piece is that my father spends $1000-2000 a month on counter checks. this basically eats up the majority of his social security check. where these go to… i don’t know but now i suspect he was wiring this money to the international lotto scams or maybe just giving it out to people? a year ago he was flagged and banned from wiring money at his local supermarket because what he was doing was considered gambling. at this point, i would believe you if you told me he was paying rent to the people living there rentfree because they told him to. apparently don felt so comfortable he is using the garage as a hoarding space and got married during these few months he has been living in my fathers home. is his new wife going to move in? all of this has been so overwhelming for me, especially when thinking about my father’s future. how do you remove these people, essentially squatters? none have leases. my father needs financial supervision. would the hospital backing me up be enough to get a conservatorship(or poa?). when the time comes for long term memory care, i can see that maybe his social security + if the house is rented correctly would be enough to pay the exorbitant prices of a home but right now his finances and spending situation is a mess. he has always been very independent but now i don't think that is an option for him anymore.",,0
"my 73 yr old mother has dementia.  she lives with me.  i work full-time and am her only caretaker.  mist of the times, things are fine.  she doesn’t need a lot of care.but . . . she has a habit of picking at her skin, when there’s any kind of blemish, dry skin, scab/etc. to be picked at.  band-aids don’t last five minutes.  she takes them off and keeps picking.  i’ve tried gauze pads with different kinds of medical tape, paper tape, etc.  i’ve tried liquid band-aid applied several times daily.  most of the time she’s not aware that she’s doing it.  when i point it out as she’s doing it she denies she’s doing it.  then later she asks me why there is blood under her fingernails . . .does anyone have any ideas for helping me help her with this?",,0

"i’ll try to keep this as short as possible.this week has been the hardest one of my life. earlier this week my mom told me that my dad was all of the sudden hallucinating (in all honesty we don’t know how long because he didn’t tell my mom until this week) and was acting strange / memory issues.so i decided to take matters in my own hands and drive him to the hospital. he had blood work, urine tests, cat scans, and an mri done as well. all of his tests came back “normal.” this doesn’t make sense because...well...he’s hallucinating after not previously hallucinating (he’s 68 years old). he’s not making much sense and super paranoid. they wanted him to stay the night but he refused...so...we took him back home and he didn’t go to sleep that night. the next day he was acting weirder and hallucinations were stronger. my mom took him back to the hospital and she made him stay the night. they ran the same tests and everything is somehow fucking normal? clearly not. he does take medicine for restless legs and migraines...we researched and saw that elderly patients who take them can become confused and hallucinate. we brought it up to the hospital and they agreed to taper him off over the next week (he can’t go cold turkey because doing so could cause seizures). anyways, he stayed the night (and didn’t sleep...so that’s 2 nights) and tests were normal so the next day i came to see him and he seemed to have some moments of clarity and i thought we made real progress and that my dads mind might be coming back. before i took him home and i asked them to give him medicine to help him sleep. big mistake. he got home that day and took it before bed...it had the opposite effect. he didn’t sleep again. this is 3 days of no sleep. maybe an hour here and there. he kept waking my mom and sister up and hid their car keys. he got aggressive and threatened to hit my sisters kid claiming that he was trying to steal the house? so today i come over and take him back to the hospital demanding answers. fun fact - my dad hates hospitals. the only reason he went every time is because he forgot he went the other times thankfully. i take him today and it got ugly. i told them they needed to sedate him and keep him for my families safety and so he can finally get sleep. they gave him ativan (the same stuff that made him not sleep in the first place) and about 15-20 mins later he started getting anxious and not making sense. he said i was his lawyer and i was being a bad friend by making him be there. he asked for us to leave so we could get a burger and then come back. i explained we couldn’t do that and he got angry. then shit hit the fan. he tried to leave. security had to try and escort him back to his room and sedate him. he forgot i was his son and said if i came any closer he’d fight me. he said i was a terrible lawyer and that he’d know if i was his son. he was super confused and agitated. i just don’t know what else to do. is it dementia, effects from his medication over time, mold poisoning, lead poisoning? i forgot to mention in november his medicine dosages went up - it was around december that he started getting confused here and there but no one knew. also, they are renovating the kitchen and the floor is ripped up and exposed. could it be toxins or mold? the house was built in the 40’s...could it be lead? the doctors brushed me off when i mentioned either and didn’t test for it. i’m just frustrated and don’t know how to help get my dad back. is it stress related psychosis?i just feel like health care, apart from surgery, is a joke at this point. any suggestions or positive thoughts?",,0
"what to do if your mom won't, literally cannot sit still for a second, but due to late stage of parkinson's and now dementia she either doesn't care, still believes 100% she can and will fall flat, or forgets.... background: my mother is 65 and has had parkinson's for the past 17+ years and now dementia. she took a heavy fall 3 months back and fractured her right arm &amp; shoulder ( which is also her dominant), but the heartbreaking part is that she seems to have both mentally and literally physically deteriorated down hill within a second. she kept hallucinating (almost like the term ""sundown"", only it was for 24/7).screaming at my brother and i as if we were little and fighting when we are both now adults ( memory from the past?) thinks her sisters from korea came down to visit her ,but than believe they also left to go have fun without her which makes her angry and scream. (when no one else is around)talking to a ""little girl"" with a full conversation when there is no one there!!! got angry and paranoid that everyone is trying to poison her or her son touched her inappropriately and threatens to call the police.... ( he helps give her a bath since she just dead weights on me and i injured my back.)i can keep going, but needless to say: obviously this is not going well and seemed to keep headed down hill. we recently ((finally)) were able to get her started on dementia meds and that seemed to kinda help? she still isn't her 100% self, but just a more aggressive and headstrong version? seems more willing to correspond, but still not herself.... she keeps believing that she is capable of cooking, cleaning, and everyday household chores and that nothing will stop her, only her body literally cannot support her own weight ( just a huge amount of weight loss..... i don't even understand how. we try our best to feed her protein rich meals, veggies &amp; grain. even got her ensure and protein shakes when she absolutely won't eat and will throw huge tantrums. she is at the point where she literally cannot be left home alone, my dad is 75 and tries his best, but it is allot.... from bodily fluids discharge, tantrums, hallucinations, confrontational aggression.....and will not stop trying to do chores when she falls even with the walker. i don't know, maybe we are just at our wits end and venting here, but has anyone else experience something like this with their loved ones?what did you do?we are currently figuring out how to find more help.... whether a nurse that stops by, or a full time care facility,  but for the immediate relief of all of our family..... anything to help with now? i don't even understand how a fall would change everything so drastically. the doctor's believe she is at early stage dementia, but ( i know i'm not a doctor, and possibly there was a miscommunication on my part),but how is this a early stage?!?! it's so intense and this is just the beginning??? i'm sorry if everything seemed to bounce all over. very exhausted and overwhelmed and any to all advice will be appreciated. thanks.",,0

"myth one: alzheimer's disease is caused by amyloid and tau tangles.neither cause alzheimer's disease.  zinc that attracts amyloid oligomers and copper can increase hydrogen peroxide early in alzheimer's disease and this can do damage to brain cells.  this damage stops once copper and zinc are incorporated in amyloid plaques.  this may be what also stops alzheimer's from being a prion disease.tau tangles in and of themselves are not harmful.  nitrated tau tangles that cannot be reconstituted can interfere with neurotransmissions and the transport of nutrients in the brain.it is not a matter of starting anti-amyloid and tau strategies earlier; it is a matter of focusing on what actually causes the disease.myth two: we don't know what causes alzheimer's diseasethere are many proximate causes of alzheimer's disease and one ultimate cause.  as one researcher made the analogy there are many streams that feed into the mississippi river but it all ends up in new orleans [or close to it]. alzheimer's disease is caused by an oxidant called peroxynitrite.  peroxynitrite formation leads to nitration, oxidation, lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and dna damage.  the specific results are the lack of synthesis and release of neurotransmitters involved in short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness, the restricted flow of blood and glucose transport in the brain which can leads to apathy, wandering, and delusions, the overactivation of nmda receptors which can lead to hallucinations, an end to the regeneration of neurons in the hippocampus, and the death of neurons.  many factors can lead to peroxynitrite formation.  they include but are not limited to high levels of glucose, a high sodium diet, high fructose corn syrup, psychological of physical stress, mercury, various pesticides and herbicides, various air pollutants, several industrial solvents, bisphenols in plastics, aluminum flouride, sodium fluoride, fosamax and other osteoporosis drugs, chronic acetaminophen use, presenilin gene mutations, amyloid precursor protein mutations, the apoe4 gene, down syndrome, and various chronic bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.myth three: we have no idea how to prevent or treat alzheimer's disease.we can reduce the risk of alzheimer's disease via compounds that reduce the formation of peroxynitrite.  these include polyphenols in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and beverages.  these same polyphenols also help to scavenge peroxynitrite and reverse part of its damage.  this is why a mediterranean diet both reduces the risk of alzheimer's disease and slows it progression.myth four: nothing has ever slowed down the progression of alzheimer's disease, let alone partially reversed it.alzheimer's disease has been partially reversed in small-scale clinical trials by powerful peroxynitrite scavengers.  this includes methoxyphenols such as eugenol in rosemary essential oil via aromatherapy and ferulic acid and syringic acid in panax ginseng.for those not consumed by the above myths, the way forward to treating alzheimer's disease is almost in plain sight.",,0

"hi,i have a question about potential dementia as it relates to remembering recent activities/events/conversations...a close family member has what we think is probably (relatively early) dementia of some kind - has a lot of the classic symptoms and often forgets things that just happened (forgot he was at the dentist later that same day for example). often forgets recent conversations, and will ask the same questions several times within the span of a few days. recently he was in the passenger seat of the car and we were driving in an area he had been to several times in the past (though not in the last few years) and he was sure he'd never been there in his life. had no idea where he was.  all this leads us to think he has dementia.on the other hand, he will occasionally remember recent conversations, even a few weeks later. totally random and out of the blue. this sometimes makes me question whether or not it would be dementia or something else. there's no way to know for sure unfortunately as he would never agree to get evaluated by a doctor (there are issues of narcissism that prevent him him acknowledging there's ever anything wrong with him).anyway, is it normal for someone with dementia to sometimes remember recent occurrences, seemingly randomly? thank you!",,0
"so long time lurker, first time posting.my mother has had dementia for awhile now.  i'm not exactly sure how long because my dad didn't tell us when she was first diagnosed.  he passed away just over 3 years ago after a very short battle with heart disease.  this was the first trigger in my mom's decline.  for months after she would tell people so many different reasons why my dad wasn't around.  during one doctors visit a nurse came out and asked us if my dad was really murdered by ""hooligans"".  after about a year these stories stopped.  after the initial shock (to all of us), we found a day program for mom.  she hated going to it in the mornings ("" hate this job, i need to find a new one"") but in the afternoons she would tell us how much fun it was.  she went there 3 days a week until covid stopped that from being an option.since all the lockdowns, we have been watching her by ourselves.  her mental state has gone down so fast it seems.  she has gone from a homemaker juggling 5 kids and her mil to a woman that cannot remember how to use the toilet.  my wife stopped working so that she could help watch mom full time but it gets to be so much sometimes.  who ever is watching her can get so frustrated at times because she will refuse to do anything.  small blessing is that she has not gotten mean yet (fingers crossed). a couple days ago my youngest brother came by for a visit.  the day after he sent a text to all of us kids (5 total) saying that we should find a care facility for her.  this caused my wife and i to feel like failures.  she cared for me so long, how come i can't handle caring for her for more than 3 years?  would dad have given up this quickly?  the rational side of my brain does kick in most times and i know that we are not giving up, that this disease is  only going to get worse.  i also understand that we are very lucky that my dad made sure that mom would had everything she needs to be taken care of (which leads us to believe that he knew well before he got sick).  \\rant&amp;#x200b;tldr: just feeling bad that we are looking for a long term care solution for mom.",,0
"ive been on this sub for months watching the journey of others.  i think this may be the safest place to let it out in order for me to gain some kinda mental solace, if that's the proper terminology.  my faith and trust in god is disappearing quickly and that scares me a lot!my family and i had been receiving calls (at 2 and 3am sometimes!) from dads live in whore/girlfriend of almost ten years informing us that she thought he had dementia.  i was working two jobs after surviving covid, getting myself back up after losing a car in a george floyd riot and my own child before my girl was full term (8.5 months to be exact) when i finally got the call from dad himself. knowing that dad's been actively using (hiding habits the entire time!) for 50+ years, i was very standoffish with becoming involved.  it took a very serious "" dad have you been using again?"" to hear that something just didn't sound right.  when i arrived by greyhound here, caught a bus to dad's place and walked in, i finally got the full look at the last day of my life as i knew it.  found my dad laying in bed, dirty sheets full of poop/pee/bugs in clothes that hadn't been changed in months in an apartment that hadn't been cleaned in years, drunk and chain smoking cigarettes, pissing into a mop bucket because he just couldn't make it to the bathroom anymore, blood pressure was 183/nothing, got him to the hospital asap.  saddest part about this is all she had to do was push his life alert button on his arm.  instead she turned the light off and left him to die, alone, told him to get help as soon as she left because she found someone who wasn't as broken and old as he is.  man, this was an eye opener, on my 40th birthday, when we, as family, trusted dad's decision making skills and girlfriend for all the years prior to stand by the man she loved and be the rock he had been to her, paying her way for everything, rent, food, allowing disability benefits to be drawn on his address, getting benefits for her children on this address, using him for all he was worth.  figured out its had been about a year since the whore had been inside this apartment also, she's been too busy scheming other married men in the neighborhood for money for crack and using dad's money to go on trips with other men to be attentive to my dad, as the neighbors had informed me.  they had been giving him money when he asked because that's all he's known will help cure the pain.  that was end of march 2021, i've been here since, scrubbing the fuck outta his apartment, getting rid of bugs (from my own pocket and savings!) losing my own clothes to the bugs, cleaning, cooking, running errands, paying bills, trying to figure out exactly what this man has been up to and why he didn't see living like this was just downright foul and wrong.  it was then i started seeing the cognitive decline.  dad has been going to the va docs drunk every appointment, showboating, being dishonest, lying to cover up other lies, masking everything because he just doesn't want to accept the quad diagnosis (early onset dementia/heart failure/copd/ed on top of mini strokes) and wants to stay young forever.  the aging process on top of it all has added more stress also.  being a veteran hasn't helped much as i'm feeling they diagnosed him a year ago and he just never told anyone.it's getting to be a lot too much lately, the constant need for nurturing, the doctors appointments in which they watch me watching him to see if i can tell if he's lying to them, the days of no sleep, the constant discord between a father and son who have never been close to begin with, warning signs of more decline, running away when he gets angry/confused/confounded and hiding, missing medications.  as a child he would always have conflicts with my ma and would use that to his advantage, most of the time abusing her physically so she would call the cops and have him escorted out just so he didn't have to give money for rent, food, clothes, shoes, etc.  this gave him reason to take his money into the streets, running the neighbor for days at a time, ignoring his child.  i clearly recall three separate instances of him hitting my ma and me snapping out at age 9, 10 and eleven.  the last being the first time i took the biggest kitchen knife and ran at him full speed with all of my might, screaming ""you ain't gonna hit my mama no more!""the other bigger factor is the hidden family secret of h molesting me and raping me.  i was taken by my ma to her mother's and it was discussed and decided that they couldn't tell anyone and ruin the family name, nor could they take me to the hospital to be seen about cause people would talk.  so it had been decided, by ma's sisters and mother, that mental help would be the best for me and i was put into programs for disgruntled/troubled youth at a very early age and the truth has never come out until after ma died about ten years ago this month.  efffffff, the last point puts so much hatred in my heart towards this man for not ever putting me first when it came to needs.  i didn't need a bike, i needed food.  i didn't need nintendo, i needed time spent with him teaching me how to work on cars and fish and be a dude.  because i was always hidden away with family after school or on weekends, i tended to get a lot of bullying from the kids in school.  the first time i was called a faggot was in kindergarten and i didn't know what it was.  i came home, asked my ma and she took me immediately to her mother who taught me to always study the word of god to find understand no matter what it is.  that book would answer any questions i had whether she or my ma had an answer or not.  my dad's mother reminded me that ""fagotto"" was a popular style of upbeat tempo in music and always told me to sing to god my troubles and trust in him with all my might and he would take care of it.since stepping into the roll of being dad's caretaker a lot has happened, i'm starting to see my own mental decline, again, after years of putting it all back together, failed marriage, losing my hair and my teeth, not eating, countless jobs, ma's funeral (that haunts me every day now because dad reminds me that he replaced her with a younger model because she was broken every day!), etc.  been seeing that i'm not the only one who's been through pure torture and mentally fucked from the person that i'm taking care of.  just recalling all of this makes me feel quite nauseated, so i think i'll stop here for now and cry myself to sleep for the next 20 minutes before he comes into the kitchen and asks me if i'm ""gonna crawl into bed with him and keep him company until he falls back to sleep"" in that same creepy tone as the night he raped me as a child.fyi: it can be very easy to assume that i would be aggressive towards him due to the nature of this post.  it's a vent situation here and i'm trusting that it's safe to let these facts out here instead of bombarding my family anymore than i have.  unearthing the family secret about my childhood is enough for them to me er speak to me again.  just wondering if there are any other caregivers who are trapped in situations like i am who have always been taught to ""honor and respect their parents"" as it has been instilled in me.  i'm doing this all by myself here, no job because he's a danger to himself and the world outside the door during the day and a wanderer at night.  thanks for the safe place y'all and letting get things off my chest.  feedback welcomed, help/food donations are very welcomed also because the stress of support his eating habits now that he's completely clean keeps me from eating daily at this point.",,0
"hi alli wanted to give a heads up to everyone about how covid and the economy is affecting care facilities. as you have probably heard, there are major challenges with hiring everywhere, and in the health care field, many people have quit work. the impact is that care facilities across the us are having trouble with staffing. facilities which pay well (and thus probably cost more) are hiring the good staff away from smaller or lower paying facilities. and those smaller facilities are having to hire anyone they can get, which may mean they are short staffed, or have new or untrained staff. at best, it means that your loved one might be being cared for by a new person who is unfamiliar with their status and conditions.   i recommend that you increase your visits right now to monitor the care your loved one is getting. when you are with your loved one, do a deeper check - don't just ask the aids if there have been any falls or incidents, look over your loved one's body for unexplained bruises, swelling, or other signs of issues. keep a record of anything you are told.&amp;#x200b;we are currently dealing with hospitals, the state investigators and the police over an incident, which is what prompted me to post this. i can't give details until the investigations are complete, but please be careful. it's a difficult time in the world right now.",,0
"i have not had any alcohol since june 25th.  my mother in law with dementia who had been living with us for over 2 1/2 years was recently placed in a nursing home yesterday.  my husband is the one who got her admitted and is struggling with guilt, and anger, and greiving.  i have been taking care of her consistently several days a week for months now and it has effected my mental health.  i was drinking to cope with the stress of her being here.  she was not easy to deal with and often tried to walk away.  we couldn't let that happen because we live ina  rural area near main roads and she would get lost and possibly run over since she has not a concept of danger.  he came home last night and asked me to leave and said he couldn't deal with me so i did.  today he was been in a bad mood bordering on needing to go somewhere for help.  i drove past a liquor store 4 times today.  i made sure to be on the phone with a supportive friend so i can honestly say i didn't drink when that would be my solution in the past.  my husband is hurt and angry with me and my kids.  he called me selfish.  he says he doesn't feel like i care about him.  i wake him up. make his coffee, make his lunch, keep the laundry done, cook supper, do dishes.  i have been cuddling with him extra and even left social engagements early so tath i could hang out with him and make him feel supported.  i wish i knew where i went wrong.  but i didn't drink, and i so want to.  the store by my house is closed so i am home waiting for my meds to kick in so i can go to sleep.  i just need someone to give me advice on how to prove that i care about him.  what can i do to make h im believe that?  he, my son, my daughter and myself are in therapy seperately and sometimes together.  the main point of contention is that my son is trying to assert his independence and my husband wants to try to have more control over him.  but i didn't drink.  i have therapy wednesday and he has it tuesday.  i may see if i can get him to come to my session and do a littel marriage work.  i know a lot of this wall of text has nothing to do with drinking, per se, but in teh past i would be drunk right now so i didn't have to feel.  iwndwyt",,0
"dad was diagnosed sometime early in 2019.  can’t remember the exact day because it all has blended together.  he came out of the hospital going through speech  therapy.   he came out needing 24/7 care.    my siblings thought that would be a temporary thing and after months of not visiting dad before his stroke, even though they lived less than 10 miles away,  they played hero and were with him any chance they got.  then it became to much for them.  they were missing cookouts and beach trips with their spouses friends.   even though one sibling only had to stay the night with dad a few nights a week, coming home to dinner cooked and getting to watch tv the rest of the night was to much for her.so, here we are a few months later, my wife and i, with our 3 school aged children are my dads only caregivers even though there’s plenty of family less than a few miles.  he hasn’t progressed enough for any out of home care, but he can’t function the basics of everyday life on his own.  we were supposed to be having baby number 4 here today...july 9th but lost that child unfortunately a few months ago with a miscarriage.  no vacations, no days off, no nights off, both of us working 45-55 hours a week to provide for our family.    dads savings will run out in about a year, then the home health that looks after him when we work will not be affordable.   i pray every night that he passes peacefully in his sleep before this damn condition takes any dignity that he has left.",,0

"good morning y'all! so i have the honor of being the program director on a small dementia unit in a nursing home- the company took a bit of a gamble on me and i think it's paying off for them and for me- we all seem to be doing really well but i want to be positive that i'm knocking it out of the park.   i have a few unique cases of dementia on my unit; one is a case of some sort of alcohol related dementia, one is a visceral ftd dementia (like, comments on the titties a lot), and several cases i haven't been able to identify (without looking in the system). i am looking for activity suggestions that appeal to a large group. many of my residents are quite sharp still and i do not speak to them slowly or condescendingly because they are all ""there"". this group loves exercise and reminiscence kits, which are, by the way, best things ever. some residents don't speak at all or are extremely anxious. i bought a bluetooth speaker and downloaded a special playlist and i can see them fighting in their heads to come alive for the music. it's fascinating.still another is constantly exit seeking- i've found it most effective to just beat him to the punch and take him out. i'm concerned because he's a tall dude with extensive military experience in good shape and he could absolutely take off, but he hasn't even attempted it with me because we have mutual respect. other activities are of course snacking, some gardening, and a few art projects. bingo is never turned down, and old-time movies as well. &amp;#x200b;what else can i be doing?",,0

"hello wonderful community. any advice would be appreciated.  my grandmother has alzheimer's and plays candy crush-style games as her main source of entertainment. it's great that she has this outlet because she finds it difficult to read books due to her failing memory (she has some insight into her condition). she plays the games on an old **iphone 5** and **first-generation ipad mini**. the problem is that, as her cognitive decline worsens, she's increasingly having trouble working the charging cables for the devices.  she forces the wrong cable into devices, damaging both. she constantly breaks cables and misplaces them. she puts cases on the wrong way, covering the charging slot, and wonders why it isn't working. she assumes a device is being charged even when the cable hasn't been properly inserted. ultimately she gets very frustrated and upset when her devices run out of power and she can't play her games. her family also gets frustrated with her regular phone calls asking to drive over at all hours to help her with the devices.   i've looked into wireless charging stations but they don't work for ipads or pre-iphone 8s. besides the charging issues, she also has trouble loading money into itunes to unlock game levels (which is important to her) and needs constant help with that. she doesn't necessarily need a smart phone as the game are the only thing she uses it for.&amp;#x200b;so, does anyone have suggestions for:  1) a basic handheld, touch screen gaming device that has access to candy crush-style games?   extra points if you can just purchase the games outright rather than a freemium model where you keep having to pay to unlock things.  2) an alternative to standard insert charging cables for apple devices? wireless charging isn't an option unless we buy her a new model of phone.  thanks all!",,0
"in reading these threads, i always wonder about the timeline of events leading up to a person’s diagnosis. for instance, my mother’s journey would look like this:2014: father gets leukemia, mom has trouble visiting him in the city. later, my nephew is born and she seems somewhat apathetic. he’s born in the city as well, and she gets lost trying to visit. we chalk it up to her being a nervous driver. she is 64. 2015: gets lost going to mcdonalds in the dark... a drive she’s made dozens of times before in an area she’s lived in for 30 years. we chalk it up to cataracts, which she has removed later in early 2016.2016: my aunt is placed in assisted living with advanced alzheimer’s in august. i knew she wasn’t quite right, but i had no clue it had gotten so bad because mom had never indicated as much. driving back from the hospital alone, mom ends up on the wrong side of the road and enters an army base. she’s pulled over by a half dozen cops. at this point i’m in denial, but i urge her to get a mental health exam. she gets a referral from the doctor, but between my aunt and life, nothing ever comes of it.2017: mom continues to slip. she’s still independent but she no longer understands how to gas up a car, she refuses to cook, and she’s been escorted home several times in the dark from church. i tell her she can’t go out at night anymore. in october, she can’t remember when her next drs appointment is, so instead of calling, she drives there and ends up lost. the dr drops her off, leaving me to find her car, which she can’t remember where she left.2018: i start receiving late notices in the beginning of the year. she’s writing the checks but the written amounts don’t match the numerical amounts. when leaving to go to target she’s gone for hours at a time. target is 2 minutes away. when questioned about why she’s been gone so long, she gets defensive. i have a panic attack every time she leaves. i ask her to let me know where she’s going but she rarely does. i force her to go to the drs for another referral, where the dr clearly states that she has dementia. i’m stunned that he didn’t think it was important to tell her family that. in april we have our first neurologist appointment. in june, she’s officially diagnosed with alzheimer’s at the age of 67. in july, my brother and i make the decision that it’s no longer safe for her to drive. in late august, she gets angry with me for not sharing a personal pizza with her. this aggression happens a couple times a month. in december, my aunt passes at 73. mom won’t let me help her pick out an outfit; she decides on the same black jeans she always wears and a sweatshirt. from this point on, her aggression and paranoia have a marked increase. in january 2019, her sense of taste change, and she starts throwing out food i make her unless it’s sweet or bland. over the next several months, her behavior worsens, including tantrums and physical aggression. her hygiene begins to suffer, and she aggressively cuts her own hair, leaving both sides patchy but the top long. she refuses to let me take her to get a cut. in may, my brother and i place her in an assisted living community. she still speaks poorly of me, despite not having seen me since june. she turned 69 in december.that’s about it for me. what does your timeline look like?",,0
"my 59-year old mother just got diagnosed with alzheimers for a few months now. the symptoms have been there and badly worsening for around 5 years now, though. that's because doctors suspected her brain tumor/chemotherapy/medication were the cause of all of them until not that long ago.well, i'm 17 now and i feel like i never really got to know my mother. i didn't have enough time with her, and she's lost her real personality a few years ago. and she's getting worse rapidly.today she came home bloody and crying with a deeply split lip. she was super upset and kept telling us that a big branch had fallen on her while she was gardening. only that it's almost winter now in our country (the weather for gardening is definetly over) and when we looked at the garden there was absolutely no big branch on the ground. only a shitton of blood. but there was a broken off gardening tool but we didn't find the spike that broke off (that could've hurt her). apparently she had a really bad fall, my dad assumes. when i came home today, the person sitting there looked like a whole different human. she looked so small, sad and confused, sunken in like it was just a shell. when i entered she flinched. i asked her how she was feeling and her voice while speaking sounded like she would start to cry any moment. i just couldn't take it. she was in desperate need to be comforted but i just did not know how to do it. i wanted to cry so bad.now i feel guilty. guilty for not being there for her, for leaving my completly emotionally exhausted dad alone with her. worried because her alzheimers has been progressing so rapidly lately and sad. sad that apparently she isn't even able to go outside by herself anymore/ride her bike somewhere and has lost all independence now. i'm sorry this is so long. i just don't have anyone to tell, because i just don't now how to. i also can't tell a therapist right now because i'm in the midst of getting admitted to a clinic for various other mental health issues and we have other priorities (finding the underlying issues and not the obvious reason: i lost my mom really young and it destroyed my family and all my ability to form healthy friendships/relationships). i guess this is just a rant, dunno if anybody reads this :)",,0

so my dad has very advanced dementia and forgets things from moment to moment.  he gets very easily confused as to where he is and who is around. at times when i look at his eyes he seems scared at times. especially when he goes to the bathroom or i go into his room when he wakes up alone. i found a site called aniprinz  and they make custom shirts for people with dementia. i bought him one that when looked in the mirror from his perspective that reminds him that he is not alone. it seems to have help a bit when he reads it. i think i may try a custom message next time to remind him to was his hands too. 🤗,,0

"first post here. first of all, i'm sorry about the difficulties you all go through, either yourselves or while taking care of your loved ones. my family is new to this and it is overwhelming. my thoughts go out to all of you. disclaimer - i am not one of the caregivers since i reside abroad currently. i am posting here since i needed some perspective from people who may have experience with this aspect of care.my grandmother, someone known to have irritable bowel syndrome, has been diagnosed with dementia and bpd in her 70s. to be honest, we saw it coming, but it got so much worse so quickly in april after she had a fall, a pelvic fracture and a head injury (her brain scans are clear now, whatever bleed she had has resolved apparently). within a matter of days she was hallucinating/delusional and things set in as a mix of amnesia/disorientation alternating with her crying/yelling for days on end. she developed diarrhea on and off, which worsened in july, which then meant she needed hospitalization for low potassium and low dehydration. after a week or so of in-patient care she is home with an ng tube to keep her food intake up, and she has episodes of diarrhea on and off. infectious causes have been ruled out and they're chalking it up to her ibs. i know this is complicated but i guess all i'm asking is - how do you manage diarrhea/ibs in someone who isn't in their senses anymore? are there foods or supplements that help? even her doctors are scratching their heads. they started her on epival and that made her diarrhea worse so they stopped it, but it's still happening and it is draining her caregivers at home. she is a tall and heavy-set woman. cleaning up after her needs 4 people. it's just really exhausting for everyone.",,0
"i'm about to write to the va, but need advice, especially from people familiar with the va. main question: for ftd patients mobile and mostly physically healthy, how can you get more home aide care hours of watching them, if your local va clinic says your at the max? (obviously cheaper for va to pay for than alf's!)* i'm thinking of trying to do that and get 4 full days a week of home aide help (is now 8 hours), and maybe adding locks to the doors so my dad can't sneak out when we're in the bathroom. my mom is so stressed from caregiving that she said to research alf's, but i think this plan would relieve us enough to keep him home. my intuition tells me the alf would be bad, and trying adult day cares was awful, they upset him and he refused to do anything but try to escape and run home.* background: my sweet dad is 100% disabled veteran, 62, supposedly all his health care should be taken care of for free now. the va reasoning my mom cited is that he can do most ""normal activities of living"", he just needs to be supervised because he likes to go out of the house walking, 3x a day and obsessively say prayers at different neighbors lawn statues, crossing a main road often too. i try to always jump up when he heads to the door and walk with him so i know he's safe. (no issues getting lost, always goes the same route, knows how to get everywhere/home, careful around cars) he has to be cooked for, and cannot say many sentences anymore, or express himself well.* so he has to basically be monitored all day. my mom's taken great care of him the last 3 years, but the stress of this is destroying us health wise, we both developed high cortisol, auto-immune diseases, failing thyroids, anxiety disorders, went from healthy weights to obesity (despite working out and eating very healthy!). and he treats her like a piece of furniture mostly while hugging me every day, so extra heartbreak for her.the other day she developed a scary sounding cough, and i decided she can't do this anymore (even with me giving her time off 3 days/wk) i cannot lose her too and be alone in the world with no family (kind of selfish, yea).* [fyi: if everyone thinks ""va just won't give you more hours, only a nursing home"", i will simply visit my senator to change it. i am an activist thanks to my dad's influence and will not accept va status quo anymore]any advice welcomed!!",,0
"hi everyone,i'm in my final year at university and currently waiting for my 60 year old father's diagnosis but according to most doctors it's some sort of dementia. i was wondering if other people around my age (25) had been or were facing the same challenges at the moment? i've lived abroad quite a lot these last few years and so did my siblings so no one is really around my mother to help out looking after my father and i get that this is incredibly hard on her especially as there have been some pretty brutal changes in the last few months (my father can no longer work and he can barely speak...), he's also become aggressive towards her saying some pretty nasty things. my other siblings don't really care about the whole situation and we're not in touch. i kind of carry the ""emotional"" burden of my mother, i'm the only one she'd talk to about this and for now that's all i can do.she would never ask me to move back in but i can't help wondering if that's what she wants. i've asked but she said no, that it would mean wasting what i have done these last few years.everytime i'm home she does say that he is calm and cheerful when i'm around and she feels less stressed out. the thing is i'm at a crossroads in my life too. i'm about to graduate in international relations and there is no way i can find a job in this area in my hometown and i hate myself for even thinking like this especially when i know what my mother is going through on her own but what did you guys do? how do you feel about your decision to go home or not?i'm also puzzled because money-wise things have been shit lately for my parents, i'm financially independent so i'm ok but they are not as they just lost my father's income and closing his business turned out to cost a lot of money... so i'm also thinking that if i got a good job after graduating that could be another way to help.i feel like i'm reacting like a child, i know what to do, where i'm expected and that moving home is the right thing to do but my very selfish side also dreads going home because that would mean no future perspective for me. anyway some advice or anything is welcome. i'm just rambling here as i guess i needed to write this down and get some outside opinions.thank you and good luck to all of you out there going through some shit.",,0
"my grandma has dementia and i am more than done with all the shit i have to put up with day in and day out. i am literally pulling my hair out every single day just trying to move on with all the stress i have to deal with.let's just start with a few things i have to deal with:1. name calling: my grandma is very religious and i'm constantly being called a ""demon"" or i should go die because she doesn't like the way her food is prepared, she blames me for ""supposedly"" for going into her room, or just for something so menial and retarded i just can't.my grandma loves to believe that everything is mine mine mine: this one really irritates me and just overall makes me want to punch a wall, because no i'm sorry but not everything is hers. after she's done eating she likes to take the plate and silverware to her room because ""she bought it"" and it is supposedly hers, and once it is in her room it then is lost forever in the dark abyss of her luggages (she doesn't use a dresser despite one being in her room). you don't know how infuriating it is having to buy and waste money upon buying new plates, cups, you name it just because my grandma took it. not to mention, she believes every single one of my own nike shoes is hers, clothes of either my own or my moms are being stolen left and right, and just recently she stole my dogs fucking sweater. i don't know about anyone else, but when my own shit is taken i feel as though it is an attack on my own very existence, and best believe until whatever is stolen is returned i will not stand for such bullshit.2. too many questions: i feel as though i just tape a sign to my forehead that reads whatever question she's asking, and often times it's the same god damn question just asked over and over and over and over and over again. it'll really drive someone nuts. sometimes i get so tired of answering the same questions over and over again, so i just flat out ignore her and when i do that she gets mad that i don't answer her questions. i get so frustrated with this one because she asks questions such as ""where's my mother, father, or brother?"" and i of course for the millionth time in row have to break the news that they of course are all dead.3. she walks out the door: this one is truly my favorite as it requires me to waste my time and physically chase after her around the neighborhood. if my grandmother is truly upset, because of whatever reason it is she loves walking out the front door and going who knows where. you don't know how many times i've had to call the police because she wouldn't get into the car with me, and come back home and sometimes i feel so embarrassed having to call the police. not to mention, just recently when she walked out the house she started to throw rocks at my car and wanted to hit me with a stick.4. hygiene: this one is just really fucking gross and there's no easy way to put this. but once my grandmother is done taking a dump sometimes i notice she doesn't really wash her hands even though there's a huge sign in the bathroom mirror that reminds her. all she does after depositing her shit is splish splash a little water and a smidge of soap onto her hands and doesn't even properly scrub. not to mention, she hasn't taken a shower since like november and me and my mom try and try our best to urge her to take a shower but no as she thinks we are attacking her.these are the things that only just scratched the surface of what i have to deal with day in and day out, and i know what everyone is going to say, it's the disease don't take it seriously, just brush it off. no. i am done brushing it off and i am taking this shit seriously.i also just want everyone to know that i am only 21 years old. i am a full time college student. so on top of all the stress of my classes at school i have to deal with the stresses at home. also no, i don't have the means to go out and live on my own. i'm certainly not a trained professional and unfortunately i am only getting paid a measly $200 a month (under the table, i am not on the payroll).clearly my own mother does not see how stressed out i am as she does not have to deal with her as i do. sometimes when my grandmother comes home from her senior day care program i have to either use my own money to buy her food (which she doesn't even eat sometimes) because we are out of groceries. alternatively, i do not feed her at all and wait for my mother to come home from work which isn't until 5 to 7 at night and my mom is too tired from work that she doesn't prepare dinner until 9 or so and the diner isn't done until 10 or 11. all the while my grandmother goes to sleep around 8pm-ish and is thusly too tired to wait and eat the diner my mom has prepared. so it is really my fault that sometimes my grandma does not eat at night? in my own defense, no it is not.this is just a copy and paste from a post i made previously. but this is an update, as i truly feel as though i need to kill myself because i cannot take the stress any longer of living with my grandmother. i have already cut myself within the past week and bang my head against the wall several times. i cannot guarantee what will happen in the future. i live in the state of california, usa in sacramento and if someone could just pinpoint me to a website for an assistive care living or a lock down facility. this would truly be helpful to me.",,0

"my dad currently wants a divorce from my mom cause he believes she's keeping all their money for herself.  my mom would absolutely love a divorce so everyone is in agreement there.the issue for me who is my dads power of attorney is that i assume mom will have to give my dad her half of her 401k money as he doesn't have any 401k money of his own and most their assets are there.  this will mean a lot of money is placed in his bank account.   my dad cannot handle money and is highly likely to be scammed.  he will want direct access to all his accounts.i don't think limiting his phone contacts alone is enough.   his few ""friends"" are all a bunch of leeches.  throughout his whole life, he has always given away money to people or hires his friends to do projects for him where they grossly overcharge him. he uses money to buy friends. it'll probably be even worse now with dementia.   i can also easily see a gold digger wanting to marry him to take him for every penny he's got (he will brag about money).how do i make sure he doesn't lose everything?",,0
"i (26f) have been taking care of my grandmother with lewy body since march. both of my grandparents had gotten covid, and my grandpa ended up in the hospital for 15 days so i had to stay with my grandma. it was only supposed to be until he was home and well, and yet i’m still here. i can feel my fuse shortening with her and it hurts my heart. i’m currently in school for psw (cna) and also working as a homecare aid. i was doing this before becoming a full time caregiver and i’m just so exhausted. it never ends. i wake up- do care, go to work- do care, go to my 8 hour placement- do care, come home- do care. i do have my dad and aunt to help, obviously as i can’t be home all the time with work and school. i’m also able to stay at my boyfriends on weekends and one day during the week (this is pretty recent) but this means i have basically no alone time. i stayed the night at my aunts last week while she was out, and it was the first time i had been alone- not expecting someone or needing to do something- in months. my grandma is also declining quickly, and my aunt is her poa who doesn’t want to put her in a home and has been procrastinating getting full time care for months now. i can’t do this for much longer- i just can’t. i want to go home, my dog is at my dads house and i just want to go get him, lay in a bed that’s not a single with a candle and have all my stuff in one place. i know i’m being selfish, i should be better at this since it’s my literal job and i’m lucky to get a few nights off a week from this but god. i don’t even know. sorry this is so all over the place. i just needed to type it out.",,0
"my grandmother (74f) has dementia and it's getting to be too much right now.she's been refusing to eat anything my mother makes her, calling it raw and junk, and only eats bland basic food like plain rice or tortillas dipped in chili. i bring her salads and other stuff from my job she used to love, but she's been giving them to the dog when i'm not looking. (my dog is fine. he's very chill around food and doesn't eat what she tries to give him)i asked her why she keeps refusing to eat and she went on this whole rant about how she doesn't want to burden us by eating food she didn't pay for and how my mother would flip her shit if she caught her eating stuff that was hers and how food doesn't taste good anymore. it was scary to listen to, since my mother has never said any of that and is actually trying to get her to eat more food. same with drinking water, which she refuses.right now, she's bawling her eyes out because my mother doesn't let her wash clothes or do dishes anymore because nothing she does is right and how if we don't want her help, we should just ship her to mexico to die. my mother doesn't let her do chores since she can barely stand, let alone walk, and breaks the dishes whenever she tries since mugs are too heavy for her now. the few times she managed to sneak her way into the basement to do laundry, she got stuck at the bottom since she couldn't lift her legs enough to walk upstairs.she snuck out while my aunt was asleep to tend to my garden and plucked a lot of unripe plants since ""i'm not doing it right and she was sick of asking me to pick my tomatoes"". this resulted in her falling over and not being found until an hour later at 11am when she managed to push herself up and walk back inside. when we asked her why, she started crying and calling us all abusive and evil for not letting her do anything.she's also been claiming some really bad things about people. like, when she was hospitalized with covid, they had to restrain her since she kept trying to wander off and started screaming that the nurses were taking her blood to sell on the black market. after she got out, she told the entire family that we all hated her and left her to rot in the hospital alone without visiting her, even though my aunt took a week off work to stay with her 24/7. just today, she said that my mother threw all her blankets at her face and told her that she's not allowed clean laundry anymore. my mother's been at work all day.is this normal?",,0
"my mid-70s parents live just outside a small town. my mom is in the early stages of alzheimers, has considerable confusion, anxiety and memory issues, and has never been a good driver. a few car issues (not caused by her driving), covid, and then an expired license kept her off the roads for the last year.  but she really can't get anywhere without driving. and while my dad is always happy to take her, and they go to the grocery store and other places together, she pushed tremendously to get her license renewed. she wants to go to her group exercise class on her own and, because she has a very strong need to feel useful, she wants to go get groceries, etc. on her own too.  there's lots of ego and pride issues there too. for various reasons, my dad preferred to leave it up to her to see if she could pass the driver's test, rather than request the written test for her (which she would have failed, she can't handle forms) or get a note from their dr and have her license revoked. but now she passed, and we're all trying to figure out what to do to keep her off the roads. any suggestions? appealing to reason and common sense doesn't work. she doesn't believe she'll hit anyone and ignores all ""mom, you should not be driving"" discussions. since she's always losing her keys anyway, hiding them doesn't work - she won't realize that it's to stop her from driving. and while my dad is happy to invent errands etc so that he can drop her off various places, she'll invent her own so that she can drive.  ugh. i'm sure this is a common problem - any suggestions for ideas to keep her off the road? ideally ones my dad (her primary caregiver and poa) won't find deceitful or underhanded? thank you!!",,0
"hello all,my dad(80) and step-mom(75) left yesterday for an 8 day vacation that we were concerned about, but hopeful they would enjoy. my step-mom has been having various levels of mania for a year and has had the focus of most of our attention. my dad was diagnosed with early-stage alzheimers last august, just before she started having manic episodes. (her breakdown was definitely partially due to his diagnosis. )my dads license was taken in january and he’s really upset. thinks he had another 5 years of driving in him. i saw things that made me nervous for several years and there have been lapses in memory, moments of confusion, and stories that he is sure happened but definitely didn’t. however, for the most part, our conversations are pretty cogent. my question is this. how much is he pulling himself together when he’s talking with me? i see or talk to him about every three or four days. it’s usually pretty surface stuff, but i saw him on friday for several hours, and honestly he was so with it i questioned us having his license pulled.  he was navigating the grocery store, having a nuanced discussion about how to handle covid, talking about my dog. all kinds of stuff but he was completely there. this, as opposed to what my step-mom is telling me. they are coming back home tonight. a little more than 24 hours after they left. her story is that he was yelling at her while driving that she’s going the wrong way, couldn’t sleep in the bed because it’s too firm to the point that they woke the air bnb staff to get a cot at 4am, which he also didn’t like. and he wanted to come home. talking to her was a tour-de-force of lost dreams today that they will never be able to travel. their vacation was ruined because his disease is so bad he needs to be in his own space or it’s too upsetting for him. all of this seems very plausible. we were preparing to meet them at their home to help them unpack and kind of deal emotionally with the loss of this trip. which is hard to do because they get mad at us if we imply they are incapable of things or having any issues. then i called my dad. we had a completely calm conversation. the beds were too hard, so they’re coming home. he wanted to go on to their second destination, but my step-mom didn’t and he does what the boss wants. no anger. no depression. everything is fine. at this point i don’t know if they will get home just fine, or i’ll be driving three hours to help them navigate home. i don’t know if my dad is really slipping like my stepmom keeps saying or if her mania is the problem. they’ve got me so confused i’m not even sure if my dads license should have been pulled. maybe the stories she was telling didn’t really happen?tl;dr:how much can a persons behavior swing between there and not there? my dad seems very with it compared to the stories i’m hearing from his wife.",,0
"my grandma doesn't have a formal diagnosis but its clear that she likely has dementia. this has been clear for about a year that something wasn't right with her memory but ever since covid started, its been going downhill fast. the bright spot is that my mom has been so on top of things and has finally gotten my grandfather to agree to let her to talk to the family gp. which in turn got a referral to a geriatric team that specialise in this, might help us get her some medication and give my grandfather a bit of mental relief.but my mom's siblings are not helping the situation. my aunt keeps telling my mom that we *have* to tell my grandma this evaluation is happening (even though we don't have a date yet and it'll just cause distress). my grandma has become a flight risk and instead of disabling the battery in the car (which my grandfather was fine with) my uncle didn't do it and instead ""hid"" the car keys which were found in 2 hours by her. my other uncle has a young family so he can't participate in going up and helping out my grandad a bit.i just want to yell. i'm watching my grandad have his heartbroken when the woman he loves thinks he's an intruder and doesn't recognize him and is mean, i'm watching my mom try to manage her own job, helping my grandparents, and not feel guilt about when she can't be with them (they live about 3 hours away). i just want my family to be on the same page, help each other and keep heads above the water. i'm trying to help and be supportive of my mom but its hard when my grandma is starting to misplace me. she can't tell who i am on the phone and i'm left feeling like i make the situation worse if i call.i know the only way forward is through but it just sucks.sorry i just needed to vent a little. i've been on the sub a fair bit reading and you guys all are such a big help in making me feel like i'm not alone.",,0
my mum (55) has been recently (last 6 months) diagnosed with early onset alzheimer’s - we are still waiting on the final scans to confirm the plaques but multiple numerologists have said that is what it is and she has now been off work for a year. i’m really struggling to come to terms with it but that isn’t why i’m posting. the reason for this post is that mum is still driving and she is very unsafe on the roads but is pretty unaware of it. i’ve tried to draw her attention to it but she just says “oh i get flustered and stressed out when i’m lost or my maps aren’t working”. she has almost been in a few accidents when i’m in the car. she often will randomly slow to like 20km/hour when she is flustered (like even on motorways and stuff!!!!) and run red lights and things. i’m incredibly worried for her own safety but also if she hurt someone else she’d never forgive herself. i don’t know how to sensitively broach this with her and my dad doesn’t understand the extent of the issue because when they’re in the car together he is the one driving. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!,,0

"my dad has never been particularly bright or observant, but lately it is getting to be so difficult to be around him. he has trouble following conversations. if we are talking to someone he usually comes to a completely different conclusion than me. and he is constantly only talking to other people about himself, almost like an adolescent. one thing that drives me nuts is if we watch the news or a movie he somehow misinterprets the entire plot or storyline. he no longer understands context in conversation either. so he still unloads the dishwasher and does laundry, but if you ask something like “is that clean” while he’s doing it he’s genuinely confused as to what you’re asking. hes forgetful to the max, always arguing with customer service reps over misunderstanding his bill or forgetting passwords. he's 65, and has always been slim. he has passed out quite frequently from low glucose, and i think that might have some effect?he’s opposed to going to a shrink, so what are my options?",,0
"my nana has had dementia for about 8 years now. while my family all take turns sleeping at her house at nighttime to make sure she’s safe, the “big jobs” (bathing, changing pads, anything with bodily fluids xd) seems to fall onto my mam and me. one thing we have not figured out for the life of us is how to manage my nanas weight. for the first few years of her condition, we think she ate very many times a day as her groceries would disappear. (now we bring meals with us from home and heat up). so we hope that’s helping. but as her dementia is getting worse, she’s refusing the move from her armchair. she’s peed herself in her bed and her armchair because she refuses to move, and i keep forgetting to remind her to use the bathroom. i beg her to go on walks but we always end up fighting with no winners. when she was well, she was always a lazy goose anyway she never even cleaned her house but now i’m afraid she’ll lose her walk as i’m already carrying her to the bathroom and back to the chair.she’s starting to struggle to breathe, she mentions she can’t breathe in bed. has anyone got experience like this? how can i trick her(?) into moving.",,0
"long story short—my elderly stepmom has dementia, and my even more elderly father is basically the one taking care of her. he was in denial for a long time i think about what was going on, and she’s still in somewhat denial. she has no short term memory, and gets confused basically all of the time but can still mostly perform basically sanitary etc stuff. but the memory and cognition is definitely getting worse. the problem is that she covers her confusion/cognition stuff with anger, and this leads her to screaming at my dad 24/7, and has led to her being violent a number of times. police used to get called to their house several times a week by neighbors. no idea if that’s still happening as my dad has sort of stopped telling me cause i was getting real concerned. i’m not entirely sure what her formal diagnosis is. i know a dr. told her she has dementia, but other than that i’m just not sure. she spends many days just weeping and repeating things in between getting angry at my father. i’m really concerned. i live across the country from them and want to see if it makes sense to help him get some kind of medical advocate? i have tried really hard to help but i think they need someone there during medical appointments etc and to make sure they seek out the right doctors. thank you so much for any help",,0
"hi everyone,my mom is showing early signs of dementia (alzheimer's runs in her family); she's still self-sufficient so long as she can stick to her routine, and she can rattle off a story from 30+ years ago in detail, but complicated tasks are becoming difficult for her.i'm sad about losing much of our family history with her. she's the eldest, and the only surviving family member from her branch of the family.i'm trying to think of ways to record that history, but i don't want to stress her out. my initial thought had been to ask her to journal (i've seen ads for journals with prompts to help people write about their own/family history), but i'm not sure if this will eventually become a stress point for her.i'm also not sure how cool she'd be with voice recording.have any of you done anything to preserve a family member's memories? thanks. :)",,0
"i am my mother's sole caregiver, and for the last few weeks, she won't freaking sleep for more than 2 hours at a time. she gets up two or three  times a night, because she's too hot, and then too cold, or because she thinks it's time to get up. invariably, this leads, some time between 3 and 5 o'clock in the morning, to an hour or so of screaming and door slamming, followed by sobbing and wandering up and down the hallway muttering about wanting to leave, and wishing she were dead. some days, i wish she were, as well. and then i feel horrible, because she's my mom, and i love her, and i don't *really* want her dead.  i'm just so f'ing exhausted.and i  can't even sneak off to have a nap during the day, because she panics if i leave the room for more than 10 minutes, and accuses me of abandoning her. my sleep schedule has been reduced to fitful naps, passed out on a recliner in front of the television. worse, i never have any time to myself. as an extreme introvert, that's probably the thing that wears me down the most.i realize you all probably don't have any answers for me. i just needed to get all of this off my chest. thanks for listening.",,0
"this is about my grandmother. so let me just say this - getting her to a doctor has been difficult. she’s always been a bit of a controlling and bitter person. but in the last few years she’s become increasingly mean, angry, and manipulative. she also has exhibited serious memory issues in the past 6 months or a year that leads us to think it’s dementia. i am just asking for your experience with dementia and aggression. did they become more manipulative than before? more angry? literally make shit up that didn’t happen and lash out at you? her anger seems “well put together” in a sense, as she’s obviously thought out her anger &amp; the situations she’s angry about. i would’ve thought someone with dementia might just be reactive or angry and not know why. but she definitely knows why. did dementia increase the negative traits of your loved one/patient? her anger and aggression is really getting out of hand but she has not been physically violent (yet?)",,0

"***tl;dr: my mother is in the later stages of nfppa and if you know of little-known 'tricks' on how to communicate, i need to hear them... please.***hi, i really hope you can help me because i'm starting to become desperate. my mother was diagnosed with cognitive issues back in 2016, alzheimer's in 2018, and following a lot of efforts we were able to narrow it down to '**fronto temporal dementia**' and '**non fluent primary progressive aphasi**a'. last mmse score was 13.she and i (she has no other family or friend) have been soldiering on and fought this disease tooth and nail since the very beginning. she's in the right place (dedicated assisted living), with the right staff (including a private caregiver) and **takes all the right meds**. i try my best to construct a social life for her.the aphasia was tough to deal with psychologically from the beginning. eventually she became almost mute but we could still 'communicate' in the sense that she could understand me. as you know, that disease eventually robs you from the **ability to comprehend both written and spoken language** and now she's turning not only mute but also looks confused despite my best efforts at non-verbal communication.i know you probably already know this but for the sake of completeness i tried various other ways to communicate including both tools and technology where you can click icons on a tablet, exchange printed symbols on cards etc. over time though, the icons have lost their meaning and the tools are more of a hassle than fun, **so we had to stop that**.which leads me to today: for the first time in caring for her over 4 years i felt she had lost the ability to even express something was wrong - and while in the past we both were able to 'shrug it off' and find alternative ways to help, this time, i wasn't able to resolve her issue, whatever it might have been. it broke my heart. if you know of absolutely anything that might help continue 'communicating', no matter how basic, please do share, no matter how far fetched it might sound. thank you.",,0

(they say shes fine because she says she is, but if you're there often enough you know shes not)eventually we left because it just kept getting worse, with harrassment, she would steal our stuff, accuse me of things, giving out personal information onto the internet and to ads/people who call; including my personal email and phone number and our address with personal information on who is there and when.  when my bf's mom got frustrated and yelled at me for bringing up the issues and demanding a 2nd family meeting (the second one all year) she said ""it doesnt matter what you think, grandma gets to win. she wins"" as if i dont want her to win, i want us all to win, including my son and me who both deserve help, peace and a schedule. as if i'm not begging them to actually take care of her and not just ignore her 24/7 to go out, dance, drink and party, leaving me and my son to be the only people exposed and available to her. so we left. and slowly my bfs mental health is getting worse. and whenever i visit, his grandmother screams at me, harasses me and says some vile stuff, and i just... have to take it? i asked my bf to please give me some pleasant words or compliments after she tore apart my character when i walked in the door for the first time in a week. she told me how terrible i was, how i should be ashamed and god hated me for what i've done to her??? and he just.. said he couldn't say anything nice to me? that his brain ""wasnt working"" and he was ""tired"".but i was in tears, and am now. i've always been the kind of person to try and help and raise up others when they suffer, and i've always tried to do so for him, but when it comes to her, he always leaves me high and dry. i dont know what to do or think. i just feel like we have to end our relationship. i just feel so lost and i wish i had help and support.",,0
"recently, my family and i put my dad in memory care. he'd gotten violent (lots of paranoid delusions) and, after he tried to push my mom down the stairs and strangle me, we decided this was more than we could handle.my mom is in a bad headspace, in part because she feels enormously guilty for placing him in a home. i don't. mind you, i don't like it, and i feel sad that we had to put him there, but i also believe it was necessary. he's a danger to himself and others at this point, we're not equipped to handle it, memory care is, and frankly, it is reasonable for the rest of us to want to be safe in our own homes. if i could travel back in time to when my dad was in his right mind and ask him what he'd want us to do, i'm sure he'd tell us to do what we had to in order to keep him from hurting anyone.so, no, i feel sad but not guilty, and when my mom asked me, i admitted it. she called me cold-blooded. i'm not sure whether she's right or she's just lashing out.has anyone else felt this way? i see a lot of caregivers expressing guilt, but very few saying, ""you know, actually, i think we got him the care he needed, and it sucks that that couldn't be us, but i feel ok about my decision.""",,0
"my elderly relative has had life long bowel issues, either too much or nothing. there is really no medical diagnosis and they are healthy overall, it's just the way it is. at 83 years old they they are starting to have more accidents, not making it to the bathroom after a meal, going after every meal, not getting up out of bed in the morning to use the toliet. and now they need a rest after using the toilet. thanks to this thread, i have all the diapers, piddle pads, urinals and tool to make accidents and clean up easy to deal with. i am wondering anyone relate? i have nothing to compare this too and it would help to hear your experiences. is this typical of a senior?",,0
"this is in the uk if that makes a difference.a bit of background, dementia runs in our family. our uncle (my dad's brother) who is 5 years younger than our dad is currently in a nursing home suffering from early onset dementia. one of our dad biggest fears is going the same route as his brother. this, the loneliness of the pandemic and possibly the death of our mother by cancer who he looked after in her final days a few years ago have all taken quite a large toll on him. he is active, social, fiercely independent, and seems in  good health for his age, but he does seem to be drinking more, being more forgetful and confused and has bursts of seemingly unjustified anger.my sister and i are a bit worried about him and want to make sure we as a family do the best by him. due to how's he's been over the last few months, my sister (who has poa) asked to speak to his doctor to ask advice to whether these symptoms could be the start of dementia or something like depression. she didn't ask any personal details on dad's health and was just seeking advice on what we should be looking out for and if there is anything we can do as a family to support him.after her initial talk with his doctor, the doctor said he would need to tell dad next time he's sees him that he had spoken to her and what her concerns are. his reasoning is that because dad is independent and of sound mind it is his duty to let him know. now i understand if he had to disclose any information about my dads health directly, but all my sister wanted was some advice. the doctor did not previously let her know that by talking to him he would have to tell our dad what they spoke about and she assumed it was a confidential discussion. should the doctor have let her know the procedure before he spoke to her?our main worry is that this will deeply affect our dads mental health knowing that we were worried and have sought advice. he has made comments in the past that lead us to believe that if he did get dementia that he would take matters into his own hands rather than go into a nursing home and go the same route as his brother.we love our dad so much and only want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to keep him as independent and as happy as possible for as long as possible. is there a way to ask the doctor to not disclose the conversation? he has said he wouldn't talk to him until my sister has had a chance to tell my dad herself but this still feels like it would do more damage to my dad the good.sorry for the long post, but just wanted to make sure all the details we there.",,0
"hi everyone, i guess i just want some outsider confirmation that i’m not overreacting in anyway. family history is complicated, but essentially my (20s) dad (50s)and nan (90s) raised me. dad died suddenly from the virus last year, it was a huge shock. my nan was in hospital at the time as she had an accident and bleed on the brain. due to the situation in the world we didn’t get to see her during our grieving time and her other son decided it would be best not to tell her about our dad (her youngest son) as she did not come out the accident the same and was completely confused, didn’t recognise anyone and was then diagnosed with dementia. me and my sisters really wanted to tell her but the advice from the nurses was to not also. obviously within one week i essentially lost half my family, and my depression has been bad. i’m doing a phd and have been trying my best to finish it with only my sisters as support. last week i visited my nan as we’ve been able to recently with lifted restrictions. this was the first time she mentioned my dad in over a year. she doesn’t know who i am but desperately begged me to promise to find her son and it’s now clear she does understand that he’s no longer here but still doesn’t know why. it was heartbreaking, and all i could do was promise that i would try to find him, that i know he loves her and that was it. it broke me. i’ve been hanging on all this time since my dads death but something snapped and my depression just went wild, it was truly my worst nightmare and something i’ve been dreading the whole year. i feel suicidal, hopeless, and just desperately miss those two most important people in my life. i’ve asked for a time off from uni and while my supervisors are understanding somehow i feel guilty as i know dementia is something a lot of people deal with especially with grandparents and i feel like i should be able to cope. i think this was just the straw that broke the camels back, and i’m not sure why i’m posting here, i guess i hope that someone will be able to understand and tell me it’s ok xx",,0
"my grandma on my dads side is my last living grandparent from that side and her health is badly deteriorating. several (maybe 6) years ago she was happy and fully there and knew everything a normal person would. she could walk and go up stairs. she had no signs of dementia and went to costco and bought all kinds of random stuff. now she’s suffering, especially in the past year. she stopped talking mostly and now just shouts random words.. not even words. just sounds. she puts her hand over her mouth and yells as loud as possible, spits at people, yells curse words she never knew before at caregivers (english is not her first language). she doesn’t even understand english anymore. she can’t form sentences. she starts to say “i want.” but is unable to finish her sentence and gets frustrated. she used to be so happy and she could talk perfectly in english. now she can’t have a conversation with anyone, and can’t express what she wants anymore. it’s sad and it makes me sad. she’s always yelling and there is no way to stop it. there is always someone staying with her at all times, whether it is a caregiver or one of my aunts (who are staying with her now). we can’t take her places because she screams and grabs and rips people’s hair and clothes. she has fallen several times over the past 10 years , has type 2 diabetes, pacemaker , and most recently she fell getting out of bed on her knees for several hours and my dad was sleeping and unable to hear her screams (he felt horrible). before we had caregivers she fell a couple times and was on the ground for hours and it makes me mad that nobody checked on her. we don’t even know what kind of dementia she has since she is so out of it and it is unlikely that they’ll be able to determine the type and severity anymore. just one year ago she remembered some things. i read to her and she could at least understand me. now she has no idea what my name is until i remind her. i think she remembers who i am just not my name.  she is 79 i think and overweight my grandpa on my moms side has lewy body dementia. he is rapidly deteriorating also. he’s had the condition for a few years now maybe 6 or 7 years but only now is it getting worse. he still remembers some such as a good amount from his youth and can still talk to people, but has random moments of delirium (is this the right word)? he yelled at my cousin to get out of his house as if he didn’t know who she is. he gets anxious often and cannot be without my grandma on that side. he is also hard of hearing which means repeating things a lot. he has tremors and has fallen before and will probably need a walker now. all of this hurts me so much. i wish i had spent more time with them while they were still cognizant. i’m going to see my grandpa tomorrow, he lives 2 hours away. i hope i can make memories with him even if he doesn’t remember them. whenever i see people’s family members without dementia who function just fine at 90 years old i get so envious and i wonder why my grandparents and family has to go through this. it fucking sucks and i won’t be able to bear it when they forget me completely or are fully out of it.",,0

"brand new to this sub so please forgive me if i make any mistakes. also on mobile so please forgive formatting.i feel like i should start by saying that my mom and i have lost several different family members (some dead, some just gone) to several different types of dementia and have both been caregivers in some form or fashion. not that we are experts by any means but we know enough to know when to worry.my mom’s friend d (74f) has no children, no partner and no extended family. she has a neighbor that helps with her yard work and taking her trash to the curb and stuff like that, a financial advisor who helps looks after her assets, and my mom. over the past 10 or so years my mom has gradually gone from weekly phone calls and occasionally meeting for lunch to driving d to all of her appointments (doctor, hair salon, etc.) and having to fix all of d’s “technology issues” which started with a crypto-locker, then there was an “amazon” scam, then a handful of facebook scams... basically d clicking on links that she shouldn’t have and my mom dealing with the fallout for her. in the past year these incidents have increased in both frequency and severity, even though we’ve both told her multiple times how to identify and avoid harmful emails/texts/phone calls. at this point my mom has most if not all of d’s logins and password info even going so far as when d updates a password she calls mom to tell her.mom and i recently (in the last month) discussed mutual concern for d’s potentially declining mental state. we both think that she is showing signs of some form of dementia, and hindsight being 20/20, has been for some time.today d called my mom saying she was having trouble resetting her username for her main bank account. d claims she tried to reset it online but was told she had to go to a branch. when she went to the branch they told her she had to do it online. so now d is all worked up and flustered and frustrated and freaking out because she needs to get online to pay her bills. mom agrees to meet d at a different branch office (d refused to go back to the one she had already been to) and thankfully they got a rep who was both patient and compassionate. long story short, d forgot her username and new (about 2 months ago) password, rep provided correct username and mom had the new password. they get it all sorted. mom &amp; d go to leave and d is still noticeably agitated so mom is concerned about her driving. mom offers to drive d home and arrange to get d’s car there too. d gets confrontational, mom backs down. d gets in her car but can’t remember how to get out of the parking lot. she calls mom (who is also still in the parking lot) and mom again tries to talk d out of driving. d’s having none of that so mom leads her back to the main road (literally 2 turns) and lets her go. d made it home safely.so this brings me to the two main reasons for this post. 1) i’m not sure if i’m projecting due to my previous experiences but it really seems like she has early signs of dementia and has started escalating rapidly in the last year, and 2) we have literally zero authority in any way, shape or form but there’s also (as far as we know) no one else who does. how do we help d?(i have more examples of signs but this post is already super long and i figured today’s events were most relevant)",,0
"i’ve been having symptoms and actively complaining about them for years, but since the doctors never had an answer for my issues (for example, not being able to reliably swallow, urine and bowl issues, etc). since there was no conclusion reached i’ve just taken to using the less than desirable choices in the past to explain my situation now. anyways fast forward to last week and my wife texts me “i think you might have ms”, and this was based off of something she saw on the tv while at her parents house visiting when she reached out to me. when i googled the symptoms of ms it...was rough. the list isn’t something i can ‘relate’ to, it reads like a god damn laundry list of complaints have made over the years, as in it was a great descriptor of what i’ve been experiencing. yesterday i had an apt with my doctor related to a regular checkup. i brought up “hey doc, i know it’s silly but i think i may have some kind of neurological issue such as ms, anything we can do to explore?” to which he replied “dude you don’t have ms..” before he started going through my history in his computer and then referred me to a neurologist. ok so here’s where i would appreciate any advice if possible. i called to schedule my apt with the neurologist yesterday, and the doc i was referred to isn’t even taking new patients however they were still able to schedule me with an in network neurologist who is taking patients but doesn’t have anything open until june 20th, which i booked. i.... i don’t know how i’m going to make it that long, the anxiety is overbearing. any tips on how to get an apt bumped up? i’m going in tomorrow in person to ask them to place me on a list in case someone cancels, but ive also thought of.. goimg to the er and having them mri me. nothing sounds reasonable to me, including my er suggestion, but thats why im here. im 31, have been married for 10 years. have two children, a 7 year old son and another son born march 9th this year. im falling apart.",,0
"with one anti-amyloid clinical trial failing after another, researchers are beginning to cast around for another explanation for the disease.  one of the more popular theories at present is that inflammation plays a major role in alzheimer's disease.this is a positive change because instead of seeing one cause of alzheimer's disease (misfolded amyloid proteins, for instance) it posits that there are multiple causes of alzheimer's disease leading to one outcome (in this case inflammation).  however this relatively new theory also comes with its own limitations.activated microglia (immune cells in the brain) produce hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite which contribute to the death of neurons.  however, they are not the only source of oxidants in alzheimer's disease.  furthermore, peroxynitrite itself contributes to inflammation which helps explain why most non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs have not helped people with alzheimer's disease.  amyloid plaques by entombing copper and zinc help prevent the formation of hydrogen peroxide as alzheimer's advances, but the production of peroxynitrite (in part through activated microglia) continues.  nitration and oxidation inhibit the release and synthesis of neurotransmitters needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recogntion, and alertness.  via mitochondrial damage, dna damage, and the depletion of energy, peroxynitrite sets forth a chain of events that leads to the death of neurons.  to treat the disease, one needs to inhibit the formation of peroxynitrite, scavenge peroxynitrite, and reverse part of their damage.  compounds that do that such as cannabidiol, thc, and terpenes in marijuana essential oils, eugenol in clove and bay laurel essential oils via aromatherapy, and ferulic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid, maltol, and ginsenonsides in panax ginseng have shown great promise in the treatment of alzheimer's disease.inhibiting inflammation is part of the answer, but not the whole answer.  at least, the post-amyloid appears to be arriving albeit a quarter century too late.",,0

"if you have a bed bound family member you are caring for you'll need a few things. over the years i came up, through trial and error, with some products that just flat work better. also a few just practical tips. this will be for everyday items, not for beds, mattresses etc.you'll need gloves. my preference is the curad 3g vinyl. they come in various sizes in boxes of 100. some people have a personal preference for nitrile gloves. those are fine too. but with either you'll use a lot of them. guaranteed - you will pull one or three out of the box. never the two you need. 😁disposable washcloths. think really large wet wipes. invaluable for many uses. you can't do better than members mark (yes, sam's club!) premium washcloths. they're just better. they come in a box of 480, which is 5 packets of 48. that'll last you a while. the sam's club stores have them but they're not very good at all on keeping them in stock. i just use amazon.medline z-guard paste. now, this product is a little expensive because you use a lot. but by far the very best product for healing skin problems like chafing. also very good for preventing them. it comes in an orange tube. there's usually a 2 tube option, do that.underpads : there's 2 sizes. 23x36 and 30x36 inches. i use for different things.some people buy bibs for eating. they're washable but after a short period they get so stained they're just not useable anymore cuz they look so nasty no matter how much you was them. i use the smaller underpads as bibs. the armageddon for my wife was hot dogs. i'd cut them up but mustard would go everywhere! the pads help because you can cover the shoulders. but at any rate if you make a big mess you just toss them. i also found a lot of other uses for them. i use mckesson underpads lite uplt2336. they're very absorbant.and the big underpads. i will tell you, after i switched to the mckesson underpads ultra uphv3036 we never had another leak thru to the sheets. they are very absorbant.pro-tip. take two of these and lay them widthwise overlapping in the center of the bed. then take a third one and lay on top of those lengthwise. it seems you're using 3 but you'll rarely have to replace more than 1. maybe 2.diapers, or as they're known in polite society, briefs. definition time - in the industry what we think of as diapers are called briefs. what we would think of as pull-ups are called underwear. it doesn't have to make sense...the prevail per-fit 360 are far more absorbant than any other i ever found. easy to use too. buy a bigger size than you think you'll need.",,0

"it's been a hard week, but i keep coming back to one thought, ""if only she knew she was sick, if only i knew what she really wanted beneath the delusion and hallucination and illness!"" but specifically, not just ""your mom wouldn't want you to suffer, she'd want the best for you,"" which while true is useless and subjective and impossible to wrap your head around in these circumstances. i am dealing with a woman who hardheartedly believes she is fine, that the world is falling apart around her, that there are creatures in the woods plotting to get her, that my father is part of a conspiracy to have her killed, and on any given day asks if people she sees, that i know don't exist, have called me about her.this led me to thinking about how i had heard of alzheimer's but never really knew what dementia was, especially lb dementia, nor how scarily common it is. people should know.i haven't really talked about this stuff on my social media platforms, (anywhere non-anonymous), and i've been feeling almost ready to start posting a bit. some small personal stories interspersed with facts. giving people a heads up this stuff exists, and that the earlier you catch it the better etc. hoping it will help someone be less blindsided than me should they come up against this wretched disease.however, what i think would be the most helpful thing ever, that i am wondering if any of y'all on here have come across (finally the point), **is some sort of form, or questionnaire**, that people can fill out about their wishes for specific dementia related issues. i don't think it necessarily has to be legally binding, it'd be more to leave behind for loved one's and caretakers. something to fill out when you're still healthy, before diagnosis. i am looking for something that both educates people about what happens with this disease, and alleviates some of the pain for loved ones and caretakers trying to make important decisions without sane input. eg questions would be:&gt;1) if you were to become incontinent, when would you wish for your family to start thinking about an outside care facility: a) as soon as occasional 'accidents' begin b) when they become a weekly occurrence c) when they become a daily occurrence requiring a diaper d) never, they she keep me at home anyway or e) other \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ if you know of something like this, please let me know. or just your thoughts on it, even if you think it's a terrible idea. i'll fully admit to my thoughts not being the clearest this past year and i may not be considering implications i'm unaware of. or maybe just list off some questions you'd want on this questionnaire and we can build one if it doesn't already exist. what do you wish you knew about your ill loved one's wishes that they are no longer capable of communicating to you?thanks",,0

"there have been so many gift threads here and i've gone through as many as i can, but not found anything appropriate. i was hoping someone here would have some bright ideas!my dad (who lives with my mum) has advanced dementia but is cantankerous, grumpy, and has no interests. before he got dementia, his hobbies were cooking and drinking, and all the gifts i got him were related to those two things. however i'm trying not to get him alcohol as he already has 2-3 beers a day (he's an alcoholic so drinking less than that is out of the question for him). music is unfortunately a trigger for his drinking, so my parents try to avoid it as much as possible. he can no longer cook at all but forgets and gets incredibly grumpy when my mum won't let him, so anything cooking-related is likely to wind him up. he spends his days watching the news and sitting on the sofa snoozing, not doing anything, really. they do like to go out sometimes for a walk along the beachfront or to a cafe.i've got him previous gifts of the obvious things - clocks, photobooks, etc. he would be extremely offended by things he perceives as babyish like fidget items. he already has warm, comfy clothes galore. he has no interest in activity books or anything like that (we've tried). i spend as much with him as i can already.i'm honestly at my wits end with knowing what to get him. does anyone have any suggestions?",,0

as the title reads my mother in a nursing home is in late stage vascular dementia.she’s bedridden incontinent refuses to eat but drinks plenty fluid. but refuses protein drinks cos she’s deemed them ‘medicine’. refuses all oral meds but is on morphine patches.she’s got a ulcer on her buttocks and it now has puss and a smell is noticeable so sounds like an infection. palliative team will attend nexti know without a doubt this isn’t due to bad care the home is incredible i’ve seen how they work and they’re not understaffed have t had covid outbreak they manage it well.they thought she’d pass at christmas but she made it through no co morbidities either.has anyone had experience with their loved one having an infected bed sore?,,0
"my father (69m) was paralyzed last year due to a cortisone shot gone very wrong. he has been tested mentally for alzheimer's. the doctor said he doesn't have it but he can not confirm or deny dementia. i moved 400 miles to his town to help care for him every day. my stepmom(sm) and i are trying to regiment his days and certain days are certain events (in wednesdays he reads to my niece and nephew via zoom. sundays football etc) we try to keep a schedule noon get him hoyered into his chair for lunch. etc. today he is lashing out angrily. i come over every day at 9am. i was 5 minutes late and he called my stepmom at work screaming no one is taking care of him. no one has changed his brief in two days. (bull. i did to yesterday morning, checked him before i left at 5pm and sm did it before bed and this am when she got up. he yelled at me his fork was dirty (i used a clean fork to cut up his pancakes and kept it there.) he yelled at me for not moving fast enough. i felt 13 years old again. in my head i know it isn't me he is mad at, but i can't help thinking i did something wrong) there are days he gets mixed up. he comes up with stories that never happened. we will have the same conversation multiple times a day. he takes phone calls from drs etc and doesn't tell anyone. he forgets who he is talking to or sometimes talks to people not there (like his brother who has passed on) i don't know what to do. how to help. speech therapy is only 1x a week and that is currently on hold due to c-diff.ty for letting me vent.",,0
she cant remember she's  hurt and we are trying to follow the doctor's instructions.  she flips out screams and cries and just goes into a meltdown scream and cry fest. my dad caves and lets her do things. i tell her to do what the doctor asks and then she yells at me to the point i explode which i dont want to do. im here visiting till the end of the month and to be honest i dont think i will ever come back until shes in a home. im at wits end and im sure my dads beyond that. im out of ideas . i dont want her to fall but she's adamant that she walks. im almost entertaining the idea of drugging her so she just stays put and is easier to deal with. do you think the doctor would prescribe to make her easier to manage? this is almost nightmare level for me.,,0
"hello, i’m new here. my dad was recently diagnosed with dementia and i’m having a hard time trying to figure out what to do. his wife (my mom) passed away in 2016 and i’m an only child so i’m the only one he has. he’s not logical and is getting very hard to manage. he gets fixated on financial stuff, even when he receives ads in the mail, he thinks it’s somehow connected to his real accounts and that people are trying to “send him money”. he is in a good spot financially (thank goodness) but i’m having an insanely hard time trying to reason with him. he also lives by himself and has let the house completely go. it’s a pigsty. he hoards stuff and it’s becoming unlivable. the plan was for me and my family to move into his house and he move into the house next door because his house is very big for him and we would be close to him. i’ve brought it up a few times and he won’t acknowledge it or answer my question. i need to be closer to him to help keep an eye on things. i try to have patience with him and the situation but some days i feel like i’m going to break down. it doesn’t help that i have a toddler to care for and i’m having baby number two in two days. just feel like i’m in over my head. anyone have tips or have a similar situation?",,0
"this is a throwaway account, as i don’t want info traced back to my family. i’m kind of in the midst of a big hole with this and am desperate to reach out to others who might understand what i’m going through. i’m in therapy, but a constant emotional wreck. as the title says, my (m37) father (66) was recently diagnosed with dementia, what we believe is ftd. his mother had it and his older brother has the same condition, just a few more years advanced. what is hard at the moment is that both my parents are suffering and i don’t know if my mother has the ability to care for my dad - even now in the early stages. essentially, i was shuttered away from both my parents for close to 2 years, due to border closures throughout the pandemic. i still live 700km from them. when i finally got back home, i knew something was wrong straight away. my parents used to be such house proud people, but the house was filthy, like a hoarders home. my dad had emotionally shut down, didn’t talk as much and my mum was trying to dig bugs out from under her skin that weren’t there. i’d zoomed them weekly throughout the pandemic, but they’d only shown me what they wanted me to see. when i first saw them i had no idea what was going on. they’d lost contact with friends, family etc. they’d become shut-ins living this paranoid, delusional life, where in their heads i’d done crazy things to them, like hack their phone from afar to delete photos, or hidden details of non-existent life events from them. turns out my mum was overdosing on antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds, causing her to go into serotonin shock, have hallucinations and not reach rem sleep. it took months to get her in somewhere, but she’s now detoxed and a lot more level, but i still don’t trust her capacity. my mum has never been the most stable person, with some severe trauma in her past- in fact dad used to care for her i many ways. last night she admitted to me she had seen dads behavioural changes come on over the last three years and she had self medicated herself into the state i found her in. she’d been doctor shopping and trying to find a way to escape it all. last night she made panicked messages to my brother and i, threatened to leave my dad, as his behavioural changes made it too much to bear. i ended up on the phone to get to calm her down from a state of hysteria and beg her to get some support herself. she’s only been out of hospital a week and already i’ve had to mediate fights over dad not driving the car on my breaks at work and then this panicked call last night. i haven’t seen it personally, but apparently dads behaviour has changed in private to her and he can get quite aggressive and angry - something he would never have done in the past. i don’t think my dad ever raised his voice before- not even when i was a shitty teenager acting out. i’m just in this constant state of overwhelming grief. grief for dad, grief for my family and grief for my mums pain. it also comes with this intense worry that she is unable to care for him or help him through this. she already almost killed herself once (serotonin shock is eventually fatal if left untreated)- the future terrifies me. it’s at the point i feel like my life is being put on hold whilst i sit paralysed with worry. i had amazing job opportunities overseas i was actively pursuing- but i’ve kind of dropped the ball on everything now. it didn’t even occur to me that i potentially could suffer the same fate as my dad and uncle, but after reading more about ftd, it’s just added to my anxiety about the future. i’m not sure why i’m writing this- i guess i just wanted to share what i’m experiencing with people who might understand. i tell friends and colleagues, but there is a big disconnect around the constant grief i feel. it’s like a feeling of constant loss and i feel angry the pandemic cheated of the last few normal interactions i could’ve had with them both.",,0
my dads behaviour has changed dramatically. he went from being a devoted loving husband and father for the last fifty years to talking to a friend from highschool online and falling in love. he’s always someone who researches everything and is very practical and black white. he’s always said to every action there is a reaction. now this week alone he has said he’s leaving my mom for “j” to saying he would never leave and that he loves my mom back to he’s leaving every few hours! he even has forgotten that he’s leaving my mom and then remembered randomly 5 hours later. it’s even more bizarre that when he told me he was surprised i was upset. he can’t understand what all the fuss is about. i had an appt yesterday and he asked me four times in the span of an hour what time my appointment was at. i’m honestly so scared that he doesn’t have a grip on reality that he might just go for a walk and never come back. has anyone had an experience like this? i’m supposed to see his dr on tuesday,,0
"hi there (long post!)my father (79 y/o) was moved into a specialist dementia ward in an aged care facility in march. he had been struggling for years (i tried again and again to talk to his gp about symptoms, to no avail). my question is two fold: what to say, and ideas for enrichment activities. the only reason he entered care was because he had an incident that landed him in hospital (series of small strokes) and, coupled with the dementia, he couldn't return home. we moved him two states away to be closer to us. he doesn't believe he has dementia or that there is anything wrong with him. he believes he is in care temporarily (but doesn't really understand where he is).some days he is completely catatonic and i rest easy with my decision about placing him in care. other days (most, recently) he is rather lucid and demanding to go home. he has always been an aggressive, successful but emotionally unavailable person. dementia has only amplified these traits. i am running out of things to say. early on i would try to explain that he had a stroke and that he needed care. this just made him irate. lately i lie and say that ""due to covid, and the borders being shut"" he has to stay where he is. this just leads to more questions. i hate the idea that he is spending his final days (months? years?) being miserable about where he is living. i have looked into other care facilities, but they are much of a muchness. this one is clean, the staff are good and it came highly recommended by people in the industry. i simply don't know what to do. do you have any advice?also, dad spends most of his time in his room doing nothing. he can't use a phone or tv, and will decline if we offer these to him. he likes the newspaper so we bring one everytime we visit (we go every second day) but he doesn't seem to engage with it. the activities at the centre are not really to his interest and most of the other residents in his ward are more progressed in the disease than him, so he finds conversations difficult. he refuses photos because he believes he is there temporarily. do you have any ideas for activities for him?thank you for reading so far. i would appreciate any input.",,0
so we are roughly half way through our fith year with my dads dementia. two weeks ago he had kidney failure and now has a catheter. hospice has been initiated. it’s been a really rough ride. it’s bizarre knowing tis light be the last year  the worst part is i’m not sure mom and i will be able to stay in our house because dad and i are coborrowes. i’ve gone from taking this disease day by day to hour by hour. hang in there guys. dementia really is a marathon and not a sprint in some cases. but you are stronger than you think.,,0
"there have been some interesting studies of reversing memory loss via osteocalcin- a hormone produced in the bones.osteocalcin is produced in the body via nutritional intake of **calcium + vitamin k.** *gamma-secretase cleaves amyloid precursor protein (app) to generate amyloid-beta (abeta) peptides, which aggregate in the brain in alzheimer's disease (ad). gamma-secretase also cleaves molecules that regulate osteoblast activity, such as notch and ephrinb2.....*basically, what that means is that amyloid beta plaques develop when there is a deficient supply of osteocalcin and ultimately leads to neuronal death involving an imbalance of intracellular calcium homeostasis via activation of calcium channels, intracellular calcium stores, and subsequent production of free radicals by calcium-sensitive enzymes. thoughts?",,0

"my sister dragged our alcoholic father kicking and screaming into the er four weeks ago in septic shock. as he has healed and made great physical progress, we were stunned to discover he is unable to retain new memories. his short term memory is gone. the doctors are treating him with thiamine supplements, citing the long term effects of alcoholism and whatnot. the memory issues persisted and they dropped the dementia bomb on us last week. dad is 63, he hasn't had a drink since he entered the hospital. i'm the eldest of 3 and we're trying to cope with the new dad. our hearts are broken every time he asks where he is or why he can't come home. still trying to work out his care plan and how we are going to do this, but the guilt of leaving him in this care facility has been overwhelming. it has been such a shock. the look on his face when we go, the sudden change, all of it. how have others coped? was the decline slow, or does it come in sudden and steep drops? i know to be patient with him, it's not his fault he doesn't remember. i think the worst part for all of us is this weird unknown grieving process. dads still here but he's not here... you know? and it happened so suddenly we didn't have time to really notice he was slipping. our mother is in a different care facility at 67 years old, and they've been kicked out of their home due to unsanitary conditions. us kids are trying to pick up the pieces and settle affairs with limited capital and no experience... anyone have words of wisdom for us? we're green to this process and the emotions are raw, on top of the obvious logistical and practical issues. vehicles need to be sold, checks need to be cashed, their mail needs to be forwarded. anyone have a checklist they've found handy for doin damage control? thank you for listening, it helps just writing this out somewhere...",,0
"i'd like some advice about my mother. she is really starting to get to me, and we keep having arguments about what i have or have not talked to her about. she has never been diagnosed with dementia or anything  (but of course she's never went to the doctor about it), but she forgets conversations, and her ability to reason isn't good. she's in her low 60s and has had diabetes for 24 years. her mom had dementia in her later years too. okay, so this happened tonight. i get a text from her asking her why i didn't ask her about camping. background info..we go up north to where my parents have land for a family reunion. my husband and i are planning on camping with my extended family nearby for the first time. previously, we would just go back to my parents. but then that leads to us not spending much time with the family. since we had never done this before, originally i asked my mom if we need reservations or if we need to pay or whatnot. she said she didn't know. so today i posted the question to my family's private group. they answered and said it's free, no reservation...just give a donation. which leads to why my mom texted me. she read what we said on facebook. i responded with ""i did mom. you said you didn't know."" she said ""you did not ask me because  i do know."" i said ""i did too mom. [my so] was with me and said the same thing i did."" and she said ""no you didn't because i would have known. i may be forgetful sometimes but not all the time.  i think that you might think you ask me but you don't."" and i said ""maybe then you don't listen to me.[so]was there too mom."" and she said ""[my so] is always with you. i listen to you because  you don't talk to me very often. ]this makes me want to cry for several reasons. firstly, she requires that we text or talk almost every day. it really hurts my feelings that she thinks i don't tell her anything. what does she want to know?! i can't even think of anything i haven't told her. second, i accept that she is forgetful. she has been for many years. but it bothers me that she says i have a good memory until i tell her that we already had this convo, etc. then suddenly it's ""i don't think you tell me as much as you think you do."" why must it be me that's wrong? even when i was a witness (my husband). finally, this thing makes no sense. if she knew all along, why didn't she tell me in the first place??? some of what she does makes it seem like she's gaslighting me because i keep having to question my sanity. but she seeks bow innocent. anyone have advice or anything that might help? i don't know how to deal with her anymore.",,0
my mother in moderate alzheimer’s often has some late night urinary incontinence. she refuses to wear “adult diapers” and takes poise pads out of her regular underwear. she will sleep with no underwear to avoid using any incontinence products. i bought her “period” underwear that women use instead of tampons or maxi pads and that collect urine in an absorbent layer. they can be washed and reused. she will wear these since they are “real” underwear. i hope this might help other people too. ,,0
"can anyone review my theoretical framework on psychological control and the causal factors behind a family of diseases including alzheimer's disease and other dementias, stroke, depression, and norepinephrine deficiency (aka dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency).these new theories support matsuyama's 1989 theory, that spoke of a relation between microtubule collapse and dementia.my thesis in brief: psychological functions are carried out by neurocircuits containing myriads of dopaminergic and norepic systems; due to excessive electrical signalling in ""dopamine-heavy"" types of brains -- the over-stressed signal conducting micro-tubules break down, which is the neuronal collapse. more the average signalling volume (due to more deployment of the evolutionarily backward dopaminic and lesser of the evolutionarily advanced norepic behavioral circuit elements), more the stress (either mechanical and/or thermal and/or chemical stress), which proves fatal in the end.the link to download my thesis:",,0
"while not receiving much attention, this recent finding may be the key to understanding alzheimer's disease and to its effective treatment.""malinow’s team found that when mice are missing the pkc alpha gene, neurons functioned normally, even when amyloid beta was present. then, when they restored pkc alpha, amyloid beta once again impaired neuronal function. in other words, amyloid beta doesn’t inhibit brain function unless pkc alpha is active.""the pathway activated by pkc alpha leads to the production of peroxynitrite--the key oxidant in alzheimer's disease and caspase-3--the so called death enzyme.  this dovetails well with this much older study:a natural scavenger of peroxynitrites, rosmarinic acid, protects against impairment of memory induced by abeta(25-35).through oxidation and nitration, peroxynitrite inhibits the transport of choline, inactivates the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, and limits the release of acetylcholine from muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.  as a result, short-term memories cannot be retrievednow if amyloid oligomers were the only cause of oxidative stress removing the oligomers or using nearly any antioxidant would work.  but there are dozens of triggers for protein kinase c leading up to alzheimer's disease: they include an unhealthy diet (too much sugar, carbohydrates, and salt, for instance), moderate to heavy smoking, environmental toxins, psychological stress, and various genes.  this in part explain why so many treatments seem to work in mice designed to develop amyloid and not in human beings with the actual disease.  at this point, the only substances which can partially reverse alzheimer's disease are single-compound peroxynitrite scavengers that can easily enter the hippocampus (such as the terpene eugenol via aromatherapy) or substances containing multiple compounds that scavenge peroxynitrites such as ferulic acid, syringic acid, maltol, p-coumaric acid, and vanillin in heat processed ginseng and cannabidiol and terpenes (and thc if needed) in medicinal marijuana.",,0

"my great grandma has dementia. she had a dog that she would forget to take care of. the dog was malnourished and had an untreated anal abscess that ruptured. the poor dog was in an incredible amount of pain and was very sick. she was kept in a cage 24/7, she was not let out to potty regularly and never got any love. my great grandma would just forget to take care of her. i was able to convince my great grandma to give her dog to me. however now she is threatening to call the cops on me for “stealing” her dog and wants the dog back. i have had her for a couple of months now, and have taken her to the vet regularly for treatment. the dog’s anal glad infection was so bad that she had to be on antibiotics and pain meds for over a month. i don’t think she ever had a bath or her nails clipped and had dreads i had to cut out of her fur. she also had ticks. if i didn’t take her she would have died. i spent hundreds of dollars to bring her back to health and i’ve also spent a lot of time working with her extreme anxiety. she has special needs due to begin neglected for so long. …so i’m not really inclined to give my great grandma a dog she is just going to unintentionally neglect. it’s a hard situation because my great grandma does not even recognize her owndaughter sometimes and is at a point where she needs assisted living or a caregiver. she is being incredibly difficult and resists moving. there’s also a lot of family drama behind that ..and her bum son who makes matters worse. all those problems are beyond me. there’s alot going on with her and my family just wants me to give her back the dog because they don’t want to deal with the drama. i need some ideas on how to proceed with this situation. i love my great grandma and i am just trying to do the right thing..",,0
"my dad literally doesn't stand ever unless i'm picking him up for doctor's appointments. he's been peeing in diapers for about 3 months and has been pooping in them for about a month.there has been some odd behaviors such as putting his poop under his pillow on one occasion and numerous times of wiping his butt with his socks but he generally cannot care for himself and sits in his feces for extended periods of time. one time overnight ruining his futon which we came to find doesn't have a removable cover or removable mattress... every single time he poops it gets in his pants somehow which leads me to believe he's sitting in it. numerous times my mom will walk in and find him soaked through his diaper completely with urine. his socks are always 100% filled with pee when she washes them from the pee running down his legs. on top of all this he hasn't bathed or washed himself in 4 months.my mom can't take it anymore. the house smells awful 24/7. it goes through the a/c. she has to bring him his food in bed otherwise he won't eat. he's lost so much weight we just need him to eat. she can't stand entering his room anymore. the urine burns your nose and eyes and the feces makes it even worse. a home care aide has been suggested in the past but i don't think that would help enough.on top of it all. and i'm ashamed to say this. my sister lives in that house with her 1 year old. i can't believe he's growing up in that environment.he's still very much there mentally. his memory loss is very minimal at this point. like he'll go all day without watching tv because he will forget it was fixed yesterday but he gets only maybe 25% of the slam dunk questions wrong when the doctors quiz him. like maybe he will forget the president and think we are in 199something but if you had a conversation with him you'd think he didn't have any issues.i haven't brought up assisted living to him yet. i plan to do it at his doctor appointment in front of a healthcare professional. (yay or nay?) i highly doubt he would fancy the idea but i think that is where we are headed. how does a family ""force"" someone to go when they don't want to? does it sound like he would be able to be ""forced"" based on what i've outlined here?any help would be much appreciated. thank you!",,0
i'm unemployed which is bad enough. but on top of that my parents are old. i'm up most the night and my dad will come downstairs open the living room door and say 'oh your still up are you mate' - he does this most nights - at first i thought he just wanted to talk to me. now i realise maybe he forgets and comes down to turn the light off?i have also be slowly losing my patience with not having any personal space at all. i had a big talk to my dad about it the other day. how whenever he leaves the house he asks if i want to go with him and mum. - every week he asks me to go shopping.  i used to go now and then but it's the only time i get the house to myself. and i've been slowly losing my patience with my dad asking me all the time. i told him this. and yet he still does it. all the ducking time. at first i thought it was because i had a breakup with a girlfriend and was a little bit down and he was trying to get me out the house. but now i realise it's not that at all. and he can't seem to remember that i don't want to go shopping with him and mum all the time.i mean - maybe i should be a good son and do it. but i need to keep my mind healthy as well. and if i don't keep boundaries it never stops with him asking me to do stuff with or for him. we have conversations and i feel like i'm explaining myself over and over. and i'm realising some points in the day he seems like himself and others it's like a ghost sitting next to me. i thought it was old age before and maybe it is but either way it's fucking hard. he was the stongest man i know just 10-15 years back and it's like i have lost him already. i feel like i never got a chance to be fully young. but now i'm realising maybe i did and this sort of thing will happen to most people at some points in their life. it's just a shame i am young and before i got my feet off the ground it is happening. it's fucking heartbreaking honestly because i had more going for me then anyone else i know but my entire life has slowly crumbled around me. home hasn't really felt that way for 10+ years anymore and i'm so lost. people see me as this shell i have become but nobody really knows what i'm going through. i would have moved out at 18-19 i had a great social group and i was pretty much the leader of it but i have had to let it all go and slow down to be patient with my dad at home. i could fuckoff and do my own thing but what kind of son would that make me?but saying that my sex life and social life have comepletely gone as i never brought my friends or girls home because i feel so trapped at home.10 years back i had the life i wanted. the girlfriend and mates i wanted. it's all gone. my ex went on to be a tattooist. mates have all moved on with their lives and i feel utterly powerless and vulnerable.  i'm kicking myself for not taking oppotunities i had but with vulnerable parents what am i to do? do my priorities lie with what i want out of life or being there for those that sacrificed so much for me? it feels a waste not getting the life i want after all they did for me but it feels just as equally selfish and it would be to leave my mum on her own as my dad gets older _ but the thing is my mum is 15 years younger then my dad so if i don't do what's right for me i might be sacrificing myself another 30 or so years until they are both dead and in which case i will then be 56? i don't really know why i am venting here i just feel like the bottom has well and truly fallen out of my life and it's not gonna get any easier,,0

"please. please. i think i have dementia. i'm really young, 16 years old. i know it's unheard of for a person at such a young age to get dementia, but hear me out. what if i break the world record? what if i end up being the record breaker for who got dementia the youngest? that sounds incredinly arrogant, but i'm not. i do not want dementia. i do not... please. please. please.when i was young, i would constantly fall and hit my head. now, you may ask, how is that relevant? because i read that there's this thing called chronic traumatic encephalopathy. it's something people who've suffered head injuries get, and it leads to early dementia.and before you say, so what? that doesn't mean anything. fuck fuck fuck fuck i'm scared. please, help. so i've been unable to concentrate since last year. okay, not unable, but it's hard. and it's hard to think coherently. like one time i could be thinking about something, and the next my mind is blank. or maybe i'm asking myself what the hell i was thinming again. like sometimes, my train of thought goes too deep, and when i go back to the premise my mind's blank. and this is just an example, and i'm scared. my mind is blank most of the time. i have to literally force myself to think. it's hard to hold conversations too, but that might be because of anxiety... anyway. i miss the old days where thoughts came naturally. came fluidly. not artificially. not repeated thoughts in place of fruitful conclusions or inferences or links to other topics. i miss those days. now i struggle. it's an internal fucking battle. it's like trying to break through a wall in my head. you know the feeling? oh, and my memory, as in not thought memory if you know what i'm saying but my memory as in what it's generally regarded as. i can't remember shit. when i for example want to fill my water bottle. i would wash it, put it by the sink, and leave, with my water bottle still by the sink— and unfilled. or whenever i'm asked to remember what a person told me and i struggle to remember it. or when i talk to others and i forgot our subject. ok, as i said, that might just be anxiety, but it just screams something deeper. or when. look i can't even remember. what the fuck?????oh and here's a little something. last year, my absolute dumb fuck of a self thought it a good idea to hit myself in the head multiple times because i had the idea that if i did that, maybe i'd be able to be normal again. yeah, that didn't help. it probably even made my condition worse.don't let my wall of text deceive you. the amout of time i took to create this took at least 30 minutes, or even longer. please tell me what is wrong. please say i am wrong. please. i'm too young. i want to have a life. i want a job. i want meaning. i don't want to be a husk, and i don't mean this to offend anyone. please. i'd rather die than be incapacitated. an invalid. please please help. please. i can't express my desperation clearly and urgently enough through text. i hope you don't think i'm trolling. fuck. please don't. please.",,0
"hi, i'm new to this group. my grandma was diagnosed with vascular dementia about 5 years ago, but in the last 2 years it has really progressed dramatically. in addition, she broke her left hip 1 year ago, had surgery and made a nearly full recovery in terms of walking and mobility, but this past september broke her right hip after another fall. her recovery from this surgery has made everything significantly worse. she is mostly incontinent now. she used to just have accidents like wetting her depends over night, however she consistently has accidents day and night now. bowel incontinence as well. which inevitably leads to frequent uti's, and when she has a uti she almost always ends up having a few tia episodes. her walking is incredibly shakey, even with a walker, and there are days where she can barely take a few steps. she lives with my mom and i, and we're just getting exhausted. it's so draining, emotionally, physically, and mentally. every morning its a hassle to get her out of bed, changed, cleaned before we go to work. pre-covid, she used to attend an adult day center however obviously they have been closed since march with no signs of reopening soon. so we are going through the nj personal preference program to have a caregiver get paid through her insurance program however they only approved about 30 hours a week for her. weekends are really hard on my mom and i. it's taking a massive toll on my mom and she is 61. i worry about her a lot because of thsi. shes not of the greatest health either, having gotten a terrible 2 month bout of pancreatitis last year, and a repeat attack this past october which lead to her diagnosis being chronic. the worst part is, sometimes, i wish my grandma would just be able to pass away peacefully. she's had such a beautiful life surrounded with so much love, happiness, accomplishments, and amazing memories. she's like a shell of herself now. and i know its making my mom resent her at times. i don't know what i'm looking for in writing this, i guess it's had to vent this out to friends when they don't really understand. and i don't know if it is really feasible for us to put her in a facility. in mexican culture, it's like unheard of, to just drop a loved one off somewhere to live out their days. i also would never want her to feel neglected or abandoned, or not be cared for well. but i also don't know that what we are currently doing now is sustainable or healthy for anyone. our shower is upstairs and its getting harder and harder to get her up the stairs, and it's stressful being responsible for her when she's such a fall risk all the time. anyways. any advice or input is appreciated from people experiencing similar situations. thanks :(",,0

"so, i believe my grandfather who is 81 is showing signs of dementia but i’m not sure.he has a extreme vocal impulse issue that is getting worse and worse through the weeks.he’s constantly commenting on basic needs.for example, if i come home with more then 2 bags of groceries he has a meltdown. it’s comment after comment then proceeds to say how the county has no more food. it’s a real fear for him too, he’s so detached he doesn’t realize how much a family of 3 eats he’s constantly “teaching” me how to do things i’ve been doing since 14, i’m 24 now. i believe this makes him feel smarter and better. his memory when it comes to learning technology is just completely out the window. i teach him 2-4 times a week how to send pictures and listen to voicemail. his excuse is “i don’t do it often” witch leads me to think he’s forgetting that he’s asked. anyone notice these things in the early stages ? this is all new, a year or so ago there was zero vocal impulse issues. he kept his comments to himself.",,0

"my elderly family members, with various degree of cognitive issues, have discovered online shopping, and in the past few weeks i have disputed hundreds of dollars in charges and spent hours returning they insisted they did not order but only ""looked at"". most of these orders were through the amazon app so things were pretty straight forward, but some of the other items only show up as debits from their bank accounts with cryptic identifiers from distant lands, and they can never remember where they actually ordered the items from.today i spent the morning trying to track down a charge on my mom's boyfriend's bank statement for which he has an e-mail receipt that only indicates being from some non company in china. he does not recall placing the order, only looking at the item, but does not recall from which website and has mild paranoia. this leads him to the conclusion that he has been hacked and that the hackers have taken elaborate steps to collect his bank information, shipping address (different from home address), cell phone number and new e-mail address. i know this is actually not the case because i recall him talking about having ordered this thing a month ago.unfortunately the item hasn't arrived yet and i have no way of determining if the website was legit because it is not showing up on or around the order date in his browsing history and it has proved difficult to file a claim on the charge because the banks and paypal are short staffed due to the virus.fun times.",,0
"sorry about the length of this post. you can skip to the end where the questions are if you don’t have time. i’m worried about my dad, he was diagnosed with cognitive impairment/dementia by the va and it’s supposedly from agent orange exposure in vietnam. he also happens to be a daily drinker for 40+ years, probably 10-12 beers when he was younger and i think he’s probably averaging 5-7 beers right now. he has a drinking buddy, my uncle they aren’t brothers he’s from moms side of the family, and they have some co-dependent drinking relationship going on it’s beer for beer but my uncle is 200 lbs and my dad is probably only 125, he’s not hungry anymore naturally and has to force himself to eat, my uncle can handle the beer, my dad cannot and it’s obvious to me and outside observers but maybe not either of them. he has some trouble following conversations, forgetting new information, but he seems to do pretty well with old information especially when he hasn’t been drinking. the problem is that once he reaches a certain level of alcohol he can’t remember much, if anything of what was said 5-10mins ago, he repeats himself, if he passes this point he does weird things like flood the kitchen after he turned on the water, wanders around outside and will fall asleep outside, or just wander around. does anybody have experience with this? how much worse could he be making his situation? he refuses to give up drinking right now and addiction runs in the family, so i understand this too well, but he won’t take the antidepressant prescribed to him, he’s sort of giving up in more ways than one. he’s a stubborn man and he broke his collar bone twice because he wouldn’t stop working, he beat prostate cancer easily, but it’s because it’s a mental and not a physical thing that he’s surrendering to it. i’m trying to get him to stay active(he still excercise by riding a bike 30 miles,but covid has closed all the races and he feels like it’s pointless without a race) he gives up on complicated instructions and learning new things( a man that built his own house/garage and farmed 3 acres his entire life while working as a dr.) he only wants the easy way now and when his therapy sessions go towards deep stuff he shuts off. anyways, how bad could the alcohol be for him? could he be having daytime withdrawals? what tools could i try to get him to use to help bring him more clarity, slow the decline and maintained a better sense of self?(he’s displaying too much suggestibility) i’m trying to suggest verbalizing his actions and notepads, what else could i get him thinking about? any supplements could help? thanks!!",,0
"heads up, this is going to be a bit of sleep deprived rant, but it's intention is a cry for help - my grandmother was diagnosed with ftd at 52, lived 10 years, mostly in a zombie like state and finally passed in 2008. this was obviously gut wrenching and also alarming given how young she was. fast forward to 2018 and my mom (at age 60), starts showing some of the same signs my grandmother did - socially inappropriate, angry outbursts, forgetful, going in the shower with articles of clothing still on, lack of empathy, etc. i thought at first she was just getting old and ornery, but it finally clicked. once it did, i couldn't believe i didn't put it together before. she hasn't been to a doctor for any of this or been diagnosed, but it seems fairly obvious what is going on. my mom currently handles everything - the bills, the taxes, the laundry, everything including taking care of her own aging dad.i talked to my step-dad and he also has seen these changes and is scared. he is a tough guy, so once i knew he knew something was wrong and is scared, my world sort of fell apart because now i know it's real. since this reality has sunk in, i'm in a full panic 24/7. i have not slept without waking up every hour in a heart thumping panic in weeks. what keeps me up are these realities and questions -   * my mom doesn't know anything is wrong. we don't want to tell her because we think she will commit suicide, but this poses many problems stated below. i also wonder if not telling her is ethically the right thing to do here. * her driving is fine now, but i want those who are getting in the car with her to know her condition before they decide to ride in it. i don't want her driving my kid, nor any others i care about, but how do we tell her this without letting on what is happening? what happens if she plows into a bunch of kids on the side of the road - that will haunt me as something i could have prevented.* we don't know what paperwork needs doing, but we know she does not have a will and is a homeowner with her husband, my step dad. what paper work should we get her to fill out now while she can and how do we convincer her to without telling her something is wrong? do we need poa's for anything? how does one get poa, fill out a form? where do we get the form and how do we make if official? so many other questions about paperwork.* **will i also get this?**  this sends a cold chill down my spine. the more i've read trying to find something comforting, the more i fall into total hopeless despair. i know i have a 50% chance, and for me and my pessimistic attitude, that means i will or already have it. **i feel suicidal over this**. i have never felt suicidal before until now. i'm 39 and have a wife and a young child and feel like the sooner i do it the better to try and give them as long as time as possible without me so that they can get over my death sooner. i know i can get the dna test, but i'm too much of a coward to get it. i realize this makes no sense if i am suicidal anyways. i also have an older sister who feels the same way. this is all so tragic given my younger sister did commit suicide years ago, and now the remaining of us also want to follow. life is bleak.* i feel like we should give my mom the option of suicide while we still can. i feel like as a family we should give her permission to do so and let her do things on her terms. i don't know how this would go down or the legalities involved but i feel like it should be her right to do so. i live in ca and there is no death with dignity conditions in the law here that allows for suicide of the demented. * how am i going to hold down a job carrying all this? i provide the sole income in our household. i need to help my stepdad with all this and can barely manage my own suicidal thoughts and anxiety. i also have a chronic illness that has me in pain 24/7 on top of it all. * how do i help my stepdad? i don't even know what needs doing or how to help myself. and because we are hiding this, i cant just call him all the time and talk it out - me and my stepdad never called each other before all this so my mom would be suspicious.* i need sleep. i take 600mg of gabapentin a day, lots of cbd oil in the am and in the pm, magnesium, chamomile tea, meditate, go to church, read books before bed, nothing helps and i'm going insane over it. or perhaps this is my own dementia starting?i know this is a lot, but if there is anyone out there that can give me some advice on what to do next, or how to cope, encouragement, anything i would appreciate it greatly. i feel lost and hopeless, without a future, sad for my kid, a useless coward and utterly defeated.",,0

"i'm in dire need of assistance with a situation i'm caught in. i am living with my boyfriend and his father, and the two of us are helping to aid him because not only is he disabled (mostly blind), but he has also been showing rather extreme signs of dementia. the biggest issue right now, aside from him believing that his dreams are real, is a particular delusion he has often where he believes that he isn't home. he often thinks he's been to ten or twelve different homes that look exactly like his, that there are two of me walking around, two of my boyfriend, two of his dog.when he's in these states where he doesnt believe he is in his own home, it is extremely hard to convince him otherwise. my boyfriend talked to him about it for three hours today trying to convince him not to talk walk out of the house. if we try to talk to him about it, show him around the house, show him his things, make humor about it, remind him that his dog is here and wouldn't be anywhere else, he still doesn't believe it. not even a little bit. he'll often argue about it, telling us that we ""must be crazy because this isn't his house."" i have no idea how to go about these episodes. do we play along?? i see a lot of websites and advice forums talking about how you should play along, but that seems like it would only make the situation worse. i mean, if i played along, wouldn't he be more inclined to walk out of the house?i'm just so confused. i have no idea what to say to him or how to bring him down from the situation because it always ends the same way. he's always in distress because this ""isn't his home"" and no amount of proof will convince him otherwise. and it seems like it never stops?? almost like this is the most consistent delusion of them all. please, if anyone has any advice or pointers or anything at all to help, it would be greatly appreciated. i also greatly appreciate having a space to be able to talk about this, so thank you to anyone and everyone who reads this.",,0
"approximately 2 years ago my mother was diagnosed with dementia by her geriatrition. of course the signs were there long before this, the repetition of stories, forgetting of names and tasks. initially these mental blanks were easily dismissed as ""chemo brain"" as mum had battled and beaten breast cancer, but deep down we all knew. mum had witnessed it first hand with her grandmother then with her mother, her father and in more recent years all her 3 siblings (but its not hereditary or genetic).prior to mums diagnosis there was the obligatory mild cognitive disorder (mcd) label, which like bad body odour causes people to steer clear. many of mums so called ""friends"" became more absent on those celebratory occassions to which they were invited and more forgetful in terms of inviting my mother to gatherings to which they were hosting. at first i was angry at them for excluding my mother, fortunately mum wasn't angry, mum wasn't aware. i set aside my anger at these fairweather friends, when our paths crossed  i looked into their eyes and saw fear and envy, fear of themselves falling into the clutches of dementia and the envy of wondering if their children would be there to support them through this journey. over time most of mum's acquaintances no longer maintained eye contact when we crossed paths, they quickly look away, anywhere else but to their destiny as if mum was their mirrored reflection. my father was supportive until he was hospitalized due to an unrelated condition and developed the uti dementia or delerium. over time dad recovered and returned home and the delirium subsided although he would be diagnosed firstly mcd then six months later dementia.when my mother received her dementia diagnosis we held a family meeting where my brother and i promised we would keep mum at home as long as we could, provided she was safe, mum took some comfort in that committment and life continued. there were subtle changes like accompanied visits to medical appointments, shopping in pairs instead of alone and assistance with stairs and uneven ground. we began to notice my mother withdraw from conversations and struggle with fine motor skills tasks. her frustrations grew as her hands and body wouldnt do what her brain wanted.my father struggled with the evolving nature of their 50+ year relationship, moving from husband to carer and the ultimately to the target of her frustrations and anger. my mother struggled with intimacy after revealing a childhood assault she had kept to herself over the years. my father also struggled knowing that his fate would be not to dissimilar from that of my mother. the fact he held a front row ticket seat simply amplified the cruelty.six months ago mum was assessed level 4 requiring a secure position in a residential dementia program, we stepped up the supervision and mum literally did nothing alone. we began key locking the security doors when mum began waking early (2am) and dressing for shopping trips. the decision was made 4 weeks ago when dad inadvertently looked away and mum prepared and attempted to eat boiling noodles resulting in quite bad burns to her chest.it was now time and in the intervening time we have toured and researched several facilities involving mum and dad in the process. final acceptance for a position was received thursday for an admission this friday 27th december. after several years of holding christmases with my parents  due to the inevitable, the inevitable has arrived.all being ok with my parents physical health this wont be the last christmas we share, but given recent events in respect to memories i suspect they will never be the same as the christmases we have shared.i take some comfort in the fact that my mother is becoming more oblivious to some of  the changes in her life, but i worry for my father whom we expect to struggle much more than my mother with his dementia, although dads most recent geriatrition appointment ended with dad proclaiming he was cured of dementia as the dr had proclaimed ""there was nothing else he could do for my father. ""as we enter this christmas my immediate family is struggling to come to terms with events, i have attempted to always be honest and upfront with my teenage children about the nature and progression of this disease. i remind them that the behaviours of my parents are symptomatic of the disease not the person. an acquaintance advised me of the perils of this particular journey to which i was initially indifferent. this disease has tested my resolve and the strength of the relationship with my loved ones, a test i believe i have passed and with my brother have honoured our committment to our mother. i will sleep better knowing she is safe and her needs are being met, but i know that in a short time she will lose her memory of herself and those she loves and that will be shattering for my father and my siblings.as i look back over the last 2 and half years and the effort involved i take a deep breath as i realise that its now going to be dad's turn and i suspect this ride is going to be a lot rougher..",,0
"does anyone have any good strategies for helping someone with alzheimer’s who needs help and but is incapable of accepting help? for a time, mom was cooperative. now however she demands to do it herself. the problem is that hygiene and other things are suffering. inadequate tooth brushing led to cavities and really bad gums. getting dressed is not successful, leading to backwards or inside out clothing, missing underwear, etc. just trying to kindly start her off, by prepping toothbrush is a problem. starting her off with shirts, shorts, etc. in the right directions and allowing her to go the rest of the way devolves into angry interaction that sometimes leads to her throwing punches and shoving. i don’t want her mouth to totally fall into ruin or to end up wearing shorts around her shoulders (has happened), but it is hard to help when she becomes violent. is there a way to help, or do you just have to let them fall into disrepair? i don’t want to be perceived as negligent, but i also don’t want to experience her throwing her arms wildly in punches every other day.",,0
"this has been going on for a few months now. my mom (turning 65 this year) told me that she's been having concerns about her memory recently, and even set up an appointment with a neurologist to address this. i haven't heard anything about the appointment and her demeanor hasn't changed, so i don't think anything came of it. another doctor suspected her concerns could be due to a b-12 deficiency, and after taking b-12 injections for a while, i thought the issue could be resolved. but then two weeks ago or so she re-expressed these concerns while watching a special about dementia on tv, and my feelings have come back full force. she tells me that she's bothered by how she sometimes can't retrieve the names of things, including people. i asked if it's just normal ""tip of my tongue"" type stuff, and she says it doesn't feel that way. i've noticed that she's been more easily agitated/irritated these last few years as well. multiple times a day, i'll be going about my day and then something, anything, will remind me of dementia and all these depressing thoughts and feelings will just wash over me. i'm only 21, so i feel way too young to be dealing with any of this. i'm hyper-aware of everything my mom says and does, and i know this isn't healthy. any tiny behavior that could indicate some sort of memory or cognitive slip-up gets flagged, despite the fact that myself and other people in my family have similar slip-ups on a regular basis and i don't think they bothered me when coming from my mom in the past. i feel like they might be more frequent now, but i have no way of knowing for sure since i acknowledge that my fear could be distorting the picture significantly. pros for my mom: she's highly educated (phd), works in a demanding and intellectually stimulating (but stressful...) position, she eats plenty of fruits and vegetables and has an overall healthy diet, she enjoys puzzles like sudoku and reads a lot for fun. her side of the family doesn't seem to have a history of alzheimer's or dementia. her father was very sharp when he died and her mom was a little ""eccentric"", but nothing too disabling (she died in her 80's). cons: she has a lot of abdominal fat (type 2 diabetes, ""apple"" body shape), some high inflammation markers that haven't been reigned in, although she claims they don't cause symptoms (autoimmune issues run in my family), her job keeps her fairly sedentary, and she deals with a lot of stress.  i bought the book ""the end of alzheimer's"" by doctor bredesen and have been urging her to read it. she already takes some supplements but i've been working on a list of others i'd like her to take. the only way that i can feel somewhat hopeful and upbeat is by telling myself that even if she's in the very early stages of cognitive decline, all of this could be halted or even reversed. my paternal grandma has dementia and lives nearby, and watching her decline has been so traumatic for everyone. clearly this is where the majority of my fear comes from. her body is fairly resilient, but her mind is gone. i've seen how ugly dementia can be, and her case isn't even as severe as it can get. if either of my parents had to experience that, i don't know how i'd survive it. i already struggle with depression, and this would be the final nail in the coffin. i don't want to just let go and live in the moment. fuck that. i want to feel like there's *something* i can do to prevent my parents from dying in one of the most horrible ways imaginable.",,0
"hi everyone,my dad has early-onset ad in the early stages, where he still knows us and knows that he has ad, but he's not able to remember anything recent. memories are no longer stored properly and he is beginning to experience some trouble communicating.since he had to quit his job, due to his memory issues, he has been bored senseless at home. he doesn't really have any hobbies or things that he especially liked to do outside of work, except gardening and reading the newspaper or going for bike rides perhaps. he's not into computers or ipads (though he has an untouched ipad air 2) and at this point, it's too late for him to learn how to use them. i feel bad for him that he doesn't know what to do and just sits at home waiting for my mom to come home from work. does anybody know what a person in such a situation could do?",,0
"hello! i wasn't sure if this reddit was the  appropriate place to find others thoughts on the situation, but i  figured it was a start.a few things to start:i cannot convince her to go to a neurologist or talk to her doctor about this.my mother is 66she also had a recent bout with cancer and is now cancer free.my father is across the country and they do not have a talking relationship(divorced for 20 years)i live with my mother, because i had to assist her with the house and other things while she had her cancer.my grandmother had alzheimers.i do not believe she has had neurological exam in probably 20+ years....so, as i said my mother is 66 this year.over  the past 6 years, i've noticed an extreme change in her personality  from a easy going, loving mother to a demanding, disrespectful and  possibly dishonest person.its not as if it was a sudden thing, its something i noticed more and more as the years go on.i've  sat her down and talked to her about the disrespect shes shown me, and i  asked her to be more respectful and she had apologized and said she  would try better, so long as i respected her. but either she has  forgotten our conversation or simply does not care. her attitude to  others but to mostly myself and my fiance has taken a completely  different turn, even though we have done nothing but care for her, and  have done as she has asked of us the past few years.as  for her forgetting things.. obviously forgetting things is something  that just comes with age, but subtle things like her putting away,  clearly very dirty dishes into the cabinets, frequently leaving the gas  stove burner on and walking away, leaving and forgetting food in the  oven that is on, and on a few occasions forgetting some short  conversations.i remember i asked her to  leave the lights on outside for us, as we had gone out for the evening  and she didn't. but when i asked her about why she turned them off, she  seemed to think we hadn't been home all day, and never talked to  her.(this has happened on 2-3 occasions as i remember)..my mother is not proficient with tech, but i have shown her how to upload an attachment to an email many many times.but  she cannot seem to remember me showing her, or cannot remember a single  step of how i did it even though i've walked her slowly through it many  times(she was somewhat good with tech in her past, not great but could  figure out how to do this sort of thing..)she  constantly argues with me, it doesn't matter if i'm right or wrong, or  if shes right or wrong, everything is an argument, and she constantly  raises her voice and yells even if i am just making a suggestion or  offering a solution. this is completely unlike what she used to be.she  also used to be a very clean person, always wanting to keep a clean  house and kitchen.  but lately, within the last year she has just  started leaving her dishes on the counters and leaves garbage on the  floors. this is so unlike my mother because she used to always throw a  fit if the kitchen or house was messy.i  have taken up most of the cleaning. i have asked her if she could start  putting her dishes in the dish washer after she ate, instead of leaving  them out and she was absolutely livid with me for suggesting it. saying  that the dishes were obviously not hers, and that i left them there. (i  did not) i am a very clean person when it comes to kitchens, and i feel  disgusted when i see it dirty.i  could go on about how forgetful i've been noticing her becoming or how  her entire personality seems to be different in one way or another,  obviously the easy answer for this would be for her to talk to her  doctor about this, maybe even a neurologist but she has refused to talk  to a doctor, or mention it to her doctor.my question is:what should i do? i have no idea how to go about this anymore since everything leads to a fight.do  you think i should be concerned about something like alzheimer or  dementia? or does this just sound like age and stress is getting to her?i  love my mother, i do. but over the last year she has been a source of  never ending stress. it always seems like she wants to pick a fight, or  just hates me. its just so unlike how she used to be that has me  worried.i wasn't a perfect child not  even close, but i've not done anything to warrant her being so  confrontational all the time to me. and when i have asked her why, she  just says she doesn't know what i'm talking about and that she isn't  acting confrontational with me.i know  the fighting could end by me simply moving out, but i quit my job to  take care of her and i'm still going to college. my fiance is going to  college and working but we cannot afford an apartment. and i'm not  entirely sure my mother is capable of taking care of the house anymore.  she is not able to lift heavy objects and has become neglectful on  cleaning, and i have taken up cleaning the house as well as a good  portion of the cooking.",,0
"going through this now with my mother, 86, who has dementia. over 20 years ago, she signed up for a ltc program for herself, that was available thru my employer for extended family members. she has about $115,000 invested into it for home health aids. well, about 6 months ago, my brother and i decided that she finally needed it. brother is living with her and has been doing all of the hands-on care for about 4 years now. it's only the last year or so that she has started her downward descent in dementia.mother was a rn as her career, and she was always a very clean and hygienic person. about 6 months ago, she started deciding that all she needed was a ""sponge bath"" every few days, no shampoo. also, she has become incontinent, both ways, and refuses to wear depends, thinking that she can just wear a panty liner and rinse the panties out in the bathtub. that was the bottom line for my brother, and we decided to bring in a home health aid, as mother adamantly insists that she age in place. she has also become increasingly combative, angry and paranoid, something totally out of character for her.the new caregiver, who comes in twice a week for 4 hours a day, has gotten her to take a bath, thank goodness! brother is still working on getting her to use pee pads on her easy chair, but she is still resistant.putting mother in an alf or other such facility is out of the question, as my brother, sister, and i don't have the financial resources to do that, but mother still frets about this. my aunt (her sister), myself and my sister have all told her that she can move in with any one of us, as we have the room and time, but she refuses to leave her small mobile in the country, a long distance from an airport. she wakes up every morning saying that she wished she hadn't waken up, and also talks about my father, something that she hasn't done since he died in 2009. she says she is depressed.is this the normal progression of this disease? should we put her on antidepressants?thank you to anyone for listening....ps-i took a dna test which shows that i have an increased risk for alzheimer's, something my paternal grandmother had before her death. it is an unpleasant thought, but glad i live where there's pas :-(",,0
"my mother has dementia, she's had it for probably 10 years now. i feel troubled, extremely troubled by it. two years ago my father said please come home, i'm not sure how long your mother has while she is still together. so i've been coming home every 6 months for a month or so to spend time and her deterioration is slow but noticeable. now i'm heading back to where i'm currently living and my mother's mind is very scattered. it's infuriating to me. i'm trying, i'm trying to be tolerant of the same four questions every day, every 10 minutes. but i snap and i bark and i get surly and i feel terrible about it. i don't feel like i am the good son. almost a 50-year-old son. she thinks i'm a woman sometimes, doesn't realize that i'm her son, thinks my father is a friend and she sees children in the house and her mother. so she's hallucinating now (maybe it's her meds causing it). her short-term memory is completely gone i would say at this point and when my dad asks her to make dinner salads she'll ask you 10 or 12 times how many people for dinner,  how many people for dinner? and then she'll still make four when there's only three people. i'm not sure why my father hasn't gotten help for her yet. my brother and i ask all the time if he's going to do something and sometimes he says ""well you know i will try"" and then nothing happens. i think he's just trying to handle it himself to keep the cost down and i get it as medical care is obscenely expensive in america. but i'm leaving tomorrow and i just came home by myself for a little bit, they went off to do something and i was just reading over some papers and on the counter i saw this note that was left by my mom and it says her  'name' with 'medicine- vitamins-?' below that 'please help me'. i was  wowed and saddened. she's frightened, she knows there's something wrong but she can't fix it. we can't fix it. the doctors can't fix it. what do we do? how do we comfort her? i take her on walks just to get her out of my dad's hair because she'll ask him the same four questions all afternoon. and i think he's appreciative of down time. it's so frustrating and very sad for the situation. i know it won't end well.",,0

"hi everyone, i'll try to make this as brief as i can, and apologies if the problems stated here don't exactly have to do with dementia alone; but as many of you probably can relate to, his relationship with us (me and my sister) is complicated and it's hard to trace the threads.i am 37, my dad is 64 (65 in october). when he was 18, he adolescently tried to race a train and lost, resulting in a tbi that is now manifesting as early-onset dementia. this was only recently diagnosed, though, and all my life he was a slow thinker, borderline illiterate, not ""stupid"" (he could design, build, and fix things brilliantly but his mom had taken him out of school at 16 to work and i think that seriously set him back), but shy, maybe anxious, and a man of few words. and, importantly, largely absent in our upbringing.both my mom and he are alcoholics, which is another topic for another sub, but importantly my dad was largely just not around when i was growing up, even though my parents didn't divorce until i was in my 20s. he worked a lot i think (various kinds of construction but mainly putting in pools), but he was also out in the garage drinking with his buddies, out fishing, or god knows where else. starting in my early adolescence, furthermore, he basically moved into the basement (the stated reason was that the waterbed he shared with my mom upstairs was bad for his back and she refused to get rid of it, though i was never quite convinced by this) and from then on he was barely more than a housemate, or some distant uncle who'd weaseled his way into a basement apartment.so we grew up being used to not having him around, not expecting communication or support from him, and basically operating as a one-parent family. now, he seems to have clued in belatedly to some of this, and seems to want to ask me if/why my sister hates him. i don't think she does, and nor do i, but we definitely don't have much affection for him; my primary emotion about him is pity. and, i know that if he wants to know how she feels he should just ask her instead of me (though he is right in saying that she and i are close enough for me to basically know her pov).he went to a 3-month in-patient rehab two years ago after some kind of alcoholic episode (his dementia diagnosis must have been around this time too), and since then i think he might be realizing that it's likely to be all downhill from here. my perspective, and my sister's, is that we basically don't want any more than the bare minimum to do with him. we don't want to see him dead or in the streets; but taking over his finances, making decisions for him is not something i want to do, or my sister. i feel like we're going to end up doing it anyway because we're good, compassionate people. but i don't think it's going to remedy our negative feelings toward him. so what am i asking here... solidarity, i guess? advice, maybe, but if you're going to tell me ""swallow your pride and bury the hatchet before he can't any more"" i don't think that's going to work for me. i'm the furthest thing possible from a proponent of 12-step, but until he makes an effort to make amends with us regarding the effect his alcoholism had on us, my wall isn't coming down. any similar experiences? similar choices, regrets, validations? i expect that there will be less and less cohesiveness and stability in his discourse with time, and since phone calls with him are already torturously anxiety-inducing for both him and me, i don't expect to want to increase communication with him. we don't understand each other, we don't communicate on the same level, i doubt he has the emotional intelligence to really name his emotions (something i had to learn as an adult because we were so goddamn repressed at home), let alone express them.is it possible to have an ""arm's-length"" relationship with an absentee parent declining into dementia? or am i fooling myself into thinking there's anything but all-or-nothing, that i either just cut him out or dive into power of attorney?thank you for reading, again sorry if not enough of this is directly to do with dementia but i hope there are others who can identify with my experience.",,0

so me and my mom aren’t close . she wasn’t a good mom. wasn’t particularly involved or interested (long story)  and i moved abroad for most of my adult life . my dad was cool. an intellectual and we got along when i was a teen onwards and was more like my mate . he had ms and signed over everything to my mom to look after when he needed professional care ... they weren’t together as a couple. when he died she kept all his money as it was in her name .... hmmm well ok . i’m pretty sure he wouldn’t have left me nothing at all out of about $40000 . but ok.mom never prepped for old age . i give up my job and moved to england to look after her after cancer . i had a young son on the way in the last two years she has developed dementia and it’s got really bad. matter of time before she needs to live in residential care and they will take the house . so that’s it . pretty shitty mom. never prepped for old age . burned through my dads money when he died . then hers and  her only asset will be gone in a few years too.  i could never imagine leaving my kids like this . thanks for nothing 🙏🏻  rant done .,,0
"hi folks, as the title says i'm looking for some advice with caring for my father who has alzheimer's.my father got his diagnosis a little over four years ago when he was 74 and i guess for someone four years after diagnosis he is doing about as well as can be expected. i live with my parents and help out as best i can when i'm not in work myself and for the most part we get by but then there's some things he does which i struggle to deal with which leads me to posting here. in addition to having alzheimer's my father is type 2 diabetic and lately has been managing it poorly. frequently he will complain of feeling tired and sleep for much of the day and yet when a meal is prepared for him he often prods at it half heartedly before becoming disinterested and leaving the table after eating hardly anything. of course this means his blood sugar levels tank and then he will complain about feeling exhausted. do any of my fellow carers out there have any suggestions of how i can mitigate this? he keeps a stock of chocolate bars in the house for when his sugars are low but obviously this is a poor substitute for getting an actual meal. he's not overweight and in fact lately has lost a lot of what little weight he had, to the point where he seems frail.the other thing that has really gotten to me is the way he has begun to treat my mother. it seems like nothing she does is good enough for him nowadays and he frequently verbally lashes out at her. he's always had a short fuse but these days he will flip his lid over the most minor and insignificant things and she seems to be the one on whom he dumps his frustrations. i've confronted him about this previously but this only seems to make things worse. i don't really have the slightest idea of what i can do to change this behaviour and it's really becoming a problem.any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated",,0

"hello people of r/dementia. i hope that you are all coping as best as you can. i have been here watching this sub-reddit and the parkinson's one for a few years. i've found them a source of some comfort.this isn't a call for help, or advice. i just need a place to write in the company of people who can relate.&amp;#x200b;i have recently been confronted with my dad's startling decline with dementia. he was diagnosed early 2021 with dementia with lewy bodies. he initially refused to even consider the diagnosis. he had an existing parkinson's diagnosis for around three years at this point. i definitely noticed a change ahead of the dementia diagnosis though. he could not operate things like remote controls or telephones at all. even with a painfully obvious lists of instructions with diagrams.the level of incomprehension was astounding which led to his appointment at the memory clinic and subsequent diagnosis.&amp;#x200b;in june he spent a month in hospital after being found alone on his kitchen floor. we armchair consultants suspect a minor stroke occurred, but we'll probably never know.during his stay at hospital his condition was severe. i was confronted with the ""would you be surprised?"" question. this is a tool used to by doctors to gauge confidence of prognosis. such as, ""would you be surprised if my dad passes away in the next 12 months?"". the doctor said she would not be surprised. this left me a little scared but somehow comforted that we would not have to wait long. i'm perhaps most afraid of the lengths of time that someone can last with this condition.&amp;#x200b;now he has been in a care home for five months, and has no idea what is going on. thankfully, he does not appear to be too alarmed. his sores from the floor have healed and i thought he was stabilising. having rung the home today they think he is in rapid decline, frequent falls (i get a phone call for each), unable to be left alone in room because he tears it apart (flinging clothes etc all over).visits are short or cancelled because of coronavirus or some vomiting bug. phone calls are interrupted or difficult because they take place in a communal setting on his end. he regularly says ""i'll call you back"" and hangs up. of course, i then have to ring back. last time someone was just screaming their head off in the background.&amp;#x200b;i often think back to the last time we went out for dinner roughly two weeks before his fall. we always went out for pizza, ever since i was a child. that day i called him that day and we agreed a time for dinner. independent of me he arrived at the restaurant on time his jacket *almost* over his shoulder. he ordered his food, he drank his drink, he ate his own pizza. i mean it wasn't perfect, but i did not help one bit. we talked about the usual things we would talk about - music, london, when i would be visiting again.&amp;#x200b;i wish i'd known that you could sort out power of attorney online for 85 quid. we were endlessly going between him and his solicitor. he even consulted a financial advisor who said ""of it's just a bit of paper that you file away for later"", which did nothing to assist us with the urgency. he finally made an appointment with the solicitor but sadly made it into hospital two days ahead of that. poa online here - [i wish we could just talk about what we used to enjoy talking about. instead, i'm now asked to follow up on a recent delusion. sadly, he remembers that he has asked me to do this, so i need follow up answers.i wish i could know the prognosis more clearly. i have no confidence with dealing with his possessions. i am an only child and he is a single man.i wish i wasn't keeping a spreadsheet tracking his [seven stages of dementia]( and each fall.i wish i'd known that pizza was our last meal out together like that.&amp;#x200b;i could not have asked for a better dad. i just cannot believe it has turned out this way.",,0

"hi everyone, i'm a bit torn about this so i thought maybe someone here had some helpful advice.my grandma (92) lives in a nursing home, and has dementia. she hid it for a good while, but it became apparent just how bad it is when my grandpa died last year. she thinks she is temporarily in the hospital and wants to go home, but by home she means the family farm, where she hasn't lived since she was a teen. she sometimes recognizes my dad and aunt, but often she doesn't, since she thinks they are kids. other than them i don't think she recognizes a lot of people very often.and here is my dilemma: my dad recently mentioned to me that she might be getting close to death and if i would want to visit her a last time i should do so soon. my grandma was a lovely part of my childhood and it pained me so much that i didn't get to see my grandpa before he died. but on the other hand, she will most likely have no idea who i am, but she will fake it since she has gotten used to that after hiding it for so many years. so maybe a visit will just stress her out without doing anything good for her? right now my last moment with her was at my granddads funeral where she in a clear moment marched over to me, took my hand, looked deeply into my eyes and said ""he loved you very much you know?"" which is quite lovely.so yeah, i'm torn about if i should go see her or not, thoughts and advice is appreciated",,0
"a long post that is just me venting more than anything else.to start off - i just want to say i recognize that 99.9% of the posts on this sub are being made by people who are burdened with the heart-wrenching task of caring for a relative and/or loved one with dementia.  i am not in any way comparing my situation to any of yours at all, because this is happening with a neighbor who i barely know.  i also want to thank you all for your posts, honesty and vulnerability with your feelings, because they have educated me a bit on a horrible disease i (very thankfully, up until this point) knew little to nothing about it.my partner and i moved to a new, quiet neighborhood in kansas last september.  in fact we made a special point of finding a house that was a bit further from the center of town so we could enjoy a small yard, a garage for a project car we're working on together, and a spare room so i could have a home office (i work from home).  anyway, it's in a quiet little neighborhood and we share a duplex with a single woman in her mid 70s.  i was delighted by this initially because i like a quiet work environment and what is better than living next to a ""little old lady?""  her yard is immaculate and her decorations are always adorable and changed out immediately after a holiday passes.  always thought that was so charming / interesting.  a few weird things happened since we moved in. the first thing being, about a week or two after we settled in, i was standing in the kitchen drinking water and watched a bunch of flower heads get chucked over our mutual backyard fence onto our patio.  it took me a minute to recognize what was evening happening.  i hadn't met our neighbor yet so i thought it was a bizarre but slightly cheeky sign of welcome?  a bit odd.then in the coming weeks there were a few rogue doorbell rings / ding-dong-ditches around 3am - 4am.  it's a neighborhood full of kids and right by a high school, so we chalked it up to that, and the police confirmed this was likely the case when i finally called them about it because i was starting to get weirded out.then there was the time i was relaxing at night baking muffins, my partner was snoozing on the couch after watching a movie, and we saw cop car lights out our front window.  six cruisers out front and suddenly police banging on our door telling us to come out with our hands up.  a shooting had been called in at our specific address / residence, apparently someone named diane was inside bleeding to death.  of course that wasn't the case, and we were both totally bewildered why someone would swat us, we are new to the town and barely know anyone aside from my partner's boss and coworkers.all that was a bit odd but nothing i really thought about too hard.  life is weird sometimes, right? we did (and do) get woken up occasionally at 3 or 4am with absolutely thundering door slams from next door, i'm talking the whole house shakes and our cats scatter and hide.  i don't even know how a human can slam a door that hard.  definitely made us scratch our heads but there isn't anything inherently wrong with someone slamming a door in their house, i guess.  there was also the weird thing - on windy days when the little wooden bamboo wind chimes i had on our patio would make more noise than usual, she'd angrily go outside, put a stake in the dead center of her yard, and hang up this massive metal wind chime, only to take it down an hour or so later.  this is repeated often.anyway.  about a month ago, our neighbor rang our doorbell while i was on a work call.  i saw her walk away and thought to myself she'd come back if it were an emergency or something - not to mention we have tons of houses all around us in the neighborhood.  the next day i was napping downstairs on the couch and heard a voice yelling in our backyard.  i looked out our back slider door and our neighbor's entire head was sticking out like a turtle through this one area of our mutual fence that had blown over in a wind storm.  it was just the top that was leaning a bit, and i had already put in a maintenance request with our landlord about it.  anyway, the look on her face spooked me, it was as if she was looking at something or talking to someone who wasn't there.  a day later the doorbell rang again.  i was upstairs working in my office.  then the doorbell rang about 26 more times and someone was violently banging on the door.  i ran downstairs, heart pounding, and could recognize at that point that it was our neighbor who was now also shouting angrily outside the door, although it wasn't clear to me about what.  something about something leaning on something else - i had to guess the fence?  i didn't open the door because i was very alarmed by how aggressive she sounded, but i called my landlord.  he confirmed that she had some ""mental health issues, maybe dementia"" and mentioned that she had made numerous noise complaints about me and my partner and our six children since we moved in.  we do not have kids.  she also never made a complaint about the fence.  i asked him to fix it as soon as possible, nonetheless.another day later.  the doorbell rings again, 58 more times, followed immediately by the same violent pounding, and now she's grabbing the doorknob and hulk-pulling and pushing the door in and out so aggressively i do not know how long our stupid little lock will hold.  i call the police because at this point i have zero idea what is going on and by all accounts she's trying to break in.  they come over, try to talk to her, she refuses to open the door for them, screams at them through her closed window, and they speak with me and let me know they are ""familiar"" with her as she calls in a lot, believe she has dementia, she has made various noise complaints and they are often about us or a little boy who lives in her attic (there is no little boy.)it takes me about an hour to calm down after this outburst, and i finally go back upstairs to continue working.  at this point it's late at night and i'm waiting for my partner to get home from the class he teaches at night.  sit down at my desk and hear a massive bang downstairs.  i bolt down the stairs and hear a million more bangs, here she is again, our neighbor is in our backyard trying to smash our glass slider door with a rock.  what the actual.  i call the police again, this time they send multiple cruisers, at this point she's crawled back into her house (she literally broke down the rest of the fence and squeezed through it to get into our backyard) and has transformed back into a sweet little old lady again.  she talks to the officers this time, and tells them that we are just playing pranks on each other and there was no need to call the police.  definitely not the case considering i have no idea who she is and have never even spoken to her.my landlord contacted an officer on the police's mental health unit the next day and the officer asked if we'd be comfortable going over to her house (with him supervising, and her permission) and formally introducing ourselves to our neighbor.  we had zero problem with that, so we did so.  she was perfectly lovely, her house was utterly immaculate inside and she had a sweet little dog who she clearly loved and cared well for.  she was kind although she did ask me slightly aggressively how many children we have, to which i replied none.  i did compliment her on her lovely outdoor decorations which i always do (truly) admire.  the mental health officer followed up with us afterwards and said that when he spoke to her alone, she admitted to him she's been having hallucinations but hasn't been to see a doctor in over 7 years.two days later the doorbell rings again.  this time i run downstairs and am about to answer the door, seeing as i've met this lady now, and stupid ol' me thinks maybe i can talk to her and figure out what's bothering her and smooth it all over.  i stop short when i hear her start ranting and raving about how i stole all her decorations and then she proceeds to start ripping my wreath and all my outdoor decor off our front entryway, smashing all our items very hard against the frosted glass window on the side of our door.  alarmingly hard.  this repeats a few more times.  we decided to take out a formal trespassing complaint because we don't know what else to do and it's becoming increasingly alarming/disturbing/upsetting to have this happen.  i don't see her getting arrested as a solution at all, in fact it feels wrong, but it appears that she has no family, no contacts, the emergency contact information she gave our landlord was a nonworking number.  she has refused medical treatment from anyone who has suggested it to her (the mental health officer and a social worker who has stopped by multiple times) and at this point isn't even admitting she's having hallucinations anymore, she flat out denies she has any issues whatsoever. a few weeks passed after we took out the complaint, but the knocking and harassing started up again, this time she called the police and filed a complaint that we had burglarized her home, stole her dog (who was barking in a room upstairs) and we also stole a firearm from her home and left it on her front step.  that last bit was particularly chilling, a. because it meant that she has a firearm and b. because our neighborhood is full of young children running around during the day and the idea of a loaded firearm sitting on her front mat in plain sight for a few hours (or god knows how long) midday makes me want to throw up.the door knocking and bell ringing has died down a bit, but has now turned into almost constant banging on the interior walls we share in the duplex.  when i shower she smashes stuff against her walls and screams at me.  when i use the toile or make any noise in the bathroom at all, she is often standing in her adjacent bathroom saying directly at the wall ""i can hear you in there.""  not sinister at all.  almost none of this happens to my partner, or rarely occurs when he is home. she seems highly observant so i'm sure she can tell whose car is whose and notes when each is gone.  to the point where i've had my partner use my car for a week just to give me some peace.  i can't pretend to apply logic to this situation but maybe she feels threatened by his presence, he's certainly a much taller male whereas i'm on the smaller end of most females.  but again she may well be hallucinating so who knows what she sees or thinks is going on with us anyway.  when she's not actively banging on the walls she is hulk-smashing things inside her apartment, moving objects around that sound far too heavy for a 76 year old to move around, talking to herself frantically and chain smoking nonstop which is seeping through her walls into our unit. she has called both our landlord and the police and blamed the smoking on us and says we are ruining her house.  neither of us smoke.our landlord served her an eviction notice after the umpteenth time she violated our order, and she quieted down for almost exactly the 14 days she had to comply with the order.  then right as rain she started up again.  it's stuff like that that makes me frustrated, because she seems to have some self awareness of the situation.  our landlord finally decided that rather than evict her he'd do a nonrenewal of her lease which is coming up in august to give her more time to find a suitable place to live.  this is somewhat of a relief, i guess (for us, certainly not for her, realistically where is she going to go) but it's ratcheted up her aggression to a freaking 12/10.  she's home all day, and with the newfound information that her mortal enemies ie us have caused her to be driven from her home, she now lies in wait in her entryway for us to leave the house and on multiple occasions has started walking quickly towards me as i'm trying to get into my car.  i've called the police about this and all they say is to ""avoid a confrontation"" and oh also, ""assume she has a firearm.""  i am not a gun owner, no desire to be, but i've at least bought pepper spray which maybe i can spritz in her direction before she shoots me in the head.  at this point i am scared to leave the house, which sounds ridiculous, but it's true.  i also hate being in the house now too, for what it's worth.reading everyone's posts has been really helpful, though in many cases deeply upsetting and profoundly sad to read all of your situations.  they make me understand the behavior a little bit, although of course this is not someone i am emotionally attached to or have history with like a parent or grandparent or other relative.  knowing her illness is causing this behavior is one thing, but all the same it's hard to not think she's just a compete raging control freak jerk set on making our lives a living hell. it often feels like she is a predator and the behavior is very unpredictable and quite aggressive.  the police don't seem to take this particularly seriously, and whenever they are called and come by, the majority of them smile and say ""oh yeah we know \_\_\_\_, she's a sweet old lady"" and in one case i quote, ""i'm a softie so i don't think we should take her in.""  it's like, live here for 2 days, then get back to me.  again, i don't pretend to know what the solution is here, i did call the mental health officer to make sure he knew she'd need housing in august and he said he'd offer her some resources, but the last few times he's checked on her she's gotten very aggressive and slammed the door in his face.  it's a tough case because she's still quite self-sufficient at this point but is nasty as all get out to who she wants to be.anyway, i'm trying to have compassion here and of course at the end of the day want this woman to get help.  not really looking for any advice as such, just looking to vent.  thank you to all who read this.",,0
"i am in the early days of suspecting my mom might have dementia.  i think there's something not quite right with my mom. every single day is different.  the thing that caught me off guard earlier this year was her mood.  complete silence from her to me.  i am mindful of my attitude to my mom and i am not sarcastic or critical of her and i help around the home and pay bills. i did nothing to warrant silence from her.   then there were times when she was in the silence mode and she would rush around the home and grab her jacket and run from the house to go out walking.   the silence was something that was happening for a few months.  the silence was the number 1 thing that caught me off guard earlier this year and i began to wonder if this could be dementia. then there was other behaviours over the past 2/3/4 years that i think i can now piece together alongside the silence.  currently a type of ocd cleaning has taken her over.  every single day with her - cleaning.  also she's not able to comprehend the energy crisis and the there was little effort to reduce energy consumption.   i am nearly at a stage where i am going to have a heart attack at the machine.   60 degree loads with prewash and extra rinse.  washing only one or two items at a time. the whole works.  there's no effort or understanding to reduce the energy consumption.  she's washing as if she's leaving severe disease on everything. there was a type of silliness over the past few years like buying more shoes when she has shoes, shoes, shoes, shoes.  she just wants more.  recently i read something that said when dementia is found, quite often dementia change have been happening for up to 10 years before diagnosis. is that true? looking back there were other things over the past few years.  her reasoning was warpped over some issues over the past few years. for example she was not able to follow instructions from the vet when our dog was old and sick.  now, i am thinking if it's dementia and of it was setting in for years? i hope i am wrong.  i don't have time to be a carer to my mom.  and especially this.  i am trying to suggest to my mom to turn the temperature down on the washing machine and leave off the extra functions and it's not going down well.  she's looking for a fight from me when i try to conserve energy like this.",,0
she showed signs in 2014. by 2020 i forced her to a dr. early stages then. by end of 2021 she couldn’t live alone. now she’s beginning to have a little difficulty running the shower etc.  but her short term is gone. the exact same questions over and over and over. every few min or less. i am losing it. this is on top of losing my stepmom after being her hospice nurse for 3 months. and now my dads severe hypochondria asking me if he’s dying 100x a day. i’ve been caretaking everyone for 2 years. i’m losing it. but this post is specifically : how do i deal with the same question every 5 seconds?!! do you people have the patience of a saint? i’m pretty good. and she (was) my best friend. but this is. it’s all ruining my life. with covid. and i might as well quit.,,0
"my mom is stage 5/6 alz. i’m her only daughter. she’s a covert narcissist and i have adhd. she’s always relied on my struggles with adhd to fit her narrative about how hard her life has been just being my mother. i’ve always rejected the manipulation with avoidance and dissociation. this has translated to my mom telling everyone that i dont like her and dont want to be around her and she cant rely on me to be there for her when she needs care, which she knows is bullshit because i have told her repeatedly that just because she cant live in my house doesnt mean i wont take care of her. she does this as a ploy for sympathy and a way to keep me isolated so that i can focus only on her. im almost 100% that narcissism is directly linked to dementia so im sure some of you can relate. anyways - now her pity party stories and manipulation tactics have created real consequences and i’m at my wits end waiting for aps and my lawyer to move with a purpose. my moms husband of 20 years passed in early feb and left her with his sister. he had late stage copd but he ultimately died of covid after his sister gave it to him when they drove down to get my parents without telling anyone the day after christmas. before he died, i had never met or seen this woman. she decided they should move to her house last september and i found out bc i just happened upon a facebook post. a month later they decided to stay and again, i was notified with the rest of the world via facebook. i tried to talk to my stepdad multiple times about including me and keeping me informed in their decisions and what is going on and he apologized and said he would. then two days after xmas their hospice nurse called saying that she was at their house for their appt and their car was gone and their door was padlocked. no one could get ahold of them until we said we were going to call the police and then 2 minutes later the phone rings and they tell us they moved. i couldnt make a trip until early feb and by that time, my stepdad had passed and they had given all the legal everything to his sister. since they moved to her house, she has been a nightmare. she wont give me phone numbers and addresses. she refuses to discuss any of my moms finances with me. they decided to put her in a home, found a place, paid for it, and had a move in date before they ever told me anything at all. she’s been making my mom travel every week and stay with different people and when it was my turn, she sent her away with me with no atm card and no id. my mom has been having regular anxiety attacks when she forced to sleep in all these weird places and this lady just blows it off. i told her that i wanted to move my mom to a place closer to me and asked to discuss all my moms money and she said she wasnt comfortable discussing my moms finances with anyone. she wont show me any docs. she wont tell me whats going on with moms money. she has control of my mom and stepdads house. and now she wont give me my moms new phone number in her new facility - its a private number and the facility says they cant give it out. so i called adult protective services and now they’re going to investigate. im waiting for a lawyer to call me back. but these coupe of days where i’m not able to check on my mom and this woman could be doing or saying anything to smear me, i feel sick to my stomach. how can people do this to their kids?!?! these two dont even like each other and it feels like im just the scapegoat for both of them. i love my mom and i never could have imagined that she would just write her life over to a virtual stranger that she doesnt trust or like just to spite me because i said she cant live in my house. i will never do that to my kids. i feel horrible, conflicted, angry, disappointed, disrespected, sad. im just deflated and confused because all i ever wanted was for my mom to love me- and she just cant.",,0

"i am not sure if this is the right support group for my question as my grandmother (85) also suffers from schizophrenia. hopefully some of you kind souls have some advice though or could point me in the right direction. my grandmother over the past 5-6 years has developed a serious stealing issue. at first we thought as a family we were misplacing things but it came apparent with time that it was being taking by grandma. the things she takes have zero value to her whatsoever. we have read that this can be due to her dementia. she will take things like spoons from the kitchen, laundry from the dryer that is my dads (shirts that are 4 sizes to big for her), car keys, cups, mail, remotes, dog toys etc. we have tried discussing with her before but as expected she denies and gets very upset. so we have not asked her about the missing items any further and instead just replace things as they go missing and try to hide things we don’t want to disappear. it is difficult living in your own house and having to constantly hide your belongings or lock them away. we don’t want her to feel as though we are creating a sterile environment but it has gotten to the point where nothing can be left out. we simply can’t replace things like car keys or remotes every week. my mother (her daughter) is concerned it might be time to consider assisted living or a at home aide. grandma is very upset at the thought of this. (she also has heart issues and a pacemaker and we are always worried about working her up when discussing these things.)i am looking for advice on how to deal with the topic with grandma. anytime we discuss it she gets so upset but we also don’t want to blindside her and bring in an aid or take her to an assisted living facility as she would most likely react similarly. she tells us if she goes to a home she would rather die. it just seems there is no win. she does not seem happy living in the home anymore and we don’t know what to do. we love her dearly and just want her to be comfortable as she ages but it seems we can’t win. any advice is appreciated.",,0
"my grandma has dementia and i am more than done with all the shit i have to put up with day in and day out. i am literally pulling my hair out every single day just trying to move on with all the stress i have to deal with.let's just start with a few things i have to deal with:1. name calling: my grandma is very religious and i'm constantly being called a ""demon"" or i should go die because she doesn't like the way her food is prepared, she blames me for ""supposedly"" for going into her room, or just for something so menial and retarded i just can't.2. my grandma loves to believe that everything is mine mine mine: this one really irritates me and just overall makes me want to punch a wall, because no i'm sorry but not everything is hers. after she's done eating she likes to take the plate and silverware to her room because ""she bought it"" and it is supposedly hers, and once it is in her room it then is lost forever in the dark abyss of her luggages (she doesn't use a dresser despite one being in her room). you don't know how infuriating it is having to buy and waste money upon buying new plates, cups, you name it just because my grandma took it. not to mention, she believes every single one of my own nike shoes is hers,  clothes of either my own or my moms are being stolen left and right, and just recently she stole my dogs fucking sweater. i don't know about anyone else, but when my own shit is taken i feel as though it is an attack on my own very existence, and best believe until whatever is stolen is returned i will not stand for such bullshit.3. too many questions: i feel as though i just tape a sign to my forehead that reads whatever question she's asking, and often times it's the same god damn question just asked over and over and over and over and over again. it'll really drive someone nuts. sometimes i get so tired of answering the same questions over and over again, so i just flat out ignore her and when i do that she gets mad that i don't answer her questions. i get so frustrated with this one because she asks questions such as ""where's my mother, father, or brother?"" and i of course for the millionth time in row have to break the news that they of course are all dead.4. she walks out the door: this one is truly my favorite as it requires me to waste my time and physically chase after her around the neighborhood. if my grandmother is truly upset, because of whatever reason it is she loves walking out the front door and going who knows where. you don't know how many times i've had to call the police because she wouldn't get into the car with me, and come back home and sometimes i feel so embarrassed having to call the police. not to mention, just recently when she walked out the house she started to throw rocks at my car (thankfully missed).5. hygiene: this one is just really fucking gross and there's no easy way to put this. but once my grandmother is done taking a dump sometimes i notice she doesn't really wash her hands even though there's a huge sign in the bathroom mirror that reminds her. all she does after depositing her shit is splish splash a little water and a smidge of soap onto her hands and doesn't even properly scrub. not to mention, she hasn't taken a shower since like november and me and my mom try and try our best to urge her to take a shower but no as she thinks we are attacking her.these are the things that only just scratched the surface of what i have to deal with day in and day out, and i know what everyone is going to say, it's the disease don't take it seriously, just brush it off. no. i am done brushing it off and i am taking this shit seriously. i also just want everyone to know that i am barely 21 years old (my birthday was a few weeks ago). i am a full time college student. so on top of all the stress of my classes at school i have to deal with the stresses at home. also no, i don't have the means to go out and live on my own. i'm certainly not a trained professional and unfortunately i am not being payed at all.",,0

"two years into the new year and already one of the best articles on the role of oxidation and alzheimer's disease has come out.  here are some of the highlights: neurogenesis *versus* neurodegeneration: the broken balance in alzheimer’s diseaseaccruing evidence indicates the role of systemic and brain metabolic aberrations, in addition to the canonical hallmarks, in ad pathogenesis (polis and samson, 2019). the up-to-date description of ad-associated pathology includes neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, instigated apoptosis, and chronic oxidative stress. of note, oxidative damage is one of the earliest events causing and following ad (nunomura et al., 2001). moreover, oxidative damage is strongly associated with neurodegenerative processes and it is a connecting factor between β-amyloidosis, τ-protein hyperphosphorylation, and neuronal loss. oxidative stress due to the disbalance between generation and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ros) plays a key role in β-amyloid-mediated cytotoxicity via a spectrum of molecular events that eventually lead to a substantial neuronal loss, which is a primary hallmark of ad, clinically manifesting in cognitive decline. in healthy individuals, excessive ros production is counteracted by physiological antioxidant mechanisms that incessantly maintain redox homeostasis. however, these mechanisms are inadequate in the ad brain tissue and do not provide the necessary protection against highly reactive species, which disrupt membrane function, impair enzymes, break polysaccharides, and damage nucleic acids...adult neurogenesis is extremely responsive to the brain pathology and correlates with its severity. neurogenesis counteracts neurodegeneration in the aging and ad brains by implicating neural progenitors in the repair mechanisms and replacement of nonfunctional brain tissue. however, the development of ad is followed by an increase in the imbalance between these two counterdirected processes. notably, oxidative stress due to numerous factors seems to be the main cause of this imbalance. the ad brain is under gradually growing oxidative stress, leading to progressive neuron degeneration and, eventually, death and atrophy of susceptible areas. on the other hand, chronic oxidative stress causes neurogenesis decline that further aggravates clinical dementia, which becomes irreversible. therefore, early diagnosis and preventive interventions targeted at neurovascular unit function and ros elimination are the most promising approaches to combat the disease. [** this can be paired with the following research: ## glutathione: a molecular whistleblower for alzheimer’s diseasethe hippocampi – the brain centres for learning and memory – are one of the earliest regions to be sabotaged by alzheimer’s pathology. our data revealed that gsh levels plummet in the hippocampi of patients with alzheimer’s as well as those with mci (fig.1). the frontal cortices – brain ceos responsible for a variety of executive functions – are chronologically affected later in alzheimer’s. gsh levels mimic this chronology with no changes in the cortices of mci patients, but significant reduction in those of alzheimer’s patients (fig.1). interestingly, gsh remains unaffected in the cerebellum – a brain region unaffected by alzheimer’s till late stages. it appears gsh decline is not ubiquitous but rather a region-specific phenomenon that appears to precisely map the progression of alzheimer’s in our brains.   [the loss of balance in the brain between increasing oxidative stress and decreasing antioxidant compounds (especially glutathione) leads to all sorts of problems such as dna damage, mitochondrial failure, neuroinflammation, misfolded amyloid and tau proteins (which further increase oxidative stress), declining levels of critical neurotransmitters, impairments in the regeneration of neurons and synapses, and neuronal cell death.  oxidation and nitration leads to the death of neurons and niitration inhibits the further regeneration of neurons and synapses.  when peroxynitrite--the main nitro-oxidant in alzheimer's disease--is scavengerd it produces water and water is a de-nitrating agent.     thus fewer neurons die and more neurons and synapses are regenerated.  so the whole key to treating alzheimer's disease is to try to restore the antioxidant capacity that the brain has lost.  this approach has been sucessefully employed  to treat alzheimer's disease: the use of a brown seaweed compound (gv-971), anavex 2-73 (blarcamesine), panax ginseng, aromatherapy, and chinese herbs combined with conventional alzheimer's medications.  see the forest through the trees and the pathway to successfully treating alzheimer's disease becomes much clearer.",,0
"hey there everyone. my name is mustafa and i'm 23. 6 months ago i was on the verge of ending my life .at a very young age where everyone is striving and working hard for a better life. unfortunately for me everything went on pause in 2018 i got diagnosed with osteoarthritis aka (disk degeneration)that's where i had to be friend chronic pain..my past 2.5 years was filled with so much pain that i lost everything in my life.my relationships went down hill , my finances were all spent on finding a cure , uni failed me since i was not able to study due to pain and so much more i sucked it all up cuz i was told there's nothing you can do about it just like alzheimer's. anyways 2020 march arrives and that's when sh*t hits the fan and got fired my job at a restaurant because i forget alot of orders and instructions that i've been given.i realized my brain is not working right. it's like i have conversation with someone in the next minute or two i realize i would forget 90% of what we talked about. let alone just that i couldn't perform normal calculations in my head . man that felt so weird coming from someone who has graduated from a levels 5 years ago with straight up a's and b's.long story short i went through different doctors trying to find what's going on and i would always make sure i'd have my phone recorder on cuz the next minute i'd step out i'd legit forget what they just told me.after weeks of visits i knew that there no hope for me man . literally every doctor said something .i got diagnosed with adhd , depression , anxiety.and the one i hated the most was ""oh i think it's all in your head"". yes sure...i tried all the meds from adderall to anti depressants you name it. they just threw pills week after week. hoping one day i come by and talk about how they helped me..unfortunately none did.i wanted to see how bad my brain was so  i found a test called moca.i think alot of you should know what this is . it's a test doctors put people on if they have cognitive decline. no doctor wanted to test me out or do a scan on my brain so i did the test on my own and my score was literally 5/30. man i knew life was over for me and my parents would have to go through this with me as well which was horrifying.time was passing by and things getting worse day by day for some reason i'd be staring at the window for no reason for minutes.days pass and weird words come out of my mouth and i'd stutter trying to put one sentence together. i think it's called aphasia.i know i'm talking so much about my symptoms but i'm trying to show you how bad my case is. but you might wonder how the hell am i typing this entire post if i had dementia..i'll gladly explain and it's why i'm putting this out.6 months ago that's when i was at rock bottom i discovered a book called ""the end of alzheimer's"" by dr dale bredesen.i was so desperate that if someone told me the cure is to eat a plate of shit . i would do it regardless if it's true or not. it's called desperation for a solution.anyways dr dale details everything a person needs to know about this disease but not just that. he's been able to reverse his clients cognitive decline with a protocol that he has extensively put out in his book .i was skeptical but i wanted something that gives me hope so i decided to follow.  jesus man 6 months in and i swear on my mom's life that it f*cking works.i have recently done the cognitive test and my moca score was 30/30.i'm able to remember conversations , my vocabulary increased , aphasia is vanishing , i can understand movies and so much more..i highly recommend anyone who's watching a loved one die day by day to give this book a shot or hell maybe you yourself are experiencing symptoms of memory loss too . there's hope for everyone no matter how far they are ...i'm not the first one who has come back to life but in the book he shares different stories of his clients who show obvious results and they have gone back to normal life..i feel sad at time i walk by a nursing home next to my house and i see a bunch of elderly probably with severe alzheimer's stuck where they are and never get to truely come back to life just like i did.anyways for me it's been 6 months and i can't say i'm fully back 100% to where i was but jesus i'm so happy things turned around when it seemed impossible..it's a journey and it takes times i can't imagine the how my next years will be. i'm looking forward to uni again 😊yeah and also i forgot to mention that my chronic pain has subsided . i finally live a pain free life. i swear the only reason i posted this is so that someone reads this and hopefully gives the book a shot . we all know how hopeless it is to hear someone go through dementia. if you got any question i'll gladly answer ☺️",,0
i’m 29 and feel somewhat unsafe. even though my age is what it is i feel like i’ve opened up to people i shouldn’t have. gone off the rails more then i should have and now after his diagnosis this year i feel completely alone. i feel like my life’s been just one big train wreck. i’m unemployed and terrified of what the future holds for me. i’m quite a homebody and feels like i’m kind of exposed to the reality of life now fullly. good and bad and i’m finding it so overwhelming. has anyone else has similar thing?,,0
"my(29f/disabled) mom (56f) has ftd (frontotemporal dementia). for the longest time i’ve been her “person.” if she needed to do something i’d be more likely to get her to agree. over the past five years her decline has been steadily increasing. she’s still very much herself and may not remember exact dates when asked, but i’m still her person. i normally go to visit my partner in england for a couple of months at a time. she misses me but seems to be okay while i’m gone, and is always happier when i’m back. since the pandemic i haven’t been able to visit him. it’s been since 2019 that i wasn’t gone for more than a week or two at a time. recently i’ve been spending time in my childhood hometown. i have a social support community here. i can be a little more active in my life style here. for the longest time i’ve always said the two things keeping me at home are my mom and the dread of finding new doctors. now i’m at a point where i’m ready to switch and move back to my hometown. this unfortunately leaves me stuck on the position of my mom. i love her and know that her mental health would only rapidly decline if i permanently moved. my dad is at work or drinking (he doesn’t watch her like she needs, he “hangs out” meaning she will not eat or drink if he’s not home or too drunk to go get her food.) before the pandemic we were having an in home aid come once a week. she needs more than once a week, and it is very expensive and not covered by insurance. another reason why living at home benefits not only her but my fathers wallet. i have kind of tasked myself as being her protector and caretaker. which i have no regrets about, i love her and only wish i could be of more use to her. i can’t get her to do basic self care, she won’t take her meds for me. because of my physical disabilities and mental health i can’t often spend the time with her she deserves. i’m really only around to get lunch with her or run her to a store here and there. make sure she eats something. i also have trouble setting boundaries. i know this move would be great for my mental health. but i feel so guilty for leaving my mom in my dads care. tl;dr: do i move and work on growing myself and my happiness or do i leave my mom in my inattentive dad’s care, and miss out on what little time we may have left at a cost to my mental health and happiness?",,0
"my life’s gone so upside down with this that i don’t really know what way to turn. i don’t really have close bonds with other family. i’m young with old parents and lots of other family dead. my dads late eighties. thing is i’m still living at home. i’ve tried everything my life to do my best. but here i am in my twenties feeling like i’ve lost all the bonds with my friends, missed out on being young. no idea who i even am anymore and i’m mentally just done. i’m a constant anxious nervous wreck. i’m unemployed. my mum is doing the most but i’m here for them both whilst the rest of my life i just seem to being getting shat on constantly by everything and everyone. i spend 90% of time in my room just drained completely. i’m so depressed but bottle all my problems up so i don’t cause arguments as my dad can’t take it and mum gets upset. i feel like my entire life is just a fuckup and it shouldn’t be that way but it feels like it’s too late for me. i spent so many years in survival mode messing up my life because we had no idea that he had it until this year. now we know and my overthinking is just 10000x worse and it’s always been pretty bad. on top of this i have so much trauma from a relationship i had as a teenager that was toxic and went sour. failures every area of my life. i see people with normal families and think to myself i used to want anything but that. i used to be so self centred wanted the world etc. now i would kill for the peace of mind to just have a simple life. i feel mentally and spiritually broken on so many levels. feel like i’ve failed my dad my mum and myself. i find it so hard to just relax and take it easy when everywhere i go every other man just seems to wants a pissing contest with me. i just feel like no matter what move i make or what i do life is kicking my ass. i’ve tried giving my life to ‘god’ rather then my ego but i feel like if anything it’s just made me hate myself even more. to be honest i’m just completely lost for words as to how much of a fuckup my life has been. has anyone got out the other side of all this and ever lived a good life again? having these problems at home has affected every area of my life and i’m scared things won’t get better for me. i feel like i’m starting from scratch at 29 years old",,0

"# **what is this?**i've found that when my wife (who has early-onset alzheimers) wakes up to music, and we can dance together, she generally has a much better day -- a more optimistic outlook, with more energy and abilities. it's somewhat ironic that throughout my life i have *hated* dancing, but it took our current predicament to change that for me.i'd encourage all primary caregivers to try this. it's not an intellectual exercise. it's not a *pain in the ass* (her words) behavioural exercise. it's just fun and invigorating. and it anecdotally seems to work for us. that's right, **us**. it helps me too.[previous wake up and dance post i]([wake up and dance post ii]([wake up and dance post iii](------• **monday**: [jean-luc ponty -- new country](i loved this rock-jazz fusion guy back in the day. i'm sad to hear that alan holdsworth died today, so i wanted to revisit a band he was a part of. let's have a hoedown!• **sunday**: [norah jones -- don't know why](i'm not sure why on this easter sunday that a song full of melancholy and regret speaks to me. norah jones' voice is exquisitely subtle and gets me right in the heart. i know i've not been perfect in being her man through this ordeal, but i'm trying my best. if this song lets me hold my dear wife in my arms for a sweet slow dance, then all is good with the world. if i hold her close enough, she won't see the tears in my eyes.• **saturday**: [the beach boys -- god only knows](today is the day we tell our loved ones that we love them. they need to hear it, and we need to hear ourselves say it.• **friday**: [marvin gaye -- let's get it on](oh golly -- marvin gaye! we hold both hands together and do a super slinky wake up dance. remembering the days we were dating; innocent and free.# **week 4.2**• **thursday**: [the upstarts -- boppin in the 80s](ok, so this is a completely selfish entry. while a (classical violin) music student, i played keyboards in this band for maybe 3 months or so -- but not a member when this video was recorded. i eventually had to quit because: 1) i was a *terrible* keyboard player. 2) after a gig, i'd wake up with liquid coming out of ears, accompanied by a dull ringing. i realised that i was in danger of losing my hearing.anyway, my wife enjoyed watching this, and laughs at the thought of geeky me being in a rock band.• **wednesday**: [j. geils band -- give it to me](so sad to hear j. geils has died! as a bostonian, i've always felt pride about this awesome band.• **tuesday**: [blondie -- hard of glass](another great classic, one that we can't get out of our heads. it's almost like some days have their own theme song.• **monday**: [eric clapton -- layla](how bout we start the week with some good old rock 'n' roll?• **sunday**: [blue swede -- hooked on a feeling](sorry, no easter-themed song today (although i was *sorely* tempted to post [st john passion]( which is an amazing piece of music). so let's start the day with a nostalgia-ridden song with a great beat! time to make some french toast with hard-boiled eggies on the side for breakfast!• **saturday**: [the village people -- ymca](my wife is *such* a disco chick! she loves this song, and i have to admit, it's quite catchy, and a great way to start the day.• **friday**: [barry manilow -- can't smile without you](a sweet love song for a friday! a nice slow dance where we can hold each other, and look into one another's eyes while singing the chorus to each other.# **week 4.1**• **thursday**: [dave brubeck quartet -- take five](these guys are cool. how are they not cool?when i grow up i want to be as cool as these cats.• **wednesday**: [bob marley -- one love](i love finding/remembering feel-good songs. clapping and singing is such a sweet way to start the day.• **tuesday**: [eric idle -- always look on the bright side of life](i guess there's a metaphor hidden in the song… but it's got a singable melody and a positive message, basically. i know we'll be singing bits of this to each other through the day today!• **monday**: [peter frampton -- baby i love your way](this is a specific request from my wife. she knows i like to play a different song to wake her up every morning, and several times yesterday she asked me to find a frampton song. it is so glorious to see her face light up when we listen and dance to music.• **sunday**: [the beatles -- help](this song is so completely apposite to our dilemma; it's like they were writing for alzheimers suffers to sing to their significant others. the music is so energetic, while the lyrics border on desperation. i have to admit i sometimes have to avert my eyes when singing this with my wife.• **saturday**: [paul mccartney &amp; wings -- band on the run](no subtext here. however, this is a great song. how is it you can always tell a paul mccartney song?• **friday**: [yes -- roundabout](this is some quality progressive rock. we both love choral rock. it's not necessarily danceable, but we can still rock out to this song!",,0
"my neuroscience lab at ut austin is hosting an [online fundraiser]( for our research training on alzheimer's disease. i never knew much about alzheimer's disease until my son was born with down syndrome. although not well known, virtually all people with down syndrome develop early onset alzheimer's. i became even more concerned once i realized that i might carry two of the unlucky genes that predispose most people to alzheimer's disease. consistent with this possibility, i learned the same month that my mother had alzheimer's disease. most with alzheimer's disease carry this unlucky gene too, and yet scientists still do not know how it contributes to alzheimer's disease.rather than fall into despair, i focused our lab on making major progress in alzheimer's research. frustrated by the slow progress, our lab engineered a tiny worm with human alzheimer's genes. we discovered that similar to human patients, the **alzheimer's worms** have neurons that die when they reach old age. fortunately, this only requires one week! moreover, we can see whether the neurons are dead or alive through their transparent bodies! we have used our ultra-rapid model to screen through hundreds of drugs, and [discovered some drugs]( that stop neurons from dying, and boost cognition in mouse models of alzheimer's disease. i now aim to accelerate research by training the best undergraduate students at ut austin in alzheimer's disease research. with your support, we will fund **students to make fundamental discoveries in understanding and treating alzheimer’s disease.** more importantly, these **promising students will be directed towards a career in alzheimer's disease research.** our lab has an excellent record of training undergrads, including underrepresented minorities, for competitive graduate programs such as harvard and stanford.   please check out and pass on our [fundraising site]( with your friends and loved ones who want to defeat alzheimer’s disease. i will respond to comments for the duration of our campaign. thank you for your support!",,0

"my father (72) has alzheimer’s and he is just a mess. my brother lives in california, i live in colorado, and our parents live in kansas. my dad began showing symptoms of cognitive decline about 8 years ago and has been on medication for about 3 years or so. my parents were out last weekend for a short visit. we hadn’t seen them for 7 months and while i keep up with my mom and the state of my dads health regularly, there’s been a major decline in his behavior. he is 100% dependent on her. if he doesn’t know where she is, he gets very agitated. she can’t work, go out with her friends, go to church choir, or really anything any more. my dad often doesn’t know where he is or even who she is sometimes. she tells me that he will pack up his room thinking he needs to go home but when she asks where home is, he doesn’t know. he’s getting paranoid. recently he woke up in the middle of the night thinking there were people outside and got all sorts of agitated. they live on a golf course and he spends his day near this pond right near the backyard gathering sticks and golf balls obsessively. apparently he finds golf balls and washes them and has managed to gather an entire tub full. when she tries to lock doors and keep him inside, he will pull and rattle the door so hard that he has ripped off the doorknob. she has tried to get him in adult daycare a couple times a week but that didn’t work. the caregivers couldn’t keep him busy enough and he was constantly disruptive and agitated because he didn’t know where he was or where my mom was. right now she has someone come to the house two mornings a week so she can run errands, but she can’t stay at home those days because he is constantly under foot. most concerning to me was when they were here last weekend. i took them with my kids up to the mountains to this park/trail and he spent the whole time gathering dead limbs and trying to push over dead trees and piling them up. this a public open space, so not ok. i tried to redirect him and get him to stop, but he won’t and got so mad at me for even attempting to cross him... just looked at me with such anger i thought he was going to snap. i worry that he could get violent. my brother and i don’t know what to do or how to advise or help her. he can still dress himself and take care of his bodily functions. so it’s like he’s not far gone enough to go to a home and even if she put him in one, it wouldn’t work. they would have to sedate him or something, which is just awful. 1) the meds he’s on don’t seem to be doing much and they are it’s just keeping him in this awful middle area where he functions just enough but i wonder is it crueler to both of them to keep him this way. should we council her to stop them? she had asked us this before. 2) what do you do with a patient like this? i want to urge her to start the process of putting him in a home but there is no way he will just watch tv and do crafts. they used to live on a farm and he is used to open spaces and wandering and working outside. i think that’s why he obsessively tries gather yard debris and chop down trees all the time. but he can’t do this where he lives now. sorry this is so long, but i thought someone here might have some insight.",,0

"i’m taking care of my step dads mom and she cries all the time. i’m pretty sure it’s fake crying most of the time. she just yells “help me” nonstop. i haven’t seen anyone talk about using the “cry it out” method they use for babies. is that not something we should do? because if not, how the hell do you get anything done ever? some days she cries every half hour. and some nights, like tonight, it’s every ten minutes. i told her to “shut up” for the first time. i got so overwhelmed, i’m sick, and tired and i just told her to shut up. i feel a little bad but also i really do want her to just shut up. she can’t get into any trouble seeing as she can’t get out of bed on her own and can’t walk without her walker. so would it be so bad if i just ignored her for a while? closed my bedroom door, turned off the baby monitor, and just ignored her for half an hour? my first half an hour of peace at home since last year when she started getting progressively worse at an accelerated pace? she is on 100mg quetiapine. she started at 25 and it worked for two nights, same with 50mg, and now same with 100. but it only works for those two nights. then it’s back to normal. my step dad never comes to see her. only once or twice a month. we almost put her in a memory care facility but then my mom talked him out of it because it might “disturb her routine.” so now my boyfriend and i are stuck with her for god knows how long with no help. her insurance doesn’t even cover a night nurse. i don’t know how much longer i can do this.",,0

"i don't think i've posted here all that often, or really ever, so i'm not sure if it's the right place to post these things, seeing as they might have their own threads somewhere down the line.  originally i was thinking to ask for help with some of the things in here, but i'd rather not pour all of this down strangers' throats right before maybe asking for help, so i'll just ask for help with this one thing that's more recent, and then continue to rant in a way that is very abrupt, for i am editing this afterhand.  **||in short, my aunt with dementia is starting to wear an excessive amount of clothes when she hides in her room toward the later half of the day.  with her being in that room so long, how can we make sure she's not going to suffer in the hot heat of el paso from her odd behavior?||**once again, i must reiterate that the rest of this essentially-an-essay is just for the sake of me ranting; it's purpose purely for it to get my thoughts off of my chest.  if you decided to read at least this far and decide to discuss the one of my question laid above which is the most recent in my family's woes, then i thank you kindly- and to you and everyone else who might read at least this, i give you full permission to leave that reading here or wherever you see fit, as everything lying therein below this is only in the purpose of having it written all-out in the open, to be read or ignored by anyone who sees it.  but mostly, and more specific, i would like to know if anyone else has been having problems with a loved one suffering from dementia that's been wearing five-too-many tops- and how they've handled that troublesome self-harming behavior that is just one of many that loved one suffers from.for context, my aunt who used to live in assisted living is living with me and my family now.  being the eldest of my grandmother's children, she was the favorite child, even though according to my mom, aunt, and uncle, she tormented them their whole childhoods.  apparently, she was diagnosed with something that made her antagonistic around the time *i* was born, so i never saw that side of her up close as her medication made her more mellow than she was before, and i was generally just a quiet kid.  all of that to say that when she does some of her antics around the house which i'm sure many of you are generally familiar with, the rest of my family- who were the ones who had more experience dealing with my *grandmother's* dementia when she was still alive with us- don't really give their sister the same patience they gave their mom, so i'm the only calm head most of the time.  it's kind of fortunate, in very few ways, that all of this started just a month or so before the lockdown, because i'm still around the house even while taking my college classes.  they fight with her from time to time for something or another, but i'm at least around to mediate certain grievances, which i'm glad in doing.as of late she usually stays in her chair in the living room earlier in the day, which was moved so she wouldn't stare at everyone.  apparently she was caught staring at me sometimes while i was asleep on the couch, but i didn't mind on account of my not being conscious, and i figure that's more her headspace being far gone at the time than anything.  but she gets out of my old room late at night a lot now, i've noticed (with me also being awake well into the night for separate matters) (cough procrastinated college homework, rdr2).  she keeps going to the bathroom constantly even in the day too; she doesn't drink much water though, and we think she's just doing it out of habit.  despite that, she's had a few accidents without telling anyone, until my mom changes her diaper when the day ends, though she hasn't had one in a while now.  but when the day ends and that hasn't happened, we find out that she's already dressed herself in seven layers; according to my mom, two bras, three tanktops, a pajama shirt, and a jacket just today.  and all of that while we don't know anything because she's in her room at the end of the day with the door closed every time we open it.sometimes she thinks she's still in an assisted living place.  i'm the only one who goes along with whatever story she gives for the most part, since i've heard that's the best thing to do, i think.  my aunt's apparently a nurse, but at least she's still her sister.  my uncle is some guy who was in 5th grade with her, despite being a handful of years apart.  i guess i'm a patient too? since she keeps asking when i'm getting picked up- but she also asks what happened to the other guy, so i'm not sure if that means i'm a nurse too- and god knows who that mysterious ""other guy"" she allegedly talked to is.  and my mom might still actually be her sister just visiting her; she's a little vague on that, while other times she's the head nurse.  but what's for certain is that my sister's youngest children are the *bane* of her existence; she'll stare at them while holding her ears in apparent pain, and at times yell at them- she doesn't grab them anymore as she'd done before in family gatherings, thank god- but she never just goes to her room when they're here, despite spending most of her day there anyways *and* being told to do so.  that's the only time i really get angry at her, which i'm ashamed for doing so, since deep down i know half of it is just the disease; the other half her being a cranky old woman.  it's only the rare visit when my sister really just needs to spend the day focusing on her grad work when she leaves them here- and yes, we all follow our city's local emergency directive, it's still bellow 10 heads under our roof when they're here.she also sometimes claims she lives with her aunt and cousins though.  they're still alive, thank the lord, but with my great aunt being so old, her being at far greater risk and just not being all there in her head neither, i don't think her visiting them would be so good, despite me thinking that could do her some good to see them.  but she keeps asking where her mom is, which has been bothering everyone at the house.  when she doesn't get an answer, she just figures by herself that she's at church, and i just tell her she very well likely is- and that's the truth, i do believe.  the only times she ever tried to break out were so she could make it back to her aunt's house- a place that isn't where she thinks it is- but thankfully due to our house's layout, my uncle and i's generally permanent seating arrangements, and her usual ones, she can't ever make it to the door before anyone knows she's there.  i don't know how healthy it is to tell her that her mom's at church now though, since even though it's been a while since she tried to leave the door by herself, it's even more dangerous for her to be outside now.i feel like this is becoming more of a rant than anything now though, so i'll end this here.  in short, her frequent visits to the restroom, the lack thereof at times and further lack of asking help, her curious over-the-top wardrobe choices (she even stole one of my shirts i made the mistake of leaving there, though i surrender she wore it better), teenager-like time in her room, irregular sleep schedule that we're doing our best of correcting, and her antagonism towards the children are our real big gripes.  the two women in my family, my aunt and mother, do the lord's work when it comes to changing and bathing her, and my uncle in feeding her and the whole family, but they all have very short patience with that woman, and though my own duties are far smaller around the house in comparison, i'm at my wits end in bringing myself between her and everyone else when she or someone else picks a hill to die on.  i thank you if you've read this far in as it wasn't all that necessary; and if you haven't, i'm just glad to get that off of my chest.",,0
"my father is 69 and was diagnosed with this about, meh, 10 years ago. he probably had signs of this before they found it, however. when this happened to him, every thing went to shit. my dad got sick, my life-long animal friend rocky the cat died, this led to my father being fired / forced into somewhat early retirement. my mother never worked and was a stay at home mother. a few years after this, my radial nerve in my right arm was destroyed by a rather uncommon virus, which took away my function of my right hand (which was the dominant one) from my elbow down. this caused me to lose the ability to do my favorite things, such as use a keyboard and mouse at the same time (i wanted to be an electronic engineer), drive my cars for tuning and racing purposes, because they are all stick shift. i couldn't shoot hoops anymore. this led me down the path of substance abuse, which led to legal issues. i want to start my life on my own, as i'm in my mid twenties, but have already been taken away recently due to things out of my control, and don't want to miss any remaining time my father has out on my own only to lose him shortly and regret not being there. i live with my parents and my girlfriend of three years. my mother is on medication for having a botched back surgery, and is in pain and can't move too well. she is always in a bad mood, having to see her loved one fall apart, and from the daily challenges of having to play ""where's waldo"" with 10000 different objects that my father misplaces every day. each day it's a hunt for a wallet, a flashlight, a can of cat food, whatever. my dad was always the ""cool dad"", never scary. oh, heres 20$, go see a movie and get a meal. mom said no to a sleepover? well i don't see why not. is your girlfriend hungry, too? heres extra for her. lets go get you that new game even if i'm behind on bills. i was always way closer to my dad then my mom. he was always the one on my side. now, he's on no ones side. he never got angry, ever. and now, he's angry all the time. no matter waht you say to him, he gets mad. most times, he just stares off into space while i talk to him. then, when i'm done, i will get a ""hmm"", and then he will walk away. i want to talk to him, but i don't know what about. he taught me most everything i know about computers and electronics as well as cars, which i take great pride in. now, when i talk or ask questions, it feels like hes not even paying attention. where i say a statement or ask a question, i basically get the same response, which is nothing. even things i know he knew, or at least should, he won't. his sense of time is greatly distorted. for example, he loves and basically only eats ice cream. hey dad, do you want strawberry ice cream? yeah sure, that sounds good, i haven't had that in 10 years or so, when in reality we had it last month. we have pet cats that he absolutely loves and adores and spends most of his time with, petting or conversating, if you can call it that. i'm glad he has something that makes him happy but it's almost like they are more his family then me. he will buy phone after phone after phone, because he can't figure them out. he thinks that by getting a new phone, he might find one he can actually use. the issue, however, is that they are all android based, and therefore, almost the same. i'm an adult and need to look out for myself but am in a down time recently and could use a small win somewhere. i've been pining over the new cod since it came out, as i thought if i got myself back into something i loved before i turned to substances, it could help with my overall sobriety and keep my head on straight. in the past, he would surely let me pay him back for it. now, i can't even ask because he can't recall what his finances look like and won't take any chances, which i can't blame him for, because in the grand scheme of things, me getting call of duty isn't going to change anyones life, however, it would go a long way towards making me happy. i just don't know what to do. i have no acceptance of this. i don't want to treat him like i see other sons treat their fathers with this illness, treating them like little children, building lego sets, etc, treating them like a baby. i don't want that kind of relationship with him, and would be faking it to him as well as myself if i tried. i don't know if this is terrible to say or not, but some times i think i'd rather him have something that wasn't so drawn out and character ruining. at least if he went quicker, he'd still be who he was and remember the things he did in his life, such as race cars, fly planes, build communications equipment on war boats, build computers, care for all animals, instruct skydiving, do amateur radio for 40+ years, and so much more. now, he's just...some one else. when i talk to him or see him watching tv, it's like hes not there. it's a constant hunt for lost items every day, which he claims were stolen, when no one has been here. he will say something a long the times of "".....did you hear that xxxxx happened this week?"" three or four times at one sitting for dinner. i don't even know the point of me posting this i just have no one else to talk to. my girlfriend, at least partly, thinks that i am just playing off this situation to try and draw pity and that it's not really that big of a deal, or at least that's how i feel. i never see eye to eye with my mother, we butt heads at every opportunity for a reason i will probably never know. most of my irl friends have grown up, moved on, left, or we just don't talk. some left because of the reputation they heard about me and some legal issues. my online friends who i've gamed with for 20+ years in some cases, aren't very close to me any more. some stopped gaming, others swapped games to ones i don't own or can't afford. some grew up, went to school, got married, and are gone. most of my online buddies treated me better then my irl friends. they would come to visit, take me on a vacation, come stay a week here or there, gift me a game so i could continue to play with the group, treated me very well. but they are all basically gone. i don't do social media of any sort so i don't have a way to find people / have people find me, and after losing / switching phones last year, lost the only gateway people had to find me. i enjoy playing league of legends with my male cousin whos a few years younger, as he doesn't judge me and knows most of what i've gone through, but became a full pharmacist and has seen his free time / time to game almost completely diminish. i love sports, but uh, yeah. cleveland. no lebron anymore. rats. i know i'm not any different then any other child of a parent with this illness, but i just hate change so damn much it makes me sick. i literally feel like i wasn't supposed to be born at the time i was, that i was meant for something else. i just can't wrap my motivation (what small amounts their is) around getting an underpaying job, struggling to afford anything i want/ need, having no free time, and then coming home to a depression factory. i don't want to do it, and don't even think i can. so once again i don't know what i hope to get out of this, but, at the very least, thanks for reading. afternoon all.",,0
"let's deal with the realities of observing dying - the hard reality...my mother who has end stage dementia and probably had a stroke, has stopped eating. she is unconscious.she has now had her first dose of iv hydromorphone, administered by a 'butterfly' in her left shoulder so no additional injections require pricking of the skin. the nurse tells who administered it tells me that it is cold going in (the butterfly or the fluid?) and she reacted with a wince. apparently it took about ten minutes for any effect. the dosage is 'very low': 0.13 mg, and it can be repeated every two hours if needed. judgement calls by the nurse although i can ask for it presumably.her breathing is oral (very little nasal), a lot of heavy breathing and snoring - much worse than her normal. she occasionally raises her arms high. sometimes i clasp my hands in hers when she does so. periodically she burps or  shakes her legs.because she must have a  very dry mouth i asked for one of those foam lolipops that my dying father (lewy's body dementia, shriveled up in a ball in his bed shaking as a shrunken man) was given in his last days. 'we haven't used those for a long time'. she recommended that my idea of moistening my finger with gelled water would be safer.  her tongue is extremely rough, as if severely blistered. she accepted the gel, still unconscious.i also tried using chips of ice and holding them at her mouth and letting the water drip extremely slowly down her throat. but i dropped one and figured this was too risky for aspiration (choking).i asked the mature nurse with 22 years of experience how long this lasts and she said that without food 2-3 weeks, without water 2-3 days. then i realized that i could be instrumental in killing my mother. not something i welcome.looking up online the subject of end stage dementia hydration i found...[it reads that dehydration is not painful and hydrating (even by iv) can be dangerous and cause suffering. i asked a care aide about somehow hydrating my mother by iv. she told me i would have to talk to the nurse practitioner during office hours (there are so few physicians in the people's republic of canada that we have taken substitutes in nursing homes). i have to be brave and witness her suffering and sit with her throughout this prolonged last gasp of life. i have to not flinch from witnessing death, straight in face. the other day i imagined the yamadhutas (angels of death) approaching and at another time i felt a huge hole in my physical body as if her dying would leave me not whole. i do no mean emotionally. i mean literally. i do not believe in any of this supernatural stuff, but this is what i experienced in my involuntary imagination.",,0
"hi everyone.my mum doesn't suffer from alzheimers but is struggling with short term memory loss that is getting worse. it leaves her stranded constantly throughout the day wondering what she was in the middle of doing. i hope it's ok to post this here, as i can't find another community that could advise.we want to try using a voice recorder so she can record quick and short sound bites to remind her what she's about to do (e.g. going to the kitchen to get a glass of water) so that she can record a tiny soundbite at the beginning of the mission. it'd need to be super simple, intuitive and practical. just enough buttons to record, play back and skip to the prev/next memo. no bells no whistles.there are plenty online but i figured i should ask you guys for your opinions and ideas: are any that you'd recommend? i don't see many products specifically designed for memory loss, is there a reason why this isn't as practical as i'm imagining for cases like these? we've tried phone apps and physical notepads, neither of which work (she's slow on the phone, and writing on a notepad is equally cumbersome), so this is the only other solution we can think of for her particular circumstances.thanks!",,0
"hey guys, my mom has had a declining memory for the past couple years, and she’s had difficulty with remembering names of close family. last week she walked out of the house that she shares with my dad, and he had no idea where she went. to our relief she was at the hospital, either by way of good samaritan or ambulance, but safe nonetheless.the past few months he has been trying to get a neurologist to read her cat scans that have been performed, but the closest appointment they can get is august.the morning of the excursion she didn’t realize she was home, and was having trouble thinking of my dads name. since then (when she’s woke up/isn’t tired) she doesn’t have issues with that. anyways, what i am trying to gauge if anyone here has had similar experiences, and how long she has at this point. i know with this disease victory looks different than others, but she is 55. any thoughts?",,0
"my grandma has dementia (vascular specifically i think), and while she’s not in the later stages yet, she’s getting there. just a heads up, i’m sorry if i seem to be a bit blunt talking about this sort of stuff, it’s been a constant factor in my life one way or another so i never really got to learn how learning somebody you love has dementia and having to come to term with it. for me, that was just how some relative were.moving onto what i need some advice for, my grandma loves to sew (she learnt how at like 5 and it was her constant hobby), and would do it a bunch when i was younger (i’m currently in my late teens). when i say a bunch, i mean she’d make boxes upon boxes of finished american girl doll outfits, including multiple layers, working pockets, themes, and just generally some of the best sewing i’ve seen to this day. she’d go to craft shows, usually the kind organized by the local facebook mom group, filled with old grandmas and their reluctant husbands. that sort of stuff. the earliest memories of it i can scrounge up had her as the most social and kind person, who genuinely loved to see and sell her creations.the issue is, as she’s gotten worse, she hasn’t been able to do this anymore. we’ve found boxes of fabric, cut and ready to be sewn, that she forgets about. it’s a loop, she’ll want to make doll clothes, but once she’s cut out the fabrics, she puts them away and forgets, then repeats that. plus, i’m not entirely sure if she can still sew at the level she used to be able to, so i don’t know if she just can’t make all those doll clothes anymore.all of this is just a long lead up (and also a bit of a vent since my family doesn’t much like to talk about my grandmas dementia, like at all, which is a different issue entirely) to the actual question. would it be good if i offered to help her start sewing and selling doll clothes again? it seems like a good idea on the surface, doing something she enjoyed in the past that she can’t do alone now, but i know it’s not that simple. sometimes doing things like that can stress out people with dementia, and i’m not entirely sure if this would or wouldn’t. she seems to enjoy telling me about and showing me her doll clothes (she has some she never sold, because when i say she made a lot, i mean it), but also the stress of something like this could just upset her more. sorry about the essay, i just want to put as much as i can so it’s more clear on if i should/shouldn’ttl;drneed advice on if it’s a good idea to help my grandma with dementia start sewing again, or if it’ll just cause her more stress",,0
"it started all of a sudden. my mom passed away on 07.07.2020. her departure had a great impact on my dad as they were together for 42 years. from 2nd half of 2021 (june or july may be) we started observing some abnormalities like some illogical statements and questions(which were very occasional and unnoticable). but from then we noticed his excessive fascination towards sweet foods including ice creams, cakes, chocolates, candies etc. he has diabetes but he started eating candies and ice creams whenever he went out alone. i talked to the local grocery shop who informed me that dad on average takes 5 to 10 ice creams daily. i was very annoyed on him because of this childish behavior because till then i didn't realized that he developed something like dementia or alzheimer's. things kept going like this till this year. last week my dad left home in the midnight and when he got back i asked him why he left home and he couldn't answer me and he was very confused. that time i realized something is wrong with him which needs medical attention. next day i rushed to a neurologist who told me that he has developed dementia and prescribed few medications including donepezil hydrochloride inn 5 mg tab once in the night, quetiapine fumerate 25 mg 2 tabs in the night and ginkgo biloba 60 mg tab twice a day. since we started the meds he started hallucinating throughout the day. after a couple of days i contracted with the with the doc and he told me to discontinue donepezil and continue the rest. but till today there is no progress and his deteriorating each day. i'm really confused whether this is because of the meds prescribed or his progressing so fast. is it really possible to deteriorate within a week??i have done extensive research for lost couple of days and discovered alzheimer's is also termed as type 3 diabetes which leads to excessive fascination towards sweet foods because of some chemical imbalance in the brain. my doctor didn't tell me anything like this. later i came across some researches which shows nasal insulin helps  alzheimer's patients to some extent. i really want to try that out. anyone ever tried nasal insulin for alzheimer's  or dementia?? i know it is not conclusive or approved yet, but i cannot see my dad suffering without any medical care.",,0

my 85 yr mother has vascular dementia and fell in her room at 5:30am at the nursing home. she was rushing to get to the bathroom and didn’t have a firm handle on her walker and fell. she takes herbal laxatives (that she refuses to give over) and we think she took too much which made her need to rush to go to the bathroom.nurses found her shortly after with large bowel movement on the floor. 🥴 ambulance took her 2 hrs later to hospital (don’t know why the delay) and she amazingly didn’t break or fracture any bones.she has had a descendant abdomen and bowel for a long time gp put it down to fluid retention. the hospital investigated further and found no bowel obstruction but she has a colonic pseudo-obstruction without a mechanical obstruction (so nothing blocking her bowels just severely constipated hence the descended bowel and belly. enema every 2 days worked magic but still very large tummy. she is usually a very angry person but she sounded extra mad and was hitting the nurses and refusing her meds. she also became incontinent in hospital.she developed a fever on her last couple days and it was uti. they have antibiotics via iv.shes back at the home very agitated angry etc trying to pull the cannula out. she’s also continued being incontinent and wearing pads for the first time. shes also speaking only in her native language no english (it was very basic english before but still there)she oddly remembered her mobile and wanted it charged (she has one friend she calls 4 times a day to whinge moan about everyone and oddly this person listens cos i think she loves drama and how nuts my mother can sound. what has happened? i know hospital is never a good place for a dementia patient but has anyone seen such a decline after a hospital stay?they thought she has some delirium but couldn’t be sure. she’s had paranoia delusions for years so it’s little hard to know.,,0
"hi everyone, i just sought out this subreddit tonight for the first time, so please forgive me if i shouldn’t be posting here. this post concerns my mother. she does not have an official diagnosis of dementia or alzheimer’s. i’ve been reading the other threads on here about what some of you are going through as caregivers for your family or loved ones and my heart goes out to you all.my mother (77yo) is currently in the hospital for the past ten days with symptoms related to her heart and a uti. she has been very confused, disoriented and agitated in the hospital. her doctor referred to her behavior as “sundowning,” but i’ve only ever heard this term used to refer to alzheimer’s and dementia. she’s been in the hospital for so long, and medically speaking she could already have been discharged, since she completed a round of antibiotics and her heart is now stable. however, they’re still struggling to stabilize her moods and behavior. i guess i’m wondering: is my mother on her way to being diagnosed with alzheimer’s or dementia?",,0

"i don’t see him much but i’m not sure how i would answer a certain question if he asks me instead of my grandmother (his caretaker). i know at times it’s best to go along with what they believe even if it’s wrong but i’m kinda stuck here. so a bit of where he’s at in terms of his condition; he used to love to go hunting, especially for deer. during our family lunch for christmas he pointed to the taxidermy deer heads on our wall and told my father he had never seen anything like that and asked what it was. he didn’t address us by name and we had to ask our grandmother what he liked to drink because he looked confused when we asked. he doesn’t talk much mainly because he’s so lost he can’t hold a conversation. a few months ago when he’d finally recognize me, he’d tell me the same, and probably only story he could remember from when i was little 5 or 6 times in one visit, but he has forgotten that now. so onto my point, i’m not sure what to tell him if he asks my name. i recently came out as trans and go by a different name that’s not even close to my name at birth, and different pronouns. obviously everyone looks different as they age but my appearance has changed drastically. now, i don’t know what my grandmother tells him if he does ask her in private (i could care less what she says, i’m not the type to be offended easily, especially with something like that). he does get embarrassed about it and usually doesn’t ask who we are until after we leave but there has been times where he’s asked “you’re ___ right?” i know he will just forget before the visit is over if he asks and someone tells him. but if he asks me i’m not sure what to say because at this stage i don’t think he’ll remember me any ways but i don’t want to put extra stress on him as it’s getting worse.",,0
"i hope it’s okay that i post this here- my mom (70) was recently diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. she will soon see a neuropsychologist which i am glad for because mci seems possibly...well, too “mild” a description for what she’s been going through. what i wanted to discuss here in this sub though, is helping her to manage her digital life. she does not (and does not want to) use a smart phone or tablet, but does have a laptop. she primarily uses it for: gmail, facebook, viewing her bank account, viewing my dad’s calendar and reading the news. using the laptop is part of her everyday life. a couple of things she has been having trouble with include passwords (she writes them in a physical notebook but it has become too messy to understand), easily understanding the calendar, contributing money to a political campaign without realizing it was set up to charge her each month and not being able to distinguish what’s a reliable website. i’m thinking a password manager may help her, but i think someone other than her might also need to know the main password. also, i wish there was some type of plug in for her browser that would tell her things like, “you are on a political website” or “you are leaving facebook.” sometimes she will click on ads or other links on facebook and not realize she is no longer on facebook. i haven’t actually used fbook in several years, so all i know is that i see her click on ads that look very real and all of the sudden she’s on some website called viral spell- and she is literally under its spell. i suppose that itself is not harmful per se, but it seems like she is having a harder and harder time distinguishing whether something is fake. i worry about her being scammed. another thing i would love is to figure out how to push out an agenda to her printer each day. one of the things that she gets very frustrated by is that she can’t read a calendar very well and make connections with the dates and the current date. so it would be nice to have a daily print out with what’s going on today and anything coming up in the next week at the bottom. anyway, do you have any strategies? i want my mom to be able to maintain her “online” life relatively independently for as long as possible.",,0
"my mom has early onset alz.  i moved her into a memory care unit in april and the transition hasn't been awesome.  she is pretty far advanced that she can't care for her self and needs constant supervision because she's not safe on her own.  but she is still with it enough to know she doesn't want to be where she is, but wants to be home.  i used to get her every other day and take her to my house to walk her dog (which i took over care for when she had to move from her home) and eat dinner.  i've since become pregnant and am sick most of the time, so the visits have been scaled back to about once or twice a week.  the visits at my house aren't great.  she says she enjoys them, but literally the entire time she beds and pleads with me to take her to her house (which even if she was safe on her own is physically impossible bc the house has been foreclosed on) or to drop her off at her old neighbor's house so she can stay with them.  the visits are emotionally draining, but i was still trying to make her happy. the last few times i've taken her out, she's started refusing to go back to memory care and getting her back there is an emotional and physical struggle.  the last few times, i've just visited her in the memory care unit.  the whole time i'm there she fixates on me taking her out of there so she can go to my house and then walk to her house from mine.  she swears it's not a long walk, just across the street, when in reality, it's over an hour long drive.  i don't even try to reason or argue with her because i know it's pointless, but when i tell her no i can't take her out of there anymore, she whines that i'm horrible and being mean to her.  after about an hour into each visit, she's just been getting up, grabbing her purse (and suitcase she has packed bc she swears she's going home or moving into my home) and stands by the elevator, waiting for me to get it open so we can leave.  she gets so riled up about it, that i've had to leave without saying good bye and sneak out using the stairs to leave. i feel so bad sneaking out but i don't know how else to leave.  i don't know how else to handle the visits now either.  i think it is traumatic for her me visiting and not taking her to her home like she begs me to, but i also can't handle physically forcing her back to memory care anymore because that's not an easier on her than me just sneaking out and refusing to take her.any insight on how to handle it, i'm at a loss.",,0
"i have read up on both trying to figure out what my father has. they both kind of describe what he's going through.what i have noticed my father is going through right now1. short term memory. having to repeat the same answer to him 4-6 times in about 10-15 min.2. attached to material things. he is not known to have a love for material things. he always had his tools and whatnot, but now he will grab things out of the trash my mom has thrown away and store it in his garage. things like a broken lamp or a chipped plate.3. nervous and/or anxious.  i recently had a yard sale at my parents place. all the items were mine that i needed to get rid of and i had a sale at her place for traffic reasons. my dad would walk around and watch people like a hawk as if they were going to steel his stuff. he seemed nervous and anxious.4. anger. the leftover yard sale items i gave away for free. a guy contacted me and wanted to pick the stuff up. i gave him the address and had him call my mom to let her know when he will be there. my mom told my dad and he got angry about it. he rushed outside to go through the stuff and take what he wanted. then when the guy showed up my dad stood there with his arms crossed, looking at him in a angry way.my mom offered the guy to use my dads dolly and my dad said ""no"" (this is not my dad, he has always been a giver, not a taker)i had to go over there to make sure everything went smoothly. when i got there my dad said ""i would have kept this stuff, why would you give it away"" i explained to him that i need to get rid of it and they are selling their place and can't have this stuff sitting around. he looked at me with such anger and stormed off while kicking stuff around. two days later, he either forgot or got over it.5. he's losing weight, looking older every time i see him. the only thing he will eat is deserts. sweets and sugar.6. he's easily distracted. he's asked to do something and then he gets distracted and does something else. what does he have? what stage is he at?how much time do i have left with him?on another note, my dad is a hard worker, he's always working outside in his yard (2 acres) recently it's only been picking up sticks for some reason. his mower broke and he was out mowing his lawn with a weed eater. if you offer to help he gets mad and offended. he doesn't like being treated like a child.help me understand him better!!",,0
"my mom is in her late 80s and is on the cusp of dementia (can live independently, but has forgotten things she once knew at an expert level, has mood swings, etc.). she has been living in a really nice retirement community for the last three months and it was her own choice to do so.  once every couple of weeks she decides she wants to go back to her house (which has been on the market for a bit and is virtually empty)or she starts feeling sorry for herself (today it was “i’ve lost everything”- untrue, as most of her nice things were moved in with her).  i sometimes go to “now, mom, we’re not going to go there” and get accused of being not loving.   my dh &amp; i sold our house, moved in with her and i even took early retirement so we could handle her affairs after my dad died.  if i get my brother to call and check in on her, she’s all chipper and happy.  db is angry and sad that mom decided rather suddenly to move to this place, but he offers no solutions, as he was content to leave me to deal with the day-to-day stuff.  he only is present for the crisis stuff and leaves as quickly as he can.  my dads cousin is around and has done a lot for her, including finding her apartment and handling the house sale, so i’m not totally alone in this.  but i am the recipient of her moodiness and self pity.i don’t know how to respond to this—she does depend on me for a lot of things, and i don’t really want to leave her to her own devices, but i also don’t want to have a guilt trip laid on me when my dh and i have done quite a bit for her.",,0
"my grandma is obsessed with having a phone but she is no longer able to operate one. she’s started hearing bells/ringing so she’ll think the phone is ringing when it isn’t or if someone doesn’t answer when she calls she assumes the phone is broken. this leads to her eventually unplugging and throwing the phone away in terrible frustration. then she asks for another, a “regular phone,” i try to divert and pacify, she insists for weeks and weeks, i get another phone, we repeat. she has gone through a total of 7 phones in the last 2ish years, 3 of them in the last 6 months. she is obsessed though and every time i see her, becomes very agitated about not having a phone, insisting i told her i would bring one, etc. i’ve tried putting it off but her memory, especially when it comes to this, is “unfortunately” not bad enough. i once tried explaining, very gently, what’s happened before and confronted with the possibility it could maybe be some error on her part, she became incredibly defensive and angry so i immediately changed the subject to get her to calm down. we had a compromise for awhile-my grandpa has a cell phone that he always has on him. we’ve made sure everyone has that number and told grandma she has full access to it. this worked for a few weeks but we’re now back to her needing a phone, insisting the phone company has to come install this new phone and it has to happen right now. is there an answer?",,0
"my family is currently managing my mother's early dementia. i wanted to give a bit of a heads up to anyone suspecting a loved one might be slipping away about the timetables associated with procuring medical professional help. chicagoland timelines listed here; your mileage may vary.when we attended a regular doctor's visit with mom back in december, that doctor quickly ordered a battery of standard physical tests, a ct scan, and a neurologist appointment for the memory issues. the ct scan happened within weeks while the neurologist was booked about seven weeks out. it seems like these steps are to rule out a physical reason (stroke, tumor, etc.) for the memory deterioration.next step for us is the memory test requested by the neurologist. unfortunately, they are booked until late may. the non-diagnosis will continue to drag on until then. hopefully closure awaits so real help can begin.i guess what i am trying to say is: if you see the warning signs, get started down the road as soon as possible. these specialists are in demand and the schedules can be challenging. the earlier you get started down the road to a diagnosis, the better. i feel like mom might listen to the professionals instead of waving me off and saying ""i just have a bad memory"".my best to all fighting the good fight.",,0

"ventdad is 93, parkinsons, dementia, had a stroke 2 years ago and is a narcissist. he walks mostly w/ a walker and has at times bad tremors. he at times has choking when he eats and hes on sleep meds. he hates going to the doctor and tries to think he has no issues. they have been thru several parkinsons meds and they either didnt help or the one that did gave him nightmares.  his concept of is tremors is that he will just take a pill and they will go away.  six weeks ago she gave him a patch to try. on 1mg for a week he seemed visibly stronger and didnt use his walker. he then went to the 3mg patch. at the same time he tried drinking a coke with dinner as the carbonation could help ease his swallowing. for the next few nights he had a coke w/ dinner and he tried the 3mg patch and he had sleep issues. so we stoped the coke and he took the patch off that night and he slept. instead of trying it again he was convinced the caffeiene from the coke had no effect and he threw the patches away. i suggested he go back to the 1mg patch and he got mad and argued rather vehemently that she never gave him a 1mg patch. thats his dementia. his narcissism means he will argue that version of reality til he dies. he has to know and decide everything and he knows better than anyone. i suggested he call and get a msg to her and he refusedff to his appt todaywhere he told her that he put a patch on at 9am when he got up, started to feel bad, it got worse during the day until he finally removed the patch, very different story to what he told me. he then apologised for not calling to tell her what happened....and  that he had tried the 1, 2, 3mg patches. she never gave him a 2mg patch. once again his narcissism dooms him. he just has to feel superior. yet again anytime i try and offer something to help or clear up a misconception he immediately refuses it because it was from me. im at the point where im just going to be the chaffeur.  the sad thing to me is that he has made a series of poor decisions from his stroke over two years ago.  he also has no judgment when it comes to money.  im just extremely frustrated because i cant seem to get thru to him and i cant fix it when it all goes to hell.",,0
"i need advice from somebody else who has dealt with this.so, my mother (60yrs) has alzheimer's and lewy body dementia. being early onset and having two types, it's fairly aggressive and she's quickly losing her mobility- which leads to the problem. my mother lives in a two story house and her bedroom is on the top storey. her partner has become her full time carer who helps her up and down the stairs, but it's only a matter of time before she tries the stairs herself and hurts herself. so, at some point soon in the future me and my sister (both with enduring power of attorney) will need to solve this two storey issue. but that means either moving her, or finding some way of building a bedroom downstairs and fitting a shower.**anxiety**my mum suffers from extreme anxiety. she was always anxious, but having dementia, especially the lewy body's means that almost anything (or nothing for that matter) can send her into a panic. so, any change in circumstance ***will*** really impact her. **to move her:**the case for moving her is pretty strong. it's only a matter of time before we have to, but while she's in her old house, he at least has something to hold onto. my sister and i are seriously worried that moving her out of her house while she's still aware could irreparably break her. without the familiarity of location we're genuinely worried about setting her into a spiral of anxiety that she won't recover from. the other consideration is that her partner is her primary carer, so we need to consider him too.**to change the house:**apart from the expense, (which would be considerable; both to the house price and to implement), we're worried about creating a situation where she won't feel comfortable having people around anymore. my parents split when we were young and mum built a life by herself - so she's very proud of our house. having a bed downstairs changes it from our house into a 'dementia house' in her eyes. we're seriously worried about the impact of that, especially around socialisation. that said, the cost is also a problem. mum was diagnosed three years ago, which gives her between two and five years or maybe even longer for her types of dementia. so we just need to make sure we can make the money last comfortably as well. **so, any advice from someone who's been in this position?**what did you do? any lessons you wish you'd learned sooner? any advice? i'm worried that no matter what we do, we could lose her to anxiety for good.",,0

"hi,4 month ago i (a 28 year old man) agreed to move in with my mum, nana and grandad, the latter who has dementia.the initial idea was for my mother and grandparents to sell their houses and buy one house where my mother could support my grandparents. before the deals closed i because single and decided to move back with my mum to save money for a house deposit (i have previously rented with my now ex partner).the new idea would be for me to save, and help look after grandad on weekends. after moving in we discovered my nana had been covering up how server his dementia had become.in the subsequent weeks, i began to be the focus of my grandads mood swings. before the disease i have always been very close with my grandparents and we have no bad blood or personal issues. the disease however seems to have altered his mind and now he has aggressive mood swings where he tells me he hates me, that i’m evil and i ruined his life. i can see in his eyes that at that very moment, he truly believes he hates me.i keep being told that “it’s not him, it’s the illness” but truth be told i am beginning to resent him. i am more and more becoming recluse from the family because i fear my presence will trigger him and i don’t want him to go through the pain.has anyone got any advise or experienced this kind of situation?",,0

"tonight i was contacted by my aunty saying my grandmother was not doing well. the care home my gran lives in have started ‘end of life care’ as she is now deteriorating (can no longer walk, stopped eating, her breast cancer has spread to her bones etc.) tomorrow i am visiting her as they think we should see her soon if we want to see her before she dies (which i do). due to a lot of family issues that i don’t think i know the extent of, i did not get to see some of my family for a long time and didn’t know about my grandmas dementia, since being able to see her again she no longer remembers/recognises me. when i saw her earlier this year she again didn’t recognise me which i had expected but found more difficult than i thought i would. to cut a long story short i was just sort of looking for advice on how to say a more than likely final goodbye to her and say the things i feel i need to tell her (like that i’m sorry and i love her etc.) when she has no idea who i am. i’m terrified of distressing her, and will likely be the only person visiting with her to say goodbye.sorry if this was too long or at all confusing, my heads a bit of a mess rn aha.(oh also i’m 17 for context and have never been to see her in the actual home only outside of it, if that is at all relevant)",,0
"i have a really hard time remembering things and learning stuff is very difficult these days, if i can learn anything at all. i'm always struggling to remember words that i want to use when i am speaking to someone. i have a hard time critical thinking. i also forget things that happened a few days ago, and if i do it's very fuzzy and super vague. following a recipe for something is very hard now. overall, i just feel very, very dumb. almost like i'm in a constant state of confusion. or a deep, deep brain fog. this leads me to believe i have some early signs of dementia or mild cognitive impairment.however, everything that i experience is completely dull. to the point where nothing stands out. words, sentences, definitions of things. i don't really experience any good emotions, or pleasure. i can't appreciate art or beautiful scenery anymore. i feel nothing. reading through things and retaining anything is extremely hard. it's like i'm reading it but i'm not actually experiencing it. so i'm wondering if the reason why i have poor memory problems these days and trouble learning things is because i am so completely numb and depressed that nothing stands out enough for me to register it. or, am i experiencing an early stage of dementia?also, i seemed to take a big hit to my mental acuity and started to experience this dull haze 1.5 years ago after experimenting with marijuana to treat my depression (haven't used it since). not sure if that helps.",,0

"i’ve posted in this subreddit a few times recently and i wanted to get everyone’s thoughts on this. in my last post, i talked about how i had to call the cops on my grandmother for becoming so enraged that she threatened to kill my grandfather , herself and also got physical with my mother and my grandfather while almost getting physical with me.  &amp;nbsp;  cut to recent days. i usually visit my grandparents once a week with my son and wife because she loves my son like it was her own( he’s 3 for info purposes ). during the visit, she randomly gets up and heads outside in the 100 degree heat and begins cleaning rugs. my grandfather then go silent and my wife and i noticed something wasn’t right so we decided to leave. when we are about to leave my son begins to freak out because he never leaves their house without them saying goodbye at our car itself all while him and them would wave back and forth. so, i go back to the front door and see if i can get my grandparents to come outside. i ring the doorbell, no one comes to the door. i call both of their cellphones, and no answer. i decide to go around to the gate in the back to see if they are there and i see my grandmother. i ask her if she could come wave to my son and she yells to get my grandfather to do it. i just say, i’ll talk to her later. we then leave because my grandfather has not been responding and my grandmother would never be there when my son wanted her to be.  she called me later that night late to apologize saying an excuse that she just had to finish cleaning the rugs. again, i would believe this if this was her usual way of doing things and it wasn’t also super hot outside. but alas, she lied for some reason and just withheld that she was having an episode of rage. i forgave her saying that the rugs needed to be cleaned, i understand.  &amp;nbsp;  cut to today (just another day later). my grandfather sends my uncles, mom and myself a long text about supporting my grandmother. texting is not something he likes to do; and hates groups texts even more. so it was clearly obvious that my grandmother was having another episode of rage and he did it to make her happy. his text was along the lines that he was the bad person, not my grandmother and we should support her and not him. i am out with my son and wife so i don’t call right away because i was afraid she would be in a rage and my son would hear it. so, i waited until tonight to facetime her like i did every night so she could say goodnight to my son. she doesn’t answer, so i call my grandfather, he doesn’t answer so i call their home phone. my grandmother answers and she sounds pissed in her tone when she says hello. i say hello and ask how she’s doing since she didn’t answer her facetime call (something she never misses). and she tells me she’s not fine and that she hasn’t been fine since the night i called the cops on her and put her in the hospital; though she says it was jail because they put her in the psych ward where she couldn’t do a thing on her own and wasn’t allowed to have any possessions. she then hangs up on me.   &amp;nbsp;  here’s where i am at: the night i called the cops on her, i grieved the loss of my grandmother because she was no longer the person i remembered. i still feel it’s no longer the same person except a few times during the day, the rest of the time she’s a rage monster. i have my 3 year old son and a very pregnant wife who is about to give birth to our new daughter. i want to be there for my grandmother but she is in denial about her rage and my grandfather is enabling her to do whatever she wants rather than getting her true help. with everything i have going on, i’m at the point where though i love her, i no longer want to be in her life. i fear that if i continue, she will lash out with my son, or worse, my newborn…even with my wife and i there with them. she can’t control her anger and she isn’t getting the help she needs. i feel it’s time to finally say goodbye because i don’t know what else to do…i just can’t deal with this emotionally anymore when i have my own family to be there for.  &amp;nbsp;  what does everything thing? should i say goodbye or should i continue the trend of being emotionally drained? i don’t want to do either but i need to do what is right for my families sake.  &amp;nbsp;  tldr: need everyone’s thoughts: i want to cut my grandmother out of my life since she is refusing to get the help she needs and my grandfather just enables her. i have a 3 year old, and my wife is about to give birth to our new daughter. i just can’t emotionally deal with this anymore but i also don’t want to cut out my grandmother",,0

"i've been lurking for a while as i've noticed the problems with my dad starting to show since shortly after his wife died at the end of 2020, so i get that this pops up quite a bit. i suppose i'm just overwhelmed. i shouldn't be, but today i finally went into the doctor so it's...real?in the beginning, i was noticing problems with my dads short term memory from afar(i live quite a distance away, so it's been mostly phone calls until this past week). he'll have a conversation with you, but forget you had it by the afternoon. quick to call someone a liar over it, absolutely no recollection. thought this was weird at first, but he's 80 at this point so...old, ya know?he's becoming racist. whoa is he becoming racist. never used to be, but starting to make little comments on the phone. it's slowly but surely becoming such a problem, that other people are avoiding him. but...he's into some crazy things on facebook at this point, so i'm thinking...stuck at home, no wife, older...cranky old man? the covid conspiracy. not the standard one, but the ""there's messages in this, which point to this obscure movie over here, which means that, which means the vaccine will kill me. by the way, they're listening into my calls with you"". ok, that's nuts. i thought i could walk him through things logically...but i can't. he says i'm not making sense. strange...but...what am i going to do? not a lot you can do if someone goes down deep rabbit holes on the net.by last summer, i'm starting to have to intervene. he's getting scammed by anonymous people calling selling bitcoin. i'm fairly pro-cypto, but this was obviously a simple case of someone just taking the money off his credit card. we contacted the bank, canceled the cards, managed to get a refund(yay!), and now he knows to contact me when he gets those calls. during this time though, i find out the family business isn't paying it's bills. wtf is going on? he's on top of this stuff. i confront him, and he says ""you probably missed this, but i'm under a lot of stress! i wasn't paying any attention to the bills while i was caring for my wife. wtf is wrong with you that you would get on my ass about this? just take care of it."". he's always been...brash...so again, alright...maybe i'm overthinking it.fast forward to last week, when i got here. he has no recollection of being scammed last summer, people are calling me because the bills aren't being paid, i find out he's paying insurance on multiple vehicles he doesn't have anymore and he didn't know, there's more people working for the company than i knew about and he doesn't remember them ever being onboard, a friend of his is posting sticky notes everywhere so he knows where stuff is, i see many multiples of food items because he's forgotten he's already got them when he's out, he's stopping mid conversation and walking away because...mid conversation..he's forgotten he's speaking to you, he can't find words and is getting frustrated, he's lashing out at drivers on the roads, talking to someone that isn't there at night, completely unable to manage his finances because he can't do simple math anymore, and hoooooly his memory is strange. his memory about decades ago is beyond on point. like he's recalling something that happened earlier that day. every detail. he's living in the past when he's talking about it, and can't stop talking about it. short term memory is continuing to decline. today? get to the docs office, get a moca test done. score's 27 out of 30, doc says ""you did great! just because of your age though, i'm going to order a blood test and a ct scan"". strange thing to do if he scored great. i call the doc back and he says it's obvious my father is masking. he see's this often in men like my father, his ego simply will not allow him to admit he needs help and it was a hell of a lot easier than saying there's a problem. sending a nurse over to evaluate things as well cause he's been falling.this post is a lot longer than intended. i feel like i'm still in denial. is this what's happening? memory is going, personality is changing...he insists it's stress. am i wrong? what if i'm not?! where do i even start? i'm moving away soon, and no one else in the family is left to help him. i want him to come with me, but he's so dead set on not. wtf do i do?!",,0
"hi, i’m 29. my dad is late eighties with dementia. my life was just comming together about ten years back when he started having home trouble. i went through a lot as a teenager and should have really moved out at 19-20.i didn’t. i had too much guilt over feeling like my dad could die at any year. i basically past up a lot of opportunities in life because i thought he didn’t have long left. he was going through a lot of health problems at the time. i thought ile wait until he dies.long story short he’s still alive here ten years later. and although i’m so grateful for that. he now has a dementia diagnosis and after reading about it i have realised how much of why i’ve been downward spiralling makes sense. i’ve grieved and continue to grieve the old him. i have anticipatory grief. i’ve been met with failure in every area of my life as my home falling to pieces has affected the whole thing. i don’t really know where i stand with anyone anymore. in some ways i’m really mature and others i have a lot of growing up and catching up to do. but basically now it feels like all the progress i made is at square one. i’ve lost myself. and it feels like i’ve got to start my entire life all over again. and i really don’t have the strength. i’m unemployed, depressed and losing my mind every day.then other days i think how greatful i am to have what i have. i’m so inwardly conflicted i don’t know what to do anymore. i just feel broken.",,0

"so i’ve been a caretaker for a long time for people with dementia and just took on a new client. one thing i really suck at is getting my clients interested in doing the things they really need to—like changing soiled pants or brushing their teeth. i feel bad i often have to ask their primary person who is trying to take a break when i’m there, but it’s like if the wife/husband/family isn’t there to reassure i’m just not very successful at convincing or saying anything that leads to their willingly brushing their teeth.  ive tried different types of requests always with warm affirming tone of voice and never too harsh sounding—like asking “don’t you want to brush your teeth?” or “i bet you’re uncomfortable in those wet undies, let’s get new ones/will you let me help you change them to fresh dry ones?” but i’m just not very successful.  i thought to ask here because maybe some one knows and i’ve known other caregivers over the years who are rather stealthy at getting a person to do something without a huge fuss or involving family. thank you!!!",,0
"**nearly twenty years ago, when i first began studying alzheimer's disease, i began by looking at all the major hypotheses for alzheimer's disease and found out that almost none of them explained every case of the disease.  only one of them--calcium dysregulation--was present in every case of alzheimer's disease.  so when i read this article today it made me reflect back:**# does calcium overload mark dendritic spines for destruction?the work supports the decades-old hypothesis that calcium dysregulation is a driver of neurodegeneration, noted christopher norris of the university of kentucky in lexington. “the present work … is yet another example of just how vital the ‘ca2+ hypothesis’ is after all these years, and further cements the visionary status of its early proponents.”[****there are two sources of excess calcium in the brain.  one is the release of intracellular calcium.  drugs like aricept and anavex 2-73 inhibit this release.  the second which is connected to the first is the influx of extracellular calcium which is usually the results of the over-activation of nmda receptors which is inhibited by namenda.  the first problem decreases with the progression of alzheimer's disease whereas the second increases.  this may be why aricept is only effective for awhile during the early stages of alzheimer's disease whereas namenda is only prescribed during the moderate to late stages of alzheimer's disease.****my second step was trying to figure out what caused calcium dysregulation.  i found that there were many types of receptors (g protein-coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, ionotropic receptors) and many factors that contributed to this problem (high glucose levels, high fructose consumption, pesticides, air pollutants, viruses, bacteria, fungi, amyloid oligomers, misfolded tau proteins to name just a few).  unless only receptor or only one factor caused someone's alzheimer's disease, inhibiting any particular receptor or removing any particular factor was likely to make little difference in terms of the treatment of the disease.****the final step was to figure out what does excessive calcium trigger cause.  calcium dysregulation leads to oxidants (hydrogen peroxide early on and then to peroxynitrite) and neuroinflammation which results in the production of more oxidants.  in addition to triggering neuroinflammation, peroxynitrite leads to a depletion of critical neurotransmitters needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness, inhibits neurotransmissions, inhibits the regeneration of neurons and synapses, causes dna damage, damages tisssue, and results in the death of neurons.  the only way to largely stablize alzheimer's disease is to scavenge peroxynitrite and to partially reverse the damage that it does to the brain.** **here are a couple of charts which help to put the above togethe.   (onoo-) is peroxynitrite.  for critics don't focus on me, focus on the scientists who put this together.**[**[**",,0

"hi everyone,me (21) and my parents (47 &amp; 49) have recently moved in with my grandpa (82) who has dementia, he is my dads dad and we made this decision due to the fact he could no longer live independently and would make frequent phone calls to us, a lot of the time at 3am demanding a ‘hot meal’ despite the time.i am not quite sure what stage he is at and i am wondering if anyone could help give a rough estimate, by using the symptoms i will list below:- appears to have little sense of danger anymore, in december he was wandering a busy road where cars were swerving to avoid hitting him and nobody stopped until one guy did and brought him home (we were not living with grandpa at the time, this was the catalyst)- some level of incontinence, he does not always pee himself, he has awareness of going to the toilet still but he is not perfect in this aspect and will sometimes pee his pants and pee the bed. to my knowledge he has not poo’d himself. - ^ carrying on the above point, one day recently he had poo’d and pee’d all over the bathroom floor and left it there, until my mum discovered it and cleaned it up. this has not happened since.- he has frequent hallucinations and seems to hallucinate the younger version of me a lot, and will make me and my ‘friend’ some food and will be angry at why i do not reply to him - this is not me, this is the hallucination not responding.- he will randomly ask when his dad’s funeral is, or when his wife’s funeral is (his wife passed away 4 years ago, and his dad even longer ago)- has hallucinated seeing my grandma dead in his bed (this was the very first hallucination i believe)- recently forgot where his bedroom was, i had to guide him and show him- has forgotten who my dad was once recently, asking him where he comes from- refers to my dad as his brother sometimes- says sentences that don’t really make sense, ranging from ‘gibberish’ i.e random words in a sentence like randomly referring to someone as a snake or he will say things like ‘i wanna go home’ despite him being at homethat is all of the things i can recall right now, i hope that is enough to give some guidance of what stage he could be at? he was officially diagnosed with dementia in 2021 i believe, however obvious symptoms were showing since 2019. we don’t know how long he could’ve been living with it but concealing, as we only got back in touch with him in 2017 after my grandma passed away. we have supported him ever since.",,0

"i know this group is good for learning of other experiences. so i'd love to know what this might mean. and what your experiences are. my grandma's health history are of what follows:my grandma, has macular degeneration in her eyes. she has been getting treatment for it, which is a needle in the eye full of whatever medication and it's kept her sight going years longer, she would of been completely blind by now.she hit her head on a tile floor 3 years back causing a skull fracture where she went through delirium afterwards due to a massive sodium imbalance. a normal blood sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (meq/l). she hit 111 at one point where 110 you will go into a coma (it was a battle, a tough one that really made things difficult at home, she lives with us and we take care of her). she had dementia before this for many years but after this injury it definitely has sped up in progress. and she has to have sodium medications to keep her levels up for the rest of her life.she also was 91 when she found out she has ciliac disease. which is handled quite well-------now done with all this medical background, and moving forward.my grandma who is 95 now, was rushed to the hospital on  sunday feb 6th with stroke like symptoms. slurred speach, couldn't form a conversation, started talking about herself in third person i think allowed her to talk a bit better. called the ambulance, and one of the police trained medical professionals showed up did some tests, checking the blood levels/etc. what indicated its not a mini stroke (which that's what appeared to be what she was having) is my grandma's automated response to any doctor where she sounds 100% normal, so that means she's still aware of some things going on. (she's like a kid, too afraid to tell the doctor she's not ok, almost like she's scared to be scolded) basically the conversation was this:paramedic: ""how are you feeling?"" gram: ""oh great, i'm just fine, 100%!"" ""no problems?"" ""no, don't know why youre here, i feel wonderful!""""do you know what year it is?""""..... yeah...... um........... september?""""how old are you?""""um..... its a big number................. i don't know....""few minutes later we have now 3 paramedics, two of which are from the ambulance that arrived, so they start conversing about the situation my grandma then want to talk to them, as she's sitting on the couch:gram: ""hey doctor?""paramedic: ""yes?""""i'd like, um, when, like, um, uh, when? ok is it? um..""she couldn't respond to questions that weren't related to how she felt, and she couldn't make sentences on the spot. they took her in, where she did make a recovery at the hospital.they found nothing in cat scans, or anything unusual, sugar levels were somehow normal (she can go through a small bag of sugar in less than a week) her sodium level did drop to 131 (where she can go into a very mild state of delirium however, during delirium episodes she can still form sentences even when it hit a level of 116 so that wasn't it)no sign of a blood clot on the brain etc... she was fine to go home at around 4am. now visiting the eye clinic to get her shots a couple days later, the doctor there said it sounded like she has vesicular dementia. as this did affect her eyesight a bit when it happened(at least i think it did, she wasn't clear and we couldn't understand her). and he told us a lot of patients that are being treated like she is, have had this happen.he explained that this could have been a clot (on the way to the brain) that might of limited the flow of blood to the brain. which in turn leads to the symptoms she had. it can affect various parts the brain, eyes, etc. leading to sentences not being formed, blindness, and made her incapable of making decisions.were still not 100% sure at home what may of happened here, but it does sound like a clot that blocked the passage of blood for a time frame, and she wasn't getting enough to the brain. i know i wrote a lot, but it's for a little bit of an understanding and i'd rather not get things wrong. we are talking to doctors next week about this incident, and from the sounds of things this does happen to people who have vesicular dementia. her conginative ability is i'm estimating a range of 40-30% (doc said 30 last time but i think it's higher at home) right now, it was a drop from 60% in a four month period, but it hasn't decreased or increased from what i can tell so far. at least prior to this happening. has anyone had this happen, where someone with vescular dementia suddenly loses cognitive ability in a small period of time. i know id mention this more to a doctor and will be talking to them about it this week, but really i'd like to know more about this by the experiences of others. like has this happened to a family member? and were they able to come back from it? when this happens could it become permanent? or is it like a cycle of vescular dementia? what have the later stages been like? and what symptoms have you seen towards the end?my family doesn't want surprises, its been very very difficult, if its a cycle, its not like we're not going to call an ambulance based on responses of reddit. but i don't really know what the worst can be. what do we really expect towards the end of her life? so we can kind of mentally prepare too. thanks for any response",,0
"i apologize, this may no longer be the right place for me to post this, but i don't know where else to find a group that may understand what i am feeling.my father started declining when i was in high school, but was not officially diagnosed with lewy body-type dementia until i was 19.  i watched for over a decade as the disease took everything away from him.  i went through all the same heartbreaks i'm sure you all know too well.  a little over a year ago i watched him at his bedside as he passed away.now, i keep finding myself in a rut.  i'm 29 years old, i have a 2 year old daughter and my wife will soon be giving birth to another little girl.  neither of them will ever know their grandfather, and i can't stop myself from worrying that his memory is already gone.  i can barely remember what he was like before his disease.  all i ever wanted was for my girls to know about their family and where they came from, and i feel like all i have to tell them are miserable stories when it comes to their grandfather.  i wish i could clearly remember the man he was when i was a child, but it is all so foggy compared to what i remember of his illness, all i have left are tiny pieces.  not to mention it will be years before my girls are old enough for us to have this conversation.  i don't know what to do, and i'm almost sure there isn't anything i can do.thank you to whoever reads this.  i'm not looking for advice or pity; i know many of you are struggling through the worst of it right now and i wish i could just hug you and tell you i understand.  i just thought i would eventually ""get over it"" and it would get easier.  i still feel so isolated.  i just want to feel normal again.",,0
"i've been doing this for 6-7 years. i'm an only child. i turn 22 this year. all of my previous posts are still up. i also have bad asthma and i'm in college. my dad also lives in the mindset that children,even if they are adults, are their parents property and have no rights. i can't take it anymore.  he is my main source of stress. stress induced asthma attack landed me in the er at four in the morning. i'm now on a high dose of prednisone twice a day to get this under control. he loves to take my mail, order invoices, my homework &amp; study guides(!), medications, etc and hide them in his own stuff until i find it. he's 100% in my business all the time. from where i am to what i'm doing 24/7, and ""can i come home and do xyz errand now?!""he has also lost his drivers license. it was taken by the state. he now ""expects"" me to drive him everywhere.  he also ""expects"" me to wait on him hand and foot like his first wife and mother. more recently he wants me to drive him to an event and stay with him all day. he did not ask like my mom told him to do he said ""i expect you to take me to this!"" i said no because every time he goes to one of these events he ends up drunk. one was the meeting for it last night and he messed up my car really bad physically. i also have finals that week and have to take a final at that same time on the same day across town. the word no just sets him off. did i mention he fell and hit his at this event last year(held twice a year, spring &amp; fall) and i was the one who had to take him to the er? i also have to clean up his messes by doing the responsibilities he him self signed up for-- i.e. paying another businesses utilities w/ their money, and when he's late on the payment i have to drop whatever the hell i'm doing and go pay it. this happened last week, and i ended up being locked out of the test i was taking and failing it. even after i said no and told him it was easter saturday, everything is closed. turns out my mom even straight up told him not to call, he didn't listen because he ""didn't 'feel' like it [my test] was more important ."" direct quote, i asked. he hasn't filed taxes in several years, i can't file a fasfa. he's paying full tilt for those three classes. let alone pay his own bills because i'm doing those as well. more so recently i ended up in the hospital for the first time ever due to a really bad asthma attack which was stress induced.  i was in bad shape and was passing out laying down. in addition to that, i had a an abscessed molar removed a month ago that had been hurting for well over a year. i don't sleep, i'm ""not allowed to sleep."" he wakes me up during the middle of the night. i have dropped all the hobbies i held dear. dance especially so because the head of the studio really got after me for missing so many classes. it's finally happened i've been set on fire. i'm already having to drop college after this semester, since it has become such a big argument trigger with him. like how in the morning i go to leave and he suddenly comes up with a long chore list of the things he needs done. and when i refuse i'm called stupid and incompetent. i have asked for help from my mom, who prefers i deal with it aka leaving me holding the bag. i have asked and begged his doctors, the doctors who gave him the diagnosis, for someone to step in and help. they say i "" need to be more empathetic!"" i can't exactly move out yet because i'm still getting my ducks in a row. i've looked into what little senior resources we are supposed to have in town, they don't exist. but yet, they don't have a problem with calling him abusive. i just don't see a light at the end of of this tunnel. i'm sorry if this is all jumbled and confused. i'm just so exhausted. he has always been an asshole, he's now so seriously inflated that standings  to him only leads to where he lashes out but only on myself and my mom. he has done so in public in front of his doctors. don't even get me started on his porn problem and how he watches it in the same room as me and lists after/thinks of me not as his daughter but a sexual object to please him ""since [my] mother won't do it"" - we'd be here all day. i really wish i could and was making this all up. i've  stopped feeling human. i'm just so tired. i've told him ""figure it out for himself"" to no avail.",,0
"my grandmother just turned 82. physically, she's doing much better than the average 82 year old is doing. she goes to the gym and never learned to drive so takes the bus and walks everywhere. however, my family suspects that mentally, she's not doing so great. my grandfather passed away 20 years ago this year, and she's been living alone in a condo for around 15.  about 12 years ago, she had a depressive episode and stayed with my aunt for a few weeks. she seemed to be out of her mind, and everyone thought she was having a stroke. the doctor said it was high blood pressure mixed with depression. she's been taking medicine ever since.recently, she's been acting a bit more strangely than usual. she calls my aunt to tell her about the problems she has with her downstairs neighbors being too loud. she calls about her door not working. and various other problems. but when we try to remedy them by having her move somewhere else, or checking out her condo or door, there don't actually seem to be any problems. she also has been having angry outbursts that are not characteristic of her at all and behavioral problems when we go to family functions. she's always embellished stories a little bit, but never flat-out told lies like this before. we suspect that there's an onset of dementia as my grandmother has an older sister who has dementia (it's so bad that she doesn't recognize the family anymore and needs constant care from my great uncle). my family is korean, so even if my grandma goes out on a daily basis, she isn't really having much human interaction, as she doesn't know enough english to hold an engaging conversation. she has hardly any stimulation, as she usually just watches tv, cooks, knits, reads books over and over again, reads the korean newspapers we bring her, and then goes out to go to her biweekly swim class. she's been doing this for the past 10 years, and even thinking of myself doing this same routine, i think i would go crazy as well.i think that having someone to talk to would greatly alleviate this (though obviously not fully cure it), but as i said, she only speaks korean. my aunt tries to meet with her when she can, but she's a small business owner and works 7 days a week. my father also tries to meet with her when he can, but he's also extremely busy with work and does all the housework as well, as my mother works even more. my cousins don't really speak enough korean to go visit her often (though we do have family gatherings maybe once a month). and though i speak a little more korean than they do, i was out of state for college and might be leaving for graduate school again in the fall. i also can't speak enough korean to really intellectually stimulate her and can't visit her every day.my family has discussed multiple times moving her into a retirement community. there are even korean ones around the area. however, she doesn't want to move into a community, as she thinks it'll curb her independence, as she is able-bodied to get around by herself. and she also hates socializing with other koreans, so we can't get her to go to korean senior activities clubs or anything like that. edit: oh, and forget about assisted living. she would hate to have someone come to her house. i suggested seeing a counselor, just so she has someone to talk to. however, seeking mental health is still a huge stigma in korea, and she keeps insisting that she's ""not crazy"" so why would she go see a doctor. we're just at a loss for what to do. my dad and aunt are kind of at their wits' end and are getting annoyed at her frequent phone calls. they know that she just wants a conversation, but most of the conversation just is her complaining about some problem that doesn't exist. i had a little more faith in her and was wondering if she was telling the truth and tried to check some things out, but sometimes she tells stories that just completely contradict each other, so i might just be having a hard time accepting the truth that she is mentally slipping. anyways, my dad and aunt, though they've lived in america for a majority of their lives, are pretty korean and also don't really have a good grasp on mental health. they also just have no clue about the resources available to them. i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for what to do in this kind of situation. i know a lot of people have problems trying to get their aging parent or grandparent to get the help that they need, but i feel like there's another layer here because my grandmother is korean and can't really communicate with anyone here besides my aunt and my dad. we haven't really come across many korean doctors in the area, nonetheless korean mental health professionals. i also was wondering if anyone has any tips on helping her keep her brain active while we work on a longer-term solution. i know there are tons of apps out there that are aimed at keeping the mind active, but again, she can't read or speak english, and she also is just completely unfamiliar with technology. we got her a smartphone and set it to korean language so that she might find some books on there or text us if she wants to talk to someone, but even after teaching her multiple times, she can't use it.thank you for listening. any suggestion or even words of encouragement would help.",,0

"i don't know what to do and would like some advice or experiences or...honestly, any help at all would be very welcomed.  sorry for the tl/dr; no matter how much i try to shorten it, this post is still huge.some basic info: me, 55yo, never married, no partner, no kids, no siblings, father and step-father both dead. mom and i live together. 1 aunt, 80yo, lives 5 minutes away but has her own health problems and is available only once in a while. i stopped working in 18 or 19 to take care of mom full time, since she had started calling me in a panic at work to come home, or the tv didn't work, or whatever. i worked at amazon warehouse, for the curious.mom, 87. 1 sister. no friends. nobody but me. mom has had memory/behavioral/dementia-like symptoms since around 2014 or 2015. her doctor has been 100% useless; no matter how many times and in how many ways i'd tell her this is not normal for my mom, she'd say 'it's just normal aging, do puzzles, get exercise"".  no matter how much i begged, pleaded, demanded, or cried, mom would not see a different doctor. nor did she like to take pills \*at all\* (except for tranquilizers, those she takes with gusto). so when her doctor took me seriously for once and gave us samples of a dementia drug to try, mom refused to take the pills saying they were too big. fast forward to this year, feb or march. mom had very bad cold symptoms, her sinus stuffed with pain, runny nose (but no fever or cough).  slowly she stops eating. i'm getting worried, trying to give her ensure shakes, anything i can get in her. she's visibly losing weight, so off we go back to her doctor. doc says ""it's normal to be losing weight when you don't move around much"" and ""she probably had covid."" she mentioned hospice or visiting nurse.  i said we would think about it.her behavior is deteriorating, she is more confused, she stops putting on her housedress and stays in her nightgown. a call to the dr. about these things leads to another mention of hospice. dr. sends a prescription, i get the calls and make an appointment in a few days. surprise! mom starts to eat again. i cancelled the hospice.next time i call the dr., it's because mom is coming upstairs, waking me up 3-4 times a night saying she can't sleep. dr says she cannot prescribe things like benzos or anything to help her sleep  because of the fall risk associated with it and hospice is the way to go since she's lost about 8 pounds in 1 month. again, i engage with hospice. they come for a month. the nurse is very nice although i don't know if she has much experience with dementia patients because she seemed flummoxed for medication and wanted to give her ambien. i kind of hedged about it and mentioned trazodone (mentioned by several frends of mine with family in the same situation). between her, me, and the pharmacy, we get info, plus we discuss tramadol. we work out something with both meds that helps some. the whole time though, mom 100000% hates anyone coming to the house. the nurse came once a week but mom refused anyone else, especially the hha. again, my begging, pleading, yelling, and crying have no effect. i took her off hospice after a month because the stress of struggling with her all the time was killing me.  her doctor insists on seeing mom every 3 months because she's now on xanax (prn), trazodone (1 qhs), and tramadol (1 if she wakes up at night), and the last time we saw the dr she was adamant that she really should not be prescribing these things because they're hospice meds. she tried to give mom a talking to about letting hospice in to take care of her, and it kind of turned into a frustrated shouting match between me and the dr taking turns yelling at each other and mom. it was kind of a clusterfuck tbh.the last week or so i believe she is becoming incontinent. her confusion, especially in the morning, is getting worse and i'm starting to worry again. sometimes she doesn't know how to go to the bathroom or where it is..sometimes she's ok. a lot of the time i have to sit with her at night until she falls asleep. she's becoming childlike especially at night. the bathroom and sleep seem to be her biggest stressors.  after discussing with her several times (mom forgets everything in about 30 seconds) she finally agreed to see my doctor, who takes her time, is very thorough, and whom i love.surprise! a letter came in the mail saturday that my doctor is no longer practicing here and has 'moved on' to another position. fml.so! after all that huge post, here is my question:\- do i engage with dr. ugh and try to get mom back on hospice? she is steady at 108lbs right now, same as when hospice left, so i don't know if it's useless to even bother since she hasn't lost any more weight. the hospice website does say a reason for them to approve is ""needs assistance with some activities of daily living: (eating, bathing, getting dressed, walking, getting out of bed)"", mom refuses to wash or bathe and never gets dressed, but she had these problems before, too, and the nurse said weight loss had to be the reason for hospice.\-or-\- do i call a doctor who specializes in geriatrics, see if i can get an appointment some time this year, then if i do, exhaust the both of us to try to get her dressed and out of the house, to maybe find something to help her ( and me) sleep, and try and get her calm and more stable mentally? i'm alone, i don't know what to do. i asked my cousin who is a sensible sort and she said she'd take mom to my doctor. now that my doctor's no longer in the picture...is it wise to take her to a stranger neither me nor mom have been to before? any advice is greatly appreciated 🙏  i'm at my wit's end.",,0

"background: my mom has frontotemporal dementia. she’s 68 and has had this diagnosis for a year. i (37f) am her primary caregiver. i’m single; she’s single.for at least 2 years she’s struggled with urinary incontinence. around the time of her diagnosis, i convinced her to wear [thinx]( which she likes and help her to feel more secure. however, pee accidents are happening more often now, so she has (reluctantly at first) started wearing poise pads as well. now she’s super into those. but the incessant need to pee is still a big problem (she needed to pee &gt;6 times in a 3-hour drive after the 4th of july). so my sister (who is an np) suggested to mom’s gp that pelvic floor pt might be helpful. we got the referral and went last week. when we were filling out the paperwork, i knew all of the urine-related answers, but i asked my mom for answers regarding bowel movements. she told me she had no issues there. so the physical therapist skipped all that. fast forward to last night. i’m helping my mom get into bed. i go to arrange her pillows the way she likes (she usually can do this herself, but sundowning is becoming a whole thing™️), and she says she doesn’t want me to help. when i ask why, she replies, “i don’t want you to see the poop.”turns out my adult-sized 5yo (i.e. mom) has been sharting the bed (i’m guessing this is the particular situation based on the stains). apparently this has happened several times, but she manages to hide it from her caregivers. so my sister and i think she needs to be wearing underwear in bed. we have told the caregivers. i expect resistance, but what else is new?the big issue here is me, though. this level of incontinence has made me so sad. i feel sunken. i haven’t cried about my mom in a few months, and i’m not crying now. it’s just that it feels like such a huge dip to add poop to this mix of straight up hell. when i learned this information last night, i just felt like i had dropped into a deep hole and couldn’t get out. i’m ok, but i feel the depression creeping back in. (luckily i have a great therapist!)how do y’all deal with this continual grieving? and is there anyone else out there taking care of a younger, single parent as a single person? i just feel really alone. i have wonderful friends, but they don’t get it. and no one in my local ftd support group is in the same situation. i’ve honestly stopped going to those groups because our situations are just too different. if you’re existing like i am, please reach out (if you have the bandwidth). thanks for reading all of this. hugs to all of you! 💜",,0

"hi everyone,  my father,brother, and myself live in a house on my grandpas land, he’s in the house next door. about 10 years ago he was overjoyed to have us, now that he’s in the middle stage of alzheimer’s he’s getting really angry we’re here and keeps telling us he wants to sell the property. he’s decided we moved in without his permission and that were “taking over”. just to clarify moving is not an option, my father just built a new house on the property, and when my grandpa wasn’t sick he wrote my father into the will as the sole beneficiary of everything (my dads an only child and basically the only family my grandpa has). before he got sick this was always the plan, he was overjoyed to have us taking over the property once he passed. this is in texas if it makes a difference.  has anyone dealt with something like this before? we’re headed to the department of aging in texas tomorrow to try to figure out how my dad can take control of my grandpas finances and guardianship over his health. this is purely from the standpoint that we want to take care of him, and we’re worried that soon he’ll need to be put into assisted living, and he’s not ever going to admit he has a problem, so we’re going to need to take matters into our own hands while also insuring we aren’t left out in the cold if he gets angry one day (as he so often does) and sells the property from under us.",,0
"my father lives in a rural place in wyoming.  things that used to be normal are now very confusing to him. i had spoke with his medical provider before his last check up and requested cognitive screening. apparently when they requested to start screening he became angry and combative and walked out of the clinic. i just became aware of this today. the medical clinic told me to pursue medical power of attorney because they believe there is also a problem and that he needs to be screened. without poa he cannot be forced into screening.  they gave me some leads but it seems like a dead end road. i am waiting to hear back from the department family services to see if they have any information that can potentially help him be seen by a medical professional. the medical clinic also stated that i could try calling the adult protective services but warned that getting him deemed incapable of taking care of himself is extremely hard. my verbiage might be off but that’s the gist of it. the really tough part in all this is that i live on the west coast and i am not a resident nor do i frequent wyoming more than twice a year. hopefully i have come to the right place. any help would be greatly appreciated. even if it’s just a link to a similar question posed here before or links to any online resources. thank you, concerned son.",,0

"context: mother, early on set, 63 - severe stage. only child living 2 hours away. father is her carer. &amp;#x200b;\-----how do you deal with it when you live in a different place? i used to video call my dad every day and i would see my mam on the video then. she would know me and smile and blow me loads of kisses on the video. &amp;#x200b;now that she is getting worse we had to stop the video because she wasn't sure who i was and when the call would be over she'd get really angry thinking i was someone like a nurse or doctor or someone checking up on her and she'd be saying to my dad ""no one is coming into this house, that girl isn't coming in here"" and then my poor dad would have to deal with that for a few hours. &amp;#x200b;so, we switched to good old voice calls and she was fine, her speech is bad but she would talk to me a little and know it was me. &amp;#x200b;now in the last week, the voice calls are having the same issue as the video calls again she's confused about who is on the call, she wonders why am i asking how she is or did she have a good day and again shed get really angry when i hang up saying things like before ""that girl isn't coming in here"" and then my poor dad would have to deal with that for a few hours. &amp;#x200b;i don't want to upset her, but i miss my mam so much. i go down every weekend but i am worried that if she doesn't see my face or hear my voice during the week she will forget about me. &amp;#x200b;i can't leave my job. my husband and i have good jobs here and there are very few if any jobs in my hometown of the same salary / level. &amp;#x200b;i dont know what to do.",,0
"a lot of this is venting something that’s been on my mind heavy. any advice or kind words would be appreciated. tl;dr: my grandmothers mental and physical state is worsening, my short fused father is her main caregiver and it’s creating a toxic environment for dad grandma and my brother who lives with them. my dads nearby sister and out of state brother provide little to no help other than financially. my grandmother is 85 and i’ve been told by family that she has dementia. i lived with her my dad and my younger brother until last year, i moved out and they are still with her. she doesn’t speak english and i have a hard time communicating with her past basic conversation. a few years ago she started having more memory loss with just like not remembering the day or where she put things or leaving food on the stove. she began taking some medication that gave her angry mood swings (again something that i was told) where she would become very suspicious of us and blaming us for things that were missing. we’ve always had a kind of rocky relationship and i felt that i was getting the worst of it, one of the last straws being her accusing me of stealing $600 from her. from when i moved out almost a year ago i have noticed that she has become more confused. she started to confuse my dad for my uncle who lives in another state. she went through a period of believing my brother and i had another baby sibling also by my brothers name. she has had a couple of episodes, once standing at the front door and refusing to let my brother leave because she believed he stole her keys. she has now been confusing my dad with my late grandfather. he passed almost 2 years ago and she had refused to speak to him for many years. he was abusive to her and cheated on her  throughout their marriage until he left her. she now has aides that come in about 6 hours a day on the weekdays while my dad is working. a new younger woman came one day when my dad was working from home. grandma had an episode claiming she got home that day and found my dad and the aide having sex on the dining table and called her all kinds of names, claimed they were trying to poison her and screamed outside for help. my father recently eloped with a woman who works in the neighborhood that my grandma has known for years. they came home with lunch and plans for the 3 of them for the day but my grandma said she didn’t know who she was and demanded that she leave. my dad is the middle child and has a sister who is about 30 minutes away and a brother in another state. his sister (my aunt) has started spending the night once a week because my dad has been sleeping on a pull out couch in the living room for when my grandma needs help walking to the bathroom, so she comes once a week to give him a break. grandma also sometimes needs him to help her get dressed after using the bathroom. he says he wakes up 2-3 times every night. he loves to bike and isn’t able to go for rides after work like he used to because he needs to get home for my grandmas aide to leave. he has a short temper in general and him and my grandma would often get into yelling fights, or he would just get angry when she couldn’t find something and insisted she knew where it was. when i visited the day that she threw out his new wife, he was helping her into a chair and she asked me where my dad was. he immediately brought himself closer to her ear and yelled that he was my dad and that he was not her husband. i said she is confused. we had just talked 10 minutes before and she had already forgot. she said she cooked something and would give it to me and my mother before we left (she didn’t cook and my mother wasn’t there). she began asking me what i got for christmas and where i spent it (this was a week ago and we always spend it together) when i was finishing school (i dropped out 3 years ago). he said that he thinks sometimes she is confused but sometimes she knows exactly what she is doing and threw out his wife on purpose to have him alone, that she sometimes needed help getting dressed but other times *somehow* knew how to dress herself. throwing out his new wife seemed to be the last straw and he said it had him considering putting her in a nursing home. i think he is completely worn out and resenting her for everything he has to do. my dad is already not the type of person to be caring for an elderly person. he doesn’t have the patience or a nurturing kind of personality yet he is doing it 6-7 days a week. i think my aunt and uncle need to be doing more to put less responsibility on him. i’m the first person to understand feeling impatient and irritated with her but having the time away makes it infinitely more easy to be patient when i visit her. i would hate to see her be put in a home and i know she would hate it too but i think they all may be better off, including my brother who barely spends time at home to avoid the drama between the two of them. he yells at her and she doesn’t even have the capacity to understand why anymore and it’s been eating at me for the past few days. i want to bring her some kind of activity to do but her hands are also weak so i don’t know what would be good. i don’t know if it’s too much to want my aunt to spend more days there to care for her. any advice would be helpful.",,0
"okay, this will probably be a long one. my friend is 26. his mom is 62. within 1.5 years or so, she went from a fully-functional college professor to near-invalid. some of the things that have happened...- she has zero short-term memory left. she remembers her childhood and whatnot, but her memory is blank for the past 10 years or so.- she frequently digs out old bills and mail and insists that she just got them.- she screams and cries all night, every night. - she sees people who don't exist in the house, and believes that the family is conspiring against her in many different ways.- she will randomly switch to a ""baby talk"" voice in the middle of conversations, and will begin speaking gibberish here and there.- she will take out all of the food in the fridge and scatter it all over the house. friend can no longer keep anything in the fridge.- in her nightly rage fits, she has smashed a tv, numerous appliances, and a glass stovetop, as well as turned the oven on high and stuck wads of old mail in the toaster (but didn't turn it on.) all small appliances and sharp objects have been locked away.friend has two brothers, he's the middle one. dad basically isn't in the picture. neither of the brothers live at home, and never help with care.friend keeps the house via his job and mom's disability checks, but she's becoming increasingly dangerous to herself and the house, and it's more and more of a risk to leave her home alone. she went to the doctor once, got a vague diagnosis of alzheimer's before she threw a fit and they had to leave. it's basically too dangerous to take her in public at this point. she needs round-the-clock supervision and care, and friend is prepared to put her in a home. however, he has no idea how to find out about her insurance situation, etc. we're sure there's no nursing home insurance, her disability definitely won't cover it. what are their options, if any?thanks, everyone.",,0
"so last year the mil got scammed out of something like 20k$. that was actually recovered and there was some kind of investigation. fast forward to now, we live next door and she's been restricted to have no access to financial stuff.  yesterday we're having a nice dinner together and she goes ""oh the us government called me, and asked me to help south america, but i told them no."" when we asked if she gave her social security number she said ""well they have that.""  she talks about one time she had tea with queen elizabeth in the 70's ad nauseam but can't recall what country she's queen of. she frequently rereads, or really just holds, the story ""the unexpected mrs pollifax"", which is a novel about an old woman that's recruited as a spy after society is ready to toss her into a nursing home.  so either she's made this one up in her head (very possible, she also thinks a blind jazz bass player lives up the street), or some disgusting sociopath is calling her and trying to get useful info from her ""uh, we have your ssn as this, is that correct"" (also possible), or the government is starting operation pollifax and wants to send her to honduras (one time i guessed a locker combination on the first try!).  has anyone had experience with this? is lifelock still a think? i was considering getting her incoming call log from the local provider...",,0
"this is a story about my depression, what caused it, and how i am working to conquer it.  bear with me. it's pretty elaborate.  i am posting this in several subreddits so it might feel somewhat broad, but i want to help as many people as i can.i am 30. i started smoking weed when i was 13. it started innocently, like most of us. in today's culture it's pretty difficult not to be a little curious as to what it feels like to be high if you have never done it before. when i started, it wasn't nearly as accepted as it is today, so i could only imagine how the kids feel today.i was expelled from high school my freshman year in only the first week for possession, which pretty much sent my depression into a downward spiral. people think they're fixing the system by ""getting rid"" of the bad kids, by throwing them in alternative school or whatever your county may have, but really all it did was put me in a room full of kids who abused drugs. i was extremely depressed: none of my friends' parents would let them talk to me anymore, my parents were extremely disappointed, and i pretty much squandered every chance of getting into a good school. this lead to suicidal tendencies and a depression that would lead well into my twenties.i had older parents, and my mom was diagnosed with early-onset alzheimer's disease while i was in high school. i was 16. i was really embarrassed by this in a weird way: she would forget my friends' names, she would say really off-the-wall shit, or she would ask us about things that didn't happen or things that happened a long time ago in her childhood. because of this, i didn't let anyone into my house and never had friends over. years later, my psychologist friend helped me understand that ultimately this is because i was trying to protect her, because i didn't want people to think she was stupid or to embarrass her. admittedly, it was a little selfish, too.weed, alcohol, and drugs became my best friends, and i stopped hanging out with the kids that were clearly destined for success, and started hanging out with the ""bad kids"", similar to those from that school i went to, who were abusing drugs and alcohol just like me. if anyone says that weed is not a gateway drug, they're wrong. ultimately my weed use connected me with people who used lsd, xanax, vicodin, oxycontin, percocet, valium, klonopin, cocaine, mushrooms, dmt...pretty much you name it. and i wanted all of it, and in excess. i wanted to be numb.my mom's health continued to deteriorate, and when i was 18 my dad had a heart attack, a stroke, and had an aneurysm on his aorta. i was delivering pizzas at domino's while taking care of him.my older brother and i were forced to put my mother in a nursing home. before she was really sick, she told me that if she ever got a point where she couldn't take care of herself, then i needed to put her in a home. so that's what we did, and it's a decision i still struggle with to this day.this whole time, i was heavily abusing alcohol and drugs. i had developed a painkiller addiction and was taking up to 10 percocets a day, and was hanging on by a thread. i overdosed several times. i was smoking an 8th a day of weed. i was drinking whiskey by the fifth. amazingly, i got straight a's at a local community college while dealing with all of this. i was studying art and loved to draw and just being creative in general. but man...i loved to be messed up.a week before i was going to university, my dad passed away. he was my best friend and is still the person i have been able to connect with the most in life. my family was extremely poor because of all the illness, and the bank repossessed my family's house. at 22, i was homeless, i had a drug addiction, i was an alcoholic, and the only family i had was my brother who was in the navy in japan.i tried to tough it out and do the right thing and go to school anyways like i know he would want me to do. i moved into the dorms at 22 because i had nowhere else to live. i barely left my dorm room, didn't talk to anyone about what i was going through, and was drinking and smoking weed heavily every day. i had a few friends, i guess, but it was only friends that would drink with me. we never talked about what i was going through.the first semester i got all a's, but the second semester i pretty much stopped going. this is probably the lowest point in my life. i failed almost every class. i was forced to drop out, but at the same time, there was a tinge of hope: i played guitar in a band with some friends and it was actually have some success. i met an amazing girl named amber, and things seemed to be on the come-up, at least emotionally.just as things were getting better, i got the phone call that my mom was about to pass away. i went and saw her in the home one last time. amber had become concerned with my drug abuse and alcoholism, and flew me to live with my brother in virginia while he was stationed in norfolk. my brother had married a woman from japan. she wasn't very understanding: ultimately, she kicked me out of the house after a month because i wasn't going to get a job. i went and stayed with some friends of my family a couple of hours away, where i stayed sober for an entire week and tried to pull myself together. ultimately i went back to amber.at this point i was 25, i was in debt over $20,000 from school, i had no parents, no money, no house, no car. i was started smoking weed and drinking again. but amber still believed in me. she saw the person that i really was beneath the veil of alcohol and drug abuse, someone that i myself barely knew was there. after she received her degrees in psychology and music, we moved down to florida where she was from.my time in florida has been pretty good, honestly. i have grown a lot as a man since i was 25. i learned to program in php and started a career building custom wordpress themes for small businesses. i now own my own business, and even though i still struggle and don't make a ton of cash, i am so proud that i am even here and still trying.i have been alcohol-free for a month, narcotic-free for several years, and haven't smoked weed in about 10 days. it's funny to me that weed has been the last thing to go, and i will be honest, i am having a harder time not smoking weed than anything else i have had to deal with. i am reading tony robbins' book awaken the giant within, which is helping me challenge my core beliefs about myself and to rewire all of the negativity i have had my entire adult life.i proposed to amber a couple of months ago and she said ""yes!"", which was and still is the greatest feeling in the world.i am posting this because i want to help. if you are depressed, or are abusing drugs or alcohol, or one of your parents has cancer, or one of them has alzheimer's, or you are feeling alone...i can tell you from the bottom of my heart that things are going to get better and things will be okay. i truly love you, and i don't say that as a shrink or a counselor: i say that because i have been there, and i needed someone to tell me that really badly some days.  i still deal with the regret of leaving my mom in that home.if you need me, i want you to find a way to message me right now. let's figure it out. i will gladly do anything i can to help you figure things out, even if it's just listening. at this point in my life, i feel there's very little i can't handle or conquer. i know i can help you.thanks to anyone who reads. this is been very helpful to me this morning.j",,0
i’m young and my dad is old with dementia. i had a couple of years unemployment which was bad enough then his diagnosis this year has been difficult. nearly everyone i meet i have to explain i’m unemployed get judged by it then have to explain my dads got dementia etc etc. it kills me because i had so much pride and used to be successful with anything i did. but i’m completely burnt out. i’m indoors nearly every day with little money or motivation knowing my life has fallen apart and my future is passing me by. i don’t even know what to do with my life at this point apart from accept that i’m not who i should be by now and my life hasn’t worked out. the thing is i don’t even know how to occupy my spare time apart from playing video games etc etc. and i’m finding it really hard to stay positive. i have ‘friends’ tell me i have to do something. i have to get an income etc etc. but they don’t seem to understand i would rather be unemployed with better mental health then working somewhere stressful and burning myself out making me want to kill myself? it’s got to the point i just want to tell everyone to fuck off. but i don’t even have the energy to do that anymore. i’ve become so passive and i hate it.,,0

"this just sucks. i love my mom (50s), who is no longer the person who raised me (30s). i'm grateful for this community and i hope you might be able to give me some advice on how to go about this.  for a while now, it's been clear to me that my dad, who is my mother's primary caregiver, needs to get more help. they are actually quite young-- in their 50s so my father still works full-time and will do so for a while. over a year ago he's already been working primarily from home so that he can take care of my mom, who has gradually required more and more assistance. he literally cannot leave her home alone because she'll do things like turn on the stove, put random objects (not clothes) in the washer/dryer, attempt to get the mail but end up ""running away"" so that he loses track of her. the pandemic obviously didn't help. in january, he had signed her up for meet-ups for people with alzheimer's (she's the youngest, by far), but which are now cancelled. he was looking into housecleaners, but that was scrapped too. i was finally able to visit them after several months and i was shocked at how far things have gone downhill, for both of them. my father no longer exercises, he resorts to quick frozen meals because he's short on time. they're both in bad shape (after being physically quite healthy for many years into middle age). the house is mess (understatement). in part because my mother keeps ""cleaning up"" and rearranging things and my father can't keep up with tidying after her. their roomba is the only thing that cleans anymore.i should also mention this-- i have a fraught relationship with my father that required a lot of therapy and made me have to set boundaries. me moving in to help out is just not an option. i feel incredibly guilty about this, but i have to admit to myself that i don't think i would be a good caregiver because i already have a lot of pre-existing stress/anxiety when it comes to my relationship with him. that being said, i'm not callous to the situation. i love them both and i know that in his own way, my father loves me too. but we would butt heads too much day-to-day for us to successfully help my mom. my sister also lives too far away to help and has small children of her own who keep her busy.my mother literally an't function without him. though she still knows who we are, she gets confused. she suffers from delusions. sometimes she'll call me several times a day about how my sister or her best friend are stealing from her or that my dad is physically torturing her or that her mother has died (these things are all unequivocally not true). he helps her shower, lays out her clothes for her, makes her meals, and does all the housework. before the pandemic, he tried to take her out on weekends to meet up with friends, but that's not happening anymore. i know it's time to sit down with my dad and have a serious conversation about getting help. i actually think it might be time for a memory care facility. i've spoken with other family members/her friends who have seen her more frequently this past year than i have about this and they agree. my uncle was actually the one to bring this up.so here's my question: how do i bring this up to my dad? how should i approach this? i'm worried about my dad's reaction. he's stubborn and the type who refuses help from others. he's been in denial about how bad this is. should i research facilities beforehand? any advice on wording or angle of approach, fellow redditors? thank you in advance.",,0
"my mother-in-law has been relatively lucky in that she was diagnosed 5 years ago, however can still drive (all-be-it to only a handful of locations - including the gym), and remembers everybody most of the time, 100% of the time if they are in the room or she can see them via facetime, etc.  however over the last few weeks we've noticed that a few routine tasks, such as making a sandwich or folding laundry have become increasingly difficult. we give her these tasks so that she feels productive and so that she doesn't feel like a burden (her words), however this only seems to set-off her level of frustration and stress, which usually leads to spiraling &amp; confusion that i'm sure many of you know about all to well.  as i mentioned, her decline has been relatively slow. now were' starting to wonder if this is a sign that it's speeding up. i know every case differs greatly, but curious about others who have come across this.",,0
"howdy, this is a master post of what i've learned about caring for a relative with dementia.  i'm not a health care professional, i've just been through this four times and want a post to give to those who are new. this post combines six other posts.  constructive criticism is welcome.  it's written without covid in mind; it changes things, of course, but most of this is still applicable now and the rest will be again.  there's not a lot of sugar-coating here so if you're in a bad headspace, read this later.  dementia is a progressive, incurable disease that results in death.  half of everyone who lives long enough will develop dementia.  there are multiple types of dementia, but absolute diagnosis of the specific type usually cannot be made until after death.  specific things will make dementia worse: infections, dehydration, surgery, radiation/chemo, hospital stays, changes in routine, traveling, broken bones, alcoholism, etc.  most sufferer's progressions follow a similar pattern, but everyone's specific journey will be different.  note that this progression can take months or decades.  there are things that can be done, we think, to prolong or prevent the onset of dementia symptoms.  a diet low in sugar and alcohol but high on plants and fiber like the mediterranean diet can help.  exercise is essential.  those who speak two languages are half as likely to develop dementia, and people with higher educational attainment develop debilitating symptoms much later than those with less educational attainment. &amp;#x200b;# begin the journeyonce you suspect dementia, get your elder the best long term care insurance you can find.  use their most recent physical you can get; if it's too old, get a new one asap.  do not mention to the doc your suspicions about memory issues; family seems to pick up on these 1-5 years before they show up on the actual diagnostics, and it'd stop you from getting good ltc insurance.  read the contract and see how long you have to wait to get a dementia diagnosis after the policy goes into effect, so to not invalidate the insurance. this is the time to get your legal paperwork in order.  get your power of attorney or equivalent, and get the different forms the different institutions require.  your bank will usually have a notary on hand who can notarize things for you.  speaking of banks, consider moving finances to a credit union.  cus are non-profit: they don't make money off you by charging fees.  this small difference every month can save a lot of money for later, when you really might need it.  care homes are expensive.  also, get your long term directives in order.  what does your elder consider important to her quality of life?  what daily activities does she consider necessary: if she can't do that, it's not worth it?  does she want cpr?  life support?  for how long?  how does she want her body handled?  where to be buried/ashes to be scattered?  your doctor may have a booklet that will help you go through all of this, which can be filled out, notarized, and filed with your doctor/hospital so they have to honor her wishes. then get a dementia diagnosis.  many times a simple problem like a uti or other infection can appear as dementia-like symptoms, so rule out other (solvable) problems first.  if your relative is resistant to going to the doctor, offer to take them out to lunch, or ask them to keep you company while you get a prescription from the hospital's pharmacy, and then take them to their appointment.  yes, it's devious, but nothing happens without a diagnosis.  once you're sure of dementia talk with your resources both professional and family.  your healthcare may have a memory care or elder care group that can help you understand what's going on and what's going to happen.  bring your relatives, or bring them back the brochures.  there will be a lot of very difficult questions from relatives/friends who are not in the loop, such as ""what can we do"" and  ""what's the cure"".  the answers are ""take care of her until she dies"" and ""there isn't a cure"", which they won't like to hear, but will have to accept from the professionals.  so having someone else answer those questions is usually a lot easier.  if they know generally what the progression is you're less likely to come up against issues with them later.  so many relatives think ""oh, they're just hanging with grandma, how nice!"", when the truth is so much darker.  half of all caregivers will develop diseases or die while caregiving; it's often one of the worst, most stressful things we will do in our lives.  get a support group going for yourself, early, while you're still able to find time.  get a therapist if you can.  look around for what help is available where you are.  you go to [alz.org]( and use their resources.  out where i am we have a lot of local resources for home care and supplemental care, i hope you have the same or better.  you can find this by searching for ""elder care"" and your city, county, country, province, etc.  day care, respite care, and other programs are, frankly, essential. this part is important and ongoing.  start looking at where she is in the progression of the disease and make plans for the next step.  not planning for the future is the biggest mistake most families make.  they're so incredibly busy just barely taking care of today's needs that they're not ready for the next step.  my aunt was  literally hoisting my grandmother onto her back to get her from her bedroom to her chair in the front room, and then took care of her during  the day... and that was all she could do.  when grandma caught a cold, the coughing kept her from holding onto my aunt's shoulders so she couldn't get out of bed.  that led to the beginning of bedsores, so she had to go to the hospital.  instead of letting it get to that point aunt should have had in-home carers, lifts, equipment, supportive mattresses... so many things would have made life easier for both of them.  but aunt was too busy -- or overwhelmed -- with the massive job of caregiving.  prepare for the next step while you can. apply for government-paid in-home caring/recompense/assistance now, because by the time your requests are approved, she'll probably need them.  apply for a place at the best memory care facility you can find/afford now, because you can decline placement over and over and over, and just be put back at the head of the list for the next available spot.  during covid we found that the places with union workers had the lowest numbers for covid infections, controlling for many variables, due to the workers having access to ppe, so that's a consideration you might want to look for.  your country/states' department of social services will probably have a rating on all their care homes that might be helpful. many places are big enough that they provide multiple services, from respite to simple assisted living to locked wards, often via different wings.  respite is like checking your elder into a hotel for a weekend: the facility will take your elder for a bit to give you a break, and will help familiarize her with the facility.  these facilities will be able to transition your elder from one stage to the other via professionals.  this is very helpful because caregivers just compensate and compensate and compensate, burning themselves out far past the point where they should have transitioned.  keep in mind that these places run from 60k to 200k per year.  that insane price, along with the proof that elders are healthier longer at home, are why most people keep their elders at home with them for much longer than we used to.  but sometimes a care home is just necessary.  there are placement services which will take your elder's requirements (ostomy care, diabetes, hoyer lifts, meds, etc), distance from your home, and prices into consideration and get you a list of facilities.  they're very helpful and usually take recompense from the homes themselves so they don't cost you anything. save what you can.  talk to your mom and get recordings of her voice.  get tapes of all the family histories and stories you'll ever want to hear.  get her involved in alz groups as an aid or an assistant  so when she's a participant she'll still want to be there.  find out what her favorite music is, download it onto an easy-to-play format for when/if she has bad days.  get out the old pictures and see if she can identify the mystery faces. if you have access to it, look into high-cbd products to see if your elder has a good reaction to them.  dementia progression typically includes depression and anger, and most patients also experience sundowning, sleeplessness, and/or agitation.  cbd can help with all of these if it's well tolerated.  please check with your doctor first, there are a few medications that interact very badly with cannabis.  i have personally had very good luck with mary's medicinals' ""the remedy"" and a high-cbd edible but had to try a few things to find what actually worked.  and boy howdy they really do help. these are things you can do instead of worrying.  i do these things because not doing them is a bad idea, and they help me work through the grief.  activity helps dispel fear and anxiety. &amp;#x200b;# the progressionthe sufferers and caregivers who do the best with this disease are those who plan for the future.  they know what the next stage is and they've already done the research and signed the papers.  the ***best prepared*** progression is usually:1. ""impaired  cognition"" noticed by family, usually in ""help me find my car, i don't remember where i parked it"" situations.  electronic gps like a tile can help here.2. poa/healthcare poa signed by sufferer3. all financials nailed down, local laws researched, support group/network for caregiver found and activated4. dnr, ""quality of living"", death, corpse arrangements, burial arrangements discussed ahead of time5. long-term care health insurance attained (asap, the longer you wait the more expensive it will be)6. shared home prepared for sufferer to live with caregiver (separate doors, ramps, extra rooms, extra baths, ada furniture, doorways, hallways etc)7. patient diagnosed with dementia, usually ""mild to moderate"" stage8. this is usually when their driving starts to suffer.  taking away their keys usually provokes horrible rages, there is another option.  go to your country/state's department of motor vehicles site to submit their form for retesting an elder's capability to drive.9. medications to deal with side-effects prescribed, such as sundowner's, violent tendencies, hallucinations, etc.10. medications to help with actual alzheimer's prescribed.  they are usually not very effective, but are expensive and have serious side effects.  some experimental treatments, such as specific forms of light therapy, are showing promise but these will not be available from hmos for 7-10 years  from now.11. driver's license revoked, usually automatically after diagnosis &amp; medication12. apply to state/fed/insurance for any assistance, from financial to in-home.  this may take many tries and many years.  talk to your hospitals' elder care representative.13. if sufferer is violent, hallucinating, or wanders, talk to local authorities so they can be prepared.  this may not be appropriate in certain jurisdictions or for certain families. 14. get an electronic tracker, bracelet, or other identifier for any wandering patient.15. around this point a few sufferers take their own lives to spare their loved ones from dealing with a body without a mind.  this is not common with boomers and silent generations as they generally believe suicide to be a sin, but we're seeing it become more and more common in patients who are younger.16. this is the point where we used to institutionalize our elders. it was very common in the 70's and 80's and even 90's to put them in care homes.  now we know that they decline much faster when institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home, where they get better  care.17. in-home care becomes necessary during the day.18. 24/7 in-home care becomes necessary or the patient needs to be admitted to a memory care facility.  this is a locked ward where trained professionals deal with hallucinations, violent tendencies, etc.  this step is usually triggered by a tragic incident, such as patient wandering and being found by authorities, patient harming caregiver, patient injuring self, etc.  memory care facilities are not cheap, they can run between $4,000 - $14,000+ a month.  &lt;&lt; this is where  caregivers with insufficient preparation or insufficient healthcare access burn out... badly.19. patient loses memories entirely, needs help with every daily activity20. patient loses ability to feed self21. patient loses ability to swallow&amp;#x200b;this will be posted to both r/alzheimers and r/dementia.   i hope that anyone else can chime in if i've missed anything.",,0
"hey there everyone. my name is mustafa and i'm 23. 6 months ago i was on the verge of ending my life .at a very young age where everyone is striving and working hard for a better life. unfortunately for me everything went on pause in 2018 i got diagnosed with osteoarthritis aka (disk degeneration)that's where i had to be friend chronic pain..my past 2.5 years was filled with so much pain that i lost everything in my life.my relationships went down hill , my finances were all spent on finding a cure , uni failed me since i was not able to study due to pain and so much more i sucked it all up cuz i was told there's nothing you can do about it just like alzheimer's. anyways 2020 march arrives and that's when sh*t hits the fan and got fired my job at a restaurant because i forget alot of orders and instructions that i've been given.i realized my brain is not working right. it's like i have conversation with someone in the next minute or two i realize i would forget 90% of what we talked about. let alone just that i couldn't perform normal calculations in my head . man that felt so weird coming from someone who has graduated from a levels 5 years ago with straight up a's and b's.long story short i went through different doctors trying to find what's going on and i would always make sure i'd have my phone recorder on cuz the next minute i'd step out i'd legit forget what they just told me.after weeks of visits i knew that there no hope for me man . literally every doctor said something .i got diagnosed with adhd , depression , anxiety.and the one i hated the most was ""oh i think it's all in your head"". yes sure...i tried all the meds from adderall to anti depressants you name it. they just threw pills week after week. hoping one day i come by and talk about how they helped me..unfortunately none did.i wanted to see how bad my brain was so  i found a test called moca.i think alot of you should know what this is . it's a test doctors put people on if they have cognitive decline. no doctor wanted to test me out or do a scan on my brain so i did the test on my own and my score was literally 5/30. man i knew life was over for me and my parents would have to go through this with me as well which was horrifying.time was passing by and things getting worse day by day for some reason i'd be staring at the window for no reason for minutes.days pass and weird words come out of my mouth and i'd stutter trying to put one sentence together. i think it's called aphasia.i know i'm talking so much about my symptoms but i'm trying to show you how bad my case is. but you might wonder how the hell am i typing this entire post if i had dementia..i'll gladly explain and it's why i'm putting this out.6 months ago that's when i was at rock bottom i discovered a book called ""the end of alzheimer's"" by dr dale bredesen.i was so desperate that if someone told me the cure is to eat a plate of shit . i would do it regardless if it's true or not. it's called desperation for a solution.anyways dr dale details everything a person needs to know about this disease but not just that. he's been able to reverse his clients cognitive decline with a protocol that he has extensively put out in his book .i was skeptical but i wanted something that gives me hope so i decided to follow.  jesus man 6 months in and i swear on my mom's life that it f*cking works.i have recently done the cognitive test and my moca score was 30/30.i'm able to remember conversations , my vocabulary increased , aphasia is vanishing , i can understand movies and so much more..i highly recommend anyone who's watching a loved one die day by day to give this book a shot or hell maybe you yourself are experiencing symptoms of memory loss too . there's hope for everyone no matter how far they are ...i'm not the first one who has come back to life but in the book he shares different stories of his clients who show obvious results and they have gone back to normal life..i feel sad at time i walk by a nursing home next to my house and i see a bunch of elderly probably with severe alzheimer's stuck where they are and never get to truely come back to life just like i did.anyways for me it's been 6 months and i can't say i'm fully back 100% to where i was but jesus i'm so happy things turned around when it seemed impossible..it's a journey and it takes times i can't imagine the how my next years will be. i'm looking forward to uni again 😊yeah and also i forgot to mention that my chronic pain has subsided . i finally live a pain free life. i swear the only reason i posted this is so that someone reads this and hopefully gives the book a shot . we all know how hopeless it is to hear someone go through dementia. if you got any question i'll gladly answer ☺️",,0

"so, my mom is almost 55... my mom has a habit: cooking a lot of food, so that she doesn't have to cook everyday. she used to cook for 4 people. however, i have left home for a couple years now. my mom and dad are divorced so she only cooks for herself and my sister. however she still cooks these big portions.. so i had a talk with her this morning, i told her that she should cook less, so that she can eat more fresh food and didn't have to throw away a lot of good food. she said: yes, i agree. around 15:00, i made her a salad for dinner and i put it in the fridge for her so she didn't have to cook today. i told her: you don't have to cook for me tonight and i also made you a salad.. she said: oh thank you.around 18:00, she yells: dinner is ready! (my sister is at my dads, so it's just me and her). she made a big pan of pasta for 4-5 people.. (she didn't eat the salad)..so i said: i just made you a salad 3 hours ago. why did you cook anyways? and why did you cook so much again?she replied: i thought you wanted to eat pasta. the other day, you said you wanted to eat pasta. (i did not, i just arrived yesterday)...is this a sign she's starting to develop dementia? or is she just sticking to her habit? im really worried.",,0
"my mom's frontotemporal dementia is worsening rapidly and my family's at the point where we can't take care of her ourselves anymore. unfortunately, she's 62 and will be switching to medi-cal in january (she's on dad's military insurance now but loses it when he turns 65 and he's forced to go on medicare), and i'm having difficulty finding affordable options for care, as most places i've checked don't accept medi-cal and charge upwards of $5000/mo. she needs round-the-clock assistance (or as many hours of in-home care as possible), which makes it even harder.i'd love advice on where to look for care options or anything else i should keep in mind. i've been scouring websites like coveredca and dhcs to see what's covered, but i'm in such a distraught state that trying to find the information i'm looking for is getting overwhelming, and navigating the government sites is honestly confusing. any leads or clarification (even if it's from the websites i've already checked) would be greatly appreciated.",,0
"i’m feeling like i’m at my wits end and am really needing advice from others in similar situations. my mother was diagnosed 4 years ago with early on set and while when we first got the confirmation it was a bit of a relief, as the time has gone on the relief has subsided and now i’m trying to figure out how to move forward and navigate this. my problem is that before the diagnosis my mom and i never got along. this may be harsh but the truth of the matter is that i didn’t like her and we hadn’t been close or amicable since i was maybe in middle school. i believe her personality switched from the disease when i was in high school, although that’s not confirmed, but regardless we basically never recovered and never have a good relationship. now with the disease she is different and not mean or anything like she used to be but i still cannot get over the hurt and pain she caused me for so long. i try to do the best i can but unless i have to be with her i don’t see her or visit. my father is her main caregiver and i have a very big guilt that i’m abandoning him. i know how hard it is for him everyday and how thankless it is. i would like to be there for him more or help but i have very little compassion and emotion for my mother. i love my father dearly though and it is taking a toll on our relationship which i don’t want to happen. luckily he has outside help but as we all know, that only goes so far. i should say i am in therapy but unfortunately all that is revealing right now is more hurt and pain stemming from my mother. i don’t know what to do and wish i didn’t feel such hatred towards her. i don’t want this to cause such tension in my father and i’s relationship but i’m also tired of his reactions to it. for example this weekend we are on a trip and he and my husband went out for a walk late last night. my mother came into my bedroom about every 10 minutes lost and wondering where he was. i put her back in her room and tried my best but there’s only so much i can do. i’m 7 weeks pregnant, we haven’t told them and i’m exhausted, i needed sleep. my dads reaction today was it’s good for you to see how hard it is. but she doesn’t do that when he’s around so that’s inaccurate. i’m sorry for the wall of text. i just really feel helpless and don’t know how to communicate to my father or how to react to my mother. any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",,0
"my dad passed away three years ago today from this terrible disease and i still struggle with it. rational me understands i lost him long before his actual death but emotional me still holds onto this weird idea that if i could do something that would make him proud he would remember. this carried over well past his death. i’m writing this to tell you all to watch out for your own mental health. you can not receive validation from someone who is gone, and if you are a care taker, please remember to acknowledge your own needs and live your own truth.my dad took great pride in me being a good golfer. amongst his friends that became my identity. one time he asked me to take a year off work and pursue this dream. he used to try to sign me up for us open local qualifying and while i had spurts of really good play, i was never of the pedigree to actually compete in that arena. i have mental health issues, diagnosed with ptsd in my early 20s from suppressed child hood trauma. basically i developed the yips. i literally shake so bad over 1 foot putts that i miss them because my inner child fears the bullying that comes from missing something so simple. if no one is around i make them though. then his dementia came, i decided to for go achieving independence in my 20s and lived at home with my mom to help take care of him and my mom. i became obsessed with the game, i would do insane things like hit 400+ balls in the middle of winter at a “heated” driving range daily, i even qualified for a few elite amateur tournaments. none of this really mattered or helped him remember because he was so far gone he would claim i won things i didn’t to his friends. i didn’t care, i thought i could still achieve that validation and it was nice having someone believe in me more then i ever did.after his passing i medicated through the game, i was hell bent on qualifying for the us open. i found work in florida so i could practice year round. i was desperate for that validation and didn’t care that i was sabotaging my personal love life by going on this grandiose journey. my game got pretty good and i signed up for us open local. unfortunately the qualifier was rained out that year and the date it was moved to i would be coming off a 25 hour shift. i still wanted to try, and when i got home i changed into my golf clothes and sat on the couch. i fell asleep, woke up late and missed the tee time. i called my mom sobbing. this was 2019, i didn’t learn my lesson because i basically repeated the same process in 2020 except this time covid cancelled open qualifying. looking back 2019 was my best chance. i had (more) mental stability and other things in my life were going well.however the kicker to 2020 was covid took my job away, it was terrible for myself, friends, and ex but i finally had this opportunity to have that year to really train like my dad wanted. i took it and ran. i thought i was doing him proud but i was really just ignoring my own emotional needs, growth and relationships. i was being selfish but at the time didn’t view it as such. to compound the problem and dream i won my club championship this summer. i say this is a problem because the way i won it. it went to a playoff, and in front of who knows how many people i hit my approach to a foot. instantly i was known by everyone in the club and i had a reputation as a badass. no one (other then my playing partners) knew i missed 9 putts inside 3 feet over the two day tournament. ironically the kid i beat in the playoff conceded my tap in. we played the first round together. he even helped me read putts the first day which ultimately calmed me down. i feel like training in the cold helped heal my ball striking mind and wonder if i trained short game in the cold i could achieve the same results. but i’m getting side tracked with that statement. after beating tyler in the playoff i confided in his dad that i felt bad for winning, this was the first time i won anything golf wise and have lost in playoffs before. it’s brutal to be on that side of things. it is not fun to say the least. he yelled at me for saying this to him. but at the same time i wouldn’t of gotten my mind in the headspace without tyler’s kindness during the first round.the problem with winning like this is that people talk, all of a sudden i had a reputation for being this badass golfer who did something amazing despite the pressure. everyone at the club knew who i was and it was hard to remember basic things like everyone’s names. everyone wanted a game, and if i’m being honest i like the game for the solitude. i love playing by myself as a means to clear my headspace, but my game was to a point where people wanted to see it and the attention felt nice. i finished the year strong, and was determined more then ever to make a 2021 us open run. i trained the off season harder then i ever trained. i had a brief stint in florida, i left despite my (now) exes wishes. florida seemed appealing because work was coming back to that state because they didn’t give a fuck about covid, but ultimately i was putting the goal first. unfortunately the day i left to go down there one of the guys i was staying with attempted suicide. the other guy didn’t tell me until i got there two days later (i drove). i had just entered hell. my ex gf was distant because i left, the guy i was staying with was unloading on me and the company had asked me to keep it quiet to protect him. i had no one to turn to. i was also sleeping in the same bed he tried to hang himself off of. i had so many questions, i wondered if he tried because he knew i was coming down and didn’t want me there. jobs also kept cancelling. with no work or income i decided to head back home. i also missed my ex.me and my ex were growing more distant, but i was still hell bent on this goal. i found an indoor simulator space to practice in. the guy cut me a deal, 200 bucks to train all winter as long as i came in off hours. so i’d wake up everyday at 4/5am drive to the suburbs and hit 400+ balls. my ex never gave me a hard time about waking her up during this and that’s something i took for granted. i was making big strides in club head speed and shot making, the space even had a putting green in there! this is where golf is a bitch. to an extent it doesn’t matter how much you practice if your mind isn’t right. in february unemployment claimed they over paid me 12000 dollars. to deal with this i had to keep my phone on me at all times. i became screen addicted and neglected my exes needs. part of the process was being on a call back list, so everytime my phone rang or went off i had to be there. i can’t explain to you how mentally draining it is to be attached to every notification you get on your little pocket dopamine. it’s beyond distracting. this lasted for four months, non the less i persisted with my dads dream.opening day on the golf course finally came. on my way to the course someone ran a red light and totaled my vehicle. i should mention i live in a big city and have a 40-60 minute commute to the course. i didn’t believe i was that injured and was hell bent on making opening day so i got my roommates car and went and played. i’m actually did ok for the first few holes until i realized i had whiplash. i remember sitting in the parking lot crying to my friend because i had worked so hard effectively for nothing. i knew the year was dead, i knew i was injured but i didn’t know the toll it would take on my mental health. i started physical therapy for a herniated disc in my neck and had some upper back issues that restricted my swing. i began rushing between golf pt and work. the entire time i had to have my cell phone on me and the number of calls from ambulance chasers was exhausting. i persisted with the dream because it’s all i had. it had become my identity. one you thing you should learn about trauma brain is the importance of slowing down. when this happened i was effectively rushing every minute of every day. instead of adjusting my goals i turned it up, and this can cause a lot of problems for someone like me. on top of this i didn’t exactly look hurt; so while my play suffered my “friends” who once adored me when i was good were dismissive and devaluing. i’d hear stuff like “i want to play with the old version of you” (three days after the accident) “golf is a lot harder when you have to work for a living” etc. essentially i became a circus act for people i thought were my friends. golf culture can be toxic, it’s a privileged world, and speaking up about other people’s poor behavior did not go well for me.during this time my girlfriend and i were growing distant. my new job had me working till 8 so we saw each other less and less. she immediately recognized my struggle and tried to get me in therapy, something i put off. covid shut down my industry so i finally had work again and with pt and training how was i suppose to add therapy on that? also how was i suppose to turn down work when we’re shut down for 18 months! i already had to work pt in around that.a week prior to the qualifier she tried to break up with me. it was a day before my birthday and a week before the qualifier. i was devastated to say the least. we still had issues from me leaving that we never addressed and while we had a beautiful relationship before i left things just were off. i shut down emotionally and didn’t know how to turn my situation into an opportunity. i was hurt, just really really hurt. so i isolated. i came begging back and she gave me a chance to redeem myself. i tried to explain the situation and she just grew mad at me. and i don’t blame her. i wasn’t putting her first, i wasn’t even putting myself first. i was attempting to find closure in the worst possible way. i was ignoring growing as a person and an adult and chasing scores because that’s who i became. i withdrew from us open local. emotionally i was a wreck but my neck and back weren’t at a place to compete. the usga will actually punish you if you don’t perform well in these and there are other usga tournaments i have a more realistic shot of playing in. (i’ve missed usga mid am by a shot or two in the past). i was so unaware of my mental heath at the time because i was so focused on being ready for that tournament. even if my body was ready i doubt i could of succeeded. ironically i’m pretty well versed in sports psychology books but i feel like that topic does not do trauma justice if you want real help seek a professional.this past summer was much of the same. at work i was trying to get out of doing some heavy lifting because of the pain and i felt devalued to the company despite having a pretty long tenure there. i was painted as lazy and didn’t want to work. no one seemed to care that i literally had took jobs for them that cost me unemployment dollars because of how that’s set up or that i literally took a job that paid less then unemployment because i saw it as an opportunity to grow new skills. i’d try to talk about mental health with friends but i was met with things like “so what you have golf” like being able to control a golf ball means my brain functions properly. there was also a large empathy gap between the people who stayed on to work and those of us that got unemployment. they didn’t know that by working one day a week as a fill in it was actually costing us hundreds of dollars when we were just trying to survive. and i didn’t understand the stress they were under just keeping things afloat.my golf game came and went in phases. i couldn’t handle gambling even friendlu bets. i eventually disconnected from the group i normally played with because i became a punching bag. hurt me shooting 76 wasn’t good enough for these people and it was hard to meet the unrealistic expectations they had of me considering my situation. i’d only be treated the same if i shot a score. i started playing alone. i love playing alone. i could be me, free from judgement and my scores reflected that. i always wondered how many golfers there are out there that are good enough to play on tv if they know the cameras aren’t on and nobody is watching.me and my now ex broke up for good. i was in shock and emotionally unavailable so she had enough. in the beginning i blamed everything on her also. i failed to look inwardly and see how i was at fault.  we also broke up originally over text on the golf course. i snapped two clubs that day in front of guys that don’t care what i shoot. i didn’t tell them what was going on in my phone. she did so many nice things for me i took for granted. i wrote evil things about her, and sure she did some bad stuff but a majority of it was in response to my emotional neglect. she didn’t deserve the words i wrote about her and i also didn’t expect her to read them but knew there was a chance she would. (i posted a response on r/bpdlovedones because i was so convinced that’s what i had went through) essentially i was being a man child. she blocked me on all forums, and moved on. a week after the break up she was already bringing another guy around her mom. she had had enough, after all she did hold out for nine months and i wasn’t working on myself.finally golf didn’t matter. i no longer had the drive to wake up and go to the course. i didn’t want to be confronted by anyone about my bad behavior. i isolated in my room which was a total mess for about a month. i didn’t tell anyone about the break up. there were times i really thought i was going to commit suicide. i felt so hurt and so unvalued. i worked so hard at the game and to not even have the opportunity to try is crushing. it’s something i hope i’ll get over. it hasn’t just been the work i put in after my dads passing it’s been a decade of work and commitment.now comes the point of all this. i started getting help. i reached out to my mom and loved ones. they’ve been supportive as fuck. i had to find my real friends, the ones who didn’t view me as a walking scorecard and they listen. i have a coworker that we do self care together. i’ve been going to therapy. i’m writing this as a vow not only to myself but to my dad. my dad wouldn’t be proud of me for doing what i’ve done. he’d be proud of me for building a happy life. i am no longer going to play golf to seek my fathers validation and i will only play because i want to. i’m no longer going to value people that judge me by my score and not the content of my character. i’m going to address problems in my relationships before they get out of hand. and this is going to be my reminder. and if you’re someone who is struggling as a caretaker for someone with dementia please don’t do what i did. get help, it’s ok to grieve, the sad reality is nothing you can do or imagine is going to bring them back, so count the good days when you have them and be easy on yourself during the bad ones.tldr: 3 years ago my dad passed away with dementia. he wanted me to be a pro golfer, i chased the dream not because i wanted it but because he did. a series of events brought me to the lowest point of my adult life. don’t be like me, get help.",,0

episodes which involved medical attention or which now that i look back to where dare i say ""quite queer"" if i ought to designate them as such , nevertheless...even as a kid i was considered ""mentally ill"" as i was severely hyperactive and would wander around the classroom in preschool and even roam around the school premises i had a very inquisitive and vivid memory and imagination as i wholeheartedly remember how i used to play around with branches and frolic around the enclosures housing the school pets . nevertheless i was later taken over to a psychiatrist as i developed a fear that someone was going to attack my dad or family the psychiatrist gave me a particular medicine ( something called depsonil or similar ) and that stopped the said outbursts significantly but my parents cut down the medicine later since it was turning me into a ""zombie"" practically , moving on the said symptoms stopped albeit i would also like to bring into notice the fact that i suffered from a head injury when i fell backwards from my bed and hurt the back of my head ( albeit since i showed no symptoms of brain injuries like vomitting and such we never paid much heed to it ) now that was in the 2006 - 2007 .  furthermore i also had severely curled and utterly sordid my handwriting was...it was utterly jumbled and horrendous but over the course of time i was able to fix it up and even aced several times to be considered somewhat of a prodigy in my school and then there was the fact that my intrigues on military world history , cryptozoology , natural world , mysteries , the occult ( i literally  used to read bernard heuvelman's books when i was like 9 or 10 ) and extreme proficiency towards english along with my completely westernized upbringing given my father made me an oddity in my indian school where i experienced severe bullying for a long tenure of time without any particular individual whom i could call as a ""friend"" well that was until i graduated to highschool and made some friends at the age of 17 but as ill fate would have one of my friends passed away from dengue ...after that college disappointed me severely as everyone there below subpar with the sole exception of maybe a single bloke i befriended along with a single teacher back at that time i started to plan for immigration and dropped out because of some complications then due to some problems i couldn't immigrate and the covid lockdowns ensued shortly , nevertheless i was severely depressed and almost was simply existing if anything until i found about scp and other overpowered fictional verses which i used as a means of getting out of my stultified tenor ...i would also like to bring into the notice the fact that shortly before this i was extremely heartbroken at my ineptness that i could not earn along with the health of my aging father who was in his late 60s at that time . i always had this knack of visualizing my life as a videogame or a comic if anything ( i am perfectly aware as to how deranged it sounds ..but i never had schizophrenia like hallucinations or hearing voices in my mind ) [it's somewhat similar to ichiban  kasuga from yakuza 7]( without the visual hallucinations , i always used to create mental stories and events bordering into sheer ""what ifism"" to a strange alternate course of events of sort to something utterly fantastical ( super powers , weapons and all other kinda bits and bobs involved) , i also would like to say that i used to talk to myself under different contexts repeatedly using different dialects and accents to keep my vocabulary and lexicon reet and honed , i even used to think about how it would be if i was in some other countries which i had not visited yet ( these helped me to write a lot of stuff as i used to write stories a lot if anything ) moving on , i never was under any form of delusion or such actually , if anything i was extremely aware if these odd habits that i had even as recent as a few months ago whilst i was in nepal . and i was dare i say somewhat flustered and bothered as well since i couldn't offer any financial support to my family , welp i shan't digress with my backstory anymore ( which i merely presented to use as a source of context ) and get on to the problems that has caused me to write the post here today...so ever since i was in college i had a case of severe gastric problems due to not having a meal for a long tenures because of classes and such and i immediately assumed and imagined my minor gastritis as a potential stomach cancer ...after ig healed off with the aid of homeopathic medicines from a local scottish doctor , i was under the impression that i had brain cancer back in 2019 whilst i was immigrating and that was due to a migraine most probably as i am quite inclined to register , nevertheless i was absolutely petrified and used to cry and sob whilst being pretty much ascertained of my impending doom , moving on even a six or so months ago i was ascertained that i'm afflicted with a mouth cancer apparently ...which turned out to be a simple canker sore on my tongue . now ..on 26th september i was having some problems falling asleep for a few days and decided to google my symptoms ( the worst mistake that i ever did ) and it showed me about prion diseases especially sfi and scjd these absolutely terrified me on spot and i started to cry...for the next few days i was having severe panic attacks , heart palpitations , muscle twitches and even memory problems and such i was having severe problems falling asleep but because of the aid my family ( my parents ridiculed me but my uncle's family was extremely supportive to say the least ) provided i was finally able to curb that thought away a few days ago and returned to a normal sleeping pattern , now ...my problem started eversince i was under the impression that i had a prion disease ...i was having severe problems whilst reading ( mostly missing out words and re reading once to grasp the gist of the sentence or paragraph ) these where actually symptoms of sfi apparently which scared me as well ( note that this never happened before this or even if it happened it wasn't that prominent at all ) so i left it out but even then after my sleep improved when the said problem was persisting i just had to google it again and i found out about all different types of dementias and especially ftds ....this scared the fuck out of me since it matches my symptoms no one in my family ever had any form of dementia except maybe my grandmother who was already 97 years old . i keep missing words , misspell stuff whilst reading and have problems recalling words ( note this has been happening more since the last few days ) what scares me is that i had impeccable comprehension and even a few weeks ago i scored a c2 in the british council english aptitude test , i also then recalled the fact that i have had problems recalling names of movies  , words for a few days ( though i always remember them later on within a few seconds ) and even problems to articulate sentences whilst speaking in english ( i'm multilingual as i can speak bengali which is my primary language eversince the pandemic , english with a slight east london accent and different dialects and some basic german and hindi ) now that i remember it has been happening for a few months before my problems when i jokingly used to say that i had a ""brain damage"" to my family ( but even then i used to remember the said stuff in literal seconds ) so roughly this has been happening since last january maybe ? but it never even bothered me as i still was able to learn and store multiple informations in my mind ( i literally debated scp in different branches with different languages  ) but since a few months i was forgetting some old knowledge ( which could very well be because there is literally an endless amount of info whilst it comes to scp ) and had troubles recalling and mispronouncing names...this scared me especially when i learned about ftd , even now i'm still able to remember new info and even have a perfectly working short term and working memory to the point that i can remember the conversation of bystanders i heard on the pavement or similar , also i have developed severe short sightedness in my left eye which i discovered on 28th september , i also had some episodes of hypnogogaic hallucinations where i used to see grotesque images or dream like sequences whilst falling asleep along with spasms and twitches ...it is also to be brought into attention the fact that i had a lot of hypnic jerks way before the problems started months ago and i always have had sleeping problems where even a single day of allnighter ( back even a year ago it was extremely rare ) would literally cause a nigh mental breakdown if anything . i noticed that i am extremely emotionally expressive and pessimistic if anything eversince the lockdown but with the smallest hint of reassurance i can literally do a 360 and become quite headstrong until another depressive issue grips me in it's throes ( which is mostly caused by a tertiary causes like quarrels amongst my parents or other family members , seeing my former classmates , financial woes or something similar ) i get extremely gutted and dour sometimes even having severe problems to fall asleep . now in the context of anxiety apart from the aforementioned instance where i already stated my worries about my father...ever since the lock down i literally haven't went outside other than to fetch groceries or stuff like that , haven't met with the single friend i had and always had worried about financial woes and be bogged amidst the constant squabbles of my family having quarrels ( which sometimes resorted more along the lines of physical    skirmish ( bloody hell ...took me like 2 minutes to remember this ) and then thinking how my dreams and ambitions where for naught ..i sometimes used to cry as well since i saw all my classmates living luxuriously or well established , or because of how skint i was or even have sleepless nights over the thoughts of my parents ever increasing age and for the fact that how if something was to happen to one of them i would proverbially and literally loose my mind and if something was to happen to me they would be completely helpless . i do not wish to be a liability to my already aged parents and they have so many hopes and dreams in regards to me that i am just merely sobbing and stifling a cry whilst drenching my pillow covers each and every night at bed as of the moment from the thoughts of developing alzheimer's or some form of ftd ( i'm also worried about developing lewy body  dementia as well since sleep problems are a presenting symptom there as well )the main predicament that has been absolutely gnawing and nagging me from the inside is that i have ppa which results in one losing their very concept of language , however i'm only experiencing this problem regarding comprehension or reading ever since i read about prion diseases , i'm losing so much hair because of stress...i'm literally crying ..my long luscious black hair was my pride and joy...i used to decorate it with multiple coloured ribbons and play with them now they are just a sickly shell of their former selves...ever since i had developed the severe stress i kept on having comprehension problems and later on ever since i read about ppa since i had reading problems ...i found that i might have ppa or other ftd which further scared the living jibbies out of me , i keep reading words wrong and miss words simultaneously as well like i read ""potions"" as bloody ""potatoes"" only last day as for my word recall problems i generally remember the word i'm seeking in less than a few seconds but sometimes it can be delayed then there is the fact that sometimes i have troubles articulating my speech and words ....i'm literally at my wit's end as of the  moment if i am being honest ...also i would like to bring into notice the fact that the first time i took alprazolam was when i was in middle school and even before that i used lick alprazolam tablets as i confused them with candies when i was a kid ( i know it sounds super wonky but that's that ) . literally before my problems i never had any problems with comprehension and even finding words ..heck the only thing i can relate to is probably how sometimes i usually used to forget names of movies or stuff and had to brainstorm for a few moment...that's about it .i would also wish to notify the fact that i always have swirls , patterns , cones and colour blobs when i close my eyes but that has been happening for a very very long time iirc so i never even paid much of a quip of an eyebrow if anything ....i also should bring in the fact that i was assured that i was gonna die last year and later called dibs at the fact that i'm gonna kick the bucket this year , it's all too harrowing and simultaneously straining for me to say the least...i don't even have a large family as most of my paternal or maternal relatives don't fancy to keep any ties with us and thus we are completely left alone to fend for ourselves..the only thing i can do is to just..wait and watch where my predicaments take me..i beg any neurologist or psychiatrist present..please help me..my mom and dad albeit they may seem crude , extremely self centred , indignant and callous are everything to me...i cannot live without them so i beg you...please tell me whether i have something truly sinister and nefarious so that i can take somewhat appropriate steps so that atleast they can live somewhat of a comfortable life in my due absence .",,0
"my father is 63 and was diagnised with parkinson's and lewy body dementia eight years ago. my 70 year old uncle, (dads brother) was just diagnosed with early onset alzheimers. im wondering what are the odds of myself and two younger brothers getting a neurological disease?",,0
"i (f25) have always knocked heads with my grandpa (81) -- growing up, i watched him sit on his butt as my grandma (81) did everything for him, and make rude, sexist (sometimes racist) comments as if they were funny. my mother (his dil) was stubborn, and would fight back, so that's what i learned to do too. i remember many times getting in fights with him about things he would say, telling him how disrespectful and rude they were (he had a penchant for commenting on women's weight, and instead of saying ""i saw this woman walking,""  it was ""i saw this larger, husky woman walking,"" even when it was irrelevant to what he was going to say.a little bit of his back story. he was raised by his mother and a housekeeper, and was about 10 years younger than his older brother. his older brother and father were hard workers, up until they days they died. my grandpa, while he did work hard, became the manager type, that couldn't relate to the 'working class' that was under him. nothing overly bad happened to him, never got drafted/went to war, was able to attend college after he graduated highschool, the whole lot.i think all of that affects the way he treated people. he would imply that all the rude comments were just jokes, and when i was old enough, i would tell him they weren't funny, and disrespectful. he would invade privacy, all because ""its my money, you're here because of me"" sort of mentality. but of course any rude ""funny"" comment towards him deemed yelling and admonishment.anyway. i think you get the picture. enough of me rehashing my pent up frustration.his sister had alzheimer's and died relatively young. ever since, he always would talk about how he was going to get it. he even asked his doctor for preventive medicine for it (which doesn't really exist), instead of, of course, keeping his body healthy with exercise and eating right. this always frustrated me, as health was super important to my parents/immediate family, and i had always heard that its more likely to occur in females than males.so now, here we are, and he is developing dementia. nothing overly bad, as he has always mixed up my name with his daughter's (they sound similar), and never calling my male cousins by the right names. he does, however, ask the same questions that were just answered, which he didn't use to do. all of his old, annoying habits are just repetitive now.i know that patience is important, but over the last couple years of him developing/having dementia have been a struggle of him using ""being sick"" as an excuse, or if it actually is affecting his behavior.the reason i'm posting now is because this morning, after asking me if i was going to take a break from work to come eat breakfast, (i had said yes) ""oh! well you don't want to get fat! i almost said fat-ter (he emphasized this) -- but i could have!"" i told him that wasnt very nice, and he laughed, ""well, i didn't call you fat, i just implied it, i just wanted to make you smile at your old grandpa"" (what he refers to himself as now. and i was most definitely not smiling.) ""well, grandpa, i don't think it was funny. it's actually disrespectful and i don't appreciate it."" he laughed at me and told me i still have ""years of learning and need to grow up in time."" man. he hasn't done this to me in years, and i just thought i was going to explode. i mentioned this to my dad (his patience is beyond me), who must've told him to apologize, and it rang to the tune of, ""i was told i called you fat and that i should apologize. you must've said it, because i wouldn't say that. i may have implied it, but you must've taken it the wrong way. either way, i didn't mean to bother you."" and walked away.how do i balance frustration of his typical, not-new bad behavior, and his illness adding to it? again, i know that patience is key, but man does it run low.",,0
"1) my granmda's always ""hungry"". but when she does eat, she crams her mouth so full that she can't chew it all so she spits it out. and she's always got her hands in her mouth (after digging in her nose or in the garbage!). a website i was on said this sounds like ""compulsion to put things in their mouth (not just food)"", and is common among people with frontotemporal dementia. since reading, i've started doing what the page said, and started staggering her food in meals (serve one food at a time instead of a main dish with two sides). any other ideas? anyone else got this going on?  2) reading: i've read that people with dementia/alzheimer's; sometimes their brain only registers half of something they're looking at (hence the clock test, with all the numbers smushed onto one side). because grandma's gotta be unique (ha!), i noticed that *she* reads things from the bottom-up. anyone else with some variation of these?",,0
"so 12 months ago dad started to get paranoid,forgetful and anxious. nothing major to start but repeating himself and forgetting where things were kept-that kind of thing.then he starts telling me the neighbours are going to kill him-and things went downhill fast-i ended up moving  me and my daughter in with him so he wasn't alone-everyone felt safer that way and it worked out ok to start (i have a full time job and he took care of school runs) my bf is a good guy and dealt with everything perfectly too fast forward 6 months..dad went missing for 12 hours said people were trying to hang him so he was hiding. so someone needs to be with all the time as he's so scared to be alone. i quit my job-i hated my job but (how do i work and look after him too? how do i trust him to care for a child?) i don't mind not having a job-but how do i make money?currently waiting to be diagnosed-but unsure where we go from there. long winded confusing post so i apologise-but any advise would be greatly appreciated.",,0
"i'm so sorry for the wall of text... there is a lot to get out, i'm going to try to split it into sections with bolded titles for easier reading**background**my grandmother has been exhibiting signs of short term memory loss for a few years now. it began with asking the same question multiple times in short conversations, the inability to remember what she had done throughout the day, calling me by my aunt's name and confusing me for a younger version of her, and occasionally forgetting where she was. we dismissed this originally as just a symptom of growing older and not using her brain quite as much due to retirement. so we got her and ipad and some brain training apps, made sure she always has puzzles and crossword/wordsearch/sudoku books around, made sure that she was getting out and spending time with her friends (she now has a standing coffee appointment with a group of ladies 3x a week), and have been spending as much time with her as possible engaging with her, doing puzzles with her and just over all attempting to keep those cognitive juices flowing. but it seems as if none of this is working, she is still in a noticeable decline which has seemed to increase more rapidly the last 6 months. i moved out of the house i shared with my grandparents and mother growing up in december and have tried to see my grandparents once or twice a week since and i am noticing more and more how bad it is getting not seeing her every day and there have been a few instances lately that have me c concerned. about a month and a half ago i went out and took her for a walk (she likes to go for walks but it is getting to the point that we are no longer comfortable letting her go out on her own as she gets very disoriented and the neighbourhood can be confusing) where she introduced herself to some neighbours across the street who have lived there 10+ years. a week or two after that i went for coffee with my grandparents and as they were dropping me off at my new house (which my grandmother has been to at least once a month since i moved in) and she asked who i was going to visit and when i would be home. the last (well the last biggish seeming one that has me concerned) was when we went to the dance recital of a family friend last week, i sat beside her and she was turning to me and calling me by my aunt's name and talking me me as if i was her and when it came time for the little little kids (3-5 age group) to preform there was one that resembled me as a child at which point she got very excited and said ""*aunts name* look at *sosullied* isn't she adorable in her costume! we need to make sure to get lots of pictures!"". i had been gently reminding her of who i was every so often but at that point i just couldn't and let her have the happy moment of her being so proud of her ""granddaughter"". **the issue**so the problem is that our family gp will not acknowledge that there is any issue what so ever. my entire family go to him (my self, grandparents, mother, and 4 aunts and uncles) and at one point or another most of us have spoken to him about our concerns which he has either brushed off or ignored completely. the closest that we have gotten to a response from him was that we should ""think carefully before saying anything else as once we 'start this' it can't be undone"" and his biggest concern seemed to be that my grandmother might have her license taken away (we don't let her drive any more anyways - she gets frustrated with other drivers because she doesn't know what to do on the road or where she is going which leads to dangerous driving). he has said that her memory seems absolutely fine to him - she still asks him about his children and wife when she comes into the office - and i have a feeling that my grandfather has also been downplaying her symptoms and stepping in and prompting her for correct answers when they have their doctors visits together. **my question**has anyone dealt with a gp that has been reluctant to acknowledge symptoms of dementia before? how did you handle it? are there any resources that can be accessed with out a gp referral? (for reference we are in canada)thank you so much for any responses, my family deeply appreciates it.**side note:** i have looked up all medications/supplements/vitamins she is taking to see if there are any contraindications or interactions that could present as dementia and as far as my research has shown there is nothing.**tl;dr: my grandmother's memory seems to have been declining for some time but the decline has been more rapid the last six months. our gp does not think that there is anything wrong based on short visits with her and will not take further action or refer us to any resources.**",,0
"well this morning was unusual. it’s been weeks since my mil had a bath.  smelling bad, everyone that stopped by told her she stinks.  her son was here for a week and refused to touch her because she smelled like poop.  my wife gives her a sponge bath when my mil will let her.  we mark bath times on a calendar so she can see the last time she had a bath.  the pads in the couch were covered in poop.  the whole house stunk.  we changed them everyday.  so this morning my wife said bath day.  nope. i’ll do it tomorrow.  that was it for my wife.  she told her mother to go to her room and stay there.  she said we will close the door and she can stay there until she decides to take a bath.  she was tired of the house smelling like poop.  well my wife won this war. she took her bath.",,0
"mom has alzheimer's, though i'm not entirely sure which stage. she has a memory span of about 10 seconds, and asks the same questions ad nauseum. she rarely sleeps more than 3 hours before getting up.here's my question: how can i keep her safe without taking away her agency and dignity? obviously, we need to keep her inside the house while everyone else is sleeping. we bolt the doors at night so she can't wander. i want to create a safe place where she can do what she wants to do without constant supervision and without worrying she will fall, cut herself, wander away, or start a fire.here's what i've thought about so far:when not being accompanied:1. turn off the gas to the stove.2. turn down the hot water heater so the hot only tap isn't going to be too hoy\3. get rid of knives, scissors, and glads items.4. put a gate before the stairs.5. setup motion detector lights and cameras to show if she's gotten hurt.any other suggestions?",,0
"hi there. long time lurker, first time poster.my 94 year old grandma has dementia. undiagnosed, but she exhibits a lot of the behaviours i've been reading on here. she lives with my parents who are not the most emotionally intelligent people. they get annoyed by her and never reassure any of her fears (99% of the time is being left alone, despite never being alone due to covid). my grandma is also unmotivated and never wants to do anything and obviously with covid she can't leave the house. she complains about being bored or lonely, but never wants to actually do anything. i am thinking of something to buy her for christmas that can keep her busy solo. i can't spend time with her due to my job/covid and asking my parents to do things with her is a hard no at this point. is there anything i can give her, as a gift for christmas, that she will enjoy doing alone? she's not the nurturing - so no fake baby dolls &amp; she has enough crossword and sudoku to last her forever. she can't use any technology - so no cd/phone/ipads. any suggestions? :) thanks in advance",,0
"my 86 year old dad fell and broke his hip at the end of august. his “friend” found him the next morning on the floor of his bedroom, and called the ambulance. dad had surgery on a tuesday and my sister and boyfriend (dads so called friend) didn’t tell me until friday. dad and i had always been close but had an argument in may (he accused me of stealing money that he told me to use for dental work) and didn’t speak all summer. as soon as i found out that he was in the hospital i went to him right away. he was so happy to see me we both cried. i spent the day with him, calming him down and reassuring him that his dog and business were being looked after by his friend. thanks to covid he was only allowed 1 visitor a day so my sister saw him the next day because she had to fly back home. the next day he was moved to a rehab facility. once there he was only allowed one outside socially distanced bust per week. my dads friend, my husband and i shared the first visit. then i had to return home. i talked with dad every day twice a day because i wanted to be sure he was ok and i was concerned about his mental capacity. sometimes he was lucid other times he was delusional. a week later i get a call from the head of pt calling to let me know that after my dad and his friend visited dad wanted to talk to his attorney about revoking the poa he had give me 15 years prior. the next day i hear from the facilities dr. the same thing and she told me dad had dementia and couldn’t make those kinds of decisions and she recommended i get an attorney. dads friend and my sister began working on getting him to move out of state to be close to them. dad stopped talking to me, and insisted i relinquish the poa because he made a mistake. he became such a jerk to me that i let him go live with my sister and boyfriend who has dad believing he is his son (my brother passed away 4 years ago after a lengthy illness, and dad was his caretaker) and his kid is my dads grandson. has anyone else lost their loved one to people telling them lies? is it normal for him to believe the lies they are telling him?",,0
i used to be one of the caregivers for my mother since 2011. she had cancer and she was paralyzed. she passed away two months ago. i am now the sole caregiver to my father who is also paralyzed and has dementia. lately his memory loss became unbearable. he forgets that he already ate breakfast and lunch and dinner but he keeps asking for them nonstop. he calls my name nonstop. i hear him call my name with a loud voice almost all day long and for the most part of the night. i cannot describe to you how that affected my life. i can’t eat i can’t sleep i can’t work [we are still working from home]. i can’t use noise canceling headsets although i have them because he would start yelling very loudly and the neighbors start to complain. i am too weak and too desperate to the point where i’m considering taking my own life. i haven’t even had a chance to grieve my mom. her death was a trumatic experience and we couldn’t even have a funeral. and now i am suffering because of what my father is doing. i completely understand dementia and i understand thats everything is out of his control. however i’m feeling hopeless. i’m contemplating into my own life as i’m writing my post. i hope to hear from people in my situation. how are you coping? please let me know. i am extremely desperate.,,0
"my dad took his last breath at 10:59 on tuesday night. we were told he had an infection about 2 weeks ago and on monday he had sepsis. i sat with him from 8:45am and held his hand, rubbed his legs, touched his face, talked to him and played music. (no idea how jimmy barnes got on to dads playlist but never mind). he knew i was there and he knew i had on a wedding dress for him. story behind the wedding dress was that we were going to do a mock wedding on sunday as we didn’t think dad would make it to next year. so i wore a white dress down for him. he hugged me. he squeezed my hand. he was kept comfortable. the nursing home staff were amazing. there were flowers, mum and dads wedding photo, a diffuser and music filling the room as i walked in. he was peaceful. i had a bed put beside him as i was going to stay with him overnight. i heard him rattle a little. i rubbed him on the side and told him ‘dad, it’s ok. i’m here with you. please don’t be scared. i love you and we will all be ok here’. he took a deep breath, exhaled,  and that was it. the staff said it was a beautiful passing and one that will stay with them as being peaceful and dignified. rest in peace, my darling dad. i hope you pop in from time to time.",,0
"i've been on here through various accounts. my grandmother passed from this disease coming on 2 years ago and i still hurt like she just passed. over the years during her care, i worked in healthcare where i'd see various patients, some with dementia. it ranged from someone starting to need care because they didn't remember meds/lived alone/disappear for days on end, etc. but two specific people stay in my mind, one of them having a medical chart that stated the title. the woman came in when covid was really just starting to ramp up. she was in a facility and i guess had symptoms after covid hit the nursing homes here. she wouldn't respond to her name. she wouldn't respond to requests for a name, dob, etc or to put on her armband. i did like i would do for my own grandmother and just talked her through everything i was doing (mainly putting the armband on and then adjusted her sheets). but reading that phrase-""severely demented"" brought me almost to tears. my grandmother never got to that state. she was able to somewhat respond until she fell comatose. she could say yes or no to whether she was in pain and even could muster a good morning every now and again. she knew us and even could name my godfather by name while in hospice care. but seeing this woman and a man a year prior who was in a similar state saddened me. this disease is treacherous. it triggers me when i see people fighting this disease, being taken down by something that could've been out of their control or hell, even if it wasn't (noncompliance with high bp meds for example), no one deserves this. what life did this sweet lady live before she was overtaken by it? i'd hope she wasn't a mean person, onery, etc. i so often feel i have deep seated trauma from the 4 years of watching my grandma decline but i also feel bad because dementia (especially how my grandmother left this world) isn't even the worst that could happen. keep your heads up everyone....i'm thinking of you.",,0
"from mid 2018 to early 2020 i lived in my family's vacation home while attending classes. my grandma lived less than 5 minutes away. during this time i would visit her almost daily for hours. her symptoms began with delusions and paranoia. i immediately knew something was wrong and at this point in time the rest of my family was on board with me when i said she needed to see a doctor. however as her symptoms progressed much of my family fell into denial. i witnessed my grandmother hallucinate, cry, beg to feel better. i witnessed her tear up her house looking for money she was convinced some man had stolen. i witnessed her stare out her window for hours saying she saw kids playing when there was nobody there. i saw her lose weight and watched as her quality of life dwinded. i was there every night and hugged her when she was frightened of the man who she said sat in her chair. i begged my family to get her serious help. i remember them constantly telling me she doesn't have dementia she doesn't have dementia. nobody would listen to me. i am currently 22 and had just turned 20 when i moved up north. my family saw me as a child. my words held no weight. the worst part is that they saw it too, they just chose to ignore the signs. my aunt and uncle lived next door to me and therefore also frequented her house. they saw what i saw, maybe not to the same degree as i spent the most time with her but they saw it nonetheless. they had her see neurologists, they had her put on vitamins they thought were her eyes, they thought it was everything but dementia and refused to listen to me. my family is large, very large. not one single person made an effort to get her the help she needed. i had no control over the family finances so i couldn't just do it myself as much as i wanted to. we have the money for a live in aid, we have the money for good doctors and facilities. i know dementia is incurable and eventually leads to death but i also know there are ways to greatly improve quality of life especially when treated early.today i visited her for the first time in 6 months. i moved back downstate at the beginning of 2020 and covid made it quite hard to travel.she did not know who i was. my grandmother, the woman who helped me through the hardest times of my life, the strongest most amazing woman i know, asked me who i was.currently one of my aunts is living a few houses down from her and takes care of her. i no longer try to speak my mind on her care as it was made clear to me that my opinion means nothing. i don't know if she's seeing doctors or getting the care she deserves.i told my sister how distraught i am that for so long my family blew me off and ignored me and know that my own grandmother doesn't recognize me. they finally admit she has dementia.my family has been telling me that i need to visit her more before she dies. i want to scream at them, scream that i was there for her every day when she was hallucinating, i want to beg them to tell me why they didn't listen to me, why they didn't listen to her.it's too late now and i expressed to my father and sister that i was upset that nobody listened to me. my father blew me off and while my sister was understanding and supportive i think she thinks i'm overreacting. i really miss my grandmother, i don’t know how to  deal with any of this",,0
"i care for my wife's 96 year old grand mother, being a work from home engineer has allowed me to attend to her over the last 5 years but the last few months have been exceptional difficult as dementia has finally started to bare its teeth ( i am very thankful that it took this long to start affecting her but it still sucks)anyways... we are on a pretty consistent daily schedule, deviation usually leaves her confused or scared so we have settled into a pretty rock solid routine. unfortunately she has become increasingly frustrated with the news and doesn't want to watch it anymore, no biggie, i think its for the better but in her state she can't fill that time with anything else but more music. it is now becoming a little too repetitive for her. she will only really listen to old era music, bing crosby, franks sinatra, nat king cole etc (i've learned to love it)... but we need to be careful because shes prone to bouts of sadness triggered by music that is, well, sad. anywho, i am looking to try and incorporate some audio books into her routine but have not had much luck searching and finding recommendations. i have tried ""to kill a mocking bird"" and ""pride and prejudice"", two of her favorite books from here formidable years, but she struggles to comprehend the story lines, which leads to frustration. i am hoping to find some short stories that would be easily digestible, clear narrators, clean audio and most importantly subject matter that is engaging but not to emotionally triggering (subjective i know) she usually laments her lack of a partner, so anything that focuses too much on losing partners can trigger this grief, so we try to avoid the subject. if anyone has any recommendations for books or short story collections, in audio form, i would be very grateful. i believe adding audio books will be a great boon to her quality of life, i just need to find the right material to get her interested and then perhaps move back and try some of her favorite novels in audio form in the future. she says that she likes the audio books we have tried but they are to slow, she gets lost in all the detail and just wants things to happen, any enjoyment then gets lost in frustration.the format of the audio book doesn't matter, i will subscribe to any service (we already have audible and we use the public library audio book service as well) or purchase physical discs or tapes and digitize them for her music player. it's just finding the right books that is the hard part, like searching for a needle in a stack of needles. it will take some trial and error for sure but thought that i would enlist the help of the good ol reddit community, to maybe help point me in the right direction at least.thank you for listening and i, and my family, appreciate any help we could get.-michael",,0
"hi everyone,my grandma with dementia had a fairly sour marriage to say the least for most of her life, so she often gets stressed or worried about things from her past. doing an engaging activity is key to starting her day off right, keeping her brain active on positive things, and keeping worrying at bay for some time. however, finding activities she would enjoy  and engage in has been a struggle. she can't understand what she reads anymore, she has a hard time understanding crafts you put in front of her, and she doesn't follow along well with tv. i've tried a plethora of things that could trigger happy memories from her past, but she wasn't a big hobbyist so i'm running out of ideas. for some examples of what we've tried and where she's at: i've had her bake a pie with me and let her mix things, knead dough, and roll out one of the pie crusts. she didn't exactly enjoy being put to work but it did take her mind off things and the instructions were basic enough that she could follow along well. painting a simple sunflower was mentally challenging, and she needed me to point for each place to start and stop her brush. caused a bit of frustration at first but she kind of enjoyed it halfway through. she loooves loves loves listening to elvis, i can put him on for a good hour before she gets bored and she goes to town with foot tapping in her recliner. i was hoping some of you could share activities that you find to be engaging with your loved ones? we'd be more than happy to try just about anything.thank you for taking the time to read this",,0
"i only found this out tonight, but this sunday (8/12/2019) the bbc are airing their adaptation of emma healey's novel elizabeth is missing.my friend recommended the book to me after learning that my paternal and maternal grandmothers both have dementia, and i thoroughly enjoyed it. so much of it i could relate to seeing in my paternal grandmother over the years (my maternal grandmother was diagnosed with vascular dementia not long before she was diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer; she passed away before her dementia really started to develop further).i highly recommend reading it, and hopefully the drama lives up to expectations! book synopsis (first paragraph c+p from [goodreads]( in this darkly riveting debut novel—a sophisticated psychological mystery that is also a heartbreakingly honest meditation on memory, identity, and aging—an elderly woman descending into dementia embarks on a desperate quest to find the best friend she believes has disappeared, and her search for the truth will go back decades and have shattering consequences.",,0
"although ""[dementia]( is often used interchangeably with terms such as alzheimer's disease or memory loss, it is actually an umbrella category of brain diseases that comprise more than 100 types of memory disorders.[dementia]( refers to a collection of symptoms that signal cognitive declines, such as short-term memory loss, language deficits, poor judgment, and changes in behavior.while [alzheimer's]( disease is the most common form of dementia, comprising 50 to 70 percent of all dementia diagnoses, some of the other forms of dementia we will focus on today include:* lewy body dementia (lbd)* frontotemporal dementia* vascular dementia* parkinson's disease dementia (pdd)it's important to understand the most prevalent types of dementia so you can begin to recognize the signs your loved one is exhibiting, arrange a medical assessment, and prepare for a potential move to a memory care community.## what is alzheimer's disease?neuropathologist aloysius alzheimer first identified the disease that bears his name in 1901. the most common form of dementia, alzheimer's disease (ad) currently affects 5.8 million americans, and this number is projected to reach 14 million by 2050.while many people assume [memory loss]( is a normal part of aging, alzheimer's disease is not inevitable. as we age, it may become more difficult to recall someone's name, and you may tend to misplace your reading glasses or leave your shopping list at home. but these forgetful moments are usually attributed to age-related memory loss and not necessarily signs of impending alzheimer's disease.part of the confusion around alzheimer's disease arises from the challenge in diagnosis. like lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia, alzheimer's disease can't be determined with complete accuracy while someone is alive.the biomarkers for ad — sticky plaques and tangles that accumulate in the brain from abnormally folded proteins, causing inflammation and cellular damage — can only be positively identified on autopsy. thus, doctors generally make an alzheimer's diagnosis by testing for and eliminating other possibilities.## what are the signs and symptoms of alzheimer's disease?ten signs and symptoms that a senior's memory loss might be alzheimer's include:1. disruptive memory loss. the inability to retain new information, forgetting important events, or needing to put reminder notes everywhere indicate a problem.2. problem-solving difficulties. mom can no longer follow a recipe she knows by heart, or dad can't balance the checkbook.3. getting lost driving to a familiar location.4. temporal or seasonal confusion: is it spring already?5. challenges with visual or spatial relationships: how far away is that sign?6. vocabulary issues: having trouble finding common words, such as calling a toaster, ""the thing that makes bread dark.""7. odd misplacement. it's one thing to leave your keys in a different room; quite another to place them in the freezer or dishwasher.8. loss of judgment. giving money to phone scammers, neglecting to bathe.9. social withdrawal.10. personality changes: confusion, anxiety, suspicion, fear. someone in the early stages of ad may become easily upset when out of their comfort zone.## what is the treatment for someone with alzheimer's disease?as with all types of dementia, and other health conditions in general, good nutrition, exercise, social engagement, mental stimulation and lifestyle choices that nurture the body, mind, and spirit may delay, slow the progression, or even prevent the onset of alzheimer's disease.let's examine them in turn:* healthy eating. here at the kensington place, fine dining is the cornerstone of our first-rate memory care. our culinary craftsman, tony ng, is devoted to delivering a mealtime experience that each senior will savor, not only for the delicious and nutritious cuisine but also for the presentation and variety. while heavily processed foods laden with sugar, salt and preservatives can actually [induce or increase memory loss]( the healthy meals tony prepares contain [memory-boosting foods]( such as leafy greens, cold-pressed olive oil, and mouth-watering salmon.* exercise. our life enrichment programs are renowned for offering an ever-changing calendar of events to residents seven days a week, from morning till evening. whether it's walking, dancing, yoga, or stretching, we encourage our residents to keep their bodies moving, which also [boosts brain health](* social engagement. building friendships and staying active has been shown to reduce stress, preserve wellness, keep the mind sharp, and increase feelings of worth, especially for seniors. and the bay area is [one of the best locations]( in the country for staying active, with parks, museums, classes, art galleries…there's something to interest everyone!* mental stimulation. while our life enrichment coordinators work full time with our core team to keep our senior residents active and engaged, there is a lot of options seniors can choose to do on their own to challenge their brains. solving puzzles and math problems, reading, and learning a new skill such as surfing the web, help light up the brain, decrease the buildup of plaque, and [keep alzheimer's at bay](## what is lewy body dementia (lbd)?up until a few years ago, lewy body dementia (lbd) was not a familiar term to the general public. even mds weren't necessarily familiar with it unless they specialized in geriatrics or neurology.however, lewy body dementia gained widespread attention in 2014, after beloved comedian and actor [robin williams]( chose to take his own life rather than slowly succumb to the disease.lewy body dementia is the second most common dementia after alzheimer's, accounting for up to a third of all cases, according to autopsy reports. there is not yet a cure, and symptoms tend to worsen over time.lbd comprises a spectrum of diseases involving an array of dementia and motor symptoms. identifying lewy body dementia can be challenging, because its pathology is similar to that of alzheimer's, while many symptoms appear to mimic parkinson's.however, there are notable distinguishing characteristics. unlike people with alzheimer's or parkinson's disease dementia, patients with lbd exhibit:* strong psychotic symptoms (hallucinations)* extreme sensitivity to antipsychotic medications* day-to-day symptom variabilityin addition, lewy body dementia is twice as common in men as in women (alzheimer's occurs equally in both genders) and is rarely genetically linked.## what are lewy bodies?lewy bodies are abnormal structures in the midbrain: microscopic protein deposits found in nerve cells that disrupt the brain's normal functioning, causing it to slowly deteriorate. frederick lewy, a colleague of aloysius alzheimer (for whom alzheimer's disease is named) first discovered them in 1912.while the presence of lewy bodies in the mid-brain has long been recognized as the hallmark of parkinson's disease, in the 1960s lewy bodies were discovered in the cortex (the brain's outer layer) of people with dementia.people with lewy body disease have lewy bodies in both the midbrain and cortex. lewy body disease patients often have the plaque characteristic of alzheimer's disease, while people with alzheimer's may also have cortical lewy bodies. this overlap leads to frequent misdiagnosis.## what are the signs and symptoms of lewy body dementia?many of the symptoms of lewy body dementia bear a striking resemblance to alzheimer's or parkinson's disease dementia. however, a physician familiar with lbd will be alert to the following signs that the illness is in fact lbd:* mental decline: reduced alertness and lowered attention span* visual hallucinations, usually related to people or animals. these hallucinations occur in 80 percent of lbd patients, often at night.* poor response to antipsychotic medications known as neuroleptics, which are usually given to people with mental health problems. in the case of an lbd patient, however, this class of drugs may actually amplify rigidity and confusion, and can even cause sudden death.* increasing problems handling the tasks of daily living* repeated falls* sleep disturbances, including insomnia and acting out dreams* delusions or depression* fluctuations in autonomic processes, including blood pressure, body temperature, urinary difficulties, constipation, and difficulty swallowing.if a patient exhibits some of the above symptoms, the additional presence of parkinson's motor symptoms can help facilitate a lewy body dementia diagnosis. these include:* tremors* muscle stiffness* difficulties with balance* shuffling gait, stooped posture, slow movements* restless leg syndrome.some of the cognitive symptoms found in both alzheimer's and lewy body dementia patients include:* behavioral changes* decreased judgment* confusion and temporal/spatial disorientation* difficulty following directions* decreased ability to communicate.since the lewy bodies themselves can only be identified by autopsy, accurate diagnosis relies heavily on physician awareness of the defining characteristics of the disease. a brain scan can detect mental deterioration, but not the actual lewy bodies.a thorough medical history that focuses on the pattern of symptoms and looks particularly for the hallucinations and sleep disturbances that are common to lbd patients is the optimal route for diagnosis, once other possible conditions have been ruled out.## what is the treatment for someone with lewy body dementia?being diagnosed with an incurable illness, especially one that involves dementia, can be an overwhelming experience. because lbd is a multi-system disease, with [treatment]( focusing primarily on symptom management, it's helpful to take as proactive an approach as possible from the outset. this means working with your physician to:* become informed. learn as much as you can about lewy body dementia and how it may affect your loved one, given the senior's health history, age, and lifestyle.* strengthen the senses. have your loved one's doctor evaluate each of his or her five senses — sound, sight, touch, taste, and smell — in order to identify and treat any abnormalities. then ask about exercises to improve them. by challenging themselves to enhance their senses, seniors will boost both mental and physical capabilities.* manage symptoms with behavioral changes. one example of symptom management in lbd involves low blood pressure (hypotension), a common lewy body dementia symptom that can lead to falls. to help stabilize blood pressure and minimize the risk of fall-related injuries, someone with lbd needs to:   * stay hydrated   * exercise   * avoid prolonged bed rest   * stand up slowly.* choose medications prudently. the potential benefits of any medication need to be carefully balanced with possible side effects that may occur. in people with lbd, the treatments for hallucinations, delusions, and behavioral disturbance tend to make the parkinson's symptoms worse; treating the parkinson's symptoms can make the delusions and behavior problems worse. however, depression and sleep disorders can and should be treated with medications that the patient can safely tolerate.## what research is being done on lewy body dementia?the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), a division of the national institutes of health, conducts and supports research on a wide array of dementia-related diseases, including lewy body dementia. the goal is to [learn more]( about diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of lbd. researchers are also exploring the lewy bodies themselves, in an effort to understand the mechanisms of disease formation and progression.one [study that made recent headlines]( used a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to diagnose lbd in living persons, with a high degree of accuracy. up until now, the only way to prove someone's symptoms were lewy body dementia was via a brain autopsy.## what is frontotemporal dementia?first described by arnold pick in 1892 and originally called pick's disease, [frontotemporal dementia]( (ftd) encompasses six types of dementia involving the frontal (behind your forehead) or temporal lobes (behind your ears).ftd causes the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, which control speech and behavior, to slowly atrophy, leading to an irreversible decline in mental functioning over a period of years.according to the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke, the following conditions are currently grouped together as frontotemporal dementias:* pick's disease,* primary progressive aphasia,* semantic dementia.while up to seven million americans may be afflicted with ftd, pick's disease accounts for just five percent of all progressive dementias. it is frequently misdiagnosed in the early stages as depression, mental illness or alzheimer's disease, because of the manner in which symptoms initially appear.## what causes frontotemporal dementia?as in lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia is the result of a build-up of protein in the affected areas of the brain. the accumulation of abnormal brain cells eventually leads to changes in character, socially inappropriate behavior, and poor decision making, progressing to severe impairment in intellect, memory, and speech.frontotemporal dementia typically strikes adults between the ages of 40 and 60 and is slightly more common in women than in men. while the cause is still unknown, there is a strong genetic component: about a third of ftds are hereditary.## what are the signs and symptoms of frontotemporal dementia?because the frontal lobes affect behavior and emotional response, people with ftd will usually show signs of changes in personality before they manifest evidence of dementia. this may begin as impulsiveness or a lack of inhibition. while the progression of symptoms in ftd is fortunately slow, symptoms do worsen over time.the following symptoms are typical of patients with frontotemporal dementia. more severe symptoms will appear in later stages of the illness:## behavioral changes* impulsivity* obsessive/compulsiveness (e.g., overeating or only eating one type of food)* drinking alcohol to excess (when not previously a problem)* rudeness or impatience, leading to aggression* poor judgment* withdrawal or seclusion* inability to function or interact in social situations* inability to hold a job* lack of attention to personal hygiene* sexual exhibitionism or promiscuity## emotional changes* abrupt mood changes* lack of warmth, concern, or empathy* indifference to events or to one's environment* easily distracted; difficulty maintaining a line of thought* unaware of the changes in behavior* decreased interest in personal care## language changes* reduced quality of speech: shrinking vocabulary, difficulty finding a word* difficulty speaking or understanding speech (aphasia)* repeating words others say (echolalia)* weak, uncoordinated speech sounds* decreased ability to read or write* complete loss of speech (mute)## neurological/physical problems* increased muscle rigidity or stiffness* difficulty moving about* lack of coordination* general weakness* memory loss* urinary incontinence## how is frontotemporal dementia diagnosed?as with lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementias can only be conclusively determined by a post-mortem examination of the brain. careful symptomatic evaluation, together with brain scans and eegs, are the best methods currently available for reaching a probable diagnosis. these techniques can help ascertain whether the presenting condition is likely to be ftd or a related disorder, such as alzheimer's disease.if at least three of the following five distinguishing characteristics are present in the early stages, the diagnosis is likely to be ftd rather than alzheimer's:* onset before age 65* initial personality changes* loss of normal controls, e.g., gluttony, hypersexuality* lack of inhibition* roaming behavior.also, as compared with alzheimer's disease, obvious mental impairment and memory loss occur later in frontotemporal dementia patients than in alzheimer's patients.## what is the treatment for frontotemporal dementia?while there is no specific treatment for ftd, a [supportive environment]( can yield surprising bright spots. for example, at the university of california/san francisco medical center's memory and aging center, doctors discovered a small group of frontotemporal dementia patients who [developed new creative skills]( in music and art. the artistic talents emerged when the brain cell loss occurred predominantly in the left frontal lobe, which controls functions such as language.as the ability to communicate through words declined, these patients' brains somehow accessed other realms of self-expression. so exploring and encouraging the development of latent skills is one way in which ftd patients can maintain their quality of life, and possibly slow the progress of mental deterioration.in addition, consider the following steps to help manage the symptoms of ftd:* sensory function aids, such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, etc.* behavior modification that rewards positive behaviors* speech therapy and/or occupational therapy* medication to control behaviors that can be dangerous to oneself or others. antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) may offer some relief from apathy and depression, and help reduce food cravings, loss of impulse control and compulsive activity.## what research is being done on frontotemporal dementias?the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), and other branches of the national institutes of health conduct regular research related to frontotemporal dementia. they also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. their goal is to learn more about the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and possible prevention of pick's disease and other ftds.the ninds is currently recruiting patients for a number of [clinical trials]( that will explore various treatments for the frontotemporal dementias, including pick's disease and primary progressive aphasia, as well as related dementias.## what is vascular dementia?conditions that commonly occur as we age, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, block the arteries and impede blood flow to the brain, creating what is known as [vascular dementia](if vital oxygen and nutrients can't reach the brain easily, parts of the brain die. this is called an infarct and is similar to what happens in a heart attack, or myocardial infarction. when brain tissue dies, the person begins to exhibit signs of cognitive impairment.while nearly as common as alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia remains under-diagnosed, in part because the symptoms mimic many other conditions.## what are the signs and symptoms of vascular dementia?the signs and symptoms of vascular dementia can look remarkably similar to those of other dementias.## physical symptoms include:* tremors (common in parkinson’s disease dementia and lbd)* leg or arm weakness* balance problems (common in ftd)* shuffling steps (common in most dementias)* loss of bladder or bowel control (common in many dementias in the later stages)## mental symptoms include:* sluggish thinking and forgetfulness (common to all dementias)* hallucinations and delusions (common in lbd)* depression and irritability (common in alzheimer's)* personality changes (common in parkinson's disease dementia and ftd)* confusion (common to all dementias)## behavioral symptoms include:* language problems and slurred speech (common in ftd)* inappropriate emotional response (common in most dementias)* difficulty planning or following instructions (common in alzheimer's and most dementias)* becoming lost in familiar surroundings (common to most dementias).## what is the treatment for someone with vascular dementia?although there is currently no cure for vascular dementia, by addressing the factors that lead to mini-strokes, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, a senior may be able to arrest or even reverse some symptoms, preventing memory loss and the need for memory care.treatment modalities such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help someone with vascular dementia to regain some or all lost functions following a stroke. in addition, some of the medications used to treat the cognitive symptoms of alzheimer's disease appear to work for vascular dementia as well, since many of the symptoms overlap.what is most important is minimizing the risk of having additional strokes, which will worsen vascular dementia symptoms.as with alzheimer's treatment suggestions, the best course of action is positive lifestyle changes. someone exhibiting signs of vascular dementia would be well advised to:* quit smoking* maintain their optimal weight* eat healthfully* reduce salt intake to manage blood pressure* reduce alcohol consumption* engage in moderate exercise* stay socially active* stimulate their brain with puzzles, games, reading, and other mental activities that help keep the mind sharp.## what is parkinson's disease dementia?parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is chronic and progressive. the hallmarks include muscle tremors, stiff or rigid movement, gait and balance problems, and cognitive impairment. non-motor symptoms can include difficulty sleeping, constipation, anxiety, depression, and fatigue.approximately one million americans are living with parkinson's disease. one of the better-known advocates for parkinson's research is actor michael j. fox of ""back to the future"" fame. now in his late 50s, fox was diagnosed with parkinson's disease at just 29. while most people develop symptoms after age 50, fox is one of the 10-20 percent with [early onset parkinson's disease](though parkinson's disease dementia (pdd) affects only 20-30 percent of parkinson's patients in the early stages of the disease, cognitive decline tends to become apparent as the disease progresses and the brain changes that parkinson's causes gradually spread, affecting memory and judgment.## what causes parkinson's disease dementia (pdd)?abnormal microscopic protein deposits of alpha-synuclein, whose normal function is not yet known, lead to parkinson's disease dementia. these deposits are known as lewy bodies, after frederick h. lewy, the neurologist who discovered them while working with neuropathologist aloysius alzheimer in the early 1900s.although parkinson's disease dementia is [one of the lewy body dementias]( (lbd), it is not to be confused with dementia with lewy bodies, which can include alzheimer's or vascular dementia (see below). lewy bodies are found in both brain disorders (pdd and lbd), which indicates that they may be linked to the same underlying abnormalities in brain processing.additionally, many people diagnosed with either parkinson's disease dementia or lewy body dementia also have the plaques and tangles that are the biomarkers of alzheimer's disease.## what are the signs and symptoms of parkinson's disease dementia?although researchers and physicians typically focus on the movement disorders that define parkinson's disease, loved ones observe personality changes in those who are developing parkinson's disease dementia.as the american parkinson disease association (apda) notes, the concept of a ""[parkinson personality]( is controversial, because the idea that disease could alter who we are makes us uncomfortable. however, states the apda, ""there is no question that the brain is changing because of parkinson's disease. because a substantial part of our personality relies on our brain function, it is not a stretch of logic to ask if a changing brain produces a changing personality.""## what is the treatment for parkinson's disease dementia?there are presently no treatments to arrest brain cell damage in parkinson's disease dementia; however, memory care focuses on reducing and relieving symptoms.the kensington place redwood city is uniquely positioned to care for residents with various types of dementia, including parkinson's disease dementia. our extensive team of health care professionals, as well as our alliances with community senior care programs and resources, make the kensington your premier partner in providing unsurpassed memory care for your loved one.because exercise remediates many age-related physical and mental health conditions, our community offers some parkinson's-specific programs. one example is energized fitness for parkinson's, in partnership with the [parkinson foundation]( and [genesis rehab](research shows that various forms of exercise, such as treadmill training, dance, stationary bicycle training, tai chi, and cognitive training combined with motor training involving stretching and strengthening exercises have been effective in promoting the [preservation or improvement of cognitive function]( in patients with parkinson's disease. treadmill training showed the most improvements.the kensington has also sponsored webinars on parkinson's disease dementia, such as [abc's of dbs (deep brain stimulation)]( in which board-certified neurosurgeon zachary levine, md, shares powerful, practical information about how this new technology can help seniors with memory loss due to pdd.## memory care as individual as your loved oneat the kensington place redwood city, we're committed to providing an optimal life experience for each of our memory care residents. memory care is our sole focus, which is why we have thoughtfully designed a memory care program geared for the entire family.we believe the degree of memory loss is an important consideration when planning care. we empathize with both residents and their loved ones, each confronting the challenges and changes involved with memory loss.kensington place offers a full spectrum of memory care support across two specialized ""neighborhoods,"" depending on a resident's stage of memory

"no idea if this is dads dementia or just his age (93) or what....but he cannot tell me the truth about his health. he has hearing aids, used to have good va ones but they wore out. he says since he missed a phonecall for a ride to an appt they suspended him and he needed to call the office in dallas to get reinstated. or as he puts it they dont want to help him anymore. he cant admit he made a mistake and call them.so he spent 5k for hearing aids at his audiologist and life was good. i got him to take his va aids along and supposedly his doc said theyre just worn out. i had suggested get them fixed and theyre a good backup. couple minths later he has trouble with his new ones and boom! the va ones work again. he has refused to get the 5k ones checked. he swears up and down they do work. just certain programs on tv dont sound oud. one day he had volume up to 80...freakin 80. when im not in the room and hes watching tv he keeps it pretty loud and then i usually watch a movie with him and the nightly news and every night i have to get it turned down so im not getting blasted. he tells me that his hearing aids auto adjust his volume and he cant tell what the real tv volume is. today it was screaming so we had a talk. at anything near a normal level he cant hear it. he now says his h aids dont auto adjust the volume. my brother had suggested a pair of headphones for him but the idea offended him. he doesnt want to admit he has an issue. he admits...again...he needs to go see his audiologist but this time i'll make the appt myself. i honestly dont understand why he does this. he likes his doc and has been using him for 30 years. i'll drive him over myself. i'm more than happy to help out but i cant do whats right if he wont tell me whats wrong. its just so damn frustrating every night to have to wrangle over the volume and his lil games. i get the same thing about his meds. he refuses to allow me to help with anything. he doesnt really understand meds and medicine yet he makes a snap judgemnet and thats gospel. his neurologist tried a new med with him and started at 1mg. he tolerated it fine and i thought it helped as he went off his walker for most of the 3 week trial period.  so she upped it to 3mg. unfortunately as he started the new dose he had a coke with dinner each night. he has sleep issues and a med. he didnt  sleep a couple nights that week and on the second time he ripped the patch off and slept...so he blamed his med. not the caffeine. was supposed to call his neuro and hasnt. wont let me do it, i remind him, doesnt do it. isnt taking any med for his parkinsons. i would have at least quit the coke and tried the patch one more night....so damn frustrated",,0
"hi. my name is ben. recently my mother has been diagnosed with alzheimer's at the age of 55. i myself am 21. i'm not used to redit at all, so i apologize if this post is completely inappropriate. in all honesty, i really struggle to open up to people close to me. it somehow seems easier to do so online.i also want to mention, i certainly don't see myself as a victim of circumstance. i feel like i may have caused my mothers condition. i am very uneducated in alzheimer's but from what has been explained to me, it was somehow caused by her having many small strokes as well as extremely poorly managed diabetes.  i have added to her stress and poor quality of life. i would like to explain for my own benefit below.when i was 14 my dad passed away from cancer and my mother was devastated by this. she fell into some kind of depression and stopped caring for me and my brother who has a mild form of autism. i resented her for this, something i now feel terrible and unjustified in doing. as time went on, my mother kept finding herself in financial trouble as she had no energy to continue. it got to a stage where i had to pay her mortgage and other debts to keep the house over our heads. i made the excuse that i couldn't go to university because i had to look after my mum and brother. in reality, i probably would have preformed poorly in university.  between my brother and mother always getting into money issues, i was under a lot of stress. eventually i started snapping at them any time some cold caller would sell them something or my mum went into hospital (i thought she was doing it because she couldn't be bothered to take insulin for her diabetes.) when i say snapped, i mean horribly so. i was a bully. i didn't mean to make her cry or feel like a bad mother, i was just so angry at her and falsely blamed my own faults and problems on what i though was her abandoning me.this has been so much longer than i thought and i thank you for reading this far. i know i am undeserving of any peace of mind, but where else am i to find it if not the internet? in short, all i want to know is, did my actions contribute to my mother's condition? should i report my abuse toward my mother to anyone, such as the police?",,0
"how do you cope with the endless crying?my mum has early on set for about 4 years now. she is 63. her and my dad ( her carer ) came to visit me ( i live 2 hours away) it's been a great week until i got home from work yesterday and she was in bed crying and upset. my dad said she had been in there for about 3-4 hours. i sat with her for about 2 hours, just listening, but all she was saying was it's my time, i want to go, ( heaven) i want to go now, i cant do anything for myself anymore, almost hyperventilating she was breathing so bad. i dont know how to handle that when she says things like that to me and my dad that she wants to leave us. i just breakdown. eventually i got her out of bed and she came down and sat with us for an hour and ate a little bit.  her mood lightened a little and she went from wanting to go home straight away to staying up another night and spending some more time with me this evening after my work. then i called dad about an hour ago to see how the mood was today, and he said the same, she didn't want to go out shopping or do anything with him like they normally do when they come to visit. she wanted to go home again. he put her on the phone to me and i calmed her a little. then she started saying he is mean to me, he is shouting at me. ( when he is not, he is so calm and the most amazing carer) like what am i supposed to do with this. when i say ""mum he is not shouting at you"" she tells me i dont believe her. i can hear in dads voice when i talked to him this morning that he is trying to stay calm but it is really tough to hold your patience, and i feel his cracking a little. &amp;#x200b;i'm in work, and i cant concentrate, all i want to do is get home to her, and it is only mid day. but , what is the point in me even getting home as i can't do anything different to what he is doing. &amp;#x200b;to make it worse we had an alzheimers tea day in work today and it took every part of me to not cry when the girl from the society was talking. &amp;#x200b;i'm sorry i am rambling, but my husband is away with work, and i just need to get it all out. this disease is horrible and it's breaking my heart.",,0
"long story short, i've posted before, due to covid and a few other factors we're unable to get an official diagnosis on my father yet.  he had a sudden and severe illness christmas last year and we had to move him in with us.  6 months and counting so far, not able to let him go home yet (his house is a disaster).  i feel really guilty for getting so annoyed, but it's affecting my whole family.  as much as we're trying to just deal with it and go with the flow.......we just need a f\*cking break.  constant noises when eats, yelling out every night in his sleep (occasionally really inappropriate things too, awkward!), the fixation on trying fix something randomly that just makes no sense (eg. a bike that was being replaced because it was old, broken, and had been ridden to death, we told him it was wrecked, so he spent more than we originally bought it for trying to fix because he decided he could - spoiler alert no, and now we have unneeded spare parts and a bike at the tip).  he decides to wash dishes then we have to rewash most of them because he seems to just wave them at the soapy water and they're left with bits of food or oil all over them.  he lost his old mobile so got him a new one, set it all up - now he's constantly looking up anything he can think of, and usually getting angry about: it isn't working properly (him pressing something wrong), websites, notifications, ads, errors in articles from 15+ years ago, wikipedia.....  and we always need to hear about it.  he talks over every tv show if it's not his thing.  he won't leave the room, read a book, play on his phone or just shut up and let people watch.  he sings, or makes inane comments that he thinks are witty or clever or insightful, or asks why/what/how while talking over it anyway.  over and over again.  then asks what he missed while he was talking.  last night he ruined a football game my husband and son were super invested in, to the point they refused to come back to watch.  and even when told point blank why, and that he needs to stop, he thinks it's some sort of joke. then does it again.  if he likes whatever's on, he has no trouble being quiet and just watching, then waiting for a break or the end to comment, discuss etc.  and then what he says is usually interesting, or at least relevant.  which makes me question myself about whether there's actually anything wrong or if he's just an a\*\*hole.none of us want to be angry with him, and looking from the outside it's just an old man being a bit silly occasionally.  but from the inside it's like death from a thousand cuts.  he refuses to believe he's anything but 100% right 100% of the time.  what i've listed isn't even half the little things that happen daily.  and i'm coming to the realisation that he probably won't be able to go home at all.  if he does i suspect it won't last long, for a lot of reasons.  suffice to say while he's not getting worse at a rapid rate, he's not improving.  he's not constantly forgetful, he's not confused all the time, it's not obvious what's going on unless you're living it.  until he was living with us we really didn't understand he's not been looking after himself for a long time, he hid it well.  our house isn't big enough for 5 people - it wasn't big enough as it was but we were only planning on being here a few years before moving to the other side of the country.  that's now on hold indefinitely.  we used to have family game nights, board games, old school video games and activities (especially through last years lockdown) to try break things up a bit and connect with each other (difficult enough with kids!).  now we hardly ever do things together, nothing feels the same.  it's like we avoid doing things we enjoy because my father won't join in, but will judge/comment/interrupt.  if all the above was only happening occasionally, i think we'd be alright.  but it's every day, every night.how do you deal with it when you're suddenly tasked with looking after an ageing parent?  when my kids should be my focus but now i'm looking after another adult, and i get so frustrated that he's so often basically like a bratty toddler?  i know no one ever plans to be doing this, but usually there's a buildup to this sort of situation.  it wouldn't be so bad but there's genuinely no end in sight to this situation right now, if we'd been anticipating this, we could have done at least a few things differently.how do you all cope, get a break, help your own kids and family, live a semi normal life, while dealing with a parent or grandparent with dementia?  is there anything that just helps alleviate the crap side of it all?  we have no family that could help, literally just my brother and he's barely a functioning adult at the best of times.",,0
"some ads showed up for facebook portal devices, and i was wondering how god they could be for relatives with dementia.i am considering getting one for my grandparents, my grandad has alzheimers and appreciates company although he usually doesn't recognise people, and my grandmother is her caretaker and is not good with technology (she can use the computer to write emails but not much more, and isn't interested in having a smartphone).i thought it would be good to have an easy connection to them with video, as both my cousin and i who are also caregivers to my grandad are moving away soon.we can install the tech for them, but then how easy is it for them to use? will they understand our voices clearly? my grandma has bad hearing and we're trying to get her fitted with better hearing aids. i've seen some hearing aids now have bluetooth, could that work with a facebook portal device?",,0
"backstory is my mom was a brilliant gardener before being struck by dementia. and a no-small part of my time with her spent as her primary caregiver, as we go through this evil hell together, is to attempt to maintain her garden. or her *ex-garden.*that is, i try, but, oh, with all the other duties, my *trying* just ain’t shit. i mean, it’s hard to just keep grocery shopping at all for her, one small example here, because she *needs to go shopping with me to supervise me* during that complicated process. hence her bright, cheerful garden of impeccable wonders, which she once so cherished, really cherished, is slowly going to hell. now it’s being overtaken by a variety of invasives, one of which *might* be the dandelion. i’ve italicized “might” because of course there are several other mimic species of dandelions out there growing happily, and some of the false dandelions might even be toxic for idiots like me to consume. but with the issue of their proper identification of the correct edible species — *taraxacum officinale,* the common dandelion, in case you give af— i’ve been eating the things.yeah, i know.they’re bitter. like me. they’re also free, as in without a fancy grocery price tag, also like me. you could say, perhaps, that we as voluntary, untrained, family caregivers of demented loved ones, or former loved ones, who are uncompensated, might be suddenly stomped upon, yet still here we are blindly growing our stupid yellow flower heads toward the idiotic sun, we who are furthermore common, nutritious, bitter and potentially noxious, we are something akin to wild dandelions.or whatever. anyway, you can eat the things, and after you’ve developed your tastebuds for them, or your micro biome or whatever *cultivates the proper gut bacteria* — they’re actually pretty delicious.stepping away now: am i the crazy one for *wild-harvesting* taraxacum officinale, the common dandelion, out of my mom’s formerly pristine garden?",,0
"i am living with my aunt who was diagnosed with dementia about 4 years ago. doctor ordered that she must not live alone, no rehab facilities or hospitals are able to accept her due to her aggressive behaviour. i am not well informed of how dementia patients acts out but i've been doing some reading.i understand that such patients will go through frequent mood swings, depression and even aggression towards people around them. they could be very misunderstood due to such behaviours.recently my family members and caregivers had it with her. she has chased us out before, even chasing my young daughter out while she was asleep. we are unable to take showers, constantly walking on egg shells around her. she'd lash out at us at almost everything. the moment we told her to stop (within 1 second), she'd say ""yes, say whatever you want. i do not remember anything anyway"" we also noticed that she is still aware of what is going/happened days after an incident. she could be really mean at this moment and turn around, call someone else to victimise herself the instant she knows that she couldn't climb over our heads. &amp;#x200b;my question is, are dementia patients capable of murder?i recently found out that she intentionally killed my dog, our caregiver revealed this to me (i was suspicious all along but did not have any proof). she never liked our presence, i've noticed that she will mistreat those that could not stand up to her, e.g. caregiver, dog, kids. it was a big blow for me after finding out what she'd done with my dog, plus how she has been treating us. i gave her a piece of my mind, as usual, she instantly became very sarcastic without looking/sounding confused at all. hours/days later she tried to go to another family member to act like she's the victim in this whole thing. could i be more understanding? can dementia make a person so heartless and two faced? should i be cautious about having her around my kid? can dementia patients kill an innocent animal without conscience? is it her or the dementia?",,0
"tl;dr at end, as this can be a long story... i need advice on what to do with my nana (dads mom). my family is a bit of a broken one, but we all have our issues... i really only have my mom and my dad and hey, thats really all ill need. everyone else in my family (grandmas, and uncles) are either drug addicts, alcoholics, or have allowed money to tear us apart. my parents do very well for themselves. my dad took over his fathers company, but long story short, technically my nana did some really shitty stuff, kicked me, my sister, mom and dad out of my grandpas trust fund and kept the company to herself. she ran it to the ground, my dad started his own company and took his clients with him and made something out of nothing. before he got back on his feet though, my nana made sure that she made my parents bleed any way she could, and i can honestly say she has done some horrific things that i have only learned of within the past 3 years. it doesnt help that my dads brother is hooked on drugs and manipulates her to give him money from the trust. my point in telling you this is to portray the frustration and anger my parents have built up for this woman. she is kinda truly evil, and selfish but....she now lives alone, in what seems to be an empty shell of her former life, and she has some major mental issues that no one has diagnosed her with... my uncle has stolen all of her valuables, and she has just shy of $250,000 left with a mortgage she has not been paying for the past 8 months.... so she should be evicted... she cant remember day to day... when i go to bring her food, she cant remember the day, when i last visited, or what im doing with my life. although she will give me the run around to make it seem like she doesnt have memory problems. she will talk to herself right infront of me, but its usually dialogue between her and another person like my dad, financial adviser, or whatever (but theyre not really there). when i ask her why shes talking to herself, shell make up something and say ""oh i was just mentioning this food is hot!"" even though i can hear her.... when i test her memory, she gets very agitated when i wont let her give me the run around and i insist on a specific answer she should know. my uncle has also stolen her car (although she really shouldnt drive). she never leaves her place, and stacks all of her furniture up against the door when i leave. everytime i have to shove my way in. she retains some things in her memory like her mom passing away recently, and my sister having a child, but she also thinks her sister is alive when she died about 13 years ago (before she went crazy). my mom and dad have tried countless times to get her to the doctor, and got really close to getting her to be evaluated, but as soon as she heard psychiatric exam she called the doctor a quack and never went back. they have no idea how to get her diagnosed or how to get anyone to help. we were hoping that once she was evicted, the cops would notice shes crazy and shed be forced to get help, but no one seems to care that shes not paying her mortgage. she gets letters, and people have come to warn her by taking off her door knobs, but no further action has taken place. so now, i bring her frozen meals a few times a week, and walk in to hear the same stories as to how my uncles is a jackass and my dad is such a horrible person even though all he has done is put up with her selfish bull shit for years. i dont want to go, as i have disdain for her too but i cant imagine the pain my dad feels having to deal with her so i just do it. they have given up on ways to get someone to give her a psych exam, and i dont know how to force her to get one done. we cant move forward until she gets help. she either dies in there alone with no comprehension of reality, or she is forced to get help. i would rather the latter, but im out of options. if anyone has any advice, please provide!tl;dr:nana is evil.cant remember day to day.has conversations with others (that arent there) out loud right infront of me.has no comprehension of reality.cant leave her home.need to force her to get a psych eval because she can fake being ""normal"".i have no idea how to force her to get a psych eval....",,0
"some background. my dad has had parkinson disease for around 9 years, he was only 60 and in the last two was diagnosed with parkinson related dementia. he is in the late stages, lives in a nursing home and he struggles to know who we are. now and again he references family/friends names and things that have happened in the past.  he knows my face as 'margaret' we presume it is his cousin margaret he is remembering.  i visit my dad once a week and sometimes will bring my children along. they have never known papa before illness. so have grew up visiting him with no expectation of him doing papa stuff and always know papa as unwell. i feel personally i have dealt with my dads illness pretty well.  i've worked in a gp practice for 15 years and over the years have dealt with numerous wee patients that have become demented and as heart breaking as it is i've always felt toughened with regards to illness. i recently got married with no frills. i only told my mum and my husband told his patents, no one else knew. out of respect and the fact he is my dad my husband wanted to tell him and i guess in a way get his permission. he was having a good day when we told him although he still didn't remember i was his daughter. but he asked about honeymoons etc.  fast forward to our first visit after we got married,  me my husband and our six year old went to visit. he was sitting on his usual chair in the tv room and as i walked in did my usual greeting.  i had a can of juice in my hand for him and his first reaction was to grab it off me. i told him to hang on till i opened it and as i began opening it he was still grabbing it and angrily saying give me it. so that was a little upsetting but not  anything i hadn't dealt with before. we pulled our chairs in. my son's birthday had been the day before we got married so i say to my son tell papa it was your birthday.  so he tells him and my dad just looks right through him and draws his eyes off him.  i don't know if it was the incident with the stupid can that added to my emotions but for the first time i cried while in his company. i got up from the chair and went to look out the window. my husband continued to chat to him but my six year old came up beside me and asked if i was ok. i smiled and said yes i was just a bit upset. he then continued to say you know papa isn't well mummy, his brain is all confused, it's not his fault. i hugged my wee boy that seemed too wise for his years. here was me crying like a baby and having my child comfort me by mimicking the words i say to them after every visit.  my husband mentioned we got married but he wasn't for chatting. he seemed frustrated and angry so we cut the visit shorter than normal.the reason for posting this is can any one offer advice? should i call him by his name instead of dad? he  seems to respond to his name every time. should i keep taking my children to visit? he has never shown any kind of relation to them and the kids normally end up wandering around the home chatting to the other residents. i just feel this is not my dad now and each time i visit i'm left a little more disheartened.  i wouldn't wish dementia on my worst enemy.",,0
"hey all! i've been a long time lurker and recently got myself an account. still looking for relatable subs.    anyway. i moved closer to my mother's side of the family for work and to help my aunt take care of my 83 year old grandmother who lives with her. she has been blind as long as i've been alive.    within the last couple of years i've seen a very quick decline in her health. she used to walk around the mall and go thrift shopping and i would always meet her for lunch at her favorite local buffet. she had a few hospitalizations and when she came home she fell and broke her ankle. hospitalized again; this time she was put in hospice. that was the last time she walked. all the while her dementia worstening.    i think it's a mix of the dementia and her blindness, but sometimes she goes on fantastic adventures. one time two strapping young lads picked her up and took her on a helicopter flight across the lake where she layed on a beach with free cookies and lemonade.  other times she thinks we've stuck her under tables or beds and are hitting her with baseball bats.  she always thinks she's holding babies and cats. or she's grasping at her skin and clothing thinking she's covered in ropes.  she never knows where she is and worries about how she will get home or complains how tired she is of standing when she's already in bed.    one time an old friend came to visit her and she went on this huge rant about how my aunt and uncle made her sleep on the floor with no pillows and were hitting her with a broom under the table. instead of arguing with her i just kept trying to change the subject and ask her about her children or her deceased husband to no avail. her friend was obviously rattled and i had to explain. unfortunately, we probably won't see her around again.    i try to visit her everyday and ""grandma-sit"" at least 3-4 times a week between full-time work and grad school. every time i see her she is always so delighted to hear my voice and i love every ounce of her. lately she has been asking ""why am i still here?"" and it's.. so difficult. to say the least. when she is lucid she feels like a burden and not worth our time and love.  but, as anyone with a loved one who has dementia knows, we do everything we can out of love and compassion. some days we may feel more loving and compassionate than others.. but that is all part of the disease.  so here's to us! all of you caretakers and family members are amazing and beautiful people! you go through so much to help someone else have a little bit more comfort and familiarity in their lives. you are selfless and no task is too big for you! but in all of this chaos, don't forget to treat yourself because you deserve it!",,0

&amp;#x200b;all the post, the sites everything i've seen online talk about ""keeping their dignity"" and try to convince them to give some sort or incentive to cooperate...i have not seen a single piece of advice on how not to have a brain stroke when finding my nana drawing flowers on the bathroom mirror with feces.  how to keep your head and your depression calm when on a daily basis your family member/parent (whome you love dearly) cusses you out and damns your entire family (in a very biblical way. dementia has not affected her creativity).you give them food and after chewing a couple of times they decide to spit it back on the plate or on the floor. how to avoid an ailment from all the toxic fumes you've ingested cleaning her room and the rest of the house from the times she decided not to go to the toilet and just do it there and cover it with a towel, no one will know.&amp;#x200b;i need some advice/help/support  with this window of dementia! how not to lose my mind while taking care of the person i love! i need anger management advice on how not to go crazy when she brakes things or takes in vain all i do for her. because she will continue spitting her food, behave in an unhygienic way (trying to not make it to graphic), all the while pulling my mothers hair and screaming because my mom happens to wash her. god forbid' we use soap on a daily basis! (why do dementia patients hate cleanliness?)when i see posts like ""keep their dignity"" it make my blood boil! i'll admit it works for people in the first 3-4 years of this disease i'm not a hypocrite, but my nana has no dignity left! she's the worse kind of spoiled brat that you can imagine (and i say this with love because we care about her a lot!) she's lost all contact with hygiene and she likes it that way, she enjoys manipulating and lying to us to get her agenda. she refuses to leave her room, she just wants to be left alone with her mess. i need to see some advice on dealing with advanced stages of dementia. and if there is none, i at least want to post this ""lovely picture"". because there are many faces of alzheimer's.&amp;#x200b;i love my grandmother very much, she's the person who was always there to help raise me. she has taken great care and provided very much love to us all, and seeing her in this destructive way is killing us all...very slowly. my mother has already started having fizical issues because of the stress and daily torture. and putting her in a home in not an option, it's also very expensive. &amp;#x200b;thank you for reading!i hope i shed a different light on this issue.",,0
"my dad has this beautiful cat who dotes on him and used to get 2-3 hours of cuddles from him every day. a few months ago we fostered a cat who didnt get along with his. they started disputing the house as territory and that means peeing. ok. obviously problematic so we placed the new cat somewhere else and went forward. the problem is that my dad is mad at his cat now because she was involved in marking in the house and is shunning her. for 2 months now every time she tries to greet him he kicks at her and every time she tries to get in his lap he shoves her off. he says it's because she was peeing like that explains it. his cat is now horribly stressed out, losing her fur and has started peeing on my dads stuff (either to drive him off or to get his attention, i dont speak cat). so he is even more angry and explosive around her. it makes it worse that she will sneak onto his lap and he will cuddle her for a while before he remembers and shoves her away.   he used to talk all the time about how much she made him happy. i am now prepared to rehome her but i'm faced with trying to explain to my dad why this is happening. i want him to remember that animal care takes patience and selflessness but i remember a few weeks ago when i asked if he wanted to wrap presents for my mom and he told me it was stupid and he never wanted to wrap anything again. i'm so worried that i will say hurtful things to him. it sucks so much you guys",,0
"hey. im 19 and im drunk and on mobile (sorry) right now following the reveal that my grandma, henceforth referred to as memere, is in the hospital with sepsis. the prognosis isnt great. she will probably end up passing.when i was a kid i would stay at her trailer and she still worked. she drove me to school. when i was probably between the ages of 9-10, she moved in with my dad because she wasnt quite right — but i had never known another memere.she would wash and freeze the garbage. she hoarded toilet paper and reeses cups in her room. she was confused and brought home a bag of potatoes when my dad asked for one potato for dinner. thats the event that has always been brought up as the beginning of “everyone knowing” that something wasnt right anymore. and then, when we moved into my stepmoms house, she came with. she and i shared a bathroom and she would come into the bathroom any time i had to pee in the middle of the night. every single time! i started locking the door and i would hear her jiggling the knob. it was like i activated her. any time she tried to use the bathroom she would end up smearing poo all over the place, somehow. i couldnt even dry my hands with the towel because it smelled horrible and was covered in poo. it would be on the walls.finally when i was in my freshman year of high school i hadnt been to my dads house in about a month because i was so busy with marching band. when i finally saw my dad and stepmom again, i was informed she was in a home now because she had stayed up about 48 hours or so during a hurricane. they had to barricade her in her bedroom so they could finally get some sleep.after that, we would visit her every once in a while. she was really funny during that time. all we could do was laugh along with her when she would speak gibberish. it sounds so horrible when i tell people who have never been through dementia but all you can do is laugh sometimes. we brought her a calendar of elvis pictures because she loved elvis when she was “alive” and she would look over and see the picture of him and do a little seductive growl. she was a funny lady! she had 8 husbands through her life…anyway, i havent seen her since a while before the pandemic. i sent her a letter for christmas in 2019 during therapy to assuage some guilt. i was told she loved it and kept it sitting in her room. but last time i saw her in person, she didnt know who me, my dad, or my stepmom were. she thought my dad was one of her husbands or her dad or something. the last i heard, my dad went to see her and she was completely nonverbal. except for one word. “elmira”. the place where my dad was born. she was milky-eyed, and then looked at him and registered something, and said that. it breaks my heart to think about.i came out to my dad as a trans man just before christmas because ive been on testosterone for ~7 months and my voice is too deep to pass off as “i lost my voice at a concert”… which, funny story, before i came out to anyone in my family we went to see memere and she said “who is this young man” when she saw me! unknowing trans ally queen. all i had done was cut my hair short. it was a painful process, coming out to my dad, but it ended up working out after a few days. (side note, i know my dad uses reddit and would very easily know who this is, hi dad if you see this!) i went to see him yesterday and i heard about how memere had a problem with her bank account being too high to stay in the home. at this point i honestly wouldnt have been surprised if she had passed and i hadnt heard, but i guess she was still kicking. she just turned 80. now, the day after, shes in crisis in the hospital. i feel nothing. im waiting for it to hit me. if anything, i feel relief that she will be freed soon from this prison. i suffered two losses already this past year that hit me a) immediately screaming and crying, spending a week straight sleeping and going back to sleep the second i wake up and b) feeling nothing until my boyfriend asked me whats up, and the same happened. but i dont even feel the anticipation of the latter. my memere hasnt been here for over 6 years. i feel relief and not much else.ugh. anyway, i just wanted to vent and get a little advice from people who know what its like. now im gonna go watch adventure time with my boyfriend. have a good night yall.",,0
"hi all, i've just joined to seek advice from people who have perhaps been in my shoes before.so, my granny was diagnosed with dementia in 2017 and for the last 3 years she has been in a care home.since she was put into care i made a hard decision to not visit her and keep my loving memories safe. but in recent months she has taken a steep decline. she is finding it hard to speak sentences and my dad thinks she now has the mental age of a 7 year old. she's really 'gone back in time', is my dads words. my sister approached me, who also has not seen her due to being too upset about it, saying she wants to see her and do i want to go too. the thing is i feel like maybe i want to but is the only reason i want to see her is for my own benefit? my peace of mind of a guilty conscience. its only benefitting me, not granny as she does not even recognise my dad anymore, and she certainly won't know me.. see her, her not know who i am, and to see her frail, confused and babbling. and then i'll just feel upset and even more guilty that i haven't seen her more often. but i made up my mind a long time ago just to remember her how she is. but i do feel guilty cos she is still alive. but she isn't my granny anymore, the essence of who she is has gone. the woman i knew has disappeared. but... when she passes,  will i live in regret and guilt for not seeing her whilst she was still alive?or do i keep the memories i have of her, holidaying in the sun, pruning her roses, taking me to the ballet and going on holiday to greece with her. i know this is hard to answer, as it is so personal to me. but if anyone has a story to share or some advice or guidance, i will really truly be so grateful.many thanksxxx",,0
"hello,my mil has come to stay for the festive period. its been a while since i have seen her and the first time my husband has seen her somewhere other than her home. she has been repeating herself for a few years now but is getting stuck in loops with the same thing 5/6 times over 10 minutes and then a small round robin of topics that cycles through the day. she isn't really able to follow some threads of conversation and will steer it back onto safe ground, usually an old memory from her childhood. although she has visited our house before and now been here several days she can't remember which room is which and gets lost looking for the loo (for context, it's a 3 bed... not a mansion!). there are plenty more signs but i am fairly convinced she is around stage 2/3.we delicately brought this up with her the other day and after some anger and a lot of tears, she admitted to getting a bit confused and puts this down to anxiety and loneliness (which i am sure exacerbate things for her) but refused to see a doctor. now we have had a chat she is hiding the confusion a bit less (for example when she goes into the wrong room she can have a giggle about it) but is flat out refusing any professional help as she doesn't want to be 'put in a home' or 'carted off to the funny farm'. has anyone got any tips or advice that we can try? we have tried all the usual reasoning but i think she is very fearful of going to the doctor (which makes me think it is worse than we know).",,0
"i am in the early days of dealing with the possibility of dementia with my mom.  i feel at times there is something off with her. something not quite right.  it's different every single day.  some days are good and then other days are not so good. the main behaviours have been mood changes and easily angered, some silliness, some ocd. mood changes - some days she talkative and other days there's nothing but silence from hereasily angered - there were incidents where she blows up at me easily and over nonsensical things. like i was preparing a parcel for sending away before and she went into a range at me. another time i was looking for a pan from the cupboard and that was another episode from her. another time i reached for a clean kitchen towel. small incidents that would anger her. another time she blew up at me over the laptop when i was setting it up. she has no knowledge of computers or internet and i was setting up my laptop to sit down together with her and she blew up at me shouting - 'i will do it's. silliness - getting me to do online shopping for her and getting me to buy her more shoes even though she has loads of shoes.  last year during lockdown she wanted more 'going out' or 'fancy' shoes for wearing to am event.  she has a wardrobe of shoes for such events but she wanted more even though we had no events to go to.  we were in lockdown.  i think in her mind she thought the whole country was going to break out and go dancing at each crossroads the minute the pandemic ended and she was buying to party. i don't know. she was never ocd when i was small. she is still not very particular ocd but she is spending a lot of her time cleaning and needlessly cleaning more and more. there's a lot of time and effort spent of cleaning.  it's almost as if she wants to maintain control. i know a lot of the time forgetfulness and confusion presents with dementia so this is very difficult for me..  i think there is some forgetfulness but it's very, very mild and hardly noticable. this wasn't the first thing for me to raise alarm bells. it was earlier this year after yet another silent episode from her that i started piecing together bits and pieces over the past 2 to 4 years with when i started thinking on the lines of dementia. i think she is going senile. every day is different from her. i am in a place where i don't know how to move forward with my suspicions. i am apprehensive about emailing or writing to our gp practice. we attend the same practice.  i would feel more comfortable speaking face to face with my gp to see if they could put a note on my mom's medical file to explore dementia for when my mom goes next. today i found something new with my mom.  she had a rack of clothes drying and there amongst some of her undies was a bra that looked familiar to me. i had a closer look and it was one of my bras for sure. we would be different sizes and we would shop in different places. i looked at the tage and it was my size.  i am plus size so my band size would be larger than hers.   my mom never does laundry for me so there's no way she picked up this up and put it into a load of her own laundry. there's no way this bra was lying around the home for her to pick up.  another thing is that i have my clothes and undies divided up into good wear and every day wear.  this bra would be a bra for good wear.  it was a good bra.  i remember last year when going to an event, i thought i had more bras but i couldn't find them.  i even checked my laundry basket and definitely a lot of my good bras were gone. i didn't think anything more of this. i thought maybe it's in a bag somewhere. and here today i found my mom with one of my bras. i am completely shocked that she has a bra from me.  so she robbed my bra and possibly even more as if it was hers. there's no excuse in the world to rob my bra though.   i know if i asked her she would give me an excuse of buying it in a second hand shop. i found her with other things before that looked familiar and she told me that she bought it before. it's just a new incident to add to the list of doubts that i have.",,0

"or some context, my grandmother has dementia and i live with her and have been her live-in caretaker for nearly two years now. my dad lives 8 hours away and visits a few times a year. 6 months ago my grandmother approached me and told me she wanted to get her will changed, to leave the house 50% in my name and 50% in my dads name, so it couldnt be sold without both of our consents. i knew that this was going to be a problem, but she started expressing these concerns to me when my dad kept trying to convince us to renovate the house and move her to his state. i understood where she was coming from so i set the wheels in motion. well we met with the lawyer, got the stuff she wanted changed. my dads visiting for easter and he handed me the property taxes for the house, a bill that ive been paying for two years now, and its all of a sudden under his name after 50+ years of it being under my grandmothers. it lists him as the owner of the property. at first i didnt think anything of it, but i couldnt stop thinking about it, so after a few hours of fixating on it, i asked me dad how this could have happened. the tax collectors office wouldnt make a mistake like this. and my grandmother doesnt have the faculties to do this on her own. as soon as i brought it up to my dad he blew up. he gave me the middle finger 3+ times. started screaming and swearing and calling me names. (very incriminating, i know). i told him that logically it doesnt make sense for this to have happened wwithout him knowing about it and without my granmother signing something. she is very easily manipulated and would sign anything my dad put in front of hers. however, he told me he has no idea how this happened and is very offended that i accused him. well he told me he wrote me out of his will a few months ago. (i'm his only child and he is not married or has any siblings) because of what ""i"" did with grammies will. but thats besides the point am i crazy to think that there is something fishing going on here and does anyone have any idea how this could have happened?",,0
"i don’t have anyone to talk about these things with, so please excuse the enormous length of this rant. it’s basically a novel. (tl;dr at the bottom for convenience).    a little backstory: i just turned 27 (female). about two years ago, both of my parents passed away less than a month apart. i was extremely close to them and took care of them due to health issues from years of substance abuse. my maternal grandmother lived down the street from them. besides my elder brother who is not a great person and is irrelevant to this story, there’s no other family here in this state. everyone else—including my grandmother’s 3 sons (my uncles)—live up north.  one son hasn’t been heard from in 15 years, one son hasn’t seen her in 15 years but sometimes calls, and another son saw her two years ago for a day and hasn’t for about a decade before that (and he calls sometimes).   &amp;#x200b;when my parents passed away, i felt obligated to step up to the plate as my grandma has been showing signs of cognitive decline for years and as i said, there’s no one else around. she’s 91 now for reference. she has that typical depression-era coldness often found in people her age. she’s always been quite snooty, judgmental, and unaffectionate. she had expressed on numerous occasions that she’d rather die than go to a nursing home and i get that. while i could never establish a close bond with her, i do love her and care about her. i thought that since my parents were gone, i would just move her in with me to spare her that experience. i am used to caring for people and while she’s snooty, she has generally been pretty docile. over the years, her vascular dementia has inevitably advanced and she’s had a couple mini-strokes (tias).   &amp;#x200b;to sum up her entire current condition, she is pretty close to being bedridden. it’s just around the corner. she barely remembers moment to moment, conversations go in loops, she makes up stories, she has sundowners, sometimes she thinks i’m her sister, develops obsessions about time/date/year/holidays. she’s stuck on the week of christmas. i don’t correct her and just reply simply. i basically know the drill regarding how to interact with her and i’ve read all about it on dementia websites. every once in a while, she will surprise me by having a good day.  &amp;#x200b;she’s pretty immobile without aid and a walker; she can barely see; her hearing is awful; she wears diapers as she is totally incontinent and sometimes has bowl movement accidents of all varieties; makes messes with food that are worse than a toddler would make; is constantly picking in her nose, mouth, ears, and eyes; she somehow gets literal shit under her fingernails; she has skin cancer lesions which ooze; her skin cells get everywhere like snow. she’s basically a biohazard. i spend so much time cleaning her and cleaning up her room/bathroom to deal with all of that. from changing her diapers, to dressing her skin lesions, to scraping under her fingernails. everything. i do it all. i do have sitters who watch her while i’m at work/school and i have cameras set up so that i can see her from my phone. however, my whole life basically revolves around her and her care. i can’t venture too far and have to consider her every need. i signed up for this, and i understood these were things i needed to do. it still isn’t very fun and is quite frankly frustrating. being caretakers yourselves, i’m sure you get that.   &amp;#x200b;the gross things do suck, but they don’t bother me as much as her personality. i can clean her messes all day, but it’s interacting with her that is the most exhausting thing to do. she yells at me for changing her diaper and tells me that i better make it quick. if i say one thing, she has to say the opposite. for example, if it’s her idea to go to bed…i will say “great, i’ll help you into bed.” then immediately she forgets it was her idea and says it’s too early to go to bed, and acts like i’m \*utterly ridiculous\* for bringing it up. another example of her personality is that i brought her to an adult day care so that she could get some social interaction. when it was over, she stated that she’s above all of those people and they’re all retards who are not capable of conversing with her on her level. honestly, she was the worst and oldest one there. i observed her from afar and she talked to no one. she just sat there chewing on some cookies by herself, looking lost. somehow she forgets every single thing, but remembers that one time i brought her there. when i suggest it again, she says they’re all too stupid for her. in other words, she’s extremely narcissistic and always has been. when i was younger, she would say similar things to me. if we were in a store and i said i liked something, she would say “i don’t much care for it. i have expensive taste, you know.” what kind of thing is that to say to your kid granddaughter? she’s just always been snooty with little self-awareness. she has to say “oh-pal” for opal, or “ad-ver-tiss-mint” for advertisement. she’s not from some fancy place, she’s from harlem.     pride is definitely her sin of choice. her hearing is on borderline deafness (she refuses hearing aids). instead of admitting that she can’t hear me, she says i pronounce things weird because i’m from florida and she can’t understand me. it couldn’t possibly be her fault. um, what? so i talk a little louder and slower (but in a neutral or nice manner), and she accuses me of yelling at her. another thing is she loves to play the victim. i’m surprised at how manipulative she can be despite her severe dementia. i’m not sure she actually formulates this consciously (because i cannot say it enough, her dementia is almost end stage) but it just seems to be ingrained in her. she makes up stories to suit her playing the victim to the two sons who do call. they don’t really care about or know me on a personal level, and they don’t believe she’s as advanced as i say. i’d like to say now that i know she has no idea what she’s saying or doing. it’s not her fault at this point. i do not treat her poorly, do not correct her, try to make things as easy as possible for her, am gentle with her. i genuinely feel bad for her and know that aging must suck ass. i always find myself feeling immense pity for her despite thinking she’s narcissistic. \*this leads to the whole point of me making this post…\*     today i put her on the phone with one son who talks to her a couple times a month, and usually she doesn’t talk too much shit about me which surprises me. she does talk shit about everyone else (her other sons, people she used to know, people she makes up). sometimes she talks shit about the son she forgets she’s on the phone with, lol. anyway, the point is that today i heard her say that she needs to move in with a better person because i’m not good to her. she was laying her victim story on pretty thick. this is the first time she’s said something like that. i honestly couldn’t help but feel super angry, knowing that i am basically sacrificing some of my youthful years for \*her\* after just losing my parents who i am still grieving for every single day. i change her disgusting fucking diapers, cater to her every whim, and i’m not good enough? i know she can’t help that she said that. i know she has no idea what she’s doing. but holy hell, did that piss me right off. i think it pisses me off so much because i know her son will think it’s true. then it will spread to the rest of the family who has no fucking business with us at all. i’m not really looking for advice on how to handle her because i do it all by the book despite the thoughts inside my head that i have expressed to you. but if anyone can relate, it’d be cool to hear about that. i hope i never get like that. that’s the scariest part about it all…we could end up just like them one day. if i get like that, i hope i’m one of those cute, old sweeties. i really don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings or be a burden. also, it kinda sounds like i'm playing a victim here and i get that i might sound hypocritical. please keep in mind that these are my thoughts and i don't usually express them.     tl;dr: after years of caring for her in all ways possible, gma with vascular dementia is starting to tell distant family over the phone that i’m basically not treating her well so that she can better play a victim. it upset me even though i’m aware she doesn’t know what she’s doing. also, aging sucks!",,0

"hello i have almost never posted on reddit before but i've found myself with a difficult problem. my father (64) has begun to rapidly decline, while he was always a little bit strange (some substance use in his youth having taken its toll on someone who already had a lot to deal with psychologically)  he has recently become depressed, paranoid, aggressive, and withdrawn. his alcohol use has also increased. his mother (my grandmother) who had severe dementia died about a year ago and since then his behaviour has began to resemble hers eerily--particularly in the paranoia and ""sundowning"". he is resistant to the suggestion that anything is wrong or that he should get his affairs in order, any hint that something is wrong leads to days of increased aggression that leads to everyone else in the house to fear for their safety. i don't know how to help him, or how to protect my family from him, but if possible i would like to become his  ombudsman and find a way to seek out care for him so that he can be comfortable and happy. does anyone here know how i could start the process on that even if he is resistant? or how i could convince a treatment resistant and paranoid parent to seek help?",,0

"i'm angry.  i'm upset like hell, ready to cry, and angry.  &amp;#x200b;my father and i, who lived separately before this, had to move in with my grandfather.  we all had our own cat, my father had two.  now i live in a tiny three-bedroom house (it's small, despite the bedroom count) with four cats who absolutely despise each other.  they're having territory wars and are pissing all over the place.  my cat is special needs and doesn't know how to socialize with other cats, so he just chases the others around, helping instigate the main two that are peeing in every place they can.  i've read everything i can on this and some things are helping, but only temporarily.  we were going through a great dry spell until today...    my cat fucking pissed on me.  i was taking a shit and he came up to rub his cute little face against my leg, then turned around and pissed on me.  what does this have to do with dementia?  here's the connection: my grandfather is incontinent in regards to his pee.  we have him wearing diapers, which is working fine, except at night.  he takes his diapers off at night and pisses all over his bed and the wooden floor.  my dad has talked with and yelled at him for it, but nothing helps.  there's no learning when one has dementia.  we have protector pads on the bed, but he tosses and turns so much that the pads end up getting moved around or he's just no longer lying on them.  we have put multiple down, but he somehow always finds a way to not be on the pads.  our house only has two bathrooms.  the guest bathroom is the only bathroom with a bath tub, so grandfather has to use that to bathe with help from his nurse.  all his equipment is in there so i can't shower there.  i have to shower in the bathroom attached to my grandfather's room, which means i can only shower between the hours of 10am and 8 pm.  oh, and the bedroom smells like piss.  so where i go to get clean and find some solace away from the urine, it smells like fucking urine.  i was telling a friend of mine about this and she had the fucking gall to try and relate her incontinent elderly labrador to my grandfather.  kindly fuck right off with that.  she gives her dog medicine and it cures the incontinence.  i wish it was that fucking easy for me.  what a goddamn insensitive twat. &amp;#x200b;thanks for letting me rant.  i fucking hate this disease and the way my life is playing out because of it.",,0
"to being with my mother was diagnosed with dementia (probably alzheimer’s from having a grand-mother go through it but getting her to go back to the doctors has been difficult) about six months ago.  at that time they called us and told us what was going on and that they would like us to move home (we live about a 14 hour drive away from them at the moment) and build an extra house on their property to be able to help my father out with the long term care that my mother will require.  me and my wife agreed and made plans to move back home in about 2 months from that time.  we decided with my father that we would take what is my mothers workshop (she does crafts for a living) and use that to live in while the house was being built.  at first this was fine, then as things started coming out of the shop my mothers attitude changed and became aggressive towards my father about the changes being done.  it finally came to a crashing halt about a month before we were set to move back in a phone call that had my father just say forget the whole thing.  luckily my wife could rescind her notice to her work and we hadn’t given notice to where we rent but it was still a bit jarring to say the least.fast forward to this last week back home visiting them.  my mother is farther along than i realized from the phone conversations i’ve been having with her.  she repeats herself sometimes within just minutes of saying something and forgets she’s the one that came up with certain ideas just earlier in the day.  she’s always had a problem with not letting go of the past and complaining a lot but now with alzheimer’s its gone to a whole new level.  it’s like all the crappiest things that ever happened to her is on constant rewind in her head.  this of course has not helped my parents relationship.  my father has always kind of just let my mother be in charge and given her a bit of a wide-berth on anything she had an issue with.  so now that dynamic between them is keeping us from going forward with any real help for them.  he needs help because he cant leave her alone and no one is there to really help him.  i’m an only child and they really don’t have anyone else to lean on for help.  even if he could find someone to come sit with her so he could get some time away she would just hold it over is head that he left her for how ever long before the next thing happens that bothers her.  i see this already aging him (he’s 73) and its not even been a year yet.  my mother can be a very sweet person but she had a difficult childhood and tends to linger on the negatives and isn’t able to move on or fully forgive.  so here’s my dilemma.  me, my wife and my father all want us living next to them to be able to help him moving forward with her.  my wife has medical assistant training and worked in a nursing home for years so she has hands on experience with this.  we’ve been renting for years and we’ve already been looking into buying a house so being able to build a house for us on my childhood homestead which me and my wife love would be nice.  also being able to help my mother through this would be rewarding for myself.  my mother has and even is at times on board with all of this, until she’s sat and worried about it so much that she freaks out on my father about it, and then when it gets to the nuclear level he caves.  me and my wife have i think been able to finally get him to see that he needs to take the wheel and make some hard decisions even when there is going to be a fight involved at some point.  he agrees but to be honest i’m not sure if i can fully trust him on it since he always does cave in the end, its what happened six months ago and i don’t know if he’ll do it again when push comes to shove.so now the question is how do we get her onboard with this.  my father needs it to happen so i don’t end up losing him from the stress alone and we need to have some stability in knowing how to plan our lives moving forward.  the plan is as of now for us to move back home in may and start building a house on their property close enough to their house to help but not so close as to be in their way.  the idea of changing any part of their house always ends in her freaking out eventually about it, even if it was originally her idea.  for right now i convinced my father to take my mother out of the discussion process of this as it seems giving her any information to dwell on usually leads to her worrying about it until she lays into him about it.  we don’t want to just surprise her with it but i’m also not sure how to approach it in a positive way but with the understanding that this isn’t really a decision she can veto.  if anyone has any suggestions or best practices in dealing with maybe something similar to my situation i am all ears.  i looked up a lot of best practices but those are more general and i’m in need of a bit of nuance.  any help would be much appreciated.",,0

"so to preface this there needs to be some back story. my family has been slowly dwindling since 2019 when my dad died then in 2020 my uncle (dads brother) died the reason, i bring this up is because these were the people who when my grandparents got bad were gonna be taking care of them the rest of the family is out of state and cant feasibly be expected to come all the way to take care of them, so that leaves me the most immediate next of kin. just a couple months ago my grandpa who i dont think has dementia (he doesnt have any diagnosis and isnt near as bad as my grandma) hit a motorcyclist while driving to the store and screwed his leg pretty badly, long story short theyre more than likely being sued by them and now it has fallen on me solely to take care of them. i do nearly everything for them they arent allowed to drive i have their keys so i take them 2 times a week to the store/bank/post office etc. etc.  the problem is they insist that they can drive themselves they insist that they can shop themselves (after shopping trips they thank me like im their savior because they realise how bad it is, but immediatly forget afterwards how much i helped) but if they did any of this for themselves they would have killed someone or been killed by someone. i dont know what to do anymore i know i have to continue helping them but i have a life and its taking a toll on my mental health and social health but what can i do. they call me every day multiple times a day asking to go places and i just cant uproot myself to do things for them every day all day its becoming a full time job that im not being paid very much to do i love them very much and plan to never stop helping them even if i dont get paid much or at all but it is hard, is there anything i can do to help them understand im just trying to keep them and everyone else safe?",,0
"my grandmother is now in home hospice for dementia related care. good that she gets care and can stay at home, nurses normally come every other day to assist. however with the holiday they haven't been here since friday and wolnt be here till wednesday. i am not there 24/7 only around lunch and dinner times, my grandfather lives there still. she is in a hospital bed and has been climbing out somehow and falling out, then crawling over to her former favorite chair or couch. the thing is the trail of brown matter, and blood from new wounds and all across the carpet. the hospital bed has rails and pads attached to the rails, but she climbs over them. is there any normal way to keep her in bed?i really dont want to dose her, but when she is on the floor and i have to lift her in, she gets mean and violent. today she raked my neck with her nails and bit me. last time it was kicks and bites. both my mother, and i take turns taking care of her, but the only person who can safely lift her is myself, when it's only us. granted, all of 80lbs now but last time i was lifting her excessively it gave me medical problems as well. this for us is not a tenable situation.what options do i have available to me? i've already contacted the nursing staff to hear what they have to say, as well as her gp, and the local dept on aging to hear what they have to say. but aside from the nurses, it's just my mother and myself, the grandson who didnt leave.",,0
"i'll skip to the main point - he believes he has a ""mold infestation"" in his apartment. he has been throwing away a ton of his old clothes and towels and blankets, among other things even including getting his couch removed as he said it was ""horribly infected"". the thing is, it is definitely just cat hair and other lint/loose threads that he is saying is mold. he has a cat, and therefore i worry he will never really get rid of the ""mold"" as it will just continue to come back.he has mentioned getting up at 5am and spending hours cleaning every part of his place and finding more and more ""infected"" places/objects. i'm worried because he lives alone and is spending so much time stressing himself out over something that isn't actually real.my brother and i have tried to show him it is only cat hair, even going as far as taking a strand of the mold and a hair from my brother's dog and showing him the two are basically the same. he refuses to budge on this belief and gets a little agitated when we don't believe him or try to get him to realize this isn't what's happening. so i'm not sure if i should just go with it in order to offer him comfort... or continue to try to get him to see the truth? on one hand, i feel that if he is truly not going to change his mind, then there's no point in arguing over it with him and instead perhaps we can just try to support and comfort him. on the other, i hate that he thinks he has to throw all this stuff away and stress himself out. and i don't want to encourage him doing all that if it can be avoided.any advice would be much appreciated, thanks in advance.",,0
"this is my first post here since my grandmother was diagnosed last month. long story short my grandmother needs to move. she lives alone and is getting worse / will get worse and we’re all worried about her ability to safely take care of herself, especially going up and down stairs multiple times per day and driving (we’ve all seen her driving ability decline like running red lights or getting confused on roads with divided medians). my mom is overwhelmed as she’s an only child and my brother and i live far away so all we can do is help via phone. we’ll talk as a family (without my grandmother) to discuss best care options and we’ll all agree she needs to sell her home and move to an independent transitional place with memory care help. then the first comment or pushback from my grandma my mom throws up her hands. i need to understand - how do we get my grandma into a safe environment without breaking her spirit and how do i get my mom to stay on board with our decision even though the road is tough?thank you!",,0
"i’m a 28/f that cares for my grandmother (87) with alzheimer’s from home. it’s undeniably been the most important journey/lesson of my life. from what i read-grandma is in the severe stages, or just approaching. she isn’t continent (but rare bm accidents), her mobility isn’t great, she is silent unless prompted. i go through ebbs and flows of emotions, and i wondered if anyone had any advice for keeping my own spirits up. sometimes it’s difficult to even take care of my own remedial tasks at home, as i feel like all of my motivation and energy is spent. i have had depression, but this is a different feeling. it’s kind of like i feel as if i’m lingering around in between the times and routines i have in place for her. is there any self care routines, or anything that could jolt me into some form of hobby/action for myself? what do you do to bring yourself joy while caretaking? also-grandma is in diapers and has waterproof pads for the bed-but it seems like it’s just endless laundry and urine. even though, i help her to the bathroom throughout the day many many many times. is there any techniques that you’ve found to make the clean up or the entire process easier? everything online is basically what i’m already doing...thought maybe someone would have something more handy, even if it’s a brand of pads etc..thank you..",,0
"i am pissed...i am furious...2 years gone and i still cry, i still want to scream all my fury and loss up into the sky. if you have the time, i'd like to tell you a story. i will try not to ramble, but it's a story that needs to be told if only to hopefully put it to rest....  growing up it was my mom and i, we had my grandparents and aunt and uncle's but they were rarely around. my grands were abusive and the others indifferent. my mom put herself through college and worked her ass off to put a roof over our heads... something i never really understood the strain of until i grew older.   she had always been eccentric, always a little off but in a fabulous way in most regards. we had the first home computer in our neighborhood, one of the first to connect to the internet..she loved art, music cooking and medieval history.i'm telling you all this to gain a grasp of her intellect.  my entire life i never heard a lie leave her lips or a curse worse that calling someone a ""nut nut"". was she perfect?? fuck no. i had been asking her to seek help for mental health issues since i was 20...i'm 42 now. i promise you this is all relevant.   she started really sliding down hill around 15? years ago. it's hard to judge times...like i said she was eccentric, i just thought my crazy mom is acting like my crazy mom. until it was more than that. i blew off a lot of what in retrospect i shouldn't of because they were very, very big warning bells. what finally woke me up to her mind truly slipping was that she could not remember what car was mine parked in my own driveway, a car i had had for 10 years.  a bunch of other slips started happening, couldn't remember my kids ages, her personality started to rapidly change... very very! angry. i did finally manage to get her to see a psych doctor. the list of disorders was almost a page long ( this happened before she got to far gone btw). ptsd anxiety depression were at the forefront. then the delusions started. 'theres someone climbing on the roof"" "" there's a peeping tom at the window'  she made multiple phone calls to the police about a random neighbor and a highschool friend trying to drive her crazy.   i became very good friends with the police.  i should state that at this time she was living with my alcohol grandmother as my grandmother's caretaker. they did not have the best if relationships at the best of times.  my grandmother was also a horder.  the situation progressed until the council of elders intervened. my mother's doctor would not listen to any of us, wanting only to focus on her diabetes...bitch the lady can't take her meds if she can't remember them.  she was finally placed in an assisted living facility. unfortunately she continued to decline at a very rapid rate. she would constantly try to escape thinking my grandmother's house was right outside. she got very mean and very violent even as her body forgot how to function, by the end i couldn't get her into my car to take her home for weekends.  i'm losing steam writing this. 2020 hit and i couldn't see her at all until it was to late, but really it had been to late for at least 4 years...that was our last really coherent talk anyways. i got to talk to her on the phone a few times but always set her off. i got a call from the home that she was in the hospital for a uti...later get a call from the hospital that i had better get paperwork signed cause it looked like she was checking out soon. ketoacidosis. her whole body is shutting down.  i run down there, an hours drive from here, covid regs so i can only stay 15 minutes and that's only because it's an end of life visit...fuck that. i climbed in bed with her, put on her favorite music on my phone and i laid right there for an hour. that is where we did goodbye. i had a few blessed minutes where she was there, where she knew who i was. it didn't last long but she hadn't known me in 3 years so i will take that time to my grave 2 days later she was moved to another hospital even farther away, i was told to come say goodbye again. it was an active covid floor so i had to sign a bunch of waivers and get suited up in a marshmallow suit. i called all the fam on video chat, laid down next to her husk and tried to be as brave as i could as i talked and tried to assure everyone without breaking myself.  i got the call she had passed that night.  no wake, no funeral..just me by myself going to deal with the morge and her ashes.   bottom line to anyone still reading...i'm still pissed. i'm furious something like this could happen to someone who tried so hard to be a decent person despite all the odds and unfairness and suffered so much before dementia got it's hooks in. i want her back. i want the time that was robbed. she died at 62, she left me in her 50s. i hope when my time is up i get to sock god one for all the people lost within themselves cause it's a living hell.  end rant",,0

"# antioxidants to prevent alzheimer's diseasea balanced intake of antioxidants could prevent the development of alzheimer's disease.[&amp;#x200b; this study was in individuals with the apoe4 gene(s), which increases oxidative and nitrostative stress, but it is true for all cases of alzheimer's disease. directly or indirectly, oxidation and nitration leads to a shortage of neurotransmitters needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness, stymies the regeneration of neurons, synpases, and axons, leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, and contributes to the death of neurons.the decline in internal antioxidant defenses (such as glutathione) and the increase in oxidative stress exactly parallels the progression of alzheimer's disease:""the hippocampi – the brain centres for learning and memory – are one of the earliest regions to be sabotaged by alzheimer’s pathology. our data revealed that gsh \[glutathione\] levels plummet in the hippocampi of patients with alzheimer’s as well as those with mci \[mild cognitive impairment\]. the frontal cortices – brain ceos responsible for a variety of executive functions – are chronologically affected later in alzheimer’s. gsh levels mimic this chronology with no changes in the cortices of mci patients, but significant reduction in those of alzheimer’s patients. interestingly, gsh remains unaffected in the cerebellum – a brain region unaffected by alzheimer’s till late stages. it appears gsh decline is not ubiquitous but rather a region-specific phenomenon that appears to precisely map the progression of alzheimer’s in our brains.""[another study from years ago found that peroxynitrite-mediated damage was widespread in alzheimer's disease.all the causes of alzheimer's disease and all the features of alzheimer's diseases are tied to oxidative and nitrostative stress. the few treatments which nearly stabilize alzheimer's disease for two years or more partially reduce oxidation and nitration.",,0
"(49m) my mother (68f) has been displaying chronic short term memory loss- and responding with nothing but gaslighting. denies having conversations, even text messages. i have had people over and witness instances (however small or trivial they may seem) but since i have moved back into the house (bad auto accident last year and lost everything, job, car, house because i couldn't work) i have been able to see on the daily, her actions and behavior. she holes up in her room most of the day, only coming out for food or an appointment. her bed is covered in calendars, multiple notepads and her mail with post-its. no matter how many times i repeat some benign things, she acts as if it never happened. when she goes shopping, she will return with multiple items that were purchased and not consumed from the previous trip (how many packs of 6 sponges do we need? three bottles of downey for someone who does laundry once a month? 5 things of garlic seasoning?!) this seems trivial on the surface, but i feel its more, because her mother and grandmother both suffered dementia. i have tried soft pitching a counselor to her, but she refuses.

"posted this to /caregiversupport but posting here toomy (30f) mother (69f) has alzheimer’s and has had it for several years now. we currently live with my stepdad (79m) who has always been emotionally and verbally abusive to me. they got married when i was about 11 and i’ve always just been with my mom so i never adjusted to him being in the picture. he didn’t make an effort to get to know me and as i got older our relationship just never progressed. since my moms diagnosis in 2015, i’ve stepped in to help take care of her while living with them and since pandemic working from home. long story short, the emotional and verbal abuse got physical this weekend where my stepdad grabbed me and pretended like he was going to punch me. i called the cops and had them write a report, just in case anything happens later on. the next day i found an apartment very close to their place so that i could move but still be close enough to take care of mom. i’m writing here to get tips on navigating this since i know it will be a difficult change for everyone, but i just think it’s something i must do for my own sanity. caregiving has been really tough on me as i’m the only child and our family lives in a different country. i shouldn’t feel anxious when i go home, but i do and have for a long time. i’ve tried to apply for in home care in 2017 but we were denied because of stepdads income. however my mom was 64 at the time so it was income based eligibility. not sure if now at her age would be any different. my stepdad and i tried applying for aid &amp; attendance from the va but have yet to hear back. i’m working with a social worker to figure out our options but slim pickings for our situation. mom is now in moderate to severe stages but can still do some things for herself, just needs guidance and someone there. stepdad is irresponsible with money and didn’t quite set up the rest of their lives so i’m trying to see what i can do or how to help. now, about the move, i know this will be hard on all but i’m wondering if it would be best to leave my mom in an environment she knows. whenever we’re out she’s constantly saying she wants to go home and she knows this is her home and feels safe here. my stepdad is not abusive to her as he is with me and my mom still doesn’t let anyone forcefully grab her or tell her what to do most days. i am signing a lease to a place that does have a spare bedroom. i am wondering what would be best for my mom or the best way to navigate this. maybe move out first and see how she adjusts to that? i would be coming here morning, lunch, and dinner. or just take her with us into this new place away from her husband and dog? any help, tips, suggestions welcome.thanks for reading!!",,0
"how spirituality destroyed my life and gave me dementia in 33 years i am doing this for you because i love you and because i want you to live life as i wanted to live it. before i die, i have to try to leave something behind as a warning and advice for people in similar situations. this won’t be a text that is well written because my cognitive abilities are drastically reduced as well as my vocabulary after 3 months of rapid dementia.but i want you to try to understand my point and the urgency of my insights that may save somebodies life.i am not a doctor and i can only speak from my own experience about the severe trauma i was living with. it completely controlled my life without me even realizing it. i will share with you how i analyzed the behavior of my mental illness and how it manifested itself in my mind and body.insanity and trauma are the most cunning things in the world. it is not a joke and should never be underestimated. apart from physical disability or illness that is honest and straightforward insanity is not as clear and it operates by deceiving the mind and leading it to destruction.if you are lazy beyond the norm and refuse to work, if you refuse to educate yourself and think success is not for you, you might be traumatized. if you think you are spiritual and have spiritual ‘’symptoms’’ that are not aligned with life and living, by being constantly exhausted, depressed brain fogged, you might be experienced anything but spirituality, but a manifestation of trauma symptoms. as malicious and occult as it may sound trauma can present itself as a living entity that is sucking the life force from you, leading you ultimately to your demise. insanity as i was living with it, completely gripped the essence of my thought process and kept me in delusion for 15 years. i not only believed the thoughts i was having but was convinced beyond any doubt, with body, mind and soul that there has to be truth to them. my emotions, my intuition, even my heart was driven and aligned with the schizophrenic doctrine my mind created due to childhood trauma. as you can see unfortunately this means that when somebody is insane the whole psycho physical, mind and body can serve to deceive a person. its more than the typical hallucinations, hearing voices, and having conspiracy theories that we see in movies that make somebody insane. a person can be partly insane and be completely convinced they are normal, just following a higher path that nobody understands, just like i thought i was. if the thoughts do not support life and living normally then a person should try to question if there is truth to them. there is nothing wrong with being normal and ordinary and earning an honest living. loving life and being grateful for what it is and not searching for some fantastical worlds that don’t exist. i never realized what enlightenment is and i don’t care about it at all. all i wish for is a healthy brain but that won’t come now. i would have lived so much differently.my ideology was belief that there is no such thing as work or human will, that those things are illusions and that they are ultimately not important for realizing the truth about the world. i was aspiring to be a homeless bum, living as a fool for christ in divine truth and bliss. i believed in the force of undoing or unworking and that it is like a black whole that devours everything and extinguishes everything, and ultimately when we experience this black nothingness, we see truth. i had many instances where i did work and tried to persist in my endeavors but believing i was spiritual undervalued my efforts, and the very meaning of work and success. voices told me that work and knowledge are not important and that i was beyond them. that i don’t need it to be happy and enlightened. so, i was willingly retarding myself and regressing unconsciously while thinking this is a good thing. after dementia arouse and started desecrating my brain, this illusion collapsed and i realized that such thoughts came because of an extreme sense of worthlessness. which i was living with and considered normal. when a person is traumatized, they live with extreme and abnormal feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness, that they consider normal because they learned these things and didn’t feel anything else. a glimpse of power and true value feels almost like death to their sick sense of self. and they might even fear it because their whole identity is challenged and shaken to the core. this is why work; knowledge, creativity and education are transformative tools for somebody living with trauma. they were the only cure for me except i realized this too late. the human will and will to work, and create, and love, and enjoy the successes it brings is a divine force, not at all to be undervalued like most spiritual teachers suggest, by saying do nothing or let go of effort. when people have trauma work is the only salvation they have to live a normal life. so, if you refuse to work and think its something spiritual moving you in this direction seriously consider you might be wrong. now i will share some of my childhood story and how dementia happened. my story begins by me being born with a physical disability called artogriphosis. i had bent arms and legs which could not be stretched, kind of like a baby is positioned in the stomach curled up, that’s how i was when i got out. however devastating this situation seemed at first, there was hope, because by exercising diligently i could walk and eventually stretch my arms half way. i had all the function and potential of a normal child. the problem came while doing the very exercises because they were invasive, complicated and painful. i slept with plasters every night and all this lasted for the first 12 years of my life. my parents while doing a remarkable job of straightening my body didn’t consider that i could be emotionally damaged by the process. and thus, they convinced themselves and me that i was completely normal, which i wasn’t. those painful exercises created severe trauma that was left untreated and considered normal. in my 19 year i developed ‘’out of nowhere’’ a severe debilitating anxiety towards life and work. i had constant feelings of subconscious terror, which were relentless and constant every day all day. i tried many things to help myself and gave full attention to my psychological problem, which was paradoxically, a huge mistake. in the 15 years of living with this anxiety i learned to live with it and considered it a normal part of me. the only problem was i wasn’t productive and didn’t work and live independently. so, i read psychological books and all sorts of stuff and came across spirituality and eventually developed the doctrine i mentioned before.in my opinion symptoms of dementia can come at any age if a person lives with extreme psychological burden. it starts the cognitive decline gradually and very gently as years go by so the sufferer can forget the pain. it introduces a wide variety of symptoms that mimic so many of the ‘’spiritual symptoms’’ i read about over the years. brain fog, constant tiredness, sleepiness, a sense of peace, beingness and bliss that comes in doing nothing and sleep and rest. so all these ‘’positive’’ symptoms were actually dementia in my case, mistaken and confused for spirituality. in my opinion anything that reduces one’s abilities and qualities of life should be discarded whether it be ‘’spiritual’’ or not. the pain never ended and i was just becoming dumber and dumber and more tired, and unable to concentrate for longer periods.  in my confusion i mistook these sensations as positive and even advisable which kept me in massive delusion. even efforts to work and keep my passion alive were diminished by an unnatural exhaustion that came over me as time went by. and then i thought work truly must not exist as i am truly unable to sustain my will towards it, this otherworldly tiredness is keeping me from it. it must be a sign that the force of undoing(dementia) is the true reality. that tiredness came from dementia and it was just an illusion and breakable by sustaining the effort. it might be unlikely, but if anyone identifies with my experience, my advice is to keep going and resist the exhaustion for it is a lie trying to keep you asleep. there is nothing spiritual and worthwhile in death and dementia. life is a force to be lived, not spent asleep and tired all the time.the final straw happened 3 months ago, when i took ciprofloxacin ear drops for mild noise induced hearing loss. i overdosed by mistake using them for 14 days instead of 7 as prescribed. even though it was a relatively low dose of 2 drops each day, the final day my system collapsed. perhaps due to my already overloaded brain, and combined with this poisonous medication i finally enraged and triggered dementia. now the decline that was very slow and would have kept going on for 30 years or more, has accelerated 10000 times. i presume i have about 5 years of very unfulfilling life left. i will never experience the success i could have had. the love and joy of life i could have had. it was overshadowed by constant feelings of ungratefulness and arrogance.  believing i was beyond this world and its preciousness i was watching it go by me, waiting for my spiritual revelation which never came. i was very arrogant and ungrateful thinking that things cannot possibly be worse due to my anxiety. incredibly, things can be 10000 worse than they are. now i have dementia. the only right way forward for me was to accept the anxiety and reconcile that i have to live with it like any other handicap. and do everything in my power to work and live independently. work is the ultimate expression of value and love towards oneself which trauma cannot endure, that’s why it does everything in its power to resist it.so, this is it. i talked about my life choices and some spiritual traps that people might fall into. i feel very vulnerable writing this and even a bit stupid, wondering who on earth will want to read this depressive story, but honestly id give anything if somebody told me in the right moment how wrong i was. for years nothing could sway me from my stubborn convictions. the world is getting increasingly more insane as we can witness. spiritually can be the source of massive confusion as well, and by me interpreting it the wrong way, or actually falling for its lies i ended up like this. i wish i had never read anything about it. you might argue that its not my fault for getting these severe side effects from that drug. in a way you would be right but its the life choices and ideology that led to this. my unwillingness to educate myself and work left me underdeveloped. i didn’t know that antibiotic in topical form is still dangerous, i didn’t follow the prescription, i didn’t research the side effects properly, so all these mistakes led to this. the ideology of undoing and not knowing, that false spirituality that i had so much faith in and surrendered completely to, destroyed me in the end. it was insanity and trauma and dementia taking form of something incredibly valuable to me.farewell friends or enemies, i do hope this gives some value to anyone and people can at least learn from my mistakes. some key points:work, knowledge and creativity is more than means to an end. it can transform our life and destroy trauma and mental illness. because they represent love and support life. they are life.perfectionism and working eternally on your issues, waiting to first solve them and then return to the world, is trauma keeping you enslaved in eternal rumination which leads to nowhere. the only way is to ignore it. work, be creative, learn about history, geography, economy medicine, science... each day enrich your mind little by little. keep dementia away, keep ignorance away. massive suffering can naturally create symptoms of dementia like brain fog, forgetfulness and a false sense of peace that comes from oblivion, as well as sleepiness. don’t satisfy yourself by thinking this as a spiritual symptom. enlightenment if it exists might require force and enormous willpower contrary to much of the gurus say. not surrendering helplessly to the void and waiting for things to change. wake up by force, resist the antilife forces of the world. insanity can take form of some of our most precious values and ideas like spirituality, love, religion, trust, hope, etc. it can trick and turn them against us. sometimes you can’t trust your own mind, your emotions, your intuition, even your body that can create feelings of exhaustion. especially if it tells you to be homeless and renounce the world like it told me. its more than just a thought that keeps us in delusion.some chronic traumas only get worse over time, it won’t solve by itself no matter how long your ‘’spiritual process’’ lasts. and if you are destined to live with it, live the best and most fulfilling life you can. live now. don’t sleep and rely on dementia to take you.if you don’t work or know anything, and you depend on somebody to work and provide for you, you still won’t survive. because such a lifestyle attracts natural catastrophes and disasters in form of disease, dementia, insanity or disability. you are never safe by being stupid. it can cost you your life like it did me. love and gratitude is most important. learning from ‘’ordinary’’ people enjoying their company respecting and appreciating them. just being normal is the best thing in the world, and not being narcissistic. i unconsciously thought i was better than everyone. now i see ‘’enlightenment’’ in everyone. we are just great as we are, trying our best to go by and nothing more is ever needed. i’m sorry. you can’t imagine how sorry i am. i wasted my life for an illusion.i was insane, i was misled. may god forgive me, may you forgive me, may the world forgive me. i failed to live. i was confused and alone, marked by misfortune. if there is another life, i will never make the same mistake again. be well and farewellphillip",,0
"“[insert name here] has been diagnosed with dementia”my grandad on my mums side was diagnosed with parkinson’s about 4-5 years ago, and with that came parkinson’s-related dementia. i’ve had the complete misfortune of watching my childhood role model, my loving grandad, go through this awful disease. watching him forget who i am and not recognise me, watching him lose his ability to stand up let alone walk, having to be there and help get him stripped off and into bed at night, let’s just say it’s not been a very nice experience. and now today, i heard those damn words again. it’s like it tore a knife through my heart, my nan on my dads side has been recently diagnosed with dementia. i’m not sure which kind as i don’t speak to my dad and have only heard limited info, but it just fucking sucks man. i’ve never had any close relatives die, but i feel like i’ve already lost one and it won’t be long before i lose another now. i’ve always hated dementia, even before my grandad received his diagnosis, i always thought what a cruel disease it is, not only affecting the individual but forcing their families to watch it happen and be forgotten about. i never considered i’d have to witness it myself with anyone let alone two of my grandparents. it seems like it’s always those who don’t deserve it that develop these illnesses. i’m not looking for any advice or information, i just had to get this off my chest. nobody i know has been through it so i don’t really have many people to discuss it with other than family. thanks.",,0

"***some background info:***my boyfriend of 3 years father who is 57 was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia in middle of 2018. the first year(2019) his ability to work declined and my boyfriend had to take over his business. the second year(2020) the ability to drive is completely gone and his speech is limited to only a short vocabulary.. ""that thing"" is what he refers to everything and it is starting to become difficult to understand him.his father had a heart attack in 2014 which my boyfriend thinks that it is connected to his dads dementia and his dad is also a marine vet but did not see combat. **chain smoking+ rant** his dad has been a smoker since his teenage years. how does he still do it though?? he has been smoking a lot more now since he can not drive where he wants but now he cant even walk by himself anymore since he recently watched a women changing through her window from the street and asked her if he could come in but unfortunately the women and her husband are ex-fbi agents and have no intellingence to care about the fact that he has dementia but no..they would rather waste yours and mine tax dollars on a useless investigation .......anways they are assholes.is there a point where they forget or just stop smoking? the ciggarettes are worsing him everyday and its to a point where the other night he was doing laundry and i heard the dryer go on and off probably over 20 times...his dad was checking the clothes to see if they were dried yet but would only allow it to dry for 30 seconds and would check to see if they were dried yet before puting them back in the dryer and restarting it again and that went on for like 10 minutes... of course he has been doing some really questionable things lately, like putting a glass of water in the cabinet or leftover eggs in a kitchen draw.. his dad vents to me a lot. i am a people pleaser/empath/healer which is why i think he finds comfort in telling me things or let alone being around me. he mostly tells me that everyone is harassing him and tell me his accomplishments of cleaning up the house. my heart hurts for him.. i feel so bad to a point where i feel so much pain.. his family isnt taking this well at all.. i try to remind my boyfriend that its the disease and not him but man...its hard on him...his mom is all favoring of his brother who is 2 years older than him and his dad always favored my boyfriend... my boyfriend seems to be trying the most in being there for his dad...but at the same time its breaking his heart everyday...any advice would be really helpful of what to except or any type of advice...i just wish i could do more for the whole family.. i wish they weren't so mean to him but i cant blame them sometimes because man....its bad...the anger is the worst and the loud outburst are traumatic.. this is probably one of the worst things to go through as a family/friends and my heart breaks everyday...i have no words but only tears...",,0
"long story longmom has lewy body dementia, not severe enough to qualify for a home. but hallucinations, poor executive functioning, sun downs, looses her words, etc. dad has schizophrenia which is moderately managed. they are still married, live out in the country, no uber/taxi services. dad hallucinates has hx of multiple car wrecks. mom no longer can drive (hallucinations, poor executive function). no family other than my brother and i. he live 30min away full time work and a family. i’m an hour away part time work with 2 small kids. parents have no money to speak of, insist on staying in their home. we gutted the house so they can easily live on one floor. so that’s not a problem.the problem is they refuse to take any steps towards finding what services they qualify for. we have taken them to lawyers, set them up with social workers. they just nod their heads and say they will get to it and then do nothing. just to add here, if we get legal poa (which i don’t think would be too much of a stretch) it would effectively end our relationship with mom, she wouldn’t forgive us. although i know that time will come.this leaves my bother and i (mostly him due to proximity unfortunately) to do everything. which my mom resents, until she is expecting something that we didn’t get done. my brother and i had resigned to live and let live. go up once a week we would alternate and bring groceries make sure the house hadn’t burnt down and do light cleaning.until she called me this weekend and told me she wanted to kill herself becuse i have taken all of her freedoms (referring to her ability to drive). i stopped the conversation to clarify that i heard her correctly. she confirmed it. then said the same thing to my dad when i got off the phone. i called her doctors (i have medical poa) and headed to her house. she was hysterical thinking we were going to lock her up in a psych ward (detour here, my dad has had multiple suicide attempts, and didn’t even tell us mom was considering it until we drug it out of him)i was super pissed, and hurt that she was going to put this on me. but after a few days i feel like i understand better. she has a shitty quality of life, and i know she can tell i am having a hard time being around her. it’s very hard to enjoy her company when all that’s happening is us going around in circles about her care/driving/money. i just don’t want to deal with that aspect. i’d like to enjoy what time we have left together. but it’s all she wants to focus on. also i don’t blame her for feeling that way, i think i’m going to ask her this week when i go up if she wants to talk with her doctors about assisted suicide. i really don’t want to ask that question, but i also wouldn’t want to live with my mind failing me.guys i don’t know what if any advice i’m looking for here, i think i just needed to vent.thanks for reading",,0
"howdy, this is a master post of what i've learned about caring for a relative with dementia.  i'm not a health care professional, i've just been through this four times and want a post to give to those who are new. this post combines six other posts.  constructive criticism is welcome.  it's written without covid in mind; it changes things, of course, but most of this is still applicable now and the rest will be again.  there's not a lot of sugar-coating here so if you're in a bad headspace, read this later.  dementia is a progressive, incurable disease that results in death.  half of everyone who lives long enough will develop dementia.  there are multiple types of dementia, but absolute diagnosis of the specific type usually cannot be made until after death.  specific things will make dementia worse: infections, dehydration, surgery, radiation/chemo, hospital stays, changes in routine, traveling, broken bones, alcoholism, etc.  most sufferer's progressions follow a similar pattern, but everyone's specific journey will be different.  note that this progression can take months or decades.  there are things that can be done, we think, to prolong or prevent the onset of dementia symptoms.  a diet low in sugar and alcohol but high on plants and fiber like the mediterranean diet can help.  exercise is essential.  those who speak two languages are half as likely to develop dementia, and people with higher educational attainment develop debilitating symptoms much later than those with less educational attainment. &amp;#x200b;# begin the journeyonce you suspect dementia, get your elder the best long term care insurance you can find.  use their most recent physical you can get; if it's too old, get a new one asap.  do not mention to the doc your suspicions about memory issues; family seems to pick up on these 1-5 years before they show up on the actual diagnostics, and it'd stop you from getting good ltc insurance.  read the contract and see how long you have to wait to get a dementia diagnosis after the policy goes into effect, so to not invalidate the insurance. this is the time to get your legal paperwork in order.  get your power of attorney or equivalent, and get the different forms the different institutions require.  your bank will usually have a notary on hand who can notarize things for you.  speaking of banks, consider moving finances to a credit union.  cus are non-profit: they don't make money off you by charging fees.  this small difference every month can save a lot of money for later, when you really might need it.  care homes are expensive.  also, get your long term directives in order.  what does your elder consider important to her quality of life?  what daily activities does she consider necessary: if she can't do that, it's not worth it?  does she want cpr?  life support?  for how long?  how does she want her body handled?  where to be buried/ashes to be scattered?  your doctor may have a booklet that will help you go through all of this, which can be filled out, notarized, and filed with your doctor/hospital so they have to honor her wishes. then get a dementia diagnosis.  many times a simple problem like a uti or other infection can appear as dementia-like symptoms, so rule out other (solvable) problems first.  if your relative is resistant to going to the doctor, offer to take them out to lunch, or ask them to keep you company while you get a prescription from the hospital's pharmacy, and then take them to their appointment.  yes, it's devious, but nothing happens without a diagnosis.  once you're sure of dementia talk with your resources both professional and family.  your healthcare may have a memory care or elder care group that can help you understand what's going on and what's going to happen.  bring your relatives, or bring them back the brochures.  there will be a lot of very difficult questions from relatives/friends who are not in the loop, such as ""what can we do"" and  ""what's the cure"".  the answers are ""take care of her until she dies"" and ""there isn't a cure"", which they won't like to hear, but will have to accept from the professionals.  so having someone else answer those questions is usually a lot easier.  if they know generally what the progression is you're less likely to come up against issues with them later.  so many relatives think ""oh, they're just hanging with grandma, how nice!"", when the truth is so much darker.  half of all caregivers will develop diseases or die while caregiving; it's often one of the worst, most stressful things we will do in our lives.  get a support group going for yourself, early, while you're still able to find time.  get a therapist if you can.  look around for what help is available where you are.  you go to [alz.org]( and use their resources.  out where i am we have a lot of local resources for home care and supplemental care, i hope you have the same or better.  you can find this by searching for ""elder care"" and your city, county, country, province, etc.  day care, respite care, and other programs are, frankly, essential. this part is important and ongoing.  start looking at where she is in the progression of the disease and make plans for the next step.  not planning for the future is the biggest mistake most families make.  they're so incredibly busy just barely taking care of today's needs that they're not ready for the next step.  my aunt was  literally hoisting my grandmother onto her back to get her from her bedroom to her chair in the front room, and then took care of her during  the day... and that was all she could do.  when grandma caught a cold, the coughing kept her from holding onto my aunt's shoulders so she couldn't get out of bed.  that led to the beginning of bedsores, so she had to go to the hospital.  instead of letting it get to that point aunt should have had in-home carers, lifts, equipment, supportive mattresses... so many things would have made life easier for both of them.  but aunt was too busy -- or overwhelmed -- with the massive job of caregiving.  prepare for the next step while you can. apply for government-paid in-home caring/recompense/assistance now, because by the time your requests are approved, she'll probably need them.  apply for a place at the best memory care facility you can find/afford now, because you can decline placement over and over and over, and just be put back at the head of the list for the next available spot.  during covid we found that the places with union workers had the lowest numbers for covid infections, controlling for many variables, due to the workers having access to ppe, so that's a consideration you might want to look for.  your country/states' department of social services will probably have a rating on all their care homes that might be helpful. many places are big enough that they provide multiple services, from respite to simple assisted living to locked wards, often via different wings.  respite is like checking your elder into a hotel for a weekend: the facility will take your elder for a bit to give you a break, and will help familiarize her with the facility.  these facilities will be able to transition your elder from one stage to the other via professionals.  this is very helpful because caregivers just compensate and compensate and compensate, burning themselves out far past the point where they should have transitioned.  keep in mind that these places run from 60k to 200k per year.  that insane price, along with the proof that elders are healthier longer at home, are why most people keep their elders at home with them for much longer than we used to.  but sometimes a care home is just necessary.  there are placement services which will take your elder's requirements (ostomy care, diabetes, hoyer lifts, meds, etc), distance from your home, and prices into consideration and get you a list of facilities.  they're very helpful and usually take recompense from the homes themselves so they don't cost you anything. save what you can.  talk to your mom and get recordings of her voice.  get tapes of all the family histories and stories you'll ever want to hear.  get her involved in alz groups as an aid or an assistant  so when she's a participant she'll still want to be there.  find out what her favorite music is, download it onto an easy-to-play format for when/if she has bad days.  get out the old pictures and see if she can identify the mystery faces. if you have access to it, look into high-cbd products to see if your elder has a good reaction to them.  dementia progression typically includes depression and anger, and most patients also experience sundowning, sleeplessness, and/or agitation.  cbd can help with all of these if it's well tolerated.  please check with your doctor first, there are a few medications that interact very badly with cannabis.  i have personally had very good luck with mary's medicinals' ""the remedy"" and a high-cbd edible but had to try a few things to find what actually worked.  and boy howdy they really do help. these are things you can do instead of worrying.  i do these things because not doing them is a bad idea, and they help me work through the grief.  activity helps dispel fear and anxiety. &amp;#x200b;# the progressionthe sufferers and caregivers who do the best with this disease are those who plan for the future.  they know what the next stage is and they've already done the research and signed the papers.  the ***best prepared*** progression is usually:1. ""impaired  cognition"" noticed by family, usually in ""help me find my car, i don't remember where i parked it"" situations.  electronic gps like a tile can help here.2. poa/healthcare poa signed by sufferer3. all financials nailed down, local laws researched, support group/network for caregiver found and activated4. dnr, ""quality of living"", death, corpse arrangements, burial arrangements discussed ahead of time5. long-term care health insurance attained (asap, the longer you wait the more expensive it will be)6. shared home prepared for sufferer to live with caregiver (separate doors, ramps, extra rooms, extra baths, ada furniture, doorways, hallways etc)7. patient diagnosed with dementia, usually ""mild to moderate"" stage8. this is usually when their driving starts to suffer.  taking away their keys usually provokes horrible rages, there is another option.  go to your country/state's department of motor vehicles site to submit their form for retesting an elder's capability to drive.9. medications to deal with side-effects prescribed, such as sundowner's, violent tendencies, hallucinations, etc.10. medications to help with actual alzheimer's prescribed.  they are usually not very effective, but are expensive and have serious side effects.  some experimental treatments, such as specific forms of light therapy, are showing promise but these will not be available from hmos for 7-10 years  from now.11. driver's license revoked, usually automatically after diagnosis &amp; medication12. apply to state/fed/insurance for any assistance, from financial to in-home.  this may take many tries and many years.  talk to your hospitals' elder care representative.13. if sufferer is violent, hallucinating, or wanders, talk to local authorities so they can be prepared.  this may not be appropriate in certain jurisdictions or for certain families. 14. get an electronic tracker, bracelet, or other identifier for any wandering patient.15. around this point a few sufferers take their own lives to spare their loved ones from dealing with a body without a mind.  this is not common with boomers and silent generations as they generally believe suicide to be a sin, but we're seeing it become more and more common in patients who are younger.16. this is the point where we used to institutionalize our elders. it was very common in the 70's and 80's and even 90's to put them in care homes.  now we know that they decline much faster when institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home, where they get better  care.17. in-home care becomes necessary during the day.18. 24/7 in-home care becomes necessary or the patient needs to be admitted to a memory care facility.  this is a locked ward where trained professionals deal with hallucinations, violent tendencies, etc.  this step is usually triggered by a tragic incident, such as patient wandering and being found by authorities, patient harming caregiver, patient injuring self, etc.  memory care facilities are not cheap, they can run between $4,000 - $14,000+ a month.  &lt;&lt; this is where  caregivers with insufficient preparation or insufficient healthcare access burn out... badly.19. patient loses memories entirely, needs help with every daily activity20. patient loses ability to feed self21. patient loses ability to swallow&amp;#x200b;this will be posted to both r/alzheimers and r/dementia.   i hope that anyone else can chime in if i've missed anything.",,0

"i read amazon has updated their fire cube to allow a webcam to be attached to it so you can skype over the tv.has anyone tried it and does it work well?the cube is supposed to have drop in calling and you can use the amazon fire tv app from anywhere in the world with good wifi.  all you need is a security camera to show you what the screen display shows.  the remote app can even turn on the tv and change the channel for some tv.  anyone have this setup?i currently have a desktop pc connected to my dads tv and a broadband universal ir remote hooked up to my dads tv to do youtube exercise videos, watch movies, skype, karaoke, and play video games remotely with him.  but my sister who isn't that tech savvy would probably prefer the simpler firecube which can do all of the exact same things now (though games are more limited and would require a subscription plan ).",,0

"hey everyone, i thought i would post on here instead of unloading everything on my friends, and i'd love to hear from people who have similar experiences.i've just found out that my dad has mid range alzheimer's, after i was living (studying) overseas for three years and came home to a very different dad.. i'm just 29, he's 73, and my life is not really stable at the moment, i feel totally useless.he's always had a short temper, and his personality and sense of humour have changed to being sometimes so nasty. he won't admit he has a problem, so he keeps trying to do things that he shouldn't (fitting gas bottles in the house, trying to drive, lift things). he's also incontinent and won't wear pads, will walk around with wet pants until mum or i see him and ask to change. he'll yell and call us nasty, say there's no problem, then just strip and leave his underwear and pants on the ground. i know he can't help it, and it's up to us to care for him (and he's going to all the drs and urologist and on medication) but it's just so hard. he's just so mean sometimes. i don't know if i sound like a little kid or too weak but i'm just coming to terms with it all. and to be honest i feel like a little kid and so weak.i don't know if anyone has any advice for someone with alzheimer's who insists on drinking? we try to get him not to, the drs advise not to. am i making excuses for us and need to just say ""you can't drink?"" is it time for us to step up and take control? sorry this is a bit of a ramble! i'm standing outside writing on my phone, just needed to get my feelings out.",,0
"new to this sub, but i'm so glad i found it. and i really want to share the absolute greatest thing that's happened since he started declining. my dad, who is my best friend, has alzheimer's and he had a stroke about a year ago. the alzheimer's was progressing fast but with therapy he made some improvements. unfortunately, that all changed when he suffered the stroke. he lost a lot of cognitive functioning and physical abilities. among so much else, he can't read or write anymore. the other day i got an tube shaped package in the mail. i wasn't expecting anything so it was odd. it was from my parents address. i opened it up and inside was a baseball bat. this baseball bat, a louisville slugger, is basically the only thing from my dad's childhood. and it means so much to him because it's from his own dad. he got it from his first time going to yankee stadium and signed by mickey mantle. as a kid, i always admired it but i wasn't allowed to mess with it because it was so special. and somehow, now it's mine. words can't describe how this feels. but that's not all...in the package was a letter written to me dated 2015 (before the stroke, when he could read and write, of course). i couldn't believe i was looking at my dads handwriting. two pages of it. he said the sweetest things to me and i just cried and cried while reading it. he doesn't remember writing it, unsurprisingly, but my mom found it with the baseball bat (thankfully) and sent it to me this week. i just wanted to share this because i think this is something you all might appreciate. this disease is awful but the rare times something nice happened, it feels really, really good.

"my dads mother is suffering from alzhimers, and i can't find the words to support him emotionally. when we talk about it, he is completely open about it with me, which i'm thankful for. my problem lies in my feeling that i'm not supporting him during this tough time.i feel as though i offer nothing more than comments like ""she's still here, she's still you're mom."" and other such meaningless things. he can talk to me at length about her condition, and he puts on a brave face, but i know it troubles him deeply and i want to help alleviate some of that pain, or at least have a better response when the conversation comes up. i'll be visiting her soon, and it will be the first time i've seen her in her current state so it'll be an emotional moment for my father and myself. i want to be able to give him some solid support and would appreciate and tips on how to be more supportive in such a hard time.this is my first time dealing with something like alzheimers, and i know there's no catch-all gesture that will make the pain disappear, but i need to do something more than idly listen and nod when he's opening up to me about these things. i'd appreciate any advice on how to speak about this in a meaningful way, that shows i care. i love my dad and my grandmother so much, i just can't put any of it into words during such a sensitive time.",,0
"she believes things come in threes. namely deaths. she believes this as though it were a natural law. when one person dies, two more are sure to follow. it’s to be expected. a celebrity dies, breaking news on cnn, followed by one of her acquaintances, she will announce, “they come in threes.” she thinks any one person can die and that will tie into the third. but they have to have relation to each other. three celebrities. three politicians. three friends. three family. not a celebrity, a religious leader and a family member. if it’s on the news, or written about, it must be true. she reads the obituaries every morning with her coffee. she smells like mint and perfume. she has a tendency to steal things from restaurants. like salt &amp; pepper shakers, ashtrays, or water jugs. she’s fearless, yet she panics in the face of a challenge.  she nods and mmm-hmmms when she agrees with something on tv and when she disagrees she clucks her tongue at the screen. she gives a run-down of everything going on around her even though we can see it as well. she always answers the phone with a smile on her face. she's thoughtful and kind.  she can’t keep a secret, even at christmas. and when she laughs, you can’t help but join in. even when the joke is on you.",,0
"my grandpa [76m] suffers from pretty severe and rapidly progressing dementia, and he has also suffered a couple of small strokes this year which have affected his cognitive function/communication abilities a bit. my grandma [73f] is in great shape mentally (even her mom is still alive, almost 100, and super sharp!) and she is having a really hard time with my grandpa because he is becoming a flight risk. today there was a silver alert sent out for him because he took the car in the middle of the night while my grandma was asleep, and drove for at least 4-5 hours before they found him and he had no idea how he got there when they were talking to him. he has not been allowed to drive for years and is not mentally aware enough to drive. he has also wandered off in the middle of the night on multiple occasions, often hides things like car keys and wallets around the house, moves furniture even though he is a fall risk, has tried to run away from the hospital after removing his own ivs, finds her credit cards and orders things online (he currently owns 8 ipads😅) and forgets major details in his life (his daughter died about 6 weeks ago and he still asks every few days where she is.) my grandma is not sure how to keep him safe now that his dementia is this bad. they cannot afford to put him in a home, but my grandma is retired and with him almost all the time and mostly wants to find ways to keep him from leaving in the night as that is when his unpredictable behavior is the worst. does anyone have experience with this and have any ideas on how to keep him safe? they currently live in a rental so they can't do anything permanent to the house. he is also very feisty and stubborn and not very cooperative so whatever they do it'll need to be something he can't tamper with our else he will. thanks in advance!!",,0
"my dad is 55, going on 56 and had a bilateral stroke. seems like he has had several micro strokes that we never knew about. this leads to the highly conclusive conclusion that he has vascular dementia. prior to the stroke, except for severe agitation/anger (probably early dementia) he was a high functioning adult. &amp;#x200b;now he misses the toilet 25-30% of the time, cant do anything besides sit on the couch and barely operate a computer. he tried to boil eggs, almost set the house on fire and tried to feed our dog 12 eggs with the shell on. he gets really angry randomly and cant process basic things. two nights ago he woke up at 2 am to take a shower and we could not redirect him. (it's stress on our sleep schedule as well). last night he wanted to go to target at 4 am. he ended up passing out in the living room and being furious when he woke up- (literally the moment of awakening) to why he isnt ready for the day (showered- brushed teeth etc). his sense of time is gone , no clue what time of the day it is. and most importantly his appetite is gone. &amp;#x200b;i dont think anyone who hasn't dealt with a dementia afflicted family member would understand where im coming from - ive already accepted my father is gone. i know at some point it will get worse- the question is how long do we keep living like this. even with a care giver 12 hours a day he is still very dependent on us and other people.&amp;#x200b;i dont think its a very fun life to live and i am highly considering hospice. yes i am thinking of nursing homes but 1) covid makes admission a whole lot harder 2) he is still conscious to not want to go to one 3) if hospice is an option i would prefer home hospice. &amp;#x200b;anyone make a decision like this before?",,0
"i’d posted a couple weeks back about my dad (74yo with mci) who wasn’t understanding the shelter in place and whose best friend was calling every day to go for a walk or a bike ride. i got my dads neurologist to speak to my dad about staying in and understanding that you can go for a walk or a bike ride but you can’t interact with people, you can’t talk to people, and you need to maintain distance. he encouraged 30 minutes of exercise a day but again, no interacting or anything. i’ve been encouraging my dad to go on walks with my dog (his dog died three weeks ago) or to go ride his bike towards the orchards where people aren’t usually walking but he always shrugs and says, “no, i’ll stay in.” still, i fended off requests from his best friend to go out. i spoke to the friend last night and said “the doctor said he can’t go out with you. i’m asthmatic and he’s a risk as well. he can’t be interacting with other people.” had a call today from same friend who didn’t believe what the doctor had said. i essentially just chewed out a 75yo attorney for taking the word of my demented father who has been telling him “i’m housebound. my daughter won’t let me out. she says i have to stay inside.” i reasserted that my dad can’t go for a walk with him because he doesn’t maintain the distance necessary, he can’t remember the precautions to take, he doesn’t wear the mask appropriately, etc. i told him that i’m encouraging my dad to go for walks or bike rides all the time but he decides not to. i’m so frustrated in dealing with these issues that i even offered to have my dad go live with his friend. then they can go on all the walks together and i’ll stay safe at home. i’m just tired of being the bad guy because i’m trying to keep my dad and myself safe. i don’t take it personally when my dad portrays me as the bad guy, but i take it personally when other people believe it. until you’ve watched someone deteriorate from this awful thing, you don’t understand the huge changes. stay safe everyone...we’ve got this.",,0
"hello all. my dad has been home for 2 weeks after a few weeks in hospital due to tests for diabetes issues and his ongoing parkinson’s. he is now home, after a very badly rushed discharge.....obviously for pandemic reasons. anywho....i live and care for him just by myself normally, but we now have carers coming in 4 x a day to help with his personal care. his mobility has declined, but more distressing is how his dementia has really kicked in over the last 2 months or so. due to all this he is now sometimes incontinent, or so confused or immobile that he has incontinence pads and basically has to go to the loo in bed if the carers aren’t here to help him use the commode or urinal. it’s basically impossible for me to help with any of this, as he is a dead weight due to immobility, i’m pretty tiny and it’s distressing for a father and daughter to have to deal with.i never knew how much caring for somebody, was about waterworks!! i wish i could help him more, but it’s easiest for the carers if he just lets it all go and lets the incontinence pads, special mattress protector and all the frills we’ve tried, soak up whatever they can. however!!.....with the dementia side of his parkinson’s, he decides to undress himself entirely when he needs to go. how he does this is beyond me, when he struggles to move in other ways. since he’s been home neither of us have slept very well, either because he wails or bashes the bed during the night, tries to get out of bed and falls, or generally the stress of the situation. tired of trying to explain how it would be best for him to keep his pants on to let them absorb everything, rather than get naked and let the pee go everywhere. i know he doesn’t really understand so it’s a waste of time. but heck it’s exhausting. stop getting starkers dad!!!nurses considered conveens or catheters, but they decided against them as he is likely to pull at those as well. oh i’m just so tired of it all...and can only imagine how dad feels. he shouldn’t have to lie in a wet bed. the washing is constant and i hope the house doesn’t smell too much of urine......hard to tell anymore being in the same house. but that feels like the least important thing....but it’s still his house and i want him to live in a nice, clean environment.apologies for the long rant....there is so much more...his troubling diabetes, his right eye that no longer works and is closed, the first anniversary of my mums death tomorrow.....not to mention the unmentionable horror the world is facing right now. one day at a time i guess.....but boy oh boy i wish he’d keep his pants on!!! all the best to all x",,0
"hello. i'm a 16 year old boy who's korean american. my life is nice at its times and i get what i need so money doesn't matter and i'm feel like i'm quite spoiled sometimes. about 4 years ago, my father started showing signs of dementia and i didn't know what it was. my mother didn't really tell me what's happening. he retired at the age of 77 and which i didn't know how old my parents were. i was excited to have him back home thinking i could play with him more since he wasn't home a lot due to him being an anesthesiologist. i was wrong. it turned into the biggest nightmare my life has ever experienced. my father drank a lot since koreans love alcohol and he was very drunk saying/doing things he didn't mean. i never understood as my mom just described it ""daddy might forget somethings sometimes."" i understood she didn't want me to be exposed to this hurtful thing at this age but it never helped me understand why this was happening. the first year of dementia was ok with some family arguments that were small nothing too serious. but then second year, shit hit the fan. his dimentia got worse and it didn't help he was drinking. it once got so bad that he wrestled me to the ground as i was crying and screaming becnaes my mother and i had an argument about video games and school again. my mother stood off to the sidelines and never did anything until finally when i was hyperventilating, pulled my dad off. i ran away from home for ten minutes (i was afraid of the dark) and tried to come back inside. i just saw him sitting down on teh couch holding a knife and when he saw me he screamed at me and i ran away again. after a while, i don't remember what happened, i was finally able to come inside and my mom told me that my dad had dementia which would hinder his emotions. she said not to get mad at dad because he can't control it. did it help? no it made me very upset. upset my dad does this to me, upset that my mother would stay off the to sidelines and have the nerve to say i can't blame anyone. the grudge grew and arguments got worse at least 1 or 2 every single week. i grew depressed further using video games as a place to escape from all the anger from my family. then finally, when it got very bad, my mother took my dad to the doctors after a year of this hell. they said they couldn't do anything because he was acting perfectly fine and said if he acts violently, to call the police so they can transport him to the hospital to get proper check up and stuff. my mom of course was against this but reluctantly agreed as they gave us medications. the meds helped my dad stay calm and it was ok for me to live but my mom and i still argued with each other. since the meds made my dad drowsy and lazy, my mom descided to not give him as much. big mistake. he started going back and actually got worse being violent towards me more since i always get the blame from him. he says very hurtful things saying ""why dont't you just quit school and get the hell out of here"", ""i have 2 sons and they never acted like this"", ""why are you fucking cursing at your mom, don't you respect her!?"", ""why don't you go fucking kill yourself"", and much more that i can' type without remembering the pain. fights got worse as now i got phsycial with my dad refusing to be hit and pushed and choked without a fight. my mom and dad held  grudge on me for  a small period because of this but i felt i was justified. finally, i get a call from my mother that she called the police because dad pulled a knife on her. i immediately went home to comfort her and it was very gloomy at home, i missed a lot of school days as i was so depressed and unable to learn i just called in sick. i felt upset that my dad was liek this, but the words lingered in my head from my mother. ""you can't get mad at him, he doesn't mean it"". i know he has dimentia, but it still fucking hurts me to hear this shit. i never really had a childhood with it being ripped apart from me with all this family drama. i just wished i could be normal. the sadness turned into rage. she only called the police because she was being hurt. i got mad and started to hold a giant grudge against her. i never outright showed her but it was deep down inside. finally, we went to a therapist which helped at first, but i later found it useless and one day decided not to go. that was a big mistake. my mom vented at my therapist and i was unable to defend myself. the therapist recommended very radical things and one was taking away my computer and electronics. i was lost, overtime i would try to talk to my mom, she would cut me off and say you can't raise your voice at me, you're verbally abusing me. this went on for a week and on time it got so bad so we had to get a new therpist who was much better and unbiased. he helped out so much and we were able to stop this radical stuff and i was able to get my stuff back. at this time, i was looking for something to help me cope and i found it was twitch streaming and making youtube videos. i make people laugh and it makes me happy seeing them happy. but later, my dad is able to come home, there is load of legal stuff to go through. police and child abuse people come to interview me. it was hard reliving every moment of hell and but i managed to do it without crying. (too much). life managed to get a little better until this year my mom makes the same mistake she did last year. she started to give dad less medications. the cycle goes all over again but i'm able to cope better with streaming and creating youtube videos. now i'm a 11th grade and i throught i would be tougher and this won't be as bad. it got even worse. argument are more violent and all aimed at me now. my mothers quick temper and quick to judge to accuse me make me upset that she keeps doing this, which leads to my dad getting involved which leads to me not getting any sleep and fights breaking out. i've tried to commit suicide a few times but was unable to do it knowing that i have friends and a loving boyfriend to live for so i won't be dying anytime soon. i just feel trapped and depressed for all my life. but the positive side is that it made me a stronger person and created me to be a very funny person and very optimistic. i'm so sorry for venting but i just got into another fight and i just feel so upset and trapped in this inescapable hell. she refuses to take any blame and always turns it on me using my video games as scapegoat. today i forgot to finish a small part of a page of extra work she makes me do and she exploded on me blaming me playing my video games even though i finished all my work. i know many of you are going to say that i should listen to my mom and not talk back to her, but this is very true and i refuse to be a punching bag for her just because she can't get mad at my dad and gets mad at me instead. thank you for listening...this took a lot of guts to type this so i'm sorry.tldr: depressed for 4 years because dad has dementia, mother not helping and i just wanted to vent my frustration.",,0

"how often do folks succeed in getting durable power of attorney with immediate effect for a loved-one/family member?we don't have a diagnosis yet but i'm sure mom is firmly in the late-beginning stage of dementia of some progressive kind. i live with her. a brother who is the current primary on a ""springing"" poa/advance directive on file with the hospital has told me that he doesn't want to be updated on mom's symptoms.* he thinks i'm playing internet doctor, and isn't really hearing the quality of feedback i'm getting (here, but also in an [alz.org]( lecture/class series, and a peer-support group facilitated by the director of a local dementia ward).* mom has told me for the past three years that the reason this brother is #1 on the forms is that he was the only one living in the area when they were drawn up ten years ago.* i've lived with mom again the past three years. i know her behaviors, and have seen them changing.she is amenable to re-filing the directives in a ""springing"" form with me as the primary. (i don't know if she has to do anything formal other than just giving a new notarized version to the hospital/doctors.) what i worry about is the **period between doing that and having her doctor declare her** incompetent to make medical decisions. because she is already really annoyed by but misunderstanding the things the medics do because of insurance practices (e.g. that so much of the work is done by mail/phone calls and by assistants rather than the md himself) i worry that she will increasingly dismiss their directives.she is convinced that everything is going to be ok, she's ""just old!"" (she's 88 this week). i'm convinced that she already needs me at least as the communications channel between her and her providers. the whole thing seems like a catch-22: who, while they are competent, wants to give medical decision-making power to somebody else \*at that time\*?  but if i manage to get the doctors to perform the tests and give her a diagnosis, so she can realize that this is really important to do now, is she by default at that time incompetent to actually complete that task?(the financial stuff is a whole 'nother kettle of fish, not covered here.)thanks.",,0
"since my youth, my grandfather has always talked about how he used to love taking the train cross country in his youth/ early retirement.now at 78, and an early form of alzheimer’s (can’t remember year, small little things like that, but has good conversation still about concepts - finance, house upkeep, cars, trains, etc) he wants to take a train cross country.i have the time coming up to go on one but my mother is refusing. she took him to the doctors, wouldn’t let me go to appt, and claimed they said it’s not a good idea because he’s on blood thinners for his diabetes and the sitting wouldn’t be good for him. doctors (not his but some i know) say as long as he gets up from time to time to walk around the train, watch his sugar intake, take his pills on time (which i would help with) that this trip is really a non-event.money isn’t an issue as he did well for himself. the goal was to get a full bedroom where he has a bed, bathroom, and there’s a second bed for me. maybe this is meant for r/relationships, but what is your guys take? i’m 28/m who’s been around all of his health issues (except for this latest doctor visit) and think this would be a great experience for him and something that i’ll always remember. trip would be chicago- denver (15 hours 1 way). stay 1 day in denver, then come home.",,0
"help! how can i get support??here’s the scenario: my mom, and her husband take care of my grandmother who has mid-late to late stage dementia. my mom is her full-time caregiver and her husband wants to take her on a short vacation (like 3 days or so) to take a break and recharge from the exhausting job she has caring for my grandmother. my uncle who lives upstairs from them (it’s a 2 family house) travels for work and everyone else in the area isn’t available/ or isn’t skilled enough to get my grandma through the day... other than checking to see if she’s safe. my question is:how do you go about getting support services like a nursing assistant/ respite care that is trained in caring for people with dementia? there is a bit of a language barrier, and and just overall uncertainty for my mom and everyone in my grandma’s immediate circle on reaching out for help like this. think partly because my mom has just enough mental energy to get my grandma through the day. partly cultural (hispanic background - i think she feels guilt about allowing anyone that isn’t her to care for her).i’ve been able to help by sending her information to read and helping make dr. appts and finding new drs. she’s been hesitant to get a nurse because she’s worried how my grandma will behave, and thinks its going to cost absurd amounts of money. i keep trying to convince her that she must be eligible for some type of in-home care through my grandma’s medicare, but she insists she needs to go through her pcp to get help. when i called her doctors office to ask if my mom can get information on respite care, home care etc. when she brings her for a follow up - the only thing they said was that “it doesn’t hurt to ask”. it doesn’t seem like her dr is  going to give her the specific information she’s looking for. plus this follow up takes place after this supposed vacation is taking place.  also my grandfather just passed away so part of this is the stress of figuring out how to handle finances that were left for her care etc. it just seems like chaos!anyway, i’d really appreciate any suggestions, links or  feedback on how i can help my mom get a couple days off, and get a trained caregiver to take care of my grandma.i already told her that having a write up  ready with a daily schedule, behaviors to expect, things that work/ don’t work/ etc. would be necessary. but beyond that - any thoughts would be much appreciated!",,0

"sorry so long, but dementia is just so complex as you guys probably know.my dad is going to need to go to a nursing home soon, no question about that.  my mom's out of town and i'm by myself taking care of him which has become near impossible.  so i decide to finally go take a look at his financials to put together a budget for what inpatient care will cost if he ends up living another like, 10 years and also thinking about my mom's future.my dad retired very wealthy but was a huge cheapskate.  he worked at the same company as a gm for forty years, and they matched his 401k from his first day there up to the day he retired.  i know this because the accountant from his company is my godmother.  so i went into the basement and got on his laptop to finally see just how much money he has (he kept it all on a spreadsheet that he never let any of us see.  he's always been paranoid about money being stolen from him.)  my mom pays all the bills with automatic pay i set up for her out of their checking account, (she doesn't know anything about finance above what's in this checking account where i have their social security direct deposited into).  the house was paid off long ago.went down to the basement, and i got into the spreadsheet by guessing the correct password for the laptop.  the only document on this mac was the ""secret"" spreadsheet.  i was so relieved, then immediately wasn't.   apparently when he retired, he rolled his entire 401k into a single ira, all of which was documented.  so far so good.  then the bottom fell out.  in 2014 he cashed out the entire ira and his life savings and spread the entire amount into eighteen different savings accounts in ten different credit unions.  he didn't list which credit unions, much less account numbers.  the credit unions were just numbered ""credit union 1-10"" and ""account 1-18"") with the amounts he deposited in each one.  and yes, he was loaded.   there are no paper statements anywhere, no receipts of deposit, no interest statements, and my mom says she's never seen any statements or even junk mail from any credit unions in the mail aside from their checking account.  he must have asked all of them to go paperless or something?   not even a hint or locked document stating which banks he hid all his money in.   and make no mistake, he went out of his way to hide this money.   he has no memory of doing this, of course.  i went through every document in his file cabinet and the fireproof safe.  nothing.him hiding his money, is that a dementia thing?  and finally, we are fucked, aren't we?",,0
"after dealing with being confined in the house in fear of getting covid, my grandma’s mental state has drastically declined. for as long as i can remember she has had issues with her memory i.e asking me the same question over and over in an hour, but she generally manages most everyday tasks on her own. she was living with my dad and stepmom who took care of her until they pleaded with her to go with them to the doctor for testing when things got really bad (to get a diagnosis and appropriate treatment/help) which made things worse causing her to reach out to her nephew for help, to where he intervened and took her to live with him. i often talk with her on the phone, she say’s they have been using her money for vacations and selling her things, trying to poison her food (that it was making her sick) and that she was generally living in fear with them. today she told me she wants to put my stepmom in jail and that she has contacted lawyers and is taking legal action to get her money back. she is telling everyone that they were abusing her. i know in my heart my dad and step mom could never do something like that to their mother/mil, and it is absolutely breaking my heart to see her do this to them.",,0

"hi all. i don’t feel entirely comfortable or right in asking these questions, but i am a little concerned. my father is 66 years old and seems to have problems with very simple things. his mother passed away with alzheimer’s at 100 years old in 2020. my father also was in a coma for about 2 weeks after a motorcycle accident before i was born that i don’t know might have left long term damage. anyways, he’s in pretty good physical shape and spends most of his days, now being retired, working on stuff outside and being fairly physically active. he was very successful in his career and is knowledgeable and stays on top of handling his and the family’s finances. what has been worrying me are things that should be easy just don’t seem to stick with him. just for example, he could ask me a question about an upcoming doctors appointment where i’d give him an answer and then he’d ask the same questions the next day and then the next and still won’t fully comprehend and confuse things. he also will ask me to spell out pretty simple words for him such as “choose” or “radar”, etc. he doesn’t pick up on sarcasm or jokes either. i could make a light-hearted sarcastic remark, clear to everybody but him that it had zero malice behind it, and he will flip a switch and get totally offended and upset. however, he’s a sociable guy and could talk someone’s ear off in conversation and he’s generally always in a happy, optimistic mood. am i overreacting or should this be something to monitor?",,0

"tl;dr: how to explain guardianship process to loved one, and looking for ideas on how to convince her to go to assisted living without poa or guardianship due to guardianship process taking too long.summary:my first concern is if/how i should explain the guardianship process to my aunt. she is going to be served notice of the guardianship application next week. she is extremely savvy. her logic may not be largely intact, but she owned a nursing agency for 30 years and was a very successful, independent woman, and her drive and tenacity have not left her yet. she's aware enough to know the objective of guardianship is take control of her finances (in addition to her medical care). any ideas on how to spin it so it's not as threatening to her? lastly, does anyone have experience convincing or coercing someone who refuses to leave their home into assisted living (without poa or guardianship)? guardianship will likely take another 6mo, and we don't have enough liquid assets to keep her in her home that long. a caseworker mentioned telling my aunt she needs to stay somewhere for a couple weeks while the house is fixed up. it's a good idea, but my aunt has already figured out it's a rouse. my fear is she'll completely cut off all contact if i try to do anything and then we won't be able to care for her.details:i am in az and going through guardianship process in harris county, tx for my aunt that has lewy bodies dementia. she has no children, no poa (too late now), and will not add anyone to her bank accounts. she requires 24/7 care as a fall risk and she's losing the ability to care for herself. the issue is she is almost out of liquid assets to fund her 24/7 care and refuses to go to assisted living. she says she ""will die in her home"". she has other assets (home, car, misc. collectibles) that could be sold, but she refuses to let anyone help her with finances or selling assets. i'm applying for guardianship, but i'm concerned it will destroy what little goodwill i have left with her. she believes her current condition was caused by a family member assaulting her a few months ago (she actually had a uti and fell in her home while alone), and that we (family) are trying to put her in a mental institution and steal her assets. i don't take it personally, although my mom (aunt's sister) and other cousins do. my mom is not capable of handling the financial situation, and my cousins are out because my aunt 100% believes they're trying to kill her. i know everyone thinks their lo's suspicions are next level, but my aunt tells every caregiver, medical professional, basically anyone, that we are trying to kill her and steal from her. she spends hours every day talking about it. she has already been committed once due to her paranoia, but they discharged her at first signs of being stabilized. and now she's back home and refuses any medication or treatment. i'm afraid she'll cut off all contact with me and my mom and we won't know if she's being cared for or not.",,0
"my grandmother (77) has been acting strange over the past year or year and a half. it started with her forgetting little things more often, having more problems cooking, and needing more help with technology related tasks. not unusual, except sometimes these tasks were things like changing the batteries in her remote. then she wanted to add mom onto her bank account to help her make sure her bills are paid and everything. in all fairness, though, she was preparing to go stay with my aunt for a few months, so it made sense to have us handle that stuff. she's back from her trip, though, and it's a lot easier to see the changes. still nothing massive, but she's repeating the same stories a lot, the dogs got fed twice the other night because she forgot mom had already fed them (she was in the room when they ate the first time and definitely saw), things like that. she's also been kind of mean to my mother lately, and the other day, she accused us of throwing some of her cups away. that also isn't like her, but she and my mother have fought before, she brought it up to me earlier. someone with alzheimer's happened to come up in conversation, and she made a comment about how she knows she's going to end up like that someday, she just doesn't know when. it's worth mentioning that she knows a good bit about alzheimer's. she was a psychiatric nurse for awhile, and both her mother and her husband had it before they passed, and she was their caretaker. she also said that she knows my aunt thinks she's having memory problems, but she doesn't think they're that bad yet. i asked her gently if she's seen a doctor about it, and she said no, she didn't think it was necessary. i suggested that it might be a good idea, because maybe she just needs to use oxygen for her copd more often or something similar. she just said that she doesn't think she's out to lunch yet, and that it isn't that big of a deal yet. i wasn't sure what to say and i agreed. i figure that it's still kind of true because aside from maybe needing a little more guidance in her finances just to make sure everything is covered, nothing is preventing her from taking care of herself yet. but is there a best way to talk to loved ones about this? she's not the type to be afraid of talking about this kind of thing. she's been continuously making adjustments to her will to make sure everything is right just in case for the past 20 years, at least, she has already paid for her funeral and picked everything out (except for the flowers, because she doesn't know what season she'll pass in), toured several nursing homes for herself as well as papa, and let us know which one she'd like to be in if it was impossible for her to stay at home, etc.",,0
"sorry this could get long. mostly a vent.first post here. my mom is showing signs of dementia. she has been for a year or two now. she remembers who we are, who she is, her past, even her bank account numbers and things that have been the same for several years. but she often forgets where she is, how long she's lived in her apartment, the day/year, current events. she has an appointment with her doctor soon to discuss everything and seek help.yesterday i became exponentially worried. she fell for a computer scammer. i had to leave work early to come help her reset all of her passwords and call her banks to make sure nothing was compromised. i spent six hours there in total, and tried my best to drill it into her the steps to take to avoid it. we agreed that leaving notes above her computer was a good idea so that she'd see them warning her and be able to stop it in its tracks if it happened again.well, today, not even 24 hours later, she did it again. she called me crying because she doesn't want me to remove her computer. she self isolates due to depression and doesn't have contact with the outside. she orders all her clothing and groceries on her computer and phone, but i would rather take them away than risk her losing what little financial independence she has left.she lives in independent living right now and if she would just leave her room she'd be able to have church service, watch movies, have dinner, play games and more all in the same building! but she hasn't left in over two years because she's depressed, so instead she non stop orders things online and is living almost like a hoarder (not unsanitary though), and now falling victim to scammers left and right.this isn't the first worrisome thing. a few weeks ago my husband, son, and i went to visit as a surprise and came into a smokey apartment because she'd left a pie in the over for who knows how long and it was black and burning in the oven. she had no idea because she forgot she put it in there and couldnt smell the burning or see the smoke. if we didn't show up she might have started a fire and the worst could have happened.she's fought us left and right about taking away any iota of freedom. she's physically capable of caring for herself, she can bathe etc. but she gets confused and forgets extremely important things from one second to the next and even today she told me she doesn't know how to protect her from herself.i don't know what to do. i'm barely 28, just got a good job, my son is under 10, i'm trying to go back to school and i'm so tired and overwhelmed. i don't know how to help her. i didn't sign up for this. not to mention, the first 17 years of my life i had to watch my dad suffer through parkinson's before he passed away at 81, so i know the horrors that can come next. now it feels extra traumatic watching the only parent i really had with me during my whole life going through the early phases of memory loss too.i've looked into memory care but i don't know if we could afford it, especially since she's still somewhat independent physically. we want to buy a house in the next year or two and have a special ada suite added on for her so we can care for her and also utilize her ltc insurance to help. we don't want to just put her somewhere and let her rot away, we love her and are scared for her and just want the best.yes i was raised by my grandparents and no the rest of our family isn't in the picture. it's just me, my husband, and my son. we don't have any other support or resources. thanks for letting me vent.tldr my mom is showing signs of dementia and is at risk of being scammed and i'm too young to be prepared to handle this and it all makes me very sad and scared and i don't know what to do.",,0
"i'm hoping someone else out there has some experience with this. i placed my mom with (i'm guessing) about stage five/six alzheimer's in an assisted living facility back in september. in december, they moved her into memory care. in the six months that she's lived there, they've sent her to the emergency room in the middle of the night three times. for reasons that don't seem medically necessary:visit one: the facility staff said that she was wandering and they were afraid she was going to wander out of the building. (this was before the move to the locked memory care unit.)visit two: she was found in another resident's room without clothes on. they actually didn't even tell me she was sent to the er. i got a notification from the hospital's patient portal app. the facility refused to speak with me to explain what happened for about 24 hours. when i finally got a hold of someone, they claimed that she got aggressive when they tried to remove her from the other resident's room, and that's what triggered the er visit. (turns out, she had a uti.)visit three: this one happened tonight. there's a stomach bug going around the facility. my mom was sick and threw up. supposedly, my mom asked about going to the hospital. i talked to the head nurse, and we decided mom would not go to the er. (if she was still stick tomorrow, i'd take her to urgent care.) less than two hours later, i get a notification from the patient portal app indicating that my mom's in the er. then the facility night shift med tech called me after that. i'll admit, i went off on them a little bit. the first med tech i talked to claimed that my mom was threatening to hit herself, and that's why they sent her. the second med tech said nothing about behavioral issues and said they just sent her because she was sick and that they sent all the sick residents with the stomach bug to the er. she also said that if my mom says she wants to go to the hospital -- despite having alzheimer's and me saying no -- they have to send her.from the early test results, seems like she has a uti now too.is this normal? do other memory care facilities frequently send residents to the er for reasons that are not medical emergencies?the facility she's in is private pay. but these hospital bills are starting to add up. i just got the bill for the ambulance ride from visit two. it's $700! plus all the tests and x-rays and whatnot. each visit probably costs more than $1,000 even after insurance. we just can't do this every other month. maybe it's cruel to even be mentioning money, but i just don't know how long she'll need care and don't want to burn through her savings.and sending a woman with alzheimer's to the er all by herself seems cruel. on top of this, after the first two er visits, i noticed a drop in cognition that she never quite 100% recovered from.this is supposedly the best facility in the area. and i'm worried and angry, but also afraid that my being difficult will end up getting my mom labeled a problem resident or something. does anyone have any advice??",,0

"trying to make some sense out of these new behaviors. my husband has some form of cognitive problem or dementia per my earlier post last week. he is still able to work and drive but his personality and his day to day behavior has become weird in some new ways. his recent jag is to come home from work each day and go on a long diatribe about some person or group of people at his workplace. it is always some perceived grievance, frequently a mention about him being rude or confrontational with this person(s), add in a few accusations that the person is somehow abusing the systems at work based on some protected class. i have no idea if the part of these stories where he says he confronted or told someone off actually happened or not. yesterday he bragged about ""speaking his mind"" at work even though he knows it upsets people. this started in march and it rotates through what group of people or department is somehow awful, incompetent or dishonest and it is always a personal affront to him in some way. i am worried he is actually doing these things at work and is going to get himself in a bunch of trouble. his other new quirk is talking about committing insurance fraud. he started out joking about falsifying receipts to claim he owned property he didn't but then he acted like he was serious about it. this came up again in a totally different context where he was insisting he could fake an invoice and dupe an insurance company. luckily both of these situations didn't actually turn into an insurance claim but he seems to have developed a total disconnect about where something is inappropriate or illegal behavior. he wasn't being sarcastic, he was serious and didn't seem to comprehend that these things have consequences.",,0

"my father (66m) and i (27f) had to move away from where we lived before because it was too expensive, both in overall cost of living and for the upkeep of the home we were in. we moved to the geographic region he requested, but because it’s impossible to find a 10 acre apple orchard within walking distance of town, he hates it. it’s been 6 months and he still has hardly adjusted. he is upset about me managing his finances (i’ve had financial poa since 2018 but started actively using it august of last year) and setting boundaries like he can’t access the part of the house we live in, and if he’s being rude, i will not entertain the conversation and walk away whenever possible. i know arguing won’t get anywhere and if i try to deflect it’s impossible so walking away truly seems like the kindest thing i can do. he’s not far along enough to need to be watched 24/7. after selling the previous house, he has the financial means to hire caretakers. it took three private caretakers/agencies not working out before we found one that has. now this agency is saying his mental health issues and associated behaviors are outside the scope of what they normally work with and are becoming too much to handle. they acknowledge that i make sure all his basic needs are met, he has food, cigarettes, a large yard to garden in, caretakers coming to socialize with him, keep himself/his space tidy, and take him on outings. yet he still wants to constantly “play the victim” and use any example of any (perceived or real) mistakes i’ve made as evidence that he should sue me. for example, last winter he insisted on trying to use a heavy metal plow to “shovel” a part of the yard that didn’t need to be shoveled. he refused to give the plow back to me so i had to physically pull it away from him. he is trying to claim that this was assault. there’s a few other examples like this he always comes back to and repeats over and over again. it’s getting to the point where the care agency says if he continues to lash out at the caretaker repeatedly (or flirt with them, which he also likes to do) that the caretaker has the right to leave and be paid for a full day. i don’t blame them, but i’m wondering if i should switch to a different agency with more direct experience with patients with co-occurring mental health conditions. yesterday after one of his usual ramblings the agency’s head person called me upset; i said “yes, i’m aware of this, he has dementia” and she said “no, this is psychosis”… she thinks that because he “remembers” all these details about ways he feels wronged (which sometimes are completely fabricated stories) that he doesn’t have dementia. three neuroscientists that tested him over several months last year would beg to differ. sadly his health care has been stuck in limbo, due to moving, confusion about what he qualifies for, him not being willing to receive care in the past, medicare not thinking he’s a us citizen when he is.. it’s a whole mess. today the head caretaker lady is going to come over and help me sort that out, so hopefully we can get him on medication that mellows him out soon. maybe they can re test and confirm independently that he does indeed have dementia and i’m hoping they can confirm if other mental health conditions are also affecting him. he goes through spurts of having lots of energy and periods of needing a lot of rest and emotional ups and downs and has always been this way so bipolar honestly seems the most likely. i’ve had to call the police three times in six months since we’ve moved here, twice because of my dad. the second time they were not helpful at all and basically told me he’d be better off if i left him alone and stopped caring for him. they referred me to an aps social worker who keeps telling me to pursue courses of action that don’t make any sense. i wish there was an elder crisis service for situations like this that actually had the knowledge and resources to help, and not shame the caretaker and take the dementia persons word at face value. i’d appreciate honest feedback if there’s anything different i should be doing. it seems like a lot of dementia patients just need a need met to be satisfied, but almost every day my dad makes a long list of things he wants and gets mad if i don’t get every single thing on that list. even on the days i get most of the things or give him something he really wants it doesn’t make a difference in his mood. lately i’m trying to be super nice every time i see him and even have invited him to do fun things with me/my friends but he responds by yelling at me. i envisioned us going hiking together, doing arts and crafts, all sorts of fun things we couldn’t do when we didn’t have the money/time… but it turns out all he cares about is money and freedom, neither of which can i give to him.",,0
"my father has been on the decline for several years, but was pretty successful in hiding how bad he had become. he had been living alone about an hour away from the closest family member (me).a couple of weeks ago, he was found wandering around, confused, with extremely high blood pressure (over 200) and was hospitalized. he was in the hospital for 5 days and they did all kinds of tests and scans, including multiple mris and a ct scan. none of the results showed anything definitive, but the neurologist and other doctors said that some of the scans showed results that were consistent with dementia.once the hospital found out that he didn't have insurance, they were pretty quick to get him discharged. his brother and mother drove over from alabama (we were in georgia, they are about a 3 hour drive) to get him and he has been staying with them for a little over a week. he seems in much higher spirits and is more cognizant than he usually is when i talk to him. i think being around people is really helping him, as well as taking blood pressure medication.i'm currently working on getting medical and financial power of attorney while he is still competent enough to sign. he has a doctor's appointment in a couple of weeks and we are hoping they can refer us to someone who will be able to get us an actual dementia diagnosis. i applied for early social security for him and am waiting for it to kick in. hopefully we can also get disability for him once we get a diagnosis.i'm still waiting on the hospital bill to arrive, which i assume will be tens of thousands of dollars. obviously i wish that it hadn't come to him being hospitalized, but until it happened we could not get to acknowledge how much trouble he was having even though we had tried.anyway, glad to have found this subreddit and hoping to get some advice from others who are going through this same thing. i was not expecting to deal with this at my father's age - i only just turned 30.",,0

"my mom (56 y/o) has dementia, psychosis, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. she was born with mild dementia but throughout her life she hurt herself intentionally, attempted suicide multiple times, which caused severe head concussions. we're 2 brothers and 1 sister, who's been struggling with her since we all can remember (our father died when we were young). throughout her life she's been admitted to multiple psychiatric facilities, to this day she fights her solutions, doesn't want to take her medicine, sometimes even spits them out when she goes to the washroom, doesn't listen to doctors, pretends that she's okay just to get back home and start it all over again. makes up situations to leave the house so she can harass people in the streets, shouts out the balcony and curses everyone out in the neighbourhood, attacks all 3 of us, calls us the dirtiest of names, endlessly. there are months when she's docile, but then there are days when she loses control and doesn't stop for weeks, when she feels tired she goes to sleep, that's how we get our sleep as well. admitting her to a welfare center is not the answer for us, we live in bangladesh, we've never had health insurance, and it's very costly too to admit her somewhere. anyone ever dealt with something similar to this? did you handle it by yourself? i'm the youngest brother, i spend most of my time at home looking after her and dealing with her the most, i'm looking for advice, anything would be helpful. btw, we all talk to her very kindly and patiently, we've tried loads of methods of communication over the last 2 years.",,0

"i would appreciate any  advice or insights you all might have on our situation. i apologize for the length. my husband’s mother just moved in with us, moving from ca to ok. she has lewy body dementia, ulcerative colitis, arthritis, and blood clots. she’s in her mid 50s. based on the ken keane videos, i'd say she's approximately in stage 5, with a few hints of 6. i do most of the day-to-day care, while my husband will be working outside the home. she has been on ssi and medical. we are in the process of getting my husband listed as her representative payee for her ssi.  she has lived with us before, i was the one who originally saw symptoms of dementia, but she wasn't diagnosed until she moved out of our home last time, in 2015.biggest issue (to me at least) first: she's in denial about her dementia, she talks about not being able to see because a doctor screwed up her eyes (not true). how do i address this with other people while she's around? i definitely don't want to make her feel stupid (which she does often when she can't find or do something) or argue with her, but at the same time, i need to be able to communicate with people (doctors, people at church) that she's not well. i don't see any help in trying to convince her that she's ill. what do i say in situations where she says something not true or inappropriate? financial questions: * where do i go to get health insurance for her?(i assume healthcare.gov, but i don't know where to get medicaid) * will her living in our home change the subsidy for my family’s health insurance, since we buy it through the exchange? * should we include her as a dependent on our 2019 taxes?* i understand her ssi is meant to cover her living expenses, can i use that to pay a utility bill or do i have her write a check directly to myself and my husband to cover her “rent”? we aren’t trying to take advantage of that money, obviously, but we will have higher utilities from an extra person in the house. * should we apply for food stamps/ebt for her? or should she be using the ssi for groceries?social questions:* what do we do when we can no longer provide enough care for her in our home? we have decided our boundary is incontinence or violence to ourselves and/or our children.* how do you know if she's able to be left alone in the home and for how long? she can't prepare food for herself, or get her own medicine, so i assume if ever, for a max of a few hours.* do i need to be stimulating and entertaining to her? she sat on the couch doing nothing (tv not on) for nearly two hours tonight after dinner, is this normal?* she's talked about meeting up with an old friend here in our town. should i try to contact this person? i don't think mil has any contact info for her, but i could find her on fb. would this be inappropriate? should i warn her of the lbd?* does it do me any good to put her things back where they belong after she's ""rearranged?"" she's moved some of her socks to her bedside table, moved her razor stash to her bedroom from the bathroom, etc. * does anyone have any advice for having her in the same home with my toddler? it seems all the baby proofing is too much of a hindrance for mil (cabinet and toilet locks, baby gates).also, if you have any other advice (or could point me towards the appropriate sub) for having a disabled elder living with you, i’d greatly appreciate it! thanks!",,0
"father is 71, and has been diagnosed with aphasia (trouble communicating and reading) and a form of dementia.  he's living with just my mother in miami.  i'm currently working with an attorney to get a power of attorney (poa) signed.  i'm looking into long term care options for him and it looks like it will have to be in a care facility.  does anyone have experience with those and do you know what the experience is like for the person with dementia?  i do not want to place my father into a care facility, but he's becoming a bit much for my mother as his condition worsens.  he needs 24/7 surveillance, but i can't provide that for him on top of working a full time job to assist with his bills.  aside from gaining poa, what do you suggest i do?  i have 3 siblings, 2 of which are successful enough to assist somewhat, 1 is a complete deadbeat i haven't talked to in a very long time.  i'm looking into medicaid help with the nursing home bill, however the house is in in his name and medicaid will try to take the home if that is the case.  we also can't transfer the home ownership to someone else and then put him in the nursing home because medicaid has a 5 year lookback policy in order to reclaim assets that were transferred in the previous 5 years.  a memory care unit is looking to cost us about $5k a month.  thats quite a bit of change even if i got insurance/used his assets to pay off $2k a month.  $1k from each of us is still quite a hit for me.  if anyone has advice regarding long term care, or just in general with dealing with this disease, please let me know.",,0
"so here's the summary of the situation:* dad (80s) has late stage dementia. he is able to walk and eat by himself but that will end likely in the next few months. he has no other major health issues.* my mom (70s) is his primary caretaker, but she has back and other physical problems and can't really lift anything more than a few lbs.* life savings were destroyed before we discovered what was going on.* on paper, they make good incomes. however because of bad management for the past 10-15 years and some ill-conceived purchases/debts, about half of it has to go into fixing problems, so the amount left for spending is ok, but not great. they make well above what the medicaid limits are in our state.* the income sources and assets are all mixed together with both their names on most of it. so any kind of asset sale would be enormously complicated and the leftover situation would be bad for my mom after he's gone.* he does not do well outside of the home. he gets extremely stressed out and basically stops eating. i have no doubt placing him outside his home would kill him.ideally we'd like to keep him at home but my mom is not capable of lifting him or doing the physical work that we know is to come. i found out that medicare will not cover home bound care unless they need a skilled professional or therapy (which he doesn't. he will just needs help moving around, bathing, feeding, etc). medicaid is out of the picture because they just make too much.right now we have a part-time home health aide for a few hours a week but the amount of hours that will be needed will quickly overwhelm the finances and deplete the savings in a few months. i've talked to local resources but overall it comes to the same problems: he's too healthy physically, they make too much money for aid, but out of pocket expenses are too much. making him a ward of the state also seems like a bad idea due to the mixed assets and the loss of control.i've gone through old posts but didn't see anything that pertained directly to this situation. am i missing something? has anyone else gotten benefits for this kind of situation? we simply need home health aides for several hours a day. we don't need anything else.",,0
"my grandmother has been in a nursing home since she fell and broke her hip three months ago. most of the time she is cooperative but twice now she has demanded to go home. she doesn't know that she has become a long term care patient or that she is being evicted from her apartment (her insurance ran out before she was in a condition to even think about going home, and she could not afford to pay both the nursing home and her apartment rent) and we are packing up her stuff. we hate having to keep her there. the staff are nice and do their best but they are understaffed and it's not a memory care facility. it's actually a rehab place and they keep the memory impaired patients in the rooms near the nurses' station. sometimes in their beds, sometimes in the hallway in their wheelchairs (none of them walk) and sometimes behind the nurses station. but in any case, grandma thinks it's a hospital, hates hospitals, and perpetually thinks she is waiting for something. that being said, my mother says that grandma also thought she was waiting for something when she was at home. i feel bad about going through grandma's things even though i know she doesn't remember most of it. she had her entire life in that apartment and i have deconstructed most of it, but it was in disarray when i got there.i also learned that my grandma was exactly the person she appeared to be. she spent her free time reading and praying for people and though she was on a meager fixed income, she made donations here and there to good causes. but a timeline of her decline also became apparent. her memory problems started maybe 5 years ago but up until about three years ago, she was still a fairly functional person and then she could no longer keep her finances straight. then she could no longer cook. and then she stopped caring for herself. we hate having to keep her in the nursing home but she needs 24 hour supervision, particularly at night, which our family is unable to provide. i just wish there were some way to make her more comfortable in the last years of her life.",,0
"hi everyone, i’ve been reading the posts here for a few weeks and i thought i’d make a post of my own finally. i’m 30 years old, female, only child. my situation involves mourning both the loss of my mother, who died very unexpectedly at 61 this summer, and the gradual loss of my father (72), who was, in the aftermath of my mother’s death, diagnosed with dementia, potentially alzheimer’s and potentially ftd. he’s still in the early stages but progressed a lot the past few months. my parents had been divorced since 2005. this double whammy has left me a shell of a person.as is the case with the loved ones of so many, i’m sure — my whole life, my dad has taken care of everyone. his parents. my mom, even after they divorced in 2005 he helped her financially. his girlfriend for the past decade whose existence he hid from my mom as to not damage her even more (whole other insane story for another time). i remember telling a dear friend about all this, her response was “well, childhood is over.” her mom has had alzheimer’s for years and she was right.we started noticing changes in him in fall 2017. my mom, who saw him occasionally or talked to him on the phone, would drop hints to me that she was worried about him. i didn’t want it to be true, and i avoided her phone calls because of it. this is exactly what i was doing when she passed away. i hadn’t talked to her in weeks because i was avoiding the truth of my dad’s situation and now she’s gone. dealing with her arrangements was the hardest thing i had ever done. she died without anything prepared. normally my dad would have swooped in and helped with everything but suddenly everything was different and he didn’t know how. in the aftermath of all my mom’s shit, i shifted into high gear and got a bunch of stuff settled for my dad. this was before his diagnosis. drew up a will, got durable poa financial/health care. just powering through everything, numb. months later in december i, with his help, started to take control of his finances. spent days getting all the passwords for his online accounts, got added to his checking/savings, automated most bills, took away his checkbook.  i’ll be doing his taxes this year. the only thing i have left to do is figure out how to get added to his fidelity account as poa (they make it surprisingly hard to figure out) to make sure all of that is ok because he still thinks he’s ok with stocks. on top of everything, my dad is juggling a house here and a condo in fl. he is currently in the same state as me, but is insisting on going back to fl soon. he was supposed to go back after christmas but car repairs kept him here. no clue what’s going to happen once he gets down there. yes, he’s still driving. i’m choosing one battle at a time. on one hand i know he’ll be happier when he goes back to fl, on the other hand i don’t know how i’m going to deal. this two-states fiasco has made it hard to get him a neurologist, as it seems everywhere is booking two months out. with that said i did have him evaluated by a neuropsychologist in august, and he got an mri and eeg in late december. but nothing has come of it so far. the best i think i’ll be able to do is get him a neurologist down in florida and fly down for his appointments. i just want to discuss the results of his tests with someone and maybe get him medication. and on top of everything i am still dealing with so much regarding my mom... her probate isn’t finished because my pro-bono lawyer had a stroke, i have to figure out how to sell her condo and pay (from the estate of course) the apparent $45,000 in debt she left. and now i have my own credit card debt because i didn’t know how to comparison shop for funeral stuff. my mom and i had a complicated relationship too, she was a hoarder after my parents divorced, and i’ll never know whether or not her death was caused by an opiate overdose. that plus all the bureaucratic stuff left to do for my dad (in addition to the fact that dementia is just the most tragic disease known to man) makes it hard to adequately mourn her. and him. everything. all of this has been so draining. i know i’m preaching to the choir. i have gotten no help from my mother’s 3 siblings with her stuff, no help from my dad’s shitty girlfriend (who got her ass back to fl the minute stuff got weird) with his stuff. i resent her so much. she hasn’t seen him since july and she got drunk (also she’s supposedly in “recovery”) and told a family friend that she has a “real” boyfriend in fl. said she’s with my dad only because she cares about his health. if she cared she would be helping. definitely just using my dad at this point because she gets to live rent free. i’ve always disliked her, for good reason, and much like avoiding my mom’s phone calls about my dad, i avoided spending time with my dad for years so i wouldn’t have to see her. my dad and i were always so close and my disapproval of her character was the one thing we rarely have seen eye to eye on. that part hurts and there’s no going back. my sweet boyfriend has been a big help, as have my friends, though few of them know what this is like because we’re still fairly young. i know to contact the alzheimer’s association for anything i need. i know this post has been incredibly long winded. i guess i’m asking, how do i get through this? am i missing anything with my dad? what can i do to make things better for all of us? thanks for reading and all the best to everyone.",,0
"hi, my dad is 76 and was diagnosed a couple of years ago with dementia. i believe it was in the early stages at the time. he has recently begun to be somewhat delusional, telling me that someone was stalking his wife and that the police were called. he also believes the stalker is lurking around the house. none of this is true. the situation is very complicated because his wife is much younger and their marriage is also on the rocks. she would clearly prefer it if he were in a home of some sort. his finances are a mess and i'm not sure what he will be able to afford. i live in a foreign country and i am not in a position to help him financially. i don't have a clear question for you... basically i'm just really worried for him and dealing with a lot of complicated emotions around this. i do have one question no one will be able to answer, which is how long he likely has left. i am not actually asking this of you people... it's just the question on my mind. my dad has made some serious mistakes in his life with the way he has treated people and other really bad decisions, so i am feeling a lot of resentment as well, but i can't direct that at him (couldn't talk to him about this stuff even when he was healthy). sorry for venting... i'm just feeling really sad and scared for him. thanks for being here.",,0

"i'm 45 (non-binary) white, disabled, autistic, mentally ill, a sexual assault survivor, and impoverished. i was a software engineer before being fired for being disabled. my sister (43) is nondisabled, married, no kids, a homeowner, attorney, lives in a big fancy city, works from home as a federal judge, has benefits, and lives near a big accessible healthcare complex. she has four degrees, two divorces, and a marriage, all paid for by my parents. the house she bought was partially paid for by my parents with the understanding she'd take me in after they die. she lives 3.5 hours away. i have trouble understanding her voice in person and on the phone because she talks so fast. she purposely uses medical and legal language to trip me up lip-reading. two years ago my dad (82) was dx'd with dementia, probably alzheimer's. he's still mobile, not too steady with a cane and not oriented to time anymore. he knows his family, but he's angry and resistant alot of the time now. he's struggling to use the thermostat and tv. he can'tcuse a phone anymore because he forgets what he was calling about.my mom (78) is deaf, losing her eyesight,  and has trouble walking. she's not as sharp as she was, but she doesn't have symptoms of dementia. we share caregiving for my dad and trying to keep up a three bedroom house. my parents have medicare, insurance, and basic savings. my dad gets decent retirement and my mom a little. i took them to a lawyer years ago to get dpoa and because they wanted to have a will. (my sister had a fit because she wanted me to have my dad declared incompetent. i didn't see the need. )both of my parents were doing so well and my dad suddenly declined a few years before the pandemic. my sister has visited us once for two hours after my dad's dx and then stopped calling. she's ""protective of her free time."" she didn't even want her wife to work because she wanted her at home with her all the time. i'm starting to think my sister never intended to let me move in, and i'm guessing that her promises to help us with dad were lies too. she told my mom i was trying to take over the money and put them in a facility. i am trying to keep them in their home. (my sister is the only one with enough money to afford ltc for them.) my mom is now conflicted about letting me help more with finances. my dad is still giving my sister money we can't afford. i absolutely love my parents so much. they weren't perfect and neither am i. we've always helped each other out though. i knew eldercare would be a struggle for me with disabilities. i had no idea what dementia did to a family. it's so hard and i dissociate a lot of the time. i'm scared i'm going to die before one or both of them do and no one will care for them. plus, i spend a lot of time stopping people from taking advantage of them. i went from low blood pressure to high blood pressure in six months and it's complicating my chronic kidney disease. my doctors are begging me to reduce my stress. i can't get care for my treatment resistant depression and adhd here (rurally) either. my mental health is garbage. it's crushing my soul to watch my mom go through this. no matter what my mom does my father complains and is nasty to her. that's on a good day. i can't bring myself to mention the rest of the stuff. my mom and i are doing the best we can and holding each other together. she's able to do more than i can physically right now. i don't know what to do now that my dad can't be left alone and my nephrologist and the nearest trauma center is a two hour drive. he refuses to leave the house most of the time.i don't know what to do if my mom has an emergency and they fly her out of state to the trauma center because i hold poa for both of them. who do i leave alone? how can i possibly choose. my sister blocks me when i ask for help. i've lost thirty pounds in two and a half months. i am out of breath taking the trash out. my mom is losing weight too and has high blood pressure.we both need respite desperately, but my sister says it would be a hardship on her as a federal judge. she gets four weeks of paid vacation days a year and works from home!!we're only asking her for a week for my mom. i want to scream at my sister. (i literally can't because she's a federal judge and will have me arrested.)am i a bad person because i'm scared to die for my parents and leave them alone with her? i love my parents so very much, but my body is giving up and i am in so much pain. i go to sleep crying and wake up shaking.any advice?",,0
"i and my two adult daughters live in colorado. in october my very independent, very private, father had a fall and was taken to the hospital. he had been living alone a long time in indiana. he was found to be very confused and had been diagnosed with dementia of the unspecified sort a few years prior but i did not know that because he never told anyone. we used to talk on the phone quite a bit but i hadn't seen him in person in probably the past 2 years. he never really wanted company. we had a good relationship, just didn't see each other much. when i got to indiana to the hospital where he was after his fall i realized he was going to need a lot of help. i retained an elder-care attorney firm and we did all the necessary powers of attorney. my dad understood the need for help and wanted me to help him. i did understand the enormity of what i signed up to do for him as his power of attorney for health care and his finances so i'm not complaining about that part. i'm grateful i could have time off from my job and grateful that my father trusted me to help him. when he was medically well from the hospital he was released to a rehab unit to regain stamina and steadiness and balance in walking. he went through that rehab process fairly well and was ready to be discharged after about 3 weeks. his home in indiana had deteriorated quite a bit. he was a bit of a hoarder had been confused for a few years and the plumbing did not work. i knew his home was not the proper place for him and i knew i could not take care of him by myself. i know more now about home health options but at the time i really felt i was not equipped to do even that with him in indiana. my brother lives in florida and does not travel. he had not had a good relationship with my father since our parents divorced when i was nine and my brother was six. this was painful to my father and he expressed several times he would like a better relationship with his son. i decided we should go to florida and ""see what it's like to be retired"" while we visited him over the holidays. that was how i presented it to my father but in reality it was to see if a memory care unit in florida could be a good thing for him. my reasoning was that my brother and my father would have a better chance for a stronger bond before my father passes and that i would be able to work at my job in colorado during the summers as usual and then come to florida in the winters. as i said my mother and father divorced when we were both very young so my mother who also lives in florida (close to my brother) would not have been an appropriate person to have my father stay with lol. i did ask if i could stay in her extra bedroom while we visited. my father would be in the memory care unit and i would be in her extra bedroom and we would all be able to visit during the holidays and things will be great! well not really. we got to fl dec 6th, 2021. dad was okay in the memory care unit walking fine handling his own dementia okay kind of more confused but in pretty good health and we visited often. really we visited every day just not all day long everyday. on january 4th my dad stood up too fast and fell at his memory care place. we found out that he was pretty dehydrated and that probably made him faint when he stood up like that. he was taken to a hospital to check his head since no one witnessed his fall and they wanted to make sure he wouldn't have any head trauma from the fall. in that hospital he stayed there four days because of the dehydration and was doing okay. on the day they were going to release him back to the memory care unit he tested positive for covid. luckily he ended up not having severe symptoms because he was vaccinated but unluckily he was then in an isolation unit and they would not let him get up out of the bed because they thought he was a fall risk. he laid in the bed in that hospital for more than 10 days. as most people know the longer you are bedridden the more muscle mass and strength you lose. also unbeknownst to me he was developing bed sores. he got them on the backs of his heels, on his sacrum, one on each buttock, and was developing one on his testicles as well. the hospital told me repeatedly that there was no problem and that he had no bed sores from being immobile with no one moving him or repositioning him because he was in isolation. i asked them every few days.. when he was finally cleared to leave that hospital he was released to a rehab unit to try to get his strength back. that particular rehab unit alerted me that he had these bedsores when he got to them and that the one on his sacrum was severe . however they also overly medicated him with seroquel, did not move him, did not keep him hydrated or fed either. my brother and i visited him every day but of course we weren't there all day long everyday and it never occurred to me that he might be further and further dehydrating and not getting food. on his third day there he had to go to the hospital by ambulance because of going into hypovolemic shock due to low blood volume which is directly caused by severe dehydration. he almost died. he was septic. he was in the icu two days and then spent about two more weeks in that second hospital before he was medically stable enough to be released to the rehab facility he is in now. they have him on a special bed and his sores are slowly healing thank god. he is able to eat and some days able to feed himself if his hands are not shaking too badly. he has been able to stay hydrated as well. i go everyday in the mornings until around 2 in the afternoon. my brother comes by around 2:30 or 3 but has to go back to work after about an hour. sometimes but not always i go back in the later afternoon or possibly early evening it depends on how much i can take emotionally. most of the time i think i did the right thing bringing him down here because if that memory care place had worked i think it would have been good. he was only there a little less than a month before this fall and ever since then things have been so hard for him. he was walking fine 2 months ago. never needed a walker or a cane and didn't even touch the walls as he walk down the hallways. now he just lies in the bed and even though there is rehabilitation, he won't be able to stand until the wounds on his heels heal. i find myself feeling so guilty about bringing him here instead of being brave and keeping him at his home in indiana. now the way things are i can't even take him there because he can't sit up more than a couple of hours at a time because of the sores on his fanny. i feel like i have done a bad job for my dad who trust me literally with his life. he does remember who i am most of the time but a lot of his other conversations are very confused and anxious. he still tells me thank you when i help him get his water or feed him or wipe his mouth or hold his hand and he still tells me he loves me. i love him with all my heart he's the sweetest funniest man i've ever known. i really thought i could do better for him than what i have turned out to be able to do. sometimes i don't know where the future is taking us and i don't want to be the reason that his quality of life has disappeared. i prayed so hard cuz he was in the icu. i have the faith that saint anthony worked miracles with god to save my dad. i feel guilty because i don't know if he is glad to still be with us or not. i know it was selfish of me to ask god to save him or to ask saint anthony for the miracles. i'm down second-guessing myself all the time i don't usually do that. most of the time i can handle it but tonight i feel so confused and worried and lost. all i wanted to do was help him and i feel like i haven't done that even though i know it's not really my fault. i'm sorry for posting such a long pity party story but i know if anyone understands these complicated things it would be you guys.",,0
"i really messed up. i've been taking care of my mom the last 4 years.  she has dementia. unfortunately, i forgot to get the car inspected, and the registration has been expired for almost a year.  i got two tickets today on my way to pay the house taxes.  this is completely my fault.  for the record, the cop who ticketed me was very civil.  even patiently waited while i pulled up my insurance card on my phone.  he was just doing his job. first thing tomorrow i will get the car inspected.  then i have to handle the registration.  from what i understand i can handle the tickets online three days from now.  if possible i will ask for a reduction as i'm guessing they will be upwards of $100.a squirrel or raccoon or something is in the attic, since yesterday.  the kitchen sink faucet is leaking and the valves are stuck.  it feels like everything is going wrong.  my mom said ""i love you baby"" the other day, first time in many months.  that one good thing happened and everything else seems to be falling apart.",,0
"we're in the process of moving closer to my (50f) father (75) and in the process of buying a house in their neighborhood, so talking a great deal about houses and so forth. my husband is staying with my parents while he works and goes house hunting with them. i'm across the us and packing up here, so dealing with things has been rather epically insane. unfortunately, we're starting to notice some bizarre behaviors in my father - he's using racist language he's never used in his life (note: our daughter is mixed race), including dropping the n word, (""i don't mind living in a neighborhood with ns"") asking the same question dozens of times over the course of days (""how much are you paying your realtor?"" note: my cousin, his niece) and today we had a conference call where he was confused for an hour and a half over simple things like why we had to put 10% down for a mortgage, how long a term of a mortgage we were getting, and making dozens of demands about our financial future that have nothing to do with him and aren't his business (""i'm just concerned about cash flow!"") they literally wrote everything down for him about the buying of the house there, selling of the house here and he still kept asking the same questions in this phone call! and he got angry about it. i recommended we all step away from the call, as 3 of us understood the situation and he needed time to review things. and yup, i made him even angrier with that.folks, this is our 4th house. he's never shown any interest in our finances. two weeks ago he asked if i was married (yup, 17 years to my veteran husband). he was also confused as to my legal name (i never changed my name when i married, so my legal name is his last name). he's always been stubborn and self-centered, but somehow this has become much worse lately. honestly, i've likely just been blaming this sort of thing on his personality until now. but i'm not thinking that anymore! i don't even know how to deal with him, much less have a conversation with my mother (75). part of us moving there is to help them as they age, so this is rather startling to say the least.",,0
"there is no easy way to tell this story. i have been married to the same man for a little over 30 years. it hasn't been a bad marriage but it has always been a very needy one, on his part. my husband's mother was also an emotionally needy person. i didn't see this quality in my husband until i was well into the thick of our marriage. we've had a good life together, but his neediness has been exhausting over the years. add to this he is not exactly a ""go-getter."" i think his mother's self-focus left him feeling alone in childhood &amp; he essentially never grew up. step in me pragmatic mary poppins. take care of everything. make things better for everyone. i'm not as nice as mary poppins though and as i get older i'm bitter.the reason i say all this is because i'm now dealing with a situation i can't handle. my husband, i'll call him winston, was diagnosed about 7 years ago with serious dementia and was told he needs to get his affairs in order soon. it was devastating news, of course. but the catch is, it was not provided by a reliable neurologist. we later found out that he was somewhat of a licensed practicing quack.  (a story for another time). long story short his diagnosis was rebuffed by many other trusted doctors and neurologists who confirmed over and over that my winston was not in cognitive decline and in fact, he was a relatively healthy man for his age and situation. so, good news, you'd think, right? well not for winston, he couldn't shake out that original diagnosis and settled himself into a funk and self-pity. he almost immediately start focusing on everyday absent-mindedness or slow recall to sure signs that he was in the mental decline the quack doctor said he was.  i was left to manage everything in our married life. income, finances, children, medical and mental care for our family and extended family. winston, in the meantime, became a couch potato, making his incorrect diagnosis a self-fulling prophecy. however, there is more to this story. winston did not like to work. he never did. he did not want any responsibility in life. he was the jovial life of the party. everyone loved winston, he was good for laughing and up for anything fun. this is part of what attracted me to him when i was young. i came from a stoic hard-working family with very little time for fun or affection, and winston showed me a world i never knew existed. he was a way out of my tough demanding family that displayed little support and caring for each other.  it was fun for a long time until it came time to really be an adult. winston could not do it. he drifted from job to job. winston often got promoted quickly because he was so charming and witty management loved him, but in a short time, they realized that was all he was and he end up getting fired, over and over. i kept us afloat all those years. i was a good worker, just as i was raised to be. i paid the bills and got us through rough times. i found winston job after job that he'd eventually lose. i took care of the house, the repairs, the care of the children all the adult work.  i had to threaten winston i'd leave him just to get him to mow the yard and take out the trash on a regular basis.i always knew when winston's current job wasn't going well because suddenly he'd be ill. he'd start calling in sick over nothing. that was usually the beginning of the end for every job. if i was ever sick, he was sicker, no matter if it was a simple headache or pneumonia. he was sicker because not to be would mean he would be in charge and have to manage things until i got better. so now winston seems to have mci and i don't know if he really does. after years of this, i think he's just trying to get out of holding down a job, helping me around the house. his job is not difficult and it provides a reasonable income and needed health insurance. he managed to keep this job for 7 years since his false diagnosis. i don't know what to do, and sadly i don't want to take care of him. he's drained the life out of me. i'm older now and not in great health. i'd like to take care of myself instead of him. our kids are grown adults, and they seldom connect with us. i understand why, we have a sad home now, with little hope of a good outcome. i dream of just leaving winston and starting a new life somewhere far away from all of this, but i know the burden of his care will fall on the children. why should they have to deal with winston when it was my choice to marry him all those years ago?i don't know if he has mci or not, but he knows i'm fed up. my compassion is running out and i'm not sure if he deserves the compassion i've given him. he does seem to be getting worse, at least when he's around me. he can't seem to manage the simplest tasks i ask him to do from holding up a curtain rod for two seconds to shoveling a short sidewalk. i'm lost and i don't know what my next step should be, but this can't go on. i've alluded to some of the problems with winston to my close family and friends, but not wanting to burden them and be the ""debbie downer,"" i keep most of these feelings to myself. if you've read this far, thanks. i don't know what i expect in terms of help or support, but i'm not able to go to support groups without winston. i work full time and in my free time, winston is there and behaves in a way that makes me feel like i can't leave him alone.",,0
"my 92 year old aunt has no children and has alienated our entire family. she's doing her best to alienate me too, but i know she needs help and so far i'm the only one willing and able to step up. i'm very sure she has dementia, as is pretty much every healthcare worker that's come into contact with her. after changing her mind back and forth for around 2 years, she finally decided to move from her small town into a very nice assisted living home in the city closest to her doctors. well, she didn't exactly decide to move into assisted living. she first moved into the independent living part of the home, but also occupied a ""respite room"" in assisted living while she was healing from a broken vertebrae. last week she finally decided that paying for two apartments probably wasn't the best idea and has moved into an assisted living apartment. the thing that finally brought the dementia to our attention was her loss of balance, and subsequent falls. when she moved a couple of months ago, she had a broken foot, wrist, and vertebrae. the vertebrae is a compression wedge fracture that is only getting worse over time, despite the monitored care. this is due to her osteoporosis and her absolute stubbornness in refusing to take it easy and wear her brace correctly. i'm seriously concerned she's going to keep injuring herself until she's flat on her back and catches pneumonia, which i'm certain would kill her. and she's fallen 6 times since late october. additionally, she is extremely suspicious of everything, and thinks everyone is trying to steal from her. i understand this is a big part of the disease, but i just don't know how to deal with it. i honestly believe she's hiding cash, but i haven't figured out where so i can prove she's still got her money. meanwhile, she ""loses"" about $80/wk. she's had to downsize quite a bit as a result of the move, which has been hard. even harder has been her selling her car. she shouldn't have been driving long before this move, but the people in the small town felt sorry for her and allowed her to skip the eye test when it came time to renew her license. technically, she has a license until the end of summer. she's been determined to buy or rent another car so she can start driving again. harder still, there will come a point in time where she will have to change doctors. right now she goes to military bases, but as i don't live in the same city she will soon lose her transportation when i go home. she is absolutely adamant about not seeing civilian doctors, even though multiple people have tried to explain that it won't cost her anything and she'll be able to develop much longer term relationships with the doctors. heck, there are even doctors that would make house calls that she could see for free. i understand that this has been so much change for her, and i honestly don't know if i'd be handling it well, and i'm 50 years younger. but the verbal abuse that is constantly heaped on me is taking its toll. there have been a few times i've engaged in disagreement, which just makes everything worse. i keep trying to remind myself that it's the dementia talking, but her personality didn't do a 180 with the dementia. if anything, she's her same old self, only turned up to 11. now some family members are advising me to drop her and cut her out of my life. she's living in a great place, and i completely trust the people caring for her, but she still needs someone to help handle her finances and take her to appointments. she's already got an open case with adult protective services because she falsely accused the family of forcing her to sell her car and house, and while i'm not worried about the outcome of that i am worried that if everyone drops her she'll become a ward of the state. i'm completely out of my element and have no idea how to handle everything. any advice?tl;dr: 92 yo aunt with dementia and i think i'm failing her. help please",,0
"(**quick trigger warning:** i get kinda dark at the end of this, talking about death and all)[so last time i posted]( i got so much information and support, which i really appreciate. it'll sound super cheesy but i'm just so glad that there are other people who were willing to listen to me and be empathetic and lend an ear.unfortunately, because my grandma never held a job here in america (she took care of the apartment that she lived in with my mom &amp; aunt while they worked) and moved here with almost no money, there's not much in the way of a savings or retirement plan that we can fall back on to support any type of care, which means the private homes are out of the question. she's also really vital for her age (despite the dementia), so nursing homes that insurance would cover won't take her. i think our best bet for now is adult daycare or an in-home nurse? my mom's still hashing the details out, but it's slow going. grandma's been diagnosed in the late stages of alzheimer's so that may open up more options for us.i finished my first semester at university, trying not to worry too much about what was going on at home. everything sounded pretty okay in phone calls, so that alleviated things a bit. i've been back for winter vacation and up until now things seemed really good! until tonight, when grandma spent two hours trying to find the phone number to ""her house"" or the directions so that she could take a taxi. all she seemed to think was that it was by a hospital in lima. even when my mom told her that we were in the united states, she seemed really adamant to get there.sometimes i feel super guilty for thinking that she might not be alive to see the next year as a positive thing, but i know that she's slowly just losing herself and even her early memories are getting jumbled up. at least before she could tell us about things that happened to her as a kid or family members that have passed away. it hurts to think about how i'm talking about the same person who taught me how to peel an apple or helped me with my math homework in fifth grade, but i guess them's the breaks. every little news fragment about how our treatment of the disease is slowly improving at least gives me a little hope that this type of degeneration may not have to happen to my parents or the many other people i care about (including all yall here, even if i don't know you personally)on a more positive note, grandma was laughing with my mom about how systematically my dog begs for her for food: he goes up to her, does a little ""patita"" as we call it (cutesy spanish slang for foot/paw; it's when he gently paws at whatever's closest to him to get attention), gets a tiny bit of her food, and then proceeds to lay on her feet in case she drops something else. **tldr:** things are still pretty grim, but we're dealing with it the best we can. no matter what, we're trying to enjoy the time we have left with grandma and i'm trying to live my life without worrying too much, since things seem to be going better than i thought they would while i'm away.also, dad has learned to use google translate to communicate a little. hooray!",,0
"i'm 50 years old (male).  single and no kids.  mom has late stage dementia.  my sister (54 years old, single, no kids) lives with mom and takes care of her.  mom needs 24x7 care.  she can't walk, needs to be spoon fed, can barely talk (mostly mumbles jibberish), has to be bathed and changed.  a hired caregiver takes care of her during the day, i take over the afternoon, and my sister the evening and night.2 weeks ago, my sister passed away.  no warning signs at all.  she had a headache friday night and passed out.  it was a brain aneurysm.  she passed away 2 days later (early sunday morning).  i spent 48 hours in the hospital with her while our caregiver helped with mom over this extremely stressful two days.just like that, i am now mom's full time caregiver.  i sleep on a mattress on the floor next to her at night (she needs to be turned a couple of times so she doesn't get bed sores).  i change her diapers.  caregiver gives her baths, but due to holidays, she was off, so i gave mom a bath this weekend.  today is my 4th day with mom all by myself.  caregiver will come back tomorrow (tuesday).mom has lived in the same condo for over 30 years, so i don't want to move her.  i'm bringing stuff over from my apartment and wondering if i should just give up my apartment.  it's been brutal clearing out my sister's stuff.  i haven't had time to grieve my sister's passing yet.  i'm absolutely overwhelmed.  i'm just taking things step-by-step.  learning about mom's meds, going through my sister's paperwork, arranging cremation and funeral stuff, and dealing with mom.  i'm actually thinking about skipping the funeral.  i just can't do it.  my biggest fear is that i don't have any back-up.  my sister and i were back-up to each other.  i'm now alone.  i have no social life anymore.  i have a girlfriend and used to spend all weekends with her, but am not able to see her anymore or go out anywhere.  i'm an avid cyclist and used to go on long rides several times a week (mountain and road biking).  had just bought a nice road bike.  all has come to an abrupt halt.  i can't even risk biking and getting hurt, nor do i have the time.  my life took a 180 degree turn overnight.  i had promised my sister that i would take care of mom if anything ever happened to her.  i'm gonna stick it out and do my best.  not sure if i can hold up.  i really don't think mom has much longer to go.  hiring extra caregivers or putting her in a home can be very expensive and not sure if i can afford that.  i'm now paying mom's condo hoa and utility bills and supporting her, so finances are already stretched.  on top of it, mom has severe anxiety and sundowning.  i'm trying various meds.  just put her on hospice care last week, but they are slow to respond to my questions on meds.  trazadone was a disaster and kept her up and hallucinating all night.  seraqual and buspar work better, but each has it's own issues.  i'm very frustrated.  thanks for reading and allowing me to vent.",,0
"does anybody have any idea how health care works with all this? i've been trying to dry research and make the right choices for my in laws but it's really confusing. i tried them both abs was trying to get them affordable care act insurance but marketplace came back saying they qualify for medicaid. so they got that. but now the husband's ss has kicked in, wife's has not yet (ssd she's the one with dementia). i feel like based on those very meagher ss checks they won't qualify for medicaid. so why did they? because they didn't have it yet? is it ok to pursue ask services? what happens if in a year they lose medicaid? do they try and claw back money?if anybody knows how to work all this please and thank you",,0
"i (51m) am looking after my mom (83f) who was diagnosed w alzheimer's in 2018 after exhibiting symptoms starting in 2016.  she shouldn't be driving (there's plenty of evidence that my siblings and i have witnessed first hand).  the neurologist reported her to the dmv upon diagnosis, but she somehow passed the dmv driving test.  her insurance was canceled for a few months (i guess dmv notifies the insurer?) and keeping her from driving was quite difficult at that time (her screaming profanities at me, etc.).fast forward to 2020.  she's still driving once/week to her friends house about 20 miles away.  it needs to stop, so i concoct a plan (that her friend agrees with) that her keys go missing, and we'll ease her into using uber/lyft for the 20 mile trip.  she refuses to take the uber, but can't really explain why.  this was three days ago.  since then, she has called me an average of 35 times/day while i'm away at work either asking me where her keys are or saying there's an emergency and i need to come home immediately. she has no recollection that she's calling me that often.  when i get home, she wants me to solve the problem, and is relentless (although i sometimes get a break because she forgets the problem exists).  this is killing me.  part of me wants to ""find"" the keys, so that she can continue driving with the hope that something bad does happen so that this misery that is alzheimer's will finally end.  then part of me says, others must certainly have been in this situation before and gotten through it, so i can too.so tell me reddit, how do i get over this hurdle w her???",,0
"hi all,so sorry about the extremely long post. not sure where to start with this post but its about my father with lewey body dementia, covid and financial questions. he is extremely vulnerable to predators.backstory:my father has been dealing with frequent hallucinations for few years. it was a once in a blue moon thing starting around 2015/2016, that was typically dismissed. then with time, it progressed into a more frequent occurrence. by 2020 50% of our phone calls would be about the spirits in his house and what they had done and how he would use the power of god to dispel them. he comes from a culture that is not big on mental health and a country/continent with comparatively low dementia rates. he was proud of his “visions” as he said god had chosen him as one of the prophesying elders mentioned in the bible. he would insult and act aggressively towards any one who would suggest seeing a doctor. he also developed an obsession with international lottery mail scams which he believed with his whole being would be the key to making him a multimillionaire. he would wire money to them. with what frequency or how much… i don’t know, most likely 1000s+.his only asset is the home he lives in and he would allegedly rent out the basement and a couple rooms for extra income to supplement his social security payments. i was comforted that he was not lonely as he sometimes rents to his “friends” or people he knows from his church. other than that he seemed pretty lucid to me but i didn’t know the severity of his cognitive problems; he seemed more “quirky” than anything else. he has been seperated from my mother for maybe ten years but they have been on friendly terms with once a month contact and live in the same town. i have lived 100-1000 miles away from both parents for about 15 years so contact is less frequent on my end. the quality of his tenants started to get sketchier. a year ago he had a man move in, described as homeless who had gone through a recent operation and needed medical care. i asked why he would take someone in like that. how would he pay? he mentioned this man had relatives in the church he goes to and they pressured him because god is caring. he said this man could pay rent. that was the end of that. he allegedly kicked out that man a few months later and took in another questionable man in the summer of 2020. he kept on mentioning how this man was his true friend because he would listen to him about the spirits and his secrets. then it turned sour because this man didn’t want to hear about the “secrets” or the lottery anymore. this man contracted covid in december and was sent home from the hospital to recover. my father then contracts covid from him and is sent to the hospital. my father had changed his number a couple weeks earlier and hadn’t placed any of his families numbers in there. my father never learned how to use a computer and has trouble with smart phones so any chance of remembering our numbers from memory was nilch.  since he was not able to give out our contact numbers, this “tenant” he contracted covid from was made the point of contact. my mother goes to the house for her monthly visit and is met aggressively by this tenant. he was asking who she was and why she was there. he tells her that my father has been in the hospital for a month and he doesn’t know if he died or got lost because of the dementia. the lack of tact and blatant misinformation was appalling. turns out this man was just a couple days away from being given guardianship over my father, whether this meant power over finances… idk i’m still ignorant over what types of guardianships have what rights. the hospital social worker said that don(not the man’s real name) had already decided that my father was going to be sent to a nursing home permanently after the hospital because the hospital and don both agreed that my father was incapable of dealing with his personal affairs. we showed up just in time to stop this motion. i’m surprised and relieved my father survived. he had a hole in his lungs and was on oxygen. he lost the ability to walk and his leg muscles atrophied. his body was/is recovering but his mind seems to have gotten worse. his convos now make no sense. for a week straight he was talking about how obama was trying to steal his land and how trump would come through. we have to remind him who is talking to him on the phone. and sometimes he asks my mother about their son(she has no sons). he is now in rehab and has regained some movement in his legs. he sounded a bit more lucid on the phone yesterday. honestly i do agree with the hospital’s record of mental incapacity. i recently came across his bank statements from all the way back to 2017. **turns out he has never charged rent to any of the people living/passing through in his house for years.** his basement is alway occupied by a family… right now its a family of 5. the two bedrooms upstairs, occupied by randoms. another room is empty… reserved for this pastor that comes from his country every summer. his home is essential serving as a shelter/halfway house as he gathers people pushed on to him by the church he frequents or people he meets along the way. now it makes sense that don was offended when we called to give him a heads up about rent. he simply just said “i don’t have the money!”. apparently he’s broke because he spent so much money getting movers! this house still has a mortgage and is filthy. cockroaches are also very visible “tenants”.another concerning piece is that my father spends $1000-2000 a month on counter checks. this basically eats up the majority of his social security check. where these go to… i don’t know but now i suspect he was wiring this money to the international lotto scams or maybe just giving it out to people? a year ago he was flagged and banned from wiring money at his local supermarket because what he was doing was considered gambling. at this point, i would believe you if you told me he was paying rent to the people living there rentfree because they told him to. apparently don felt so comfortable he is using the garage as a hoarding space and got married during these few months he has been living in my fathers home. is his new wife going to move in? all of this has been so overwhelming for me, especially when thinking about my father’s future. how do you remove these people, essentially squatters? none have leases. my father needs financial supervision. would the hospital backing me up be enough to get a conservatorship(or poa?). when the time comes for long term memory care, i can see that maybe his social security + if the house is rented correctly would be enough to pay the exorbitant prices of a home but right now his finances and spending situation is a mess. he has always been very independent but now i don't think that is an option for him anymore.",,0
my mom (doesn’t live with me) finally let me into her finances and it’s a mess (hasn’t paid taxes in 3 yrs and running) she got four accounts and money coming and going  every which way. can anybody save my sanity and give me some tips or 1st priority. i’m so overwhelmed i don’t know where to start.,,0
"hey there.  my mom is mid stage dementia and has just enough money for a couple of years..($60,000)...(no long term health/ life insurance/pension nor retirement savings) if we spend smartly and i do most of the care.  memory care seems so expensive..like $6000-8000 a month.  does someone have to spend all their life savings before any help?  she is ok for now with home health and me but i'm going to have to go back to work and i'm so worried she will need more care!  i'm also not mentally equipped to do all of this by myself!  how do you do it??",,0

"hello i’m a long time reddit lurker but first time poster. the reason i am posting this probably sounds suspicious and i don’t blame you if you think so i agree it does. anyways my grandpa raised me from the time i was one years old. he’s in his upper 80’s now and having a horrible time health wise. i have to take him 80 miles one way to a specialist twice a week for his medical condition. i also live with my grandpa and take care of him during the day. my aunt comes over at night so i can go to work but she has her own life and will have to quit doing that soon. i know i’m going to have to check him into a nursing home soon and it kills me. this medical thing has broke us. we can barely pay his rent because i’ve missed so much work and he has horrible insurance and only draws a small sum from social security. i am down to working 10 hours a week because of taking care of him. i hate to ask this but if anyone could spare me a little money for this months expenses it would be greatly appreciated. we just simply aren’t going to be able to make ends meet this month. between the constant trips gas money and food and me not working much it’s just not there. i regret asking here and if i’m a bother i’m sorry but i don’t know where else to ask. his kids don’t have anything to do with them and i don’t have anything to do with my mom (his daughter) either. i have cashapp if anyone wants to help, but if you want please pray for us. i know i’m gonna lose him eventually and that kills be but i’ll be okay i hope. thanks.",,0
"my dad is 57 years old with lewy body dementia. over the last year he has gone from being able to walk and talk and eat and do some household tasks to not being able to walk at all and hardly being able to get up into his scooter, having trouble eating and not talking well at all. it’s progressing so quickly and i know he’s gonna get way worse from here, but it’s getting so hard and i don’t know how my mom and i are gonna be able to take care of him. he’s on hospice right now, and he has a nurse who comes once a week or whenever we need her and he’s on heavy pain medication and has a catheter so he doesn’t have to get up too often. and he has a caregiver who comes twice a week to help him shower. but he hasn’t been able to poop and we’re worried about that so we try to get him on the toilet once a day so he can try to poop but he keeps getting stuck on the toilet and we have to call the fire department to come help him off the toilet. we’re worried about that because the hospice place can’t get someone here in time to help get him up and there’s only so much help we can afford from them so they said our only options are to call the fire department or hire private help. how are we supposed to afford private help? i know soon he’ll be bed bound and even harder to take care of so i know it’s something we need but we don’t know how we’re going to afford it. his insurance covers hospice but only to a point and my moms already paying out of pocket for a lot of their services and we can’t afford much more. we don’t know what to do, if anyone has some advice on getting private care i would appreciate it. we’re located in arizona in the us. my mom has a caseworker and stuff so were trying our resources but it feels like we’re not getting anywhere. what do other people who’s loved ones are suffering from lewy body do? it’s so hard and horrible to watch and it’s so hard for him to do anything i’m just so overwhelmed. we thought it was the end a few weeks ago when he couldn’t get up anymore and he kept telling us he was dying but the nurse came and said this is just the beginning and it’s just a lot i don’t know how we’re going to take care of him if he gets any worse.",,0
"i (24/f) always dread the night time. tirades kick into overdrive but i’m still hopeful. i can’t believe it was just yesterday that i skipped work to get a psychiatric eval for my mom. her neurologist is skeptical about dementia, the neuropsychologist is skeptical it’s dementia. however, the psychiatrist from friday definitely thinks it’s dementia. her pcp definitely thinks it’s dementia. i just had to endure a damn 15 minute long tirade about how she despises my boyfriend because he told me to open a window when he visited. (she also hates haitian men. my mother, my father, and my boyfriend, are haitian) he never said such a thing. the only time he even mentioned a window was when it was hot at our place and in all fairness, it was a hot summer day and i only had the windows open for fresh air. this tirade involved money and i definitely messed up and caused this. her brother gave her $5,000 three weeks ago because we’re financially struggling. i had to cut off the cable, landline, and remove protections on the car insurance on thursday because i’m sole breadwinner now and i can’t take on all these bills. i pat myself on the back for successfully decreasing the costs to under $1,000 a month per person so we can still live in this apartment. now she’s accusing me of giving the money to my boyfriend, spreading my legs for my boyfriend. i can’t trust her with money anymore. nighttime is my least favorite time of the day now. however, the psychiatrist prescribed her zoloft. he doesn’t think she has depression or anxiety but he said it wouldn’t hurt to try. today and tomorrow is a half a dose and the next are a full dose. 50 mg’s a day, to be exact. hopefully those will make her drowsy. hopefully she will sleep even more than she already does. hopefully she’ll never wake up.",,0

"hey - i'm not really sure what i'm doing, but i need some help and am not really sure where to go or who to reach out to.my mother was diagnosed with alzheimer's about a month ago by her pcp. i went to the appointment with her for support, as we feared she may have alzheimer's already (it took her father several years ago). the doctor put her on some medications, but they ended up not working out for her (they caused a syncopal episode).my mom lives with my father about an hour away from me. i'm 33, married, and an only child.i guess... does anyone have resources or some kind of guidebook on how to deal with a parent having this disease? a book recommendation or.. anything? i know that's probably asking a lot, but i feel totally lost and alone here. i don't know when symptoms require intervention, what to look out for, and what steps to take as things progress.the doctor didn't say if her symptoms were mild, moderate, severe, etc, but it sounds like maybe he should have? she seems coherent most of the time, but just does or says things that don't make sense now and then, so i'm hoping her case is still mild.i'm getting worried about her hurting herself in her home, especially after thanksgiving when she nearly burned herself in the kitchen. she gets very upset if the topic of alzheimer's is brought up, the same thing with my father. i think they want to continue on like nothing is going on, but i feel we should be taking a more proactive approach on how to handle this?for example, my father told me yesterday that my mom had had a couple checks bounce (she's in charge of their finances and that kind of thing never happens). we know something needs to be done, but are just not sure what, and are trying to be very delicate with anything we do or say as to not upset her more.sorry if this is a bit rambly, i'm just a bit upset and confused after the holiday. any insight is appreciated. i really don't know what to do.",,0
"my mother, 82, was recently diagnosed with alzheimer's, though has been showing increasing memory problems for several years and has been on a steeper downhill slide the last four months. she's currently living in the ""independent living"" area in an excellent retirement community where the residents and staff know her and care about her. later this week we are moving her to a new facility where she will be in assisted living, with memory care available when she needs it.i'm her son, 64, and i am her agent under her power of attorney, which was authorized by the written opinion of her doctor. my mom has a very controlling personality. for the most part, she has used her powers for good, planning carefully for her future. she has long term care insurance and enough money in her investments to last her for many, many years. but now, of course, she's resisting my taking control of her finances (she has forgotten many times to pay bills, her rent, etc) and is absolutely against moving. her current facility has been doing what they can within their legal power (we are in washington, where there are strict laws governing what the differences are between independent and assisted living) to keep her safe while we find new housing, but there is really no choice now that we have a new home for her. she has to move. we've talked about it many times over the past few weeks. as expected, every conversation about her moving is the same conversation, because she can't remember what we've talked about in the past. she continually surprised by the fact that she can't stay where she is (they can't provide the level of care she needs). she asks over and over about the new rent, and where the money is coming from, why she has to move when she's happy where she is. her arguments and questions are always the same. it's almost like a script, and have no idea how to get ahead of it, if i even can. i tell her over and over -- sometimes several times in the same conversation -- where the money is coming from, that it's hers, and it's being used exclusively for her (though, to be honest, i've been a co-signer on her bank accounts for over a decade, long before dementia was an issue for her...so i could legally use it for anything i want, but morally...no, it's hers). as much as i am able i keep my patience, answer her questions and explain the circumstances as if it's the first time i'm hearing her questions and giving her the answers.i dread the next week, as we pack and move, and the weeks after as she gets used to her new home (or doesn't, as the case may be). i love my mom, and i hate having to defy her. i'm afraid of her taking a walk in the next few days and getting lost, as she has a couple times lately (not seriously lost...not yet). since she's in independent living at the moment, the staff can't legally stop her from leaving. but i'm afraid she'll get it into her head to walk away as a deliberate act against the control i've had to take over her life. or she could write me a letter revoking the power of attorney, which is one of the provisions of the poa. i doubt she'll remember she can do that (though i've reminded her of it a couple of times), or won't be able to think through the decision and the act to do it. and if somehow she does, with the new lease having been signed and move-out notices given, i have no idea what i would need to do next. i know this is probably an old story. everyone's alzheimer's journey is different, they tell me, but the broad strokes are much the same. and i know in my head what i'm doing is right for her. but she also makes me doubt it. i'm a pretty empathetic person, but i have a hard time empathizing with her, seeing things through her eyes, because her memory problems are foreign to me, especially since she's been so logical and thought so correctly for my whole life.i wish i could *feel* i'm doing things right. i know i'm doing the best i can. no one among her friends or family is opposing my decisions except my mom, but i'm also the only one making decisions.so i had to vent.",,0
"dad (94) parkinsons, dementia/alzh and a narcissist. nothing is ever wrong with him, its always something or someone else. he has a newer pair of glasses he got this year and one thats two years old and the third i think four years old. as far as i'm aware he had no issues with the two year old pair. for some reason that made no sense he wanted a new pair. same exact script. his eyes didnt change in two years. both his eye doctor and the optician are the best. this new pair we spent many trips in to get them fitted properly. each time in the office he was happy and later would be unhappy. he wanted to give his new pair back cause they never fit right. not a refund, just give them back. he never could explain why. for a couple months no problems and now he says the glasses don't work cause he can't see clearly. i try and find out whats wrong and if he had this problem on his previous glasses and his answers make no sense. at this point i can only consider there is actually nothing wrong he just got it in his head neither work properly. i have read that with parkinsons the eye muscles can degrade and cause problems. i tried talking to him about it and he totally ignored me. i do wonder if parkinsons isn't playing with his eyesight. maybe he can benefit from some areds?  i can actually see him going to the eyedoctor over and over til he's broke. he doesn't have eye insurance. it frustrates me and drives anxiety when he gets crazy like this. being a narcissist means he won't listen to me and no one can question what he thinks. it's not like a nice old grandpa who has issues and will listen and let you help him and actually give weight to what you say. he's a bit crazy and thinks he's perfect. any thoughts on either point?thanks",,0
"my grandmother has had about 5 stokes over the past 10 years. she has been living with my parents for the past 2 years after her last stoke which has led to significant dementia.she has an always right personally which has been enhanced by the dementia. since she has had several stokes before, she has learned how to handle their effects--meaning we can have no suggestions. she completely acknowledges she has mental issues and is frequently frustrated by them, but still refuses to accept even the smallest chunks of reality.we took her to her dentist the other day and she said that she hated this dentist and said that all they want to do is find ways to charge her more money. she said she had some form of pre-paid insurance at her preferred dentist but that my dad had ripped up the papers. she told us about this dentist and wanted to go there.i took her out driving to find it. she didn't know where it was other than some vague memories, and neither did i. she said my dad knew where it was and was upset he made me take her. we spent several hours circling the city, she wanted me to ask people on the street if they knew where the dentist was located.a similar situation happened about a year ago when she said she had money in a secret bank. my dad took her out driving around for it several times, probably why he passed the driving task to me to find the dentist this time.unfortunately the conversations between her and my dad often lead to argument as she lays claims over our chip clips or other things my dad can't just go with (such as driving her around to find non-existent business or walmart certainly not being the store where she buys her yogurt). while most of her stories and delusions can be uuhhuu'd, there are some that require intervention such as refrigerator settings, food choices, shower schedule, or that her aarp card only works for medicine. she doesn't like paying for anything, although very good standing financially.she doesn't like playing games or really anything else enjoyable (she is ""done with all that""). she talks of how she likes going to the store and helping people by talking through their problems. a worthy cause, but not scalable, especially during covid. we wanted to get some sort of professional caregiver or members of her church to visit, but she doesn't trust strangers and fears they will steal stuff. she spends her days just sort of existing and we would like to find something for her to do.i don't want to straight up lie to her as she isn't completely disconnected. she seems cognizant to those that don't understand the context deeper.i avoid correcting her but try to be as honest as possible and sprinkle in a little reality here and there without upsetting her just to maintain my own sanity. when frustrated by my parents, i say it is difficult for them too.i have maintained a great relationship with her and she is always overjoyed to see me when i visit my parents' every week. she takes me into her room and shows me/talks about various things and offers me food from her stash of junk food.",,0
"my mother-in-law has been struggling even more than before during the pandemic (as i'm sure almost everybody in a nursing home has), and over the last two months it's gotten very hard to engage with her over the phone. no mobility, so she's pretty much sedentary and watched tv in bed all day, and the lack of usual visits by us plus interaction with others in the nursing home has made an awful impact on her cognitive functioning, ability to have a conversation and to hold on to her thoughts, sort of speak. when we're on the phone with her and she needs something, and we suggest she pushes her call button for a cena/nurse, she will either shrug it off or be unable to find it. i mean... i probably don't need to explain this as i'm sure you're living through it all. with dementia progressing, my mil seems to now struggle particularly with handling a phone, so sometimes we can't get through to her for days. my partner and i have our own mental health challenges in the midst of this, and i'm desperate to find a way to make things easier for all of us somehow.for months i've been thinking about getting an amazon echo show, because if we have that properly configured and placed in my mil's room, we should be able to 'drop in' and initiate a call without her needing to 'answer' anything. i know that the only way to figure out if it would work is to just try it, but due to finances being very tight, i do want to make sound decisions - so obviously i'm researching the heck out of this. with amazon having sales right now, it definitely seems worth a shot - and i truly can't think of any other way that we might be able to improve communications. but i'd really like some real life experiences about this -  i've done a lot of research already but very little is from real people's life.has anyone here tried an echo show (which has automatic drop in) or even facebook portal (requires for a call to get answered) to try to improve engagement with a parent/senior in a nursing home who is becoming very withdrawn, and has dementia rapidly progressing because of the lack of meaningful social interaction? or is there something else that you did? we're beyond drained and saddened, and i just want to try to find something that will help.in case you do have an echo -- does it require being plugged in all day or is there a way to have it operate with a battery during the day and charge at night?",,0

"okay so i'm going to try and get to the point. she's been ""difficult"" as a younger woman and girl from what i've learned. not sure if there's a condition that worsens and develops into dementia at some point? but it's gotten worse over time. especially since she's alone now (grandfather passed in 2016 at 86). i did everything i could considering i live a couple of hours away now. i'd come to town and just fight through the negativity to help. every little thing she notices out of place makes her think someone is coming in the house just to mess with her. honestly there's a rat issue that still hasn't completely resolved, and they might be the culprit. she had been saying for almost a year or longer someone is coming in, even accused me and another family member. i insisted she got cameras inside the house to monitor anything unusual. i have access to her security system, and found her to do some strange things when she alerted me of someone coming in. like, she made coffee, poured it into a bowl, and just .. idk what she did with it? she insisted someone came in to cook food, another time someone left dishes she didn't recognize, left dirty rags, moved some things, put clothes on the floor, etc. the list goes on. security company finds nothing unusual, but she just gets angry and accuses people of trying to ""make her like she's crazy"". i always tell her she can call the company if she wants to review footage of a particular time, see if they see anything. she never wants to anymore because they will tell her nothing happened. she started covering the cameras so no one could look at her when she didn't want them to. of course i never checked footage unless she insisted something happened.sometimes i feel uncomfortable taking any action because when police came after getting an emergency call, they suggested calling adult services and i quickly learned how terrible it can be dealing with them. they came in a vehicle with a flashing yellow light on top and made her feel totally uncomfortable. she fears someone wants to ""take control"" of her. this isn't a lie actually, because 3/4 of her kids excluding my mom and one grandkid took advantage of her financially. long lasting family business basically went to shit over time and died bc of mismanaging funds and taking out loans under grandparents noses. i never did nor do i now want to take advantage, and i don't want her in a nursing home. i also understand she needs help, but a special kind of help abs support that won't stress her. my mom and aunt will not bother to call her or return calls (aunt lives next door in house grandparents financed and rented to her about 30 years ago). they are her only surviving kids (one uncle died in 2015 and the other earlier this year), and the other 4 grandchildren don't bother checking on her at all. it's just me trying and it's stressful (23) feeling as if i can't do shit. i haven't been able to emotionally take all of the things she's been saying (she can get quite verbal and personal unfortunately) without having to end the convo and i feel bad because i know she can't help it. but as i've seen, continuing the conversations have lead to health issues with other family members who have now passed (uncles, grandpa). there was a time i actually felt myself getting deeply stressed and unhealthy trying to save a failing business/deal with the fact that part of it failing had to do with her being irrational majority of the time (being rude/personal with customers and employees etc.) and had to step away and find my inner peace again. the business was dead by the time i tried to fix it all, and was financially drained. it started to work fine for a couple of months but ultimately the plug was pulled.she hasn't even been diagnosed with it and i know she won't get tested willingly. she's given me durable poa over properties, business, etc. (excluding health) about a year ago or less, but revoked it after a mischievous family member got involved (they disappeared when they found out grandma had nothing to give). she's mentioned that her doctor suggested having someone look after her, but of course she was enraged at the thought. so yeah.. probably hasn't gotten tested. my ideal circumstance is to have someone look after her at home where she's comfy, and not doped up on meds. also, she's in bankruptcy and having a difficult time understanding things but wants no poa activated out of fear she'll be put away (even though i never had health poa). she will end up losing everything and my fear of her dying from stress will still be a threat if i don't get involved.im sorry if it seems like i'm all over the place, i can barely think straight! i just want her at home, and to know the property etc. she wants to keep are safe so that she's happy. how do i get this ideal scenario for her? i know she'd still be furious about someone aiding her at home but it can't be as stressful as a nursing home. how do i ensure my poa is active again? this is hard.",,0
"my mom is the primary care giver for my dad. he has become really violent lately. he will be yellling at us (sometimes towards noody), throwing stuff at us, hitting us, and alwys using foul language. we feel very unsafe in our own home currently. he also has been trying to get out the house lately so we have put latches on the outside of our door to prevent that. our doctor put him on some new medications but nothing seems to be working. we are looking to put him in a memory care facility but they do not accept his medicare insurance and we do not have enough to pay for it, what should we do?",,0
"at this point, i'm not sure if my mother (75) can continue to live alone. she has moderate dementia and a ton of mental instability that goes with that and previous mental issues. we installed a camera in her living room as that is where she spends most of her time and worried she'd fall down and not get up. she has a friend that comes and helps her with medication every morning and without that friend setting up the medication in the mon-sun box, she wouldn't know what to take, why to take it, and how to take it. i'm the epoa and mpoa and have since taken over her finances as she either forgets to pay a bill, pays too much, or struggles to balance the checkbook.   the paranoia seems to be getting a bit worse as she's just convinced every day that someone is going to show up in a white coat and take her to an awful nursing home, so much so that she calls everyone she can remember to ask if that's going to happen. she also accuses this friend of stealing her money, but now that i have access to her accounts- i can see that it's not happening. physically she is fine, she can move fairly well and with her medications, her vitals are good. however i'm concerned for her well being mentally. just last night, she woke up at midnight and went to go check the mail (which she normally does when she wakes up at like 5-6am after she eats). for reference, the mailbox is a block or so away from her house. she didn't have a grasp on the time she woke up or even why she felt the need to walk in the dark like that. she also said she saw lights coming from the mountain.   i live 5 hours away or so and the rest of her family is even further. it seems to me that she would probably do best going into some type of living situation but i don't really know where to start. for one, she lives in a manufactured home, which she owns but not the land so she won't get much for that. she lives on roughly $2,000 a month she gets for social security but seems to have just enough in her bank account to where she doesn't qualify for medicaid. i've reached out to a few programs in her area but they seem to be ""profit"" driven for these private assisted living homes, she also kind of lives in a rural area of washington state. i know some of you went through similar stuff, thoughts? feedback? ideas? what worked for you? is she just kinda screwed and we should wait until she gets really hurt and has to go into a nursing home?",,0
"my dad (72) was recently diagnosed with mild-moderate vascular dementia. my kids and i were able to travel from our home (5 states away) to where he lives and i grew up this summer. we stayed for 6 weeks and helped get his business sold, clean up his finances, clean house/yard for him, and establish poa. my two younger sisters live there and we are all collaborating care. he’s always had a narcissistic personality and is the king of gaslighting, so adding dementia to an already challenging person sucks. he blames my sisters and i for “trapping him in a cage” by not “letting him drive” (it’s state law that he doesn’t drive for 6 months after an episode of altered cognition like he had). he’s rightfully worried about money bc he lost everything to scammers (behind everyone’s back, of course) and wants to get a job, but can hardly take care of himself as it is. he told me today when i encouraged him to sell one of his three cars that i just “want to sell everything out from under him“ and that i am “no child of his”. i know he’s not himself, not like he used to be, but he always has had this part of him in there. it’s all the terrible, fucked up parts of him that are running rampant and i don’t know what else to say except it sucks. it sucks. im not looking for advice. just posting to vent. my heart goes out to every family who has/had to slowly lose a loved one to dementia. it’s the worst. love, strength, and compassion to all of you.",,0

"my mom is 49 and was recently diagnosed with early-onset with indicators of alzheimers. family noticed strange things happening the past several years but now it's official. it's degenerated rather quickly to the point where she's had to move in with me and i had to take over her finances, get rid of her car, get disability, etc etc.  her short-term memory ranges from 5 seconds to a day at this point.  needless to say it's been a lot to handle. but i have a good family support system so we're working through it together.anyway; when i was a kid my mom smoked. she would quit on and off for a few months here and there, but then when she had her final child 7 years ago she quit for good.  then, a few years ago when she started having noticeable problems, my mom started smoking again. i attributed it to the divorce, custody battles, etc.now that she lives with me i'm trying to get her to quit again but it is very difficult. she asks me for cigs every 5 minutes and if i let her have the pack it will disappear within several hours due to chain-smoking.we are currently hiding the cigs and then making up excuses why she can't have them but then she gets extremely irritable and goes on rants about us treating her like a child (which she pretty much is at this point) and starts directing her anger towards things like re-arranging furniture or cleaning stuff. the cleaning stuff aspect is not so bad except when she uses the wrong cleaning supplies and i have to hide the dog from the area she cleaned and re-clean her 'cleaning'.anyway i guess i'm ranting here. but my main question for the group would have to be:   has anyone else experienced a person with dementia chain-smoking? and if so, have they tried getting them to quit? suggestions on making that happen? i actually smoke, too, and am also trying to quit. i was quit before mother moved in. but having the constant smell of smoke, combined with the stressful situation, i started again too. i'm trying to get us to quit together but the idea is always shot down with, ""i don't want to"" or just being straight up ignored. i only smoke a few a day but it's still the worst habit you can have.  i was quit for several months but this led me back to buying packs recently and i **really** want us to quit together. for her, for myself. for everyone.need advice, please...",,0
"i'm about to write to the va, but need advice, especially from people familiar with the va. main question: for ftd patients mobile and mostly physically healthy, how can you get more home aide care hours of watching them, if your local va clinic says your at the max? (obviously cheaper for va to pay for than alf's!)* i'm thinking of trying to do that and get 4 full days a week of home aide help (is now 8 hours), and maybe adding locks to the doors so my dad can't sneak out when we're in the bathroom. my mom is so stressed from caregiving that she said to research alf's, but i think this plan would relieve us enough to keep him home. my intuition tells me the alf would be bad, and trying adult day cares was awful, they upset him and he refused to do anything but try to escape and run home.* background: my sweet dad is 100% disabled veteran, 62, supposedly all his health care should be taken care of for free now. the va reasoning my mom cited is that he can do most ""normal activities of living"", he just needs to be supervised because he likes to go out of the house walking, 3x a day and obsessively say prayers at different neighbors lawn statues, crossing a main road often too. i try to always jump up when he heads to the door and walk with him so i know he's safe. (no issues getting lost, always goes the same route, knows how to get everywhere/home, careful around cars) he has to be cooked for, and cannot say many sentences anymore, or express himself well.* so he has to basically be monitored all day. my mom's taken great care of him the last 3 years, but the stress of this is destroying us health wise, we both developed high cortisol, auto-immune diseases, failing thyroids, anxiety disorders, went from healthy weights to obesity (despite working out and eating very healthy!). and he treats her like a piece of furniture mostly while hugging me every day, so extra heartbreak for her.the other day she developed a scary sounding cough, and i decided she can't do this anymore (even with me giving her time off 3 days/wk) i cannot lose her too and be alone in the world with no family (kind of selfish, yea).* [fyi: if everyone thinks ""va just won't give you more hours, only a nursing home"", i will simply visit my senator to change it. i am an activist thanks to my dad's influence and will not accept va status quo anymore]any advice welcomed!!",,0

"about 6 or 7 years ago, i discovered what dementia is when my aunt started asking repetitive questions about her where her daughter and granddaughter was.  later on i discovered that i have several uncles who had dementia and my grandfather had it.  so it runs in the family and i expected my father to be next in line to have it.  my father showed signs of dementia and later was diagnosed with it.  my father didn't believe he had dementia, which made his care extremely hard.out of all my father's 10+ children only a half brother and myself tried to help him (not even a daughter who's a nurse practioner).  along with his mother, my stepmother.  throughout this ordeal, many mistakes was made, in my father's care and regulating his affairs. however, a lot of bad decisions were made before my father showed evidence of dementia. he bought a house that he couldn't afford.  paying almost $10k in property taxes. retired before the house was paid off.  rarely did any renovations on the house.  pretty soon after he retired and was diagnosed with dementia, that's many things in the house started falling apart.  we did some repairs and the house is still not finished with repairs. getting the ct scan and the memory tests was the easy part.  many mistakes were made was when my stepmother chose to get power of attorney, instead of my brother and i.  my stepmother had poa, but refused to do anything, and relied on me to the footwork.  however, handling my father's affairs required a poa or legal guardian, so i needed my stepmother's authorization, and if she wasn't around its slowed everything down.  my father refused to take his meds, because he couldn't remember to and didn't believe he had anything. his primary care doctor referred us to a psychiatric nurse because of his resistance to taking his meds.  the psychiatric nurse wanted to place him in special care so he could get his blood pressure down and be given the right meds.my half brother believed it was to place our dad in a nursing home.  so my half brother switched his primary care physician to another general practioner physician who lived in another county. because of the distance we rarely went for check ups.  then when covid-19 hit, we didn't go at all. this physician never referred us to a specialist like a geriatric doctor or neurologist to work on the dementia.  all they prescribed him was things to make him sleep which had no affect on him after awhile. out of my stepmother and half brother, i have the most pacifist personality. so i just go along. any suggestions that i had were usually disregarded. or explained why it wasn't plausible. now i'm sorry that i didn't speak up earlier on.  now i'm sorry that i didn't speak up.  now i'm sorry i didn't fight for my beliefs.  i often advocated for medicaid years ago so we could get a home aide and other things. my stepmother was against it.  she said he made too much.  even though, some of my aunts &amp; uncles were able to receive medicaid who made more then my father.  everyone knows there are ways getting around it.  she believed that she care for him till we could sell the house and pay for an aide out of pocket.  my stepmother is partially deaf, bad eye sight, circulation problems, obese, pre-diabetic, waddles like penguin and in her 70's, no condition to handle a man with dementia who's extremely resistant and still strong.  she waited till her job's union gave her a deal were my dad would be covered in her insurance. it wasn't till this year, she couldn't take it and wanted a home aide.  she had a representative from their health insurance come over and said they would be help, we got no help.  we had to get the general practioner to prescribed all these things for a hospital bed and things for toilets.  my half brother is very smart, definitely smarter then i am.  however, despite his intelligence. he likes to wait let other people handle shit and then come out and say they made a mistake and that he would have never done that.  i'm like ""if you know better then us, then take the lead on this issue."" but then makes it sound like he is doing all the work and everyone else is incompetent.   my stepmother and half brother aren't the only fuck ups.  i been so focused on fixing up the house and getting ready for sale.  never thought to see another doctor besides a general practioner.  i been getting advice from an uninformed cousin on what he does to help, rather then speaking to his older brother who had more information. such seeing a specialist, medicaid, home aide, day programs.  his mother (my father's younger sister) got dementia before my dad and is doing a lot better.it wasn't until the last few days ago, i been able to get a appointment with a neurologist.  i been able to contact a medical supply to get a medical bed and other things.  however, today during a face time with my father's general physician.  he says in my father's current state (bed bound, several bed sores, emaciated, not really eating, not talking), its seem like it's only a matter of days, weeks, or months.  that we will be lucky to get a few more years.  since my father has had dementia, there have been a few scares that his days were numbered but he bounced back.  tomorrow, we face time neurologist.  hoping for better news, but i don't want to get my hopes up. it's like my aunts and uncles got to live 10 to 12 years with the disease and then passed with the best care possible.  like i said before, one of my father's sisters had it several years before he did.  she is still walking and talking, lost a lot of weight, but not emaciated.  i'm saddened because looking back there was so many missed opportunities.  i want to blame my stepmother and half brother because of their egos and ignorance.  i want to blame myself.  i have made a lot of fuck ups in my life, but not getting a loved one the best essential care, is on another level.  but as everyone says, it's no use blaming anyone, what's done is done.i knew when he got dementia, that this is the inevitable end. but that there are ways to extend and make life comfortable while they are still with us.  i really wish that there were instruction manuals for caregivers of loved ones with dementia.  for anyone who has recently has a loved one with dementia this is my advice.1.  put your loved ones care first. 2. get your ego out of the way.  any family member who's doesn't want to pull their weight. any family member who's arrogance level exceeds their intelligence levels. check them, it's not about them, it's about your loved ones3. get a power of attorney &amp; healthcare proxy for someone or some people who are capable and wiling to do the work. only get a legal guardianship when the dementia patient is really out of it.  or they aren't being cared for properly.4. make sure they consistently see a doctor who lives a reasonable distance.5. make sure they also see a specialist for the disease of dementia itself (neurologist, gerontologist, geriatric psychiatrists). 6. don't wait to get a home health aide when they're are urinating and defecating on themselves.  get one pretty early on.  7. speak to an expert about getting their affairs in order such insurance coverage, debts, housing, social security, pension, 401k, and everything else is taken care of. so you just can focus on the care of your loved one.  8. don't let them live in silence and solitude.  give them stimulation.  have a tv so they can watch.  have family and friends over.  put them in a day program.  a dementia patient in a room alone staring at the walls will hasten their demise.to anyone reading this, who just had someone diagnosed with dementia.  i sincerely hope and pray that you do a better job then my stepmother, half brother, and i did. eta: my father passed a couple hours after i wrote this, early in the morning, a couple hours past midnight.  i was the one to discover him.",,0
"my (22m) family is in desperate need of some help. my dad's (69m) dementia has gotten much worse over the past few months. it pains me to say this but my sister (40f), mother (67) and i are no longer able to look after him on our own. every day there's a bigger upset than the last. my sister and i have been trying to convince my mother to look into available support for my dad (in-home care or even looking into a home) but the same sticking point keeps coming up (finances). we live in ontario, what resources can i look into to show my mom?",,0
"my mother, diagnosed with early onset, randomly decided to cancel her $500k life insurance policy that she's been paying for the last 15+ years. my brother and i found out the next week, and we called the life insurance company, but they would not re-instate the policy. my mother claims that my brother told her to do so... which obviously wouldn't be true.any thoughts on this?",,0
"posting on a throwaway for anonimity.my mil (mid 60s) appears to be showing signs of alzheimers/dementia. my grandmother had alzheimer's so i'm somewhat familiar with the signs and progression of the disease. her onset is eerily similar to my grandmother's, although almost 2 decades earlier. her symptoms are aggression or aggitation to others (especially those closest to her), stubborness, poor judgment especially when it comes to finances, incoherence, accusing others of theft, and frequently misplacing things. some incidents that stuck out was that she went to an atm to withdraw money but left the cash (several hundred dollars worth) in the mouth of the machine. she has forgotten where she had parked in the mall several times and called a cab to take her home, while leaving the car for my bil to locate and drive back. she has had always been bad at money but lately it's gotten so bad that she has to constantly ask us to lend (aka give, because she doesn't pay back) her money. she is on a pension but the amount she is receiving is sufficient to cover rent, bills, and food, with maybe a couple hundred to spare each month. however, it appears that she has been spending to the last cent on useless junk. we opened her trunk one day and found that it was filled to the brim with random items from the dollar store, including 3 hats and 5 pairs of sandals that were basically identical to each other. the most striking thing was that when my husband took her to the bank, she had basically only a few dollars in her account, and she accused the bank of ""stealing"" her money, even though she was the one who had withdrawn money herself. this is very similar to how my grandmother was leading to her diagnosis where she would accuse her care aide from stealing from her without any evidence and fall for obvious scams from telemarketers.my husband is aware of what is going on but seems to be downplaying it a bit or not understanding the urgency. he seems to think it may be related to her depression (which i think is morely another symptom, and not the cause of this behaviour). i think part of it is denial since obviously taking care of someone like this is a lot of stress. her sisters are in complete denial and think that she has always been ""ditzy"". i mentioned that he should take her to the doctor to get her diagnosed but he keeps saying that she is too stubborn and that the doctor said there is nothing wrong with her. am i wrong in being frustrated in him? my father was recently diagnosed with parkinson's and it took a while for us to convince my mom to get him to see the doctor so i understand the stubborness and denial but i think he should be doing more to push for it.",,0
"wills and trusts, poa, advanced directives - of course. long term care insurance - likely.   as i'm technical i've always imagined i'd somehow find a technical way to assist my wife if i started needing care beyond her abilities. for wandering off - it seems like you could put a tag on my clothes that talks to an iphone app so that i don't make it too far. for the assisted living years it seems like that plus a system to verify medications intake could do. she'd have to take over bill paying and investing.  memory care unit emulation gets much tougher - someone helping you get dressed, toileted, cleaned, shaved, clipped, fed, perhaps lifted to wheel chair. noticing when you're sick, advocating for you when you can't express yourself, getting you to the hospital, the dentist, the neurologist. don't see a silicon valley path for these.  any other thoughts are appreciated.",,0
"hey reddit,i got the call i’ve been dreading.  a friend in my hometown called and explained that several people at my mother’s workplace are worried about her, followed by a couple specific examples of confusion and forgetfulness.  i’ve had my suspicions as well, but told myself i would wait for a specific event before acting.  and now, i think the time has finally come for the torch to be passed on to me.alzheimer’s is no stranger to my family.  both of my grandparents had the disease (her parents), and several of her brothers and sisters have it currently or have passed from it.  for fifteen years she sacrificed, along with the rest of the family, to care for her parents.  they were both kept at home from diagnosis to death.  i grew up in the middle of all of this and know well how this disease progresses.  so, i guess i want to get thoughts, opinions and ideas from the hive mind on my next steps.first, i need to talk with her.  she has made a couple of comments about “not being like she once was” and is taking a supplement that is supposed to improve brain clarity.  i think she is aware that there has been some cognitive decline, and with her extensive history in taking care of her parents/siblings, i believe she will be open to this conversation.  i have a call into a local memory care clinic for information, but i’m not sure if we need a referral from her primary care provider before i can make an appointment.  second, she is still working.  she is 67, so i think the time has come to have a conversation about retirement.  she is still high functioning, though i’ve noticed a decline in understanding layered ideas and processes with progressive steps.  for example, teaching her how to use a new oven and microwave a month ago was difficult for her.  (as i write this, more and more example are cropping up that i have apparently compartmentalized, which is making me feeling even guiltier.)  her co-workers have noticed things like her being confused and forgetful.  this has apparently gotten worse in the last few weeks.third, driving.  her siblings live in a town 30 miles over and she travels there two to three times a week.  that is originally her hometown.  she has no family in the town she currently lives in, but it’s a small town and people help take care of their own there, to an extent.  when is time to call it quits on driving?  fourth, finances.  she has very little money, maybe a net worth of a 100k.  and the money she has, she ends up giving a significant portion away to charity.  she literally gets 10-15 pieces of mail a day from charities asking for money.  she is donating $300+ dollars a month to any number of charities (i made the mistake of looking at her monthly bank statement that was sitting out one night).  i brought up her giving, indirectly, and she told me she is only giving $20-30 a month.  though she did agree to be more mindful of her giving and acknowledged that there were a lot of scams out there.  this was probably four months ago, and i dropped it because it is her money and i don’t want to feel like i’m overstepping/micromanaging.  i haven’t looked at a statement since so i don’t know if it has continued or not.  do i talk to her about becoming her durable power of attorney and restricting these financial behaviors?  do i just let it ride?  i feel like either way, i am going to lose.  i suppose that’s the over-arching theme in alzheimer’s, isn’t it?  doesn’t matter what you do.  you lose.fifth, living arrangement.  i have a decent job, and i can support her through most things.  but i don’t make enough to pay a $3500 - $6000 / month for assisted living.  i’m not sure what her social security check will end up being.  her home is paid off, so we are only on the hook for food, taxes, utilities and maintenance.  i can easily subsidize those.  she could come live with my fiancé and me, but that takes her away from everything she has ever known, plus i worry about the strain of her living with us on our relationship.  i am thinking, at least for the time being, about hiring someone to swing by a few times a week and check in on her, buy her groceries, etc.  she is still capable.  any thoughts or ideas on this?my mother has never been married and i [32m] am the only child and live 2 hours away.  i don’t know if i am in denial on her actual condition or if i’m overreacting.  i don’t know a lot of things.  i was prepared for some feelings in this, but i was not prepared for the amount of selfishness, anger, and guilt that i am now experiencing.  selfishness in my personal life.  selfishness in my career.  i know the toll that this has on families.  i’ve lived it.  taking care of my grandparents consumed her life for fifteen years, and now, ten years later, she is subject to the same path.   i am angry.  i am angry that a good woman, a strong woman, is slowly being erased by this damned disease.  i feel guilty about not being there for her more in the past.  i feel helpless and guilty in knowing how the story ends, but only being the starting line.  i am heartbroken for her to have to suffer through this.  she has already offered up so much to the alzheimer’s gods, and now they are demanding her life.  she doesn’t deserve this.  she has paid her dues.  done her time.  without question.  without regret.i’m sorry if this post is a mess.  i needed to write this.  i know all of you caretakers and family members out there have sacrificed so much yourselves and i am not in a unique situation.  i think i just need to know you are out there, and what you did at the start of your journey.  my fiancé and family are great, and very supportive.  i know i am not alone in this, but i feel all the responsibility acutely.  i very much appreciate any feedback you can provide.  i have already talked with, and received information from, alz.org and plan on talking with mom friday.  from there, scheduling a visit with a physician, getting rx meds, etc.  after that, who knows?  here we go!edit:  you guys are awesome.  thank you so much for the advice and support.",,0
"i'd like to get tested for the genes that have associations with alzheimers (because my mom has it and it is getting pretty bad).i've googled a few options, most seem to be in the $100-$150 range.my insurance probably won't cover this, so i'd like to get the best value for testing. any suggestions?i guess i was wondering, is there just a comprehensive test that alerts a person to multiple gene associations (diabetes, etc) and would it be more cost effective to take a comprehensive test, over one that is focused on just the genes associated to alzheimers?backstory on my mom. she started exhibiting signs at 70, which might not seem abnormal, except all of our other relatives, including her mom, were very lucid well into their 90s. she is the outlier in the group, and i suspect some link to her biological father, who she never met, because her mother divorced him before she was born. the story is that her mom divorced him after having to bail him out of jail multiple times for public intoxication.",,0

"my father is 71 and has i'd say moderate alzheimer's.. he's had delusions about me not being me (that i work at our house and took his daughter's name and insisted i was lying about something to him), he sundowns, wanders, repeats himself, and has developed the very frustrating habit of not only following me or my mother around the house like a shadow.. but standing right up against us.he's always been short tempered, but now all he does is complain, insult us, get frustrated at us ""telling him what to do"" (our ac is malfunctioning and he has to be told to stop opening the front door because it lets the cold air out- while he insists he's not.. as he does it.).. constantly is telling us he wants to go ""home"" which is a place he's never even lived so i can't fathom what false memory makes him call it home. he even throws temper tantrums, i'd say he's emotionally a child again by now.but it came to a head today, my tiny chihuahua was trying to bark at and investigate my grandpa, who was trying to fix the ac.. and he smacked her. he smacked her right upside the head, hard, after she wasn't even barking. needless to say he got scolded and tried to say he didn't even do it hard, when he was being told he wasn't supposed to do it all.me and my mother are jobless, and are struggling to find any with the pandemic. his retirement and such pays the bills, but his insurance does not cover a home.. we are at our wits end, but if we tried to put him in a care facility we'd end up homeless.i hate to say it but.. (and i'm sure some can relate) he's never been an amazing father, he's short tempered, always called me names, and as now is weighing me down. i'm going to be 23, i haven't even begun to live my adult life because of him. i cannot move in with the man i plan to marry because of him. i cannot go out to dinner with my partner or to simply enjoy myself because he can't be left alone and we have no other choice but to have one of us here 24/7.my mother (who is actually my sister in law.. and another problem in my life entirely) thinks i'm selfish for not wanting to give up my youth to be a caregiver for someone i resent. i don't want him to starve or be hurt, but i can't care for him. but i'm forced to until my mother gets off her ass and gets a job after ""looking"" for over a year.he's bored, and lonely, because it's just us two with him. and we have lives, he has no hobbies and what he did have he has completely stopped doing. we tried to take him out before lock down but he just wants to go home as soon as we got anywhere. he complains about being home, about not being home, about us ignoring him, complains when we do talk to him because we won't discuss anything about him wanting to die.he's never happy.. and he's making us miserable.i don't know how to put up with being locked in a house with him any longer, i'm so tempted to pack my things and abandon them both.. but i'd feel to guilty to actually do it.",,0

"nana is in her early 70s and was semi-recently diagnosed with lbd after some severe issues with hallucinations. she saw tarantulas, turtles, small floating puff ball-like animals, and even me when i wasn't there. in addition, she has memory issues and panic problems.    before, she was a very strong woman. she was an accountant for a very large company in our city. she worked there for 35 years, only leaving after her memory started failing her and caused several mishaps with her job. she raised 3 children on her own, worked endlessly to support their every need, and continued doing so for her two grandchildren (my cousin and me.).   after she left work, it seemed like everything with her disease decided to move at light speed. the hallucinations are more frequent, her panic/anxiety has exploded, and she's just losing herself.   i started working for the same company she did a few years back, in a different department. on top of all the times i had to leave my desk to go to her department to help with whatever issue, now that she's retired she still just keeps showing up randomly. once or twice a week i get a phone call saying nana is there, yelling at the poor soul who took over her office, and freaking out. so, i'll have to go get her, calm her down, explain that she's retired and the guy in her old office actually works there now, and take her home. usually bringing coffee and treats back to the accounting department as an apology.   this morning she called mid-panic attack because she thought the microwave was going to burn her house down. she refused to unplug it because she thought it would severely shock her and she would die. she insisted that i come over right that very second and unplug it for her. i told her i couldn't, i was due in a meeting in 15 minutes. she flipped and started fussing, crying, and yelling. i apologized so many times, and told her i'd call her after my meeting and i could come by at lunch.   i just called her and she has no recollection of that previous call. however now she has completely fabricated an event that happened yesterday where she believes i came to her house and cried because my husband was leaving me. she says i cried and yelled for hours. once she finished telling me that she was concerned about my ""mental break down yesterday"" i explained to her that none of that happened. i'm not even married!! i worked all day yesterday, i spoke to nana on the phone twice, and then did yard work til sundown. telling her that just made things worse. she is so convinced that what she thinks happened, actually happened.   none of this is unusual. this is a weekly thing for us. and i'm the only one who deals with it. my mother has passed, my cousin is utterly useless, his mother is chronically ill and already is in an assisted living place, and our uncle is 400lbs living on family money. so it all fell on me. i've tried talking with her doctor about moving her to a facility (locally) that can handle her. but he says she's fine living on her own right now, and to maybe just limit her driving. i list all the things that continuously happen, and gave him a run down of the three accidents she's been in while driving in the last couple months. two were at her own house (crashed into the garage, and drove off the short retaining wall in her front yard) and the third was a literal hit and run. she ran a red light, got side swiped by someone turning who had the right-of-way, pulled over to swap insurance, but then decided to just drive away before she got out of her car. i've explained how i'm not a care giver, i can't do everything for her. i'm doing groceries, house work, doctor visits, and everything else she needs and i'm so tired. her doctor said he understood, but that's what families do - they take care of each other.    i just don't know what to do anymore. i feel so upset at myself when i get frustrated with her. i know it's not her fault. she doesn't do these things or say them to hurt me. but i can't help it. when i'm arguing with her on why she can't skip her meds, or why she has to wear a mask when we go out, or even when i tell her she can't keep coming to work because she's retired, i just lose sight of the fact that this is a disease and there is no point arguing with her over it.   i feel like i'm just ranting and i don't have a purpose for this post. but i'm hoping someone here understands and maybe knows a way to combat this fatigue i'm feeling. i honestly dread every single phone call from her. i almost feel sick when i have to go get her out of accounting because she acting out. i can feel myself spacing out when she starts rambling about things that have never happened, and occasionally throwing in a ""oh wow"" or ""mhmm"" to somewhat participate. then i end up feeling terrible, because as i said earlier - it's not her fault. goodness me. any advice would be greatly appreciated",,0
"my(43f) mom(82f) was recently diagnosed with gray matter disease. is this the same thing as dementia?? where do i go from here? this was the one thing she never wanted to get. i’m so sad for her. and i promised her i would never put her in a home. i would like her to stay in home with me but i can’t do this alone.i’m a s/mom to 6, i need help. my brother thinks she gets just barely over what is needed to apply for medicare from my fathers(passed 5 yrs ago) minimal retirement so she would not qualify and her regular kaiser insurance doesn’t cover home care. but her needs and medications eat up most of that money. how can anyone afford in home care help in these situations? i’m in ca.i’m trying to give everyone the love they deserve but i feel like i’m drowning and it’s making me feel scared and very overwhelmed. there is so much to learn. i’m hiding in my bathroom in tears rn.i don’t know where to start. any help or advice would be greatly appreciated! thank you!",,0
"my mother has been having some memory issues off and on for a couple years, but it's been worse over the last year. within the last six months, it's started significantly impacting her life. we got the news today (after mris, blood tests, cognitive testing, etc.) that it is indeed dementia and that her symptoms are considered ""moderate"" at this point. since she's been having symptoms for some time, this diagnosis is obviously not a complete shock. but of course we are still reeling.any thoughts on what we (my father and i) need to be thinking about/planning for? my parents are both retired and are financially secure. they already work with a cpa/financial planner and have pretty good health insurance. so i'm not so much worried about the financial side of things as i am about not knowing what to expect from the future and what kind of decisions we will need to make in the next couple of years.any advice or shared experiences would be much appreciated!",,0
"have an aunty who has alzheimers.  she did not get a poa when she was able and now she lacks capacity. we muddled through inadequately when she was in her home with a significant amount of difficulty because she has been a very independent person who wouldn't take help - frankly, we used a fair amount of trickery to wangle it so we could do things like get a lawnmower in and be allowed to vacuum at least once and bring her frozen meals and get her dog to the vet and get her to see a doctor etc.  we weren't good enough at it - she wasn't eating at a level to maintain her weight, she wasn't managing her finances, her house was a bombsite, she'd start fights with her neighbours etc.  it came to a head when she had a medical event.  the hospital decided to apply to the family court for a personal care order so they could send her to a dementia care unit and advised us to get a lawyer to apply once that was through for personal and property management order to ""take over"" from the hospital.  while she was in the hospital she'd had an mmse and an mri, the mmse showing a score of 11 and the mri showing significant atrophy.  she'd also had the same a year previously which had the same results.so we followed the hospital's recommendation.  the lawyer quoted us on what it would cost if it went through in the expected amount of time without a fuss.  it is now three times longer than the expected time and the court-appointed counsel has finally got around to going and seeing her and is ready to make a report and recommendations.the court-appointed counsel phoned me today and advised that she is going to make a report that she has concerns about the order - she felt that aunty didn't present as unable to manage and could probably go home for another year or two and she'd probably recommend that aunty get her own lawyer.  she seemed quite bothered by the fact that aunty is the same age as her.so the court proceeding appears that it is now in the category of complicated rather than simple, which means that the cost has become beyond our budget.  so we're considering simply withdrawing our application.  quite apart from the financial obstacle we don't want to be in some sort of family court battle where we're pitched against our aunty.  anyone got any thoughts/advice/words of wisdom?",,0
"i'm in pennsylvania and my mom's dementia has progressed quickly to the point where she shouldn't be alone all day. right now i'm in nursing school full time and working full time. i know being alone so much has contributed to her dementia (we're waiting to see the neurologist again for alzheimer's diagnosis). a social worker will be contacting us in the next month or so and as of yesterday the doctor is taking her driver's license. i only have 5 months left in school so i can't quit and have considered dropping to part time at work though we will not be able to afford anything 'extra' such as car repairs and gas, activities for her, food other than ramen, or cable. (which i know isn't a need but tv is all she has and i do need gas to make it to school).  our house is in disrepair and i had hoped to move this fall when i get a nursing job. i can't find good resources for being paid as a caregiver in the mean time and i know she doesn't want a stranger. especially since we live together and my full time income plus her social security puts us just over the poverty line to where we are not eligible for any state benefits. i know a lot of these are questions to ask a social worker but i thought someone may have experience and also if i do have to drop down to part time at work i want to use up my insurance benefits before i'm left with none. i'd like to make doctors appointments for myself while i still have coverage. does anyone have any resources they could share?",,0
"hi everyone :) just discovered this sub today and it's great!so abit of background - my grandmother is early 70s has been suffering for around 8 years now. she's deteriorated alot in the last 2/3 years and atm, she can't walk/move, doesn't talk, makes mostly noises and pretty much just sits there all day. wish i knew of this sub a while ago as we've had some interesting times over the years!so on to the point of this post - my grandmother is cared for at home. she's getting quite heavy and it is difficult to lift her.are there any suggestions for any equipment anyone's tried out or recommends? mostly with regards to transfers and lifting. finances are not an issue and we live in the uk if that's of any use. thank you!!",,0
"mom (87y.o.) is about at the point where she can't take care of her finances. twice in the past six months she's sent a blank signed check to pay her utility bill.  she just got an atm card (at my suggestion) but she cannot see well enough to use the machine (discovered yesterday) and she's declined to share the pin with me. she can't really negotiate correctly with the gardener about lawn care; she doesn't know if she paid him $14 or $24 to mow the lawn (but she normally paid the same neighbor $30 and then $35) and now i have to go investigate/apologize.  she sometimes can't really grasp orders of magnitude, e.g. whether something is going to cost a hundred or a thousand dollars. she also wants to send money preemptively to the hospital for medicare-covered services that i'm pretty sure were covered at 100% and for which she hasn't seen a bill in the six months since the medicare statements came in the mail. she does not as yet have any formal diagnosis of dementia.one of the other brothers is on her checking account but he's not in town and that was for serious emergencies. i live with her but do not have poa or other access to her finances. i've heard that judges will let a person spend all of their money on scams and still not rule them incompetent, but if on a lucid day i convince her of the wisdom of giving me financial access or control and another family member were to challenge that, could such access/poa be ruled invalid in light of the above behavior?could it go even further and develop into an allegation of fraud/elder abuse?

"wow i had a tough day and i’m posting the rant i sent to the social worker at the prestigious institute treating my husband for dlb. am i wrong?i had an issue today at bxxxxx. the first time my husband saw the speech therapist, i wasn’t there. apparently he said that we were fighting a lot. at his next appointment, she blindsided me by repeating what he said and stating she had discussed it with the pt and i needed to agree with him and redirect and what notthis week, i asked 3 times to speak to her at the end of his appointment. she left no time for it so i told her i felt ambushed and was i expected to be mother theresa who by the way, reportedly ran a child prostitution ring. i asked her if she had ever been a dementia patient caregiver and she said no. i told her i thought that if she perceived a problem that it should have been referred to the social worker. i asked her if she thought my husband would be better in a care home.  she chose to let this all unfold in front of my husband. later, my husband had an appointment with the ot. he said i must never appear upset or frustrated in front of my husband, that i must leave the room. well i’ve had several safety incidents with my husband. i’m not sure that’s advisable. i feel that again, the staff discussed this between themselves. he told my husband he may no longer use ladders or step stools or lift heavy objects. well my husband didn’t listen to him either. i had an incident on the way home where i asked my husband not to lift something and he did anyway, defiantly. between these two weeks, i did hire a respite care lady and husband and i had a very good week. i basically treated him like a 5 year old and didn’t argue or correct him. he said some really mean things to me like when i was working so hard around the house he said let me add another item to your list, i would like to f*ck my wife. i said well that’s not the way to get lucky. my health is suffering to the point i’ve developed heart issues due to severe dehydration followed by electrolyte imbalance. i have no medical insurance and i have hyperparathyroidism among other issues and i’m in a walking boot after my husband dropped something heavy on my ankle. i have severe osteoporosis. when i started crying tonight because the promised medical insurance didn’t go through, i dutifully left the room. i went to the garage. however i also can’t regulate body temperature and now my temp is 100.6.i am an intense person. after two years of neglect by his family, i worked hard to assemble an excellent care team at bxxxxx. i think the pt, ot, and speech therapists are great. i’m actually a person. i’m a chemical engineer who speaks 6 languages and has lived and worked in over 40 countries including iraq and venezuela. do i not count at all? am i to work myself to death, totally neglecting my own health issues to devote all of my time to my husband? i haven’t had labs drawn to fix my heart issue because i can’t leave him alone and i can’t get an appt at a lab. i will go saturday when the caregiver comes. as well, i have an immune deficiency called sad and igg2/igg3 subclass deficiencies and i am pretty sure i have bronchitis but haven’t had time to get the chest x ray the doctor ordered. does the caregiver support at bxxxxx only exist within your group? are the other staff to consider us as slaves to our loved ones?sorry for the rambling. i’m so so exhausted.",,0
"my grandmother is not diagnosed with dementia, but i've spoken to people with familiarity with alzheimer's and dementia and they believe she sounds like she has vascular dementia due to strokes. some of the things we've been dealing with with her is her lack of patience (if she needs help with something, she needs it now or she freaks out), her use of extreme language to get sympathy or attention or help, and her negative perceptions of everything. she is in an assisted living facility i believe is working for her, but she is not happy there. she was not happy when she was at her home either, and she had a lot of physical needs and she was at high risk of falling. now she is fixated on returning home and getting in home care although her insurance does not cover it. i don't think she would be happy anywhere sadly. i'm wondering how to address her behaviors in the moment such as what i listed above. it works to do redirection, calling her out if she is bitching about a family member who is helping her a lot by saying please don't talk badly about that person, or just listening and reflecting back what she's saying. but sometimes it's really hard to know what to do. she gets so impatient and scared sometimes whether i'm there in person or talking to her on the phone. is there any way to reassure her or make up things that might reassure her? or is that rewarding her for negative attention and is there other ways to handle it?",,0
"\*\* sorry for the long post\*\* so i'm in fl (i don't live here - just come for long weekends every month). i was planning on staying a week to help dad (87)with mom(89). he warned me that i might not want to come because she was angry at him, me, and my poor husband who has been in her presence 3 times and she really likes him. *note - i help them with all their finances and stuff - they've always trusted me and looked to me when they need anything. my mother's huge trigger is money.* our first two days were...quite good. she doesn't remember her words, but we hung out, played cards, and there weren't any problems. then day three happened. she walked into the bedroom i'm staying in and pointed her finger and said ""i need to talk to you"". note - mom has always been a wonderful person and a great mom. we have always had a great relationship. she proceeded to lambaste my father and i for ""stealing her moneys"", calling me a liar in a tone that brought chills to my spine. it doesn't even sound like her. it went on for about an hour until i finally walked away. dad and i both made the mistake of trying to discuss her concerns logically. she told me that she always thought i was a liar and that playing cards with me and being nice was hard because of all ""this"" that she had to try and hide. at some point she takes off and we have no idea where she is for three hours. she absconded with a bag packed with a jacket, a book, her phone, and $3000. she's got bad knees and walking is not something she does a lot of except for now, apparently. wth?day four she stomped around, refused to eat or drink saying she wanted to die. took off twice. day five - she passes out and pitches backwards, landing on the tile floor with the back of her head hitting first.  is out cold for a few minutes then argues that she will refuse to go in an ambulance. yeah no. trip to the er and a night in the hospital. my father said that he felt terrible but it was a relief to not have her at the house for a day. :( day six - we bring her home late afternoon, she eats, showers, and goes to bed. day seven - all he&amp;&amp; breaks loose. calling me a bitch, screaming at my father and crying that the lord was watching him and that he needed to tell her he did it, insisting that her wallet had been plundered because the money in there and the money in her secret stash was gone. she didn't use those words. money is ""cell phones"" or boxes. this went on for two hours.  then starts in that her purse is missing - she finds it after we search the house in a dresser drawer with her sweaters - not where she keeps it so ""it must have been one of you"". then her slippers are missing...but they're right next to her side of the bed right out in the open neatly placed. someone put them there - not her. none of her words were correct so this was even more difficult because we had no idea what she was talking about and had to keep doing something akin to 20 questions to make any sense of it. dad at this point has had it. we contact two mc facilities - one is coming over in the morning to do an evaluation. she also gets mad at some good friends who call to check because she showed up twice on their ring camera when they weren’t home. they were “not giving her privacy”. she takes off twice this day - once just before it got dark. my father was beside himself.  the viciousness of her manner is horrible - and not my mom.  day eight - today - we take dad to the dr and in the car she's trying so hard to get herself wound up but it doesn't happen. the rest of the day - she's fine. not normal, but very nice to my dad. so....dad wants to cancel the eval. says everything seems to be ok and i can leave if i want (but he's way ok with me staying) after i've taken another 2 weeks off of work. his health is getting bashed by all this and i'm worried that the dementia is going to kill him first. and during all this - all i wanted was to ask my mother today if she still loves me. i feel like i want to just fall apart with the sadness of all of this. i want my mom back. is this how it goes? when do you know it’s definitely the right time to do something other than deal with this alone? i can’t leave my dad here by himself if she swings back to “bad mom”.  are there options for us other than mc? she refuses to have anyone come in the house. \*\* also note – all her words are wrong – this is cleaned up to get the point across and it’s still damned long\*\*td;dr? – mom is all over the board with ok days and horrible days. i’m stumped and overwhelmed.",,0
"hi, my grandma has some form of alcohol-induced dementia that has been causing many kinds of hallucinations. i know she is seeing doctors and they are aware, but i’m less/not involved in all of that. she has one daily reoccurring hallucination being the rats in her house. the bite her feet, even her face. there’s many of them and they come from the canned lights in the ceiling. she’s spent god-knows how much money hiring companies to come and get rid of them. it’s been close to a year with no luck, she’s frustrated as heck, and has hired a new company to basically fumigate her house. she is asking to come stay with me while this is happening. luckily the finances aren’t an issue, but more of a wasted resource at this point. i don’t really know what to do, if anything. i don’t want her to needlessly fumigate her house, but it’s probably what needs to happen i guess. i’ve researched and seen that telling her the rats aren’t real isn’t a productive path forward, as they’re definitely real to her. my aunt has expressed doubts to her about the rats, and now my grandma tells me how my aunt doesn’t trust her that they’re there. when ive been around here i’ve mostly listened to what she has to say and kind of expressed condolences/hope they go away. any advice for me as a grandson/when she mentions the rats?",,0

"i'm sure these get posted with some regularity, but wanted to see if i could get some general advice from other people that have gone through, going through, or treating people with the same symptoms we are dealing with.   a basic background.  my dad turns 80 this year and began showing signs of dementia that were noticeable about 4-5 years ago. started with the basic problems of forgetfulness and not being able to complete tasks (ex couldn't assemble a basic wagon for my son. this is someone who has performed manual labor and been a mechanic his whole life) then to forgetting who's house he was at - even if we were at his house.  he would always say, my brain just doesn't work like it did, and apologize.   this past weekend, mother's day weekend, is what spurred me to ask for advice here.  when he and i were alone, he asked what i thought of the lady he was with because they were getting pretty serious and he really liked her.  he said he thinks she is a great woman and asked if i'd be ok with that being my step-mother.  the issue with that is, that woman is my mom and they've been married for 40 years!  i told him that, and he said .. oh .. really? then asked if she was also the mom of my siblings.  i finally mentioned to my mom today that this happened.  i've been digesting it since then and could barely tell my wife with all the emotions attached to that conversation.  my mom told me that they went to dinner last night and on the way he asked her where she worked and occasionally will ask if she knows us kids.  they are getting some basic treatment from the va.  last time they went the dr said he couldn't tell of any signs of degradation, which there pretty obviously is.  i've told my mom to start looking into finances and get another appointment for a better assessment.   here are some questions i've been thinking in my head since a couple days ago:  1. how much longer (generally) until we seriously need to get him into assisted living?2. should he be driving?  3. as heartbreaking it is to ask, life expectancy?  4. should my family and i look to do any personal therapy? if so, what kind of therapist?5. general suggestions to try to enjoy my father as much as i can before either his mind goes further or body does? this may seem like a dumb question, but seems like it's getting harder and harder to connect.  6. what type of legal items do we need to start taking care of while he still has some memory and function left?tl:dr - sorry it was so long. dad is losing his memory and hoping for some advice. even if none, i think this at least gave me a place to vent and put down some thoughts.",,0

"my grandmother has been more lucid than usually this past week and it has been bitter sweet. it's nice to see some of the old grandma back but the things she tells us are depressing.she says she doesn't know why she screams out the things she does and wants to stop, and that she is miserable and wants to get better. she was ambulatory up until she fell and broke her hip a few months ago and we had to put her in a rehab that doubles as a nursing home. i believe she was rehabilitable as far as walking went, but the physical therapy stopped when the insurance ran out and she became a custodial patient, which the facility discourages from walking because they are understaffed. the staff are friendly where she is at but the place looks like a hospital and i know that contributes to her distress because she hates hospitals more than a cat hates water.i was on a walk the other day and happened to look in the window of a building that i thought was a fancy hotel but it turned out to be one of those fancy assisted living places and it was such a world of difference. i wish we could put her in a place like that but they start at $2,500 per month and this one was probably around $4,000 per month for nursing and memory care.",,0
"my mom is in her early 70s and has dementia. she is generally confused and anxious at all times and is unable to pay her bills or make sense of her finances. i've set her up with autopay on most of her bills, but i need more control over her finances so that i can start paying for in home care because she has stopped cleaning or bathing and has lost her ability to drive. here's my issue. my mom lives a block away from a wells fargo bank. she visits the bank multiple times per week and has made ""friends"" with the bank tellers. she says they are her friends and that they take care of her and that multiple bankers have keys to her house. she hasn't been on vacation in years and i live 10 minutes away, so i'm not sure why they need keys to her house, but that's just one of many issues.i've looked at her bank statements and she appears to have accounts that she doesn't need, including an equity line of credit. she thinks she got a special deal because they like her so much and thinks it's free money. when i told her that she was paying interest on the money she was using, she didn't believe me and wanted to consult with her friends at the bank before i paid anything off.i have power of attorney, so i went into the bank with my mom and my fiancee to get put on the account and the banker acted really rude and standoffish and seemed to strongly caution my mom against adding me to her account. he asked me to make an appointment the following week with another banker to show her the power of attorney.the next morning, the police showed up at my mom's house and said that wells fargo had sent them to verify her identity and that some kind of fraud was reported. i went to the bank to ask them about what happened. i talked to a different banker and she said that the first banker flagged me as a problem because my fiancee had drawn up the power of attorney paperwork and had asked to be added to my mom's account. neither of those things were true or even implied! the poa was written and signed in 2014, long before i met my fiancee and he never asked to be added to my mom's account. i'm not sure where the banker got that information, but it's possible that my mom was confused and told him that in a previous visit. i had the poa with me when i talked to the second banker, but she told me she couldn't do anything unless my mom was there and agreed to it. this banker said that she is aware that my mom has dementia (because it's clear from talking to her), but she also said that she suggested my mom take money out of her equity line of credit to pay her bills. my mom has enough in social security to pay her bills, so why would she put them on credit? why is the banker making these kind of recommendations to her when she knows my mom has dementia? the banker also said that my mom clearly needs help, so i'm wondering why they are trying to stop me from getting involved? i'm so frustrated and uncomfortable with this whole situation.i guess i'm looking for opinions or advice on this situation. i'm worried that the bankers will try to talk my mom out of adding me to her account before i go back in a couple of days. can i still be added to my mom's account if i have power of attorney if the bankers try to talk her out of it? the poa does grant me access to bank accounts, so i'm not sure why she had to be there for me to get added to the account.if i do get added to the account and decide to close the equity line and unnecessary savings accounts and credit card accounts, can wells fargo report me again? i don't like that it's on record that i've been reported for potential fraud and now i'm paranoid about doing anything with her accounts. it's fine for now, but eventually she will need to go to an assisted living and i'm going to need to be more proactive about her accounts.",,0

"hello yet again,it seems the ftd and psychosis have gotten progressively worse faster than anticipated. i think it all stems from the diagnosis being discovered two weeks ago. now, i, as her relative and caregiver (i guess you could call me that since i live with her and help her with finances et al), have realized i cannot do this alone. the hospital gave me some resources and numbers to call where i could find help. but, even setting up the appointments and telling her what they were for triggered her anger and aggression.. thus, i have now realized i cannot reason with her anymore, and i also have realized that i cannot discuss with doctors things about her condition, especially if she is present. this is so fucking stressful, and i don't know what to do. how do i deal with realizing that a relative who i used to care for is turning into a spiteful and evil person? even though i don't have poa, i want to get her placed as soon as fucking possible, because honestly.. i can't do this anymore. the stress and anxiety i feel is exacerbated every time i realize she is in one of her ""moods"", which is every day. also, i understand that i have to have poa and she has to be enrolled in medicaid to be placed in a home, which if i'm  being honest, sucks ass. i just want it all to be over.. i guess i just have to vent, because today she is being enrolled in the chronic care management program, and once we get home, a home services program is coming over to enroll her in that too.. i just need a break, i feel like i'm trapped and i can't get out. either that or just place her in a home temporarily to get some respite, though i'm not too sure if that's even an option to bring up to the doctors, though i guess i could try? i dunno.. i hate this disease, because it's changed her, and as a result, i am realizing i have a disdain for her that was never there before.. anyways, thanks for listening.",,0
"hi,i'd like to ask for advice in the following situation, what do you think is the best course of action?my grandmother (89) is suffering from dementia which is getting even worse since may. in the beginning she just didn't remember small things or couldn't learn anything new, but in may she suddenly changed. she used to live abroad for 40 years but moved back to my home country to be closer to her children, grandchildren. because she didn't have experience how things work now she willingly left her finances, insurance, pension, housing stuff to her children to deal with. she even signed documents to authorise access for them for all of the above.all was good until recently when she suddenly developed paranoia and started to blame my mother stealing her money. then came that somebody (she doesn't say it, but hints her children/my mum) is spying on her computer and her phone.the problem lies she doesn't understand how modern things work and now everything she doesn't recognize means it's against her. she doesn't listen to reasoning, she says all the time she is not stupid, etc. so no matter what anybody says she ignores it and becomes hysterical from time to time about small things.i used to help her with the computer and the phone but now she gets scared of every pop-up and questions the computer asks. when i try to help her, explain what it is, why it happened, she doesn't even listen and just repeats herself about being spied and how my mum is stealing her money.the situation got so bad the family started to ignore her calls, cause it lead nowhere and she always got hysterical in the phone (or even in person) about the same things crying and feeling betrayed. it drained everybody mentally to listen daily this. our thought was if we don't give her chance to speak about these things, she won't anger herself. later she stopped calling most of us. however my mum still visits her every couple off days to do the groceries, have a lunch together but if my grandma starts her blame-game she leaves immediately, won't argue. according to my mum, she is normal a week than next week is crazy again. grandma calls me sometime but i let it go to voicemail, because i know she doesn't have any serious problem on her computer and i just don't wan't listen to her complains for hours.but i know (and grandma mentioned it unintentionally), she feels very-very lonely now everybody tries to minimise the contact with her. she always loved her whole family with her full heart and still does (despite what she thinks we might do) but now she is confused and feels lost why everybody is acting as they do. she won't admit she has a mental problem, doesn't wan't to see a doctor, so we can't do anything about it. but it's painful for her (and for us as well) for her last years to feel like that.i had the idea to call her on weekends so she doesn't feel disconnected (from me, at least). but now she is angry at us that she just says all is good in an offended voice and hangs up.we accepted her condition and we know it only gets worse. we know she's never going to be that person she was like even a year ago. it just hurts everyone to turn our back to protect ourselves (and herself) from those breakouts.i turn to you to for advice. how can i (my family) mitigate her pains but somehow avoid her meltdowns? we don't want our grandma/mother to feel lonely in her remaining years (which can be still quite a few as she doesn't have any other physical problems).thanks for reading my lengthy problem.",,0
"my  dad had a head injury three years after fainting and another  bad fall last year but is otherwise healthy. he was diagnosed with a frontal lobe injury, but it’s acting like dementia ish symptoms.  he’s forgetful, short attention span, can’t drive, we had to turn the gas off in his home.  i’ve tried setting rides every week for him through sr services for repeated appointments that he wants, pt and psycologost, but but he misses them. “oh they didn’t come”. they did. i called.  he goes out with a aid twice a week to shop,  6hours total. and though i’m trying to create a predictable schedule for him, manages to find ways to need new appointments and sabotage the ones that are set.  it’s driving me insane. i’ve looked up services in my area of the usa (southwest). there’s no adult daycare in my area. he went to the sr ctr last week once: “it was just horrible. the people are so disorganized.”. if he gets lucky be might be able to afford some independent living place if his house that needs a lot of work can be rented, he could maybe squeak by. i can’t pay for it, neither can my sister, no one here has gotten a raise in years.  i called my state agency for aging. they referred me to the alzheimers association,  that referred me to a bunch of programs that don’t exist in my area.  a psychologist told me if he gets a dementia diagnosis his insurance might not pay for psych. his neurologist has referred him to a dementia specialist 50 miles away. my question for everyone: did a specific diagnosis actually help? and how. what the hell am i supposed to do???sorry about typos, on a phone. frustrated.",,0
"my grandfather was diagnosed with dementia around 5 years ago. he wanted to act like everything was normal and enjoy his life, so we did. however, his symptoms and memory loss got alot worse a few years ago and it's gotten so much worse since. my mother has been taking it badly. he remembers his name, he can still recognize my mothers face and my grandmothers face, and when looking at pictures of my recently deceased uncle he also sees the face. recently he has had trouble recognizing me. i know it is just a part of the disease and that he doesn't mean to but it hurts nonetheless. i think he is more suspicious when i am there so i may not go visit him anymore, i dont want to scare him. my mother is a very forgetful person by nature and she is worried it runs in the family, if the same happened to her i dont know what i would do. right now i am 18 and just about to start my second year of university. i am studying biomedical engineering with a minor in computer science, and i work in the  finance sector to help fund my education, however my parents are able and willing to pay for everything. i am considering switching my income to go towards helping my grandpa and mom, but i honestly don't know how. does anyone have any suggestions for me to do?",,0

"i said something i probably shouldn't have said this morning to my grandmother. a little backstory, she was diagnosed 5 years ago and this summer has been particularly hard with the heat, and i decided to stay living at home to help my mother be her caretaker. it has been extremely difficult to get her to eat or drink, stay inside the house in 100 degree weather, taking a shower, etc. lately, i've seem to have a knack for getting her to do these things. i always said i was the favorite, ha!this morning she had a dentist appt. a very important one, as our great pyrenees ate her dentures, and with insurance delays she hasn't had any for weeks (making it even harder to get her to eat). she had to go, but of course didn't want to.my mom woke me up to try and get her in the car. i got her in the car, but let's just say i am not the nicest person being woken up from a deep sleep. after a few minutes of arguing i told her ""look grandma, we love you, you either let us help you, or we will have to send you somewhere where they will help you, but don't love you! we love you, get in the car"" i said it partly out of months long frustration and partly out pf half awake delirium.but it worked, but her face sunk, her eyes teared up and she slammed every door on the way to the car. i feel like the worst person ever. i did follow her and tell her i was sorry for yelling, i just want her to go to the dentist so she can eat her doritos again (she's been eyeing that bag for days). my only hope is she won't remember it when she gets back. i'm a terrible granddaughter.",,0

"my upper management wife has been showing early/mild alzheimers symptoms for the last few years. she was in a minor fender bender july 2017. the local doc in the box said she had a minor concussion and cleared her for work a day and a half later. the two other people (one a frail older women) in the car had no injuries. by oct. my wife symptoms started getting progressively worse. i convinced her to follow through with accident doctor's specialist referrals and recommended tests.  i also called her gp's office saying something more than the accident was wrong. this went nowhere - mri was negative and gp became suspicious of me. nov. wife gets fired, now medicaid and a new set of doctors. i finally get her to a neurologist end of dec. diagnosis is cognitive and short-term memory issues from fender bender. referred to a prominent (wealthy blue state medicaid) neurologist who specialises in brain injuries. he rules out alzheimers - too young (cites majority study 1 in 10,000 for 55 yr old) and rules out fender bender as too minor. next 6 months are medical and mental tests after tests also seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist. wife scored a 23 on her moca. recently the neurologist has come back to the accident as the cause of her problems. her occipital nerves are being constricted by scar tissue from the accident and wife needs surgery to remove the scar tissue. i don't believe this is the cause, but what do i know? first meeting with surgeon is in a couple of weeks. meanwhile, and thank-you for wading through all this background, the neurologist recommended the h-wave as an electroanalgesic pain management tool. it is very expensive, over 3k, and not covered by any insurance. is it worth it? if it is, are there any affordable alternatives? thank-you for your help",,0
"hi! i posted a while back about my mother in law and how to support my husband. i've taken a lot of the advice you fine humans provided, and it's helped me learn a lot about how to support him. we are still working it out, but the best thing that has come about is that he knows that it's safe to come to me and cry/yell/vent/whatever he needs. unfortunately, as i am sure many of you know, processing one aspect of having a family member with alz is often immediately followed by another more pressing situation. so here is where we are at: my mil is in the moderate-advanced stages. she lives independently with my fil in a senior community. i am unclear how many issues they are having at home regarding self-care, safety, etc because my fil is an expert at hiding her symptoms. i also have a brother and sister-in-law who recently moved back in a hurry to ""help support the family."" the quotes are intentional in that they've not helped nor supported anyone since they came into town. they are young parents, had an unplanned pregnancy very young and added a second one to the brood 4 years later. my in-laws provided them with endless support when they had their first, and continued to do so until they moved to a different state a few years ago. fast forward to now. they rushed moving back here before they could save up the money for an affordable home, so they went with the first overpriced condo they could find. to keep up with their finances, both of them work 50-60+ hours a week, often with no days off. their oldest is in school, so he's occupied until 2:30 on weekdays, and they finally found a preschool that they send their youngest to twice a week, but they rely on my in-laws for childcare 3-4 days a week. and these boys are exhausting. my fil is stressed, tired, and depressed. i don't think it's fair that he is spending his retirement and his remaining years with my mil caring for my nephews for 40 hours a week. on top of that, i am pretty sure that he is still letting her drive, possibly with the kids in the car. they have been told by their doctor that she should not be driving, and i am terrified for the safety of my nephews. we called him the other day, and he was with my mil and the kids and they were picking up his new car at the dealership. my husband tried to play it off like he had a plan that avoided her driving the kids, but i don't see how that could have happened.i am trying to help out. i have taken on one day a week, but i am also in an extremely intensive doctoral program taking 22 credits right now and i can barely keep up with that. they ask for 11-14 hour days for childcare, and neither child is disciplined enough to get anything done when they are home. so... wtf am i supposed to do here? my in-laws deserve peace. i want them to spend this time relaxing and spending time with each other, not chasing kids around for 12 hours a day. what can i say to my brother/sister in-law to get them to take care of their own lives? what can i say to my fil to make him realize how scary and inappropriate it is to let my mil drive, much less with the kids in the car? (last week, she asked my brother in law if he had always been the boys' dad.)okay, phew. that's what i've got for now. next week i'll be asking for advice regarding my fil inviting himself to my husband's weekly poker night with friends and then dumping all of his emotional baggage on him at the end of the night. sigh...",,0
i’m not sure i’m in the right sub but i’m getting desperate and i’m just looking for any advice that anyone might have. my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer’s when he was 64 that was two years ago and since then they have changed the original diagnosis to frontal temporal dementia and things have gone downhill rapidly. he lives with my mom and my younger brother in kentucky and my brother has been taking care of him during the day while my mom works and i visit when i can but i’m a few hours away. things weren’t great but livable until a couple weeks ago when my brothers appendix ruptured unexpectedly and i went down to take care of my dad so my mom could be with my brother. turns out the appendix was a bit of a blessing because they managed to discover a tumor and they removed it all quickly so even though it was cancer it hadn’t metastasized yet and he will only have to undergo one round of chemo but it’s been really hard for him to help my dad physically since he has been recovering from surgery and it has taken a real toll on my moms mental well-being. since my brother has returned home though my dad seems to be deteriorating rapidly. his hallucinations are getting worse and he is getting more violent and his balance is almost nonexistent. he keeps falling and not being able to get back up and he is larger man so my mom can’t always get him back up on her own. he also has a medical alert system ( think life alert) that he was using fine but he no longer seems to understand what it’s for and he keeps playing with it and alerting the company and he keeps trying to open the necklace because for some reason he thinks it’s a locket with something inside. so it has become apparent that he needs a caregiver or to be in a nursing home and we have no clue how to figure this out financially. he isn’t on medicaid/medicare because with his social security benefits and his pension he isn’t eligible but he is on my moms health insurance and she can’t afford her bills if she gets rid of his pension or benefits so that’s not really an option but we aren’t sure what options he might have. we don’t want to put him in a nursing home but we aren’t sure what level of care he would need. he has been reversing his nights and days and stays up all night and that’s when he tends to fall and he has also become incontinent so that’s another factor and basically we are just unprepared because we thought we had more time to save money before it got this bad. i was looking into care.com and local nursing homes but i’m really overwhelmed and feeling guilty that i’m not closer to help with the day to day stuff and if anyone has some experience with this i am all ears!,,0
"my mom has reached a point where she can no longer manage her home. she can't remember when she's had anything repaired and gets taken advantage of. she has an insurance claim and screws that up by telling them not to pay her for most of it. she tries to schedule travel and gets the dates wrong even though it's all written out in front of her. none of us (her kids) is old enough or has the time to be taking over her home for her, and even if we did by the time we find out about something (like a new roof she needed) she has already completely fucked it up. yet she insists she's not leaving her house. we considered in home care, but then we would still be managing the dumpster fires created when she hires somebody to do something that doesn't need to be done, and also trying to manage the in home care people. i don't really see what option we have at this point other than to find a good assisted living place for her with memory care. does anybody have any suggestions for how to handle this? she is already mad at everybody (we are conspiring against her) and said she's not telling anybody anything anymore. so pretty much she will hide even more than she has been.

"hi everyone. i want to start off by saying that i am a teenager, and i live with my 68 year old grandmother who was diagnosed with dementia sort of recently. she moved in with us a few months ago from another country. i don't live with her full time, i live with my mom also and my grandma lives with us for one week and with my aunt the next week, they each have her on alternating weeks. the thing is, my mom and aunt are unfit to care for her. they try their best and i know that they do, but they get easily frustrated, angry, tired and are burnt out at this point. my mom and aunt argue with each other all the time about her and they both argue with my grandma as well. they both work full time and have kids so it hasn't been easy on either of them and they are both just upset all the time, always angry with everyone because they're angry at the situation they're in. it's been hard for me because i'm currently in school and i often have to miss out on lectures or come home straight after class rather than do homework at the library or something because my mom needs me to watch my grandma, and i always do it, but this along with all the fighting and negativity surrounding this whole situation has become unbearable for me, for my mom, for my aunt, for everyone. i think for everyone's sake, finding some kind of facility that will care for her would be the absolute best thing to do.the problem is, every facility or nursing home my mom has looked into is really expensive. even with my aunt's help (who is already struggling financially), there just wouldn't be enough to cover these costs. what also adds to the problem is the fact that my grandma is not a us citizen (we live in the us). she has a visa which allows her to be in the us for 6 months at a time. that is how my grandma is here now. during this time, my mom is trying to get her citizenship worked out but i honestly don't know where she is in this process. i don't know how any of this works, so i'm not sure if she can get health insurance and if that can help cover the costs of a nursing home. i've tried researching what we can do, but nothing has really been clear to me because i really don't understand a lot of what i'm reading. our state is north carolina. i'm wanting to know if there's anything we can do to get my grandma full time care that won't cost an arm and a leg with her citizenship status. my grandma is really sick. aside from dementia, she can't walk, bathe herself, feed herself, she wears diapers and my mom and aunt change her, she is completely dependent on someone else. she couldn't live on her own and her dementia is worsening rapidly. i'm really hopeful that there is something that can help us, this whole situation has been so miserable for everyone, i just want to come up with some kind of solution.so, i guess my question is if someone knows anything regarding what we can do for her care under these circumstances, or if anyone can point me in any direction with knowledge about this kind of thing from our state, just any advice really. i think she is going to pass soon. i'm not really sure what my mom and aunt have arranged, but these nurses come to each my moms and aunts house when my grandma is there several days a week to bathe my grandma and give her medicine. it lasts for an hour each time they come over. like i said, i'm not really sure what it is exactly, but i know my mom has these nurses in her phone as ""hospice"". i believe this is some kind of program that provides this for us, and they also allow us to put my grandma in a facility for only a week once a month, but we've only done that one time. i wish i had more knowledge on this program and what it is exactly, but my aunt took care of it for the most part. i know that we had to apply for it and my grandma was approved because of how sick she is. i know that its free. they've provided us a bed for my grandma and they gave my aunt one too, and a recliner chair and wheelchairs, all for free. since this was possible to do for my grandma, i'm really hopeful that there's something else out there available to her that will ease this situation for all of us. it is something that helps out a lot but since the nurses only come for an hour 3 days a week, it's not exactly enough, i want to find something for her full time. i know that probably won't be free, i'm just wondering if there's something out there that's affordable. i apologize for my very limited understanding of how things work, i am still young and my mom doesn't talk to me much about these kinds of things, i help out with my grandma when it comes to cooking her something or shifting her position in bed when she's uncomfortable but that's really all my mom wants to involve me in. thank you for reading and i hope to hear back from someone soon",,0
"after several hours of a neurocognitive psych eval two weeks ago, combined w results from an mri done in june 2021, her neurocognitive psychologist gave the diagnosis of “mild cognitive impairment” &amp; “early stage vascular dementia” but based on what i’ve seen (i live w my mom) i feel like i’m taking crazy pills. here are just a few examples: 1. she wrongfully believed she had cancer and told everyone that she was having a hysterectomy for her cancer 2. she cannot drive to any place she does not already know 3. when she drives w both hands on the wheel she wobbles and weaves 4. she cannot remember how to use her cell phone to do simple things like make a phone call—she could not remember my phone # the other day &amp; could not figure out how to call me despite it being saved in her contacts5. backing out from the driveway, she hit a parked car (owner didn’t contact insurance, he said it was an old car &amp; didn’t matter)6. she never knows what day it is, misses appts or shows up on the wrong days/times 7. she gets aggressive &amp; violent w me over nothing 8. she’s sedentary 24/7 she is intelligent and charming and knows how to “turn it on” long enough to fool someone during a phone call. i am keeping a list of all of my concerns to share w her neurologist, but that appt isn’t until the end of april. i am worried she may hurt someone in the meantime w her driving, but i also can’t say anything to her doctors in front of her (she was abusive to me growing up &amp; frequently explodes at me when she feels i’m “under-riding her authority”.) in your experience, have doctors sometimes misdiagnosed dementia? is there anything more i can be doing to keep her and others safe? i’m really stressed and i keep communicating w her doctors but it feels like it falls on deaf ears.",,0

"i was wondering if i could get some opinions from you guys.  about five years ago i noticed my starting to lose her memory but it wasn't too bad.  last year at this time i took her to doctor and he sent her for a geriatric assessment.  at the time they assessed her with mild cognitive impairment.  it's now been a year and i noticed things about the same until about last month when i noticed her memory taking a turn for the worst.  we decided to sell her house which did last tuesday and got an apartment for her.  she still independent enough to be able to drive, do her laundry keep her house clean but she cannot do any complex tasks which means the selling of her old house, cleaning the old place out, getting her a new apartment, getting insurance is all up to me to do.  she is moving to apartment where two of her friends or she will have some support but i doubt she will be able to live independently for more than a year.  mainly she is doing okay'ish but i am worried how the new apartment which has 15 floors will be for her.  will she able to park her car in the right place, will she know what key does what, will she able to find her apartment etc....she mainly has a problem with memory in terms of dates.  she knows she is moving in november but not the date, she knows the closing of her old house is in december but not the date.  she remembers her friends name but sometimes has to search for while to find the name or she repeats the same question 5 times (did you feed the dog as an example).  she also starts crying when the simplest thing goes wrong (cannot find her iphone as an example).  her life will be big time simplified in the apartment since we got rid of almost everything and bought some new furniture, all bills will be auto withdrawn etc.... i know its hard to say but how is this going to progress.  do you think she will get a year or two in that apartment before she needs to live with me.  what does life expectancy look like for people with dementia.  i understand its hard to say because every situation is different so anecdotal experience is appreciated as well.",,0
"i’ve posted about my grandpa before and i got some great responses, but now i’m wondering about another tactic. quick recap: my grandpa (73m) is in the icu healing from covid. he still has a trach so he can’t talk. he is now fixated on sitting up and sometimes doing more like getting out of the hospital. i can’t blame him, but he can’t sit up on his own or else his heart rate goes haywire. i’ve told him that it’s good he’s wanting to try and sit up because that means he still wants to fight, but then i have to tell him that i can’t help him up. he’ll try to argue with me. every time i try to distract him, it doesn’t work. this has made my extended visits with him draining. so i’m wondering if being more firm with him would be okay or too mean? as in, “i know you want to sit up, and that’s good, but you can’t sit up or you’ll have to stay in here longer. i came to visit because i wanted to see you but i’m going to leave if you keep arguing.” or something along those lines. he remembers when he sits up with pt during the afternoon and keeps saying “help me, please” but i tell him i can only help him by visiting and keeping him calm. i don’t like to repeat myself every twenty or thirty seconds for hours on end. should i do so anyway? he said if it weren’t for me, he’d have given up on life. that was after i couldn’t see him for two days because i was away for work. now i’m afraid that if i only keep the visits short, he’ll give up.  if anyone has any ideas or advice, i’d really appreciate it. this has been going on for a few weeks while we wait for insurance to accept his transfer to a pulmonary rehab.",,0
the neurologist says that federal  medicare and a medigap plan is better than any of the commercial plans.  most doctors dislike federal medicare because its slow to pay and  the neurologist agreed...but...said federal medicare is better and faster coverage.  many of us on this sub are caring for an elderly family member on medicare. the process of choosing an appropriate program is onerous. i've even busted an insurance broker selling us a plan that in the fine print excludes dementia symptoms.  every state is different.  any good suggestions for florida?,,0
"hey guys, hope you're all well.we are awaiting a proper diagnosis for my dad and at the moment he is living with me in my two bed flat whilst we sort out his place and finances. it seems pretty clear it's dementia - he's forgetful, confused and is starting to feel like he needs constant monitoring like a child. he is starting to not seem like the same dad i've known all my lifeit's manageable him living with me, except a couple of things. i have to work all day from home and feel terrible that he is sitting indoors all day too as he is not confident getting out by himself. i'm already prepping all his meals and trying to look after myself so i don't have a lot of time left to get him out and about. the weather is great too and it would probably do him good to do some exercise. can you hire help just to take a dad for a walk!?the other issue is he is waking up at 5am to use the loo and then coming into my room instead of his own. i wake up and then take him back, and then it takes me ages to go back to sleep. is there anything i can do so he can find his way back and it's less disruptive to my sleep? a lock? signs!?any advice would be much appreciated.",,0
"i know its repeated often in this subreddit, but seriously, if you haven't already, sign up for hospice. now that my dad is finally out of the hospital, i was able to get him assessed. it's only been one day and i already feel good about this. i've met his doctor, his nurse, and our social worker. we have equipment ordered and out for delivery. medications are hand delivered to our home, no more waiting for insurance or the pharmacy to figure it out. i'm hoping that things will change for the better for me emotionally and that my dad gets the support he needs. i'm tired and sad because i never planned to take care of my dad full time once we reached the end stage. however, knowing that i have a super responsive hospice team surrounding me makes it feel a little less overwhelming and awful.",,0
"found out my auntie has long term care insurance from her teachers pension. her husband broke his foot so he can’t care for her anymore so i’m doing all the research to put her in a memory care facility. i toured 3 of them and in one, it was so depressing. to see all of them just sitting there in a wheelchair, lost and confused. they look like zombies. i cried all the way home. i can’t imagine leaving her there. she is not in that state yet, she can still walk and do laundry and wash dishes. i took her to her doctor and they gave her a test, she didn’t know the date, the president, the season, and she couldn’t remember why we were there. my heart breaks, i feel awful but i can’t take care of her.",,0
"my mum went into respite care on wednesday due to many issues that stem from her vascular dementia. i look after finances, medicine, appointments, shopping and increasingly dressing. mum is almost constantly sad or angry. unless i'm entertaining her all waking hours. recently she carved ""(my name) is dumb"" on her dining room table. she's smashed three phones, two clocks, many plates, the dvd player, broken locks, thrown things at me and sits in her driveway in her pajamas all day. she lived alone and i would never let her live with me. mum was and is a terrible, narcistic, self centred asshole. after years of feeling obliged to help the gp told us mum can no longer live alone. it was finally time to have some respite and i organised care at a very expensive respite place where mum could bring her cat. mum had a melt down. got violent, hit doors etc, but a nurse distracted her and i got away. now other nurses call to say she should go home as mum's saying she'll kill herself and they have less staff on a weekend. i had warned them that she frequently says this.the nurses say they will call an ambulance if they can't care for her and i said to 'please do call one'. i won't pick her up.i feel incredibly worried they will somehow force me to take her back. but if people trained to care can't care then i really cannot. i've called every support my country offers, they all tell me how strong i am and that they understand its difficult it is, but then don't do anything.i feel guilty, not that mum's in care, but that the staff there have to work with her. my constant pain is now their constant pain. i'm paying others to suffer.",,0
"around 2017, my mother had an episode where she lost track of an entire day, landing herself in the er. fast forward 3 years later and my aunt on my dad's side passes away from alzheimer's. i'm sure you can see where this is headed, i'll spare much more of the back story. soon after my mom's mri, my dad really stepped up, managing the finances. i assumed he was handling the estate. he was an investigative journalist, having been awarded 2 loeb awards. he was good at looking into money, i'm figured he was managing finances. my mom was happy despite her prognosis. i feel like an absolute moron because i guess the only thing he's really been doing for the past year is playing fantasy baseball. he had a friend who had invested both of their 401ks into a roth ira, tied up into some risky stock. ""don't worry, we're really well off, we have quite a bit in our 401k."" i was skeptical, but i glanced a statement from last december showing that had about $400k in their account. ok, i guess he's right. nope, their funds tanked and their financial advisor had a stroke. 2 weeks ago, mom was hospitalized twice in one day. the first facility discharged her against our wishes. the second facility actually hospitalized her . i guess i'm lucky i was able to obtain birth healthcare and durable poa for both parents days before she was hospitalized. they're discharging her to memory care. i guess she's also secretly been terrified of my dad, of course he's been neglecting her. my dad is 70 years old, started spending all this cash on home repairs without actually looking at his accounts. he refinanced the mortgage for another 30 years, i find the paperwork a couple weeks ago. i confronted him today about it and he told me that i have dpoa, all i have to do is call and that they're easy to work with. i replied with, oh, so they'll write off the mortgage if i ask? he said no, they'll lower payments. i reminded that he's 70 years old and refinanced for an additional 30 years and asked if he plans on living past 100. he said no, just call them and extend the mortgage. i reminded him that i would be the one responsible for his mortgage after he passes. of course i'm wrong according to him. he doesn't care. i have met once with an elder lawyer, but going through their finances is an absolute nightmare. nothing is stored electronically. the paperwork is literally all over the house. my dad has been spending money out of a joint account like it's his when my mom actually earns most of their monthly income. and my mom ""knows"" it's happening too. she hasn't been taken care of. she's being taken advantage of and she absolutely knows it.i should have done much more sooner. i should have looked further. now, the further i look, the more mortified i am and the worse i feel about myself.",,0

"tl;dr - i'm putting it here at the top because it's silly to make you scroll through screens of text for it.i need help preparing. i've finally got dad to agree to see a neurologist. i've got one shot to keep this ball rolling to get a diagnosis and get some help. what do i tell the doctor? what will be super important for him to know? what will be kind of helpful? what's not helpful at all?dad can come off as a normal, sweet but quirky old guy. but there's a lot going on at home.i'm trying my hardest to keep him independent and healthy but i've got to get at least a home healthy aid in there to keep him on track. now the long partabout 16 years ago, i noticed the first change in my father. he started telling folks he was raised in a rural town on the outskirts of our metro area where his grandparents lived. he was actually raised in the worst neighborhood in the inner-city area of our metro. he started speaking with a southern drawl for a while. he would pronounce dinosaur as di-nuh-sour and try to teach that to my toddler son. from that point until now i've noticed a marked decline in language skills. he forgets nouns and objects are described by their function.about ten years ago, when my mom/his wife was sick she had a commode at the house. he referred to it as her ""potty chair"". several of us attempted to correct him by over-pronouncing commode to him hoping he'd get the hint. she passed after being ill for four months. during the funeral planning, he told the funeral directory he wanted a second autopsy done because my mom was in perfect health when she went into the hospital and he didn't agree with the first autopsy's findings. in the next few minutes, the funeral home is calling medical examiners from across the state. he's puzzled. i asked everyone to step out for a few moments. he doesn't realize that his words indicated he believed by mother was killed by the hospital and he's threatening legal action. for the record, my mother was obese, probably morbidly; had what she thought was the flu for nearly a week and hadn't drunk any fluids for 3 days. at that point she was transported to the er, her heart beat irregular, dehydrated and found to have a bowel obstruction and required emergency surgery. she's lucky she made it to the er let alone survive the surgery.the hoarding started shortly after mom passed away. three bedroom house with narrow walk ways cutting through all the stuff. it was about this time the humming started. he would hum while watching tv, sitting at the dinner table, wherever. he once hummed very loudly at my daughter's dance recital. i told him to stop and he denied he was doing it. people three, four, five rows ahead of us were turning around and glaring at him.he fell in with a window washer who is a sovereign citizen. this character is a part of the republic for the united states. the believe the current us government is a corporation and they are the true and faithful government. for several years, dad would have a tuesday night conference call with all the other self-appointed representatives and senators and discuss how they would take control of the federal government's assets once society collapsed. this window washer acted as an agent to purchase us$300 worth of iraqi dinar. this dinar would be worth us$300 million when the dinar were turned in during a special redemption time frame. of course, the dinar were turned in but no us currency was returned.one fall i mentioned i had prepped my portable kerosene heater for winter in the event of a power outage. during a call a few days later, he mentioned he brought his heater inside to prepare it for winter. he started it in the family room and had flames shooting up to the ceiling. at that point, i realized i had to watch everything i said and start thinking ahead of him.five or six years ago, he started dealing with incontinence. he fashioned cloth diapers for himself using material my mom used in crafts and sewing projects. he'd fold these in 42 layers of cloth. he was very proud of this number for some reason. it looked like a football stuffed in the front of his pants. it took me three years to get him to switch to depends. then he switched to cloth baby diapers when he found those in the back of a closet at home. he used those until a year ago when his personal physician came to his apartment and forced him to toss those out. he'd been drying them in the bathroom without washing them. the smell was overwhelming and management at his retirement center approached me. he started using depends again and drying out partially used depends on the bathroom floor. the overwhelming smell was back immediately and again generated a phone call from management.three years ago, he placed a corn bag in the microwave to warm it. they are common in my area and are used to warm a bed during cold winter nights or as a heating pad for pain relief. one night he got it hot enough to start a fire. he burnt a hole through the fleece sweater he was wearing and a hole through the blanket he'd covered himself with. he suffered a second degree burn on his left pectoral region.about two years ago, he suffered a tia in the early morning hours. my younger brother who lived with him at the time found dad's glasses in a dinner plate sized spot of blood on the floor, found my dad bleeding from his lip, tried to had dad his glasses 3 times, set them on the bathroom counter and left to get breakfast. at 2pm that day my family and i arrived to find him with dried blood on his face and took him to the er because his behavior was very odd. mri and other tests performed. doctors said he'd had a tia. because he wasn't safe at home anymore i put my foot down and moved him to the town i now live in.since arriving here, he's started hoarding clothes from the senior center clothing giveaway. he started collecting stuffed animals there as well and giving them to his special friend june. june's family requested this end because they were concerned about mites, lice and other bugs on the donations. management at his retirement center asked me to speak with him. he stopped giving her stuffed animals and instead gave her dresses and sweaters. june's family collected two 30 gallon garbage bags full of sweaters and dresses and gave them to management. this time the manager and i sat down with dad and he agreed to stop. immediately following that meeting he told me, ""now i'm not saying you and your wife have to do this but the clothing giveaway has a lot of bras and panties and mens' underwear you could get for free."" i cannot think of anything more repulsive than wearing someone else's used underwear.he frequently asks me what i know about a letter he received in the mail. i ask what the letter was about, who it was from, etc. i get unspecific details such as from that one place or that group or i think it was those people i talked to the other day. when he receives an explanation of benefits from the insurance company, he'll ask why he's getting a bill. when i explain it's not a bill, he argues with me.if you've read this far, thank you. thank you...",,0

"not sure if this belongs here. maybe i'm looking for some support. maybe i'm hoping someone will have an idea to help me along. i have suspected for at least ten years my father's dealing with a form of dementia. if it's not dementia, then i'd have to say he's a narcissist. he was raised in a single parent home by his mother. when he's relayed stories of his childhood and interactions with his mother's family, it's clear there was a lot of dysfunction. my mother, his wife, passed ten years ago. i recall visiting my parents' home and my father displaying an odd behavior. later that afternoon i asked my mother if he'd had a stroke or if something had happened. she didn't answer but turned around and went back to her task on the kitchen counter.when she feel ill, my father was more concerned about the different syrup flavorings for coffee offered in the visitor area at the care facility my mother was in than he was about the care she was receiving from the doctors. at one point, he had a shelf in their fridge dedicated to all the cups of coffee he'd brought home with various combinations of creamers and syrups.while mom was sick and at home she had a commode. he referred to this as a ""potty chair"". although myself and others would emphasize ""commode"" in our next sentence to drop the hint he was using the wrong word, he just never put it together.one fall after she passed, i mentioned to him i'd spent some time outside prepping my kerosene heater for the winter ahead. i wanted it ready in case the house lost power for a prolonged period. during my next phone call home a few days later, my father mentioned he, too, had prepared his kerosene heater for winter by bringing it inside the house and starting it. he said he had flames shooting up to the ceiling and had my little brother not been there, the house might have caught fire.there have been several instances where he's been unable to foresee the very likely outcomes of his actions. i liken this to when my own children were toddlers and we'd have to keep on eye on them at all times for their safety.several years ago, he began to deal with incontinence. his approach was to fashion diapers out of cloth he'd had around the house. he was quite proud to tell me there were 42 layers of cloth stuffed in the front of his pants. he looked as if he'd stuffed a football in his pants. as these were soiled, he'd drop them wet into a laundry basket in his bedroom. after a number of them had accumulated, he would take the load to the laundry in the basement and wash all of them. the house reeked in the worst possible way of urine. after a year or so, i was able to convince him to try depend undergarments.two years ago, he suffered a tia and smashed his face into a door frame in the kitchen. i found him over seven hours later laying on his bed, incoherent. i dialed 911. the er ruled out uti, stroke, all the ""big nasties"" and told us to keep an eye on him over the weekend. while trying to dress to go home, he couldn't find the left half of his belt. it was in the loops and dangling right in front of him. the doctor returned and preformed some vision testing. he had no vision in his left eye from mid point to the outside. at that point, the doctor admitted him to the hospital and he went for an mri. a stroke was ruled out and the incident declared a tia.at this point, i met with his lawyer who brokered a deal. dad was to move to an independent living facility closer to me. i was prepared to obtain guardianship and force the issue. there are several other issues at play that i'd rather not publish on the internet. i will say that all these combined put my father at risk for physical harm or criminal charges if he fell into the hands of an uncaring da. when i spoke with dad's lawyer about my intentions and observations, the lawyer said he had no doubt i'd be granted guardianship based on what i was relaying. two points - first, i was holding back a few other larger points that i would share with my lawyer if indeed this would go to court. i've been around enough to know you don't lay all your cards on the table at the beginning. second, for some of my larger points, i had texts, screenshots and photos.dad moved closer to me and began use of the cloth diapers once more. he argumentatively refused to stop using them. he generated a smell complaint from the senior center. he and i met with his doctor and i explained my father's living conditions. his doctor left the office and visited my father's apartment during his lunch hour. he went toe to toe with my father and told him the diapers had to go. the doctor's assistant and i were able to round up all the diapers and toss them out.sadly, just before the pandemic started, he started drying out partially damp depends for re-use and generated another smell complaint. i'm not sure if that's a continuing practice as visitors are not allowed in during the pandemic.whenever i ask him about showering, he tells me it's been a while but that he does sponge baths.the last time i was able to enter his apartment before the pandemic, he had a pair of used shoes on the kitchen counter. these were from the senior center. the rubber heels had started to disintegrate. he'd wrapped the soles in scotch tape and was filling the voids with elmer's white glue. he refused to allow me to throw them out.he claims he's completely competent to manager his own affairs. mom did all the finances while she was alive. when he lived at home, he lost $300 to a iraqi dinar scam, $700 to a bum who promised to do tree trimming and another $400 to an online vitamin offer.during the pandemic, i've been making a point to call him daily. three times in one week he told me about different ""free"" offers where he'd only have to pay shipping and handling. the final one was a book about hitler's scientists discovering a cure for cancer. it, too, is free but he'd have to pay shipping and handling and subscribe to a newsletter. he ended that portion of the phone call by saying you never know if these things are a scam or not unless you try.that comment scared the life out of me. i've started working in the background using my financial poa to limit his access to his funds. he and i will have to work much more closely on his spending habits from now on. he tells me he doesn't have money for depend yet makes $120 a month in donations to causes he supports. when i read back the acronyms from payee line of the cancelled check, he cannot tell me which group that is or what cause it is for.i don't know if this is dementia or not. he's refuses to seek testing. he says there's nothing wrong with him and that's just how he is.thanks for reading this far. maybe if you have some communication strategy suggestions, i'd appreciate those.",,0
"my grandmother has been going through dementia for about 6 years now and things are coming to a breaking point.  my mother takes care of her, but she can only do soo much, and i'm sure she is close to her breaking point.   long story short, my grandmother needs 24 hour care but we cannot put her in a nursing home because of financial reasons.   the insurance wont cover it, and it seems like the only way to have a home take her in would be to sign over our house and my grandmothers life insurance policy to the healthcare provider.  my mother is going insane and its killing me to see her this miserable. i dont know if this post is a plead for help or maybe just getting it off my chest.. i just hate this so freaking bad and i dont know what to do.   does anyone have any idea on any programs or charities or something.. **anything** that i could look into to see if i could get something done to give my mother some sort of break or relief?

"hi all, thanks for everything on this sub. been reading a lot of helpful stuff. so my mom has been losing her short term memory for a little over a year now. a few months back she started having episodes where her entire left side would feel numb, and she would lose some muscle control. a couple of er visits confirmed it was not a stroke, we tried to follow up with mri’s, but she can’t handle them at all. a visit to a neurologist resulted in the need for more tests, and the doc said he thinks it could be something neurodegenerative, but no solid diagnosis yet. he prescribed 5mg of haloperidol twice a day, which seems to have done wonders for the episodes she was having.two weeks ago, my father died unexpectedly. he felt sick for a couple of days, then collapsed on his way back home from the store just across the street from their house. i am completely devastated, and feel totally lost without him, just on a personal level- but he was also my mother’s caregiver, more than we realized until he was gone. it turns out he was keeping quiet about how bad her memory and understanding was getting. without him now, my brothers, sister and i are finding out how badly she needs care. her long term memory is fine, in fact she’s pulling out stories we’ve never heard before from 30, 40 years ago that check out. her short term is declining though- she doesn’t remember why she’s taking the haloperidol, doesn’t remember the trips to the er. she doesn’t remember what day of the week it is, and forgets entire recent conversations frequently.a major issue with getting her the care she needs is her immigration status- she’s not a legal resident. in fact, i just found out two months ago that she and my father were never actually married. the house is totally paid off, and her name is on the title, so there’s that- but it seems like she’s entitled to nothing else at all. my siblings and i are able to pool together money every month to keep the taxes, insurance and utilities paid, and maybe pay someone out of pocket for some time with her every day- we still haven’t done the real math, but the ballpark figures seem manageable. i guess what i am looking for here is any sort of advice or information- how would i even start to get help for my mom? we’re in ny. i’m not sure yet if it would be feasible for her to stay home, my sister and i are taking turns spending the night there with her and leaving for work in the morning. the first two days were rough, she took the wrong amount of medication the first day, so from now on we know she’s only to take pills when we give them to her. we are planning on shutting off the stovetop and getting her a microwave (although she always hated microwaves, which is why she doesn’t have one already.)",,0
"let me preface this by saying i'm not sure where to start and this will probably be a big jumble. i'll answer clarifying questions if i'm able.if anyone can just give me ideas of where to start with all of this, i'd be extremely grateful.so my mom almost certainly has early onset alzheimer's. she's almost 64 and has had symptoms for at least 10 or so years (though they've gotten much worse). my maternal grandma died of alzheimer's, and my mom's at the point that she doesn't remember how many grandchildren much less their names or what you told her 2 minutes ago. my mom doesn't have healthcare because she wouldn't let me have access to her information until recently, and that is mostly through my younger brother who has access to her accounts. he has autism and is fairly high functioning, but he still needs help to know what needs done and how to do it.  i'm leaving  a lot out, but he can be coached and is willing to help, but can't really plan or make a lot of decisions himself. to further complicate matters, they live in a different state than i do. i did recently sign up for social security for my mom without trying to get her disability because she doesn't have an official diagnosis because she's refused to go to the doctor for years and gets angry and paranoid about it. she has a history of other mental illness that was present before the dementia. recently she has relented to going to the dentist and even get an oral surgery (which my brother was able to take her to and help her with afterwards). i don't think she'd accept going to an evaluation for alzheimer's and i'm not sure she wouldn't see through it if we attempted to say it was something else. she's still very intuitive sometimes and is still quick to anger at any perceived attempt to patronize her or control her.i want to get my mom health insurance in the sign-up window, but i hate answering those questions about whether the person has a cognitive disability negatively. she does have one, i just can't prove it at the moment. i have considered going through adult protective services, but there's more than one problem with that. the first problem is that, as mentioned, my brother lives with her and wants to remain in that house. the house has fallen into disrepair since my mom can't keep up with maintenance any more. i've been working on helping them as much as i can from a distance, but i was only able to visit briefly this year. the house is improving slowly, and i think i can help my brother make it better over time. my brother, understandably, is worried that adult protective services might want to remove them both from the house in its current state. i'm not sure at what level that happens, and it is improving, but...my aunt lives about an hour away and tries to visit mom most weekends, but she isn't always able to. also my mom recently rejected her help. i'm not sure if this will continue or not, but my aunt is more responsible for helping my mom maintain her hygiene than my brother.  i fear something will have to be done if she keeps rejecting my aunt.i'm going to discuss this with my aunt again soon, but i think my aunt is the executor on my mom's will and she previously said she thought i might be her medical power of attorney.  of course, to use that i'd have to get her declared incompetent, which frankly, sounds like a nightmare.i really don't know where to start on all this. does anyone have any advice? should i just do the healthcare application for this year without saying yes to the disability part?  she'll be eligible for medicare in a year... i don't know. any insight is very much appreciated.",,0
"my mother has an appointment with a neurologist on wednesday. we hope that this will be the day we get her diagnosis so we can go forward with a plan. she's had memory issues for several years, and is getting more and more moody and confused. she's refused to accept any diagnosis previously, but now she's in an assisted living situation and we need to have a diagnosis so we can help her more. yes, it's terrible to want to hear the doctor say 'your mother has alzheimers' but we need  to know, one way or another, what's going on.we have legal issues to deal with, and untangling the finances would be easier if we could show the lawyers that we (my brother, sil, my husband and myself) will be handling the issues.

"so there are days where i'm just very grateful for my wife having had the presence of mind to get decent insurance before her disease kicked in.now that she's in need of diapers, we've gotten the insurance company to cover the cost of them. we got a bale of them (14 packages, 8 per package) delivered for free this afternoon.i don't know why i feel so grateful, when there are more important things that have priority, but i do. this kinda stuff impacts our day-to-day.",,0
"my grandfather has dementia. he also has diabetes and he does a terrible job at keeping his sugar levels where they are supposed to be. we also found out he hasn’t paid his taxes in 4 years. good news is he has zero debt. owns his house and car. also has 250k in a savings account and 3 rental properties.it's hard to describe how bad it is. some days he thinks its 1990 and he's still building houses (he was a contractor and built houses for a living). other days he’s up to date with everything (my life, his daughter (my mother). but everyday he is stubborn. he was born very poor but ended up doing pretty well for himself.he still drives (passed the required il written and driving portion last week) and this aspect scares me. it seems like a huge liability.my mother has been helping him out for a while, but its starting to take a toll on her. she comes over and cleans the house every weekend. she helps put the medicine in the respective pillboxes. and one final thing she does is withdraw money from his account (she has poa) and puts cash (in small bills) in his wallet so he has spending money.lately he started a fiasco by yelling and verbally abusing my mother. he accused her of doing things that he did when he got divorced 25 years ago (my mother just recently divorced). he called me and tried to get me involved but started getting teary and said he just wished my mom would stop doing the “alleged things” (i know for a fact my mother doesn’t do cocaine and hire prostitutes). he ended the conversation saying that he is taking his finances back over from my mom, and is changing his will entirely. my mom took him to the doctor this am and the sugar level was 4x over where it was supposed to be. so moral of the story, his worst times are when he slacks on the sugar level. it also has made my mother afraid of him.here’s what im getting at.1)	this is really starting to bog down on my mom. i told her she has to go to a cpa and get the whole tax situation figured out. she doesn’t want to because shes afraid he can get in trouble. i don’t want to overstep but i know this is a huge no no. help?2)	we tried assisted living but he made it very difficult for everybody. other than the location, and the house layout, it was identical. we repainted the walls, brought in all the furniture, hung all the same pictures, etc. he likes the freedom at his house. how do we bring it up that this is probably the best option?3)	finances. other than the tax issue, what the heck do we do? i really don’t think he’s in shape to manage the rental properties anymore. even remembering to go to the bank to get cash is a bad idea imo because he has to drive.4)	any other advice?we let this situation go from bad to worse. i understand that i’m a grandson and young (m/27) but this is only going to get worse. thanks everybody.",,0

"i am in ohio.  my aunt is 95. she has lived alone most of her life about 3 hours from me. it became obvious about 5 years ago that she couldn't live alone. she couldn't remember whether she performed simple tasks like preparing meals and taking her pills. once she drove to the store (1 mile away), pulled barely into the driveway, set her head on the steering wheel and went to sleep until a neighbor came to wake her.so, my parents live in arizona in the winters and in ohio with me in the summers. the last 5 years they've run themselves ragged trying to support her. they take her with them each winter and kind of split the time between my house and hers in the summer. throughout all of this, she constantly attacks them. she accuses them constantly of stealing from her, but always little things. at least daily she repeats the stories of how ""your asshole father"" snuck into her basement late at night and stole a pipe wrench or that my mother went through her change bowl in her room while she was sleeping and stole $.90.  the latest issue has been a struggle. when they came from arizona they took a shuttle to the airport and she agreed to pay for it. now she has no memory of that conversation and she is accusing my mother of doing it without her permission.  she has been screaming at everyone for the last day and a half that my mother made the charge and wrote it in her checkbook without her permission. the checkbook entry is clearly in her handwriting, but she ""swears to god"" that she never wrote it.she has been demanding everyone to take her to the bank and remove my mother from all her accounts to prevent any more stealing.  when we refused, she ended up sneaking out of the house, going to the neighbor's driveway and stood behind their teenage son's car until he agreed to take him to the bank.  when i figured out what happened, i rushed to the bank and just missed them. the bank manager told me he helped her and it was clear she was not stable so he refused to allow her to close anything.she absolutely refuses to sign a power of attorney for health care or finances.  i have multiple doctors support that she cannot live alone. she has threatened to bring in a waitress she knows to live with her. she says that the waitress would be happy to take care of her for free if she put her in her will. my mother had a triple bypass and a hip replacement last year and need carotid artery surgery this year.  this whole thing is ridiculously stressful and we don't know how to handle her anymore.",,0
"we just moved my septuagenerian mom in with us from across the country. she has some form of early dementia, though she is not a fan of ""too many psychological questions"" from her doctor, so any full diagnosis is going to take some time.

"tl; dr: what are the pros and cons of hiring someone (probably a stranger) to serve as a remote assistant to a senior citizen with memory loss?my mother is elderly (over 80) and has started to have short-term memory loss. it's gotten more noticeable in the last 6 months or so, and she has started to acknowledge it. my brother and i both live at a distance from her, though he is close enough that he can make the round-trip in a day, and he visits every few weeks. she is not home-bound, she drives well, and is very intelligent. we do not think she is any danger to herself. due to the pandemic, she is alone a lot of the time, especially now that it is winter and she can't easily have visitors outside in the yard. friends and relatives phone her often--one of them daily, several multiple times a week. she has local friends who bring her groceries weekly. she is also able to run to the grocery store herself, where she is cautious about going very early and making the trip short. however, she is not great about remembering to wash her hands, remove her mask properly, etc.she needs help with computer and iphone issues fairly regularly. she's always been tech challenged but it is more critical now, with phone and zoom being the main ways of interacting with people during the pandemic. she reaches out to my brother a lot for tech help (and to me occasionally on it). she reaches out to me on financial questions fairly regularly and sometimes on medical. my brother and i both observed her memory issues getting worse. i began pursuing trying to get a diagnosis and any medical help that seems appropriate. she was able to get a zoom appointment with her family doctor, who seemed excellent. (i attended, too.) he prescribed comprehensive blood testing. everything was normal. he has referred her to a neurologist. that will be next--she would prefer to wait until after she's vaccinated. i made sure she registered for the vaccine as soon as she became eligible.just when her memory issues got to the point that i thought she should get medical evaluation, my brother began  advocating for her to get a remote assistant to help her with technology problems, scheduling household repairs and maintenance, remembering appointments, and keeping track of medical issues. he would like to hire someone overseas (inexpensive).my mother is not eager to have a remote assistant. she thinks that will just be someone to supervise and have to try to share everything with electronically. her biggest source of frustration is technology, and second is trying to get things done where she has to depend on other people being reliable and doing the job well. she has a lot of trouble scanning documents or emailing photos of things.i asked my brother if the reason he wants a remote assistant is because her questions are becoming burdensome to him. he said no but i think he has backed away from that answer. my husband, who works in it and is super patient, has offered to help her with computer issues. she is happy to have that resource and thinks the world of my husband, but she hasn't reached out to him yet. i think she is used to contacting my brother and i don't think he has discouraged her from doing so. here's why i'm posting: i am concerned about the safety of a stranger knowing that she lives alone and has memory issues. that person would know when she has an appointment and is out of the house and could also potentially try to scam her in other ways, such as financially. (at this point, my mother controls her own finances, though she is gradually bringing me in to help.)when my brother first suggested the remote assistant, i raised my safety concerns with him. i also suggested that if we do hire someone, we should set the cost aside. we both know that she is well off and cost is not an issue for her--she is happy to pay well for work for her. i have said we should put safety first and hire someone one of us knows and trusts (i gave him 3 names of underemployed friends who might be interested) or perhaps a friend of a friend who is well-vetted. my brother's position is that anyone can rip you off whether you know them or not. i subsequently also offered to help more (which i am doing) and i have offered my husband's help with the technology issues (which my brother has not responded to--instead he's emailing me things like medical releases we should give a  remote assistant).  sorry this post is so long. i would love any advice on any of the following: whether i'm being overly concerned about my mother's safety, approaches to dealing with my brother on this assuming that i'm not being overly concerned, possible alternative ways to address my mother's issues, any stories of success or failure using remote assistants, and anything i might be missing. thank you in advance!",,0
"i know this is kind of a legal question and such - but i figured someone here would have dealt with this.my dad's about two years into lewy body and he's doing about as good as you can expect at this stage. he's a really selfless guy and he wants us to get what he's saved for us.anyhow, he wants us to find a way to get it before he's forced into a care facility or some similar situation plays out. i know zilch about this sort of thing and have no idea where to start. i don't even know how it's being held - but i assume it's in some kind of life insurance policy? he was able to articulate there would be ""fees"" or ""penalties"".his wife is still alive and she's onboard with this. i have power of attorney documents - but that wouldn't be useful in this situation as far as i can gather.any advice reddit?",,0
"about five years ago, the va diagnosed my dad (who is now 71) with alzheimer’s. it's gotten progressively worse, and he gets extremely angry and frustrated. in addition, he gets easily confused and has severe mobility issues.my dad currently lives with my sister (23) in rural new york. the situation is not ideal for him or her, and they're both under the poverty line. i (26) currently live halfway across the country. if i stretch my budget to the extreme, i can afford to send him about $500 a month barring any major expenses or emergencies. my dad is not willing to come live with my husband and i, because we live in a large city that he's never been to and he has panic attacks while traveling. obviously, the situation is not ideal, and we're looking into memory care units - but unfortunately, they're prohibitively expensive. like, an average of $6,500 per month expensive in his area (which is double what i make). has anyone had any experiences with paying for memory care? if it helps, my dad is a vietnam-era veteran, has medicare and social security, and my mom is deceased (so my dad is unmarried). he currently has no assets to speak of (no house, no bank acct, no car). my dad is also legally blind in one eye, and is considered partially disabled from his time in the military. i looked into va aid and attendance, but it appears that he would only qualify for up to $1,788 per month, which would be way under the cost for care. thank you for any advice. i'm extremely worried about my dad right now, so if any of this is disjointed or additional information is needed, please let me know.x-posted to personal finance",,0
"so my dad was diagnosed around 2009 at age 72, he just had his 79th birthday and his symptoms have become exponentially worse. i live on my own on the other side of the state (california) so i can only be there so often to give my mom a break. while his symptoms already had included getting lost while walking the dog, not remembering family members, wandering off, lashing out and accusing my mom of stealing from him, the last few weeks have been tough. my parents were renting a house and their landlord decided to sell it and gave them 30 days to leave. they live in a small town where other rentals are in high demand, and my mom has not been able to find a house in time, so they're now in a hotel that my sister and i are paying for. this is really hard on my dad, he is confused and thinks my mom is doing this because she hates him, etc, etc. so my mom and sister have been watching him pretty much all day/night.so today i get a text from my mom that while she was in the shower, dad decided to leave. she called 911 and they found him a few streets over at a cvs, saying he was trying to go back to la to get a job. he was apparently very angry and uncooperative with police and they took him to the hospital. the hospital, along with my dad's primary doctor both said that his symptoms are basically not extreme enough, and they can't help. to go along with the doctor thing, my parents have no health care other than medicare. my mom has tried several times to go through medicaid (medi-cal?) and they get the response that their out of pocket max per month is $1800, which is about all they make each month. on top of that my mom can't work because she can't leave my dad at home alone anymore. so no real insurance, no doctors helping, nursing homes costing double what my parents make, and everyone basically telling my mom she is shit out of luck, she's at a total loss. sorry for the wall of text, but has anyone had a similar situation? can anyone offer advice/tips?",,0
"my (early-middle stage) mom has long term care insurance.  she's in independent living now but the facility thinks it is time to move her (and possibly spouse) to memory care, which is a hell of a lot more expensive.  her policy requires that she be getting care for 90 days before they'll pay, meaning there is risk in moving her and just hoping it works out.has anyone been successful in filing claims for ltc?  what stage were your loved ones at?",,0
"i posted a couple months back about my mom because one of the hoarding subreddits directed me here because it seemed to them my mom possibly also had some dementia mixed in with all her hoarding issues. i was calling aps on her for her living conditions. i ended up deleting all my reddit posts about it out of an excess of caution after i made the call because i did it anonymously.by law the state had to investigate within seven days after i called. the seventh day they came and left a business card on the door. they have done absolutely nothing since then. i’m not even sure they even tried to contact them when they left the card.after a couple months i am now convinced she has dementia.what is my next step? my mom is living in a hoarded house with most of the exits blocked. i tried calling the fire marshall but they don’t deal with residences. the house has been flooded by a leak in the upstairs bathroom multiple times so i’m sure it has mold. they opened a window upstairs tears ago and it is still open (with no screen). there are mice. there is a hole in the  dining room ceiling (that’s where the water leaked). there is a literal pile of shit in one corner of the house. she’s basically living in squalor.the refrigerator doesn’t work but she keeps food in it anyway. i have caught her digging food out of my trash to take home to take home to her non working fridge. she has conversations with my daughter where she basically repeats the same short exchange three or four times. she can’t remember my birthday and other things she could know. she forgets how to drive places.i have power of attorney but she voluntarily signed it over. she refuses to move because it’s her dream house and “it’s not that bad”. she seems to have no concept that mice are not ok, that living without a fridge or air conditioning is not normal. i have taken over her finances but only to make sure bills are getting paid. otherwise she just spends what she wants, whether she has it or not, and then goes and withdraws more out of her ira. her housing situation isn’t really sustainable monetarily either.when it was hoarding and a choice she was making (however bad it was) it was different, but now i think she has dementia, i am not sure i should be leaving her to it. i don’t know what my next step should be since aps seems to be unwilling to do anything. any advice? thank you so much!",,0
"i study in a foreign country (in spain), but i'm at home (in florida) for the summer, and i might stay longer because all my classes are online now.my dad has lost his ability to do most basic tasks but he is still himself, he still knows who i am, he still remembers a lot of details from his life. i only come home once a year so i see his decline in ""jumps."" he is worse than he was last year.he doesn't recognize objects, he can't find his way around the house, and i guess his short-term memory is off. he can't remember things like whether he had breakfast. sometimes he tries to pour himself a cup of water but he's holding the cup upside down and the water splashes all over the kitchen. he urinates all over the bathroom floor because he can't find the toilet. he can't dress himself. he can't use his computer or smartphone, which was always an issue even when he was younger but now he really can't do basic things. i taught him how to listen to the bbc world service, npr, and audiobooks on youtube, which he enjoys and he can sort of do it but he often needs help. he has a lot of difficulty using his phone.he wanted to write about his experiences during his career (he was an attorney and he participated in fighting for civil rights in the 1960s) but i'm not sure if he's still capable of writing a coherent book. it's sort of a tragedy that he can't write his experiences. he sort of can, but he keeps printing out the same three pages over and over again, and he set it to size 20 font and the whole project is becoming an incoherent disaster.my mother is angry with him because when my father was young and strong, he tended towards the abusive side. my mother wanted to divorce him in recent years, but now she has to stay with him because he never bought any kind of medical insurance and there is no one else in the world who will take care of him. my mom works in medicine and she stays home now due to corona (both of my parents are in the highest-risk group) so she takes care of my father all day, including preparing meals and helping him get dressed, but sometimes she is very impatient with him, especially when he does things she told him not to do, or when he doesn't do things she told him to do. my dad was always bad at following basic directions and he often made a lot of poor decisions, so my mom still has a lot of resentment from decades of fights. my mom has always had a short temper, and really both of them contributed to making the house a toxic place over the years. it's one of the reasons why i left, but not the only reason. (i really wanted to live in a place with public transport, pedestrian life, and cold weather.)a lot of my father's mind is still intact. he knows who he is, he knows who my mom is, he knows who i am, and he knows that i am here. he knows that i'm living abroad. there is still a lot of him left. he knows what's going on around him, to an extent. he likes bbc podcasts and he follows along. we went to the supermarket and came home and he remembered details of what we did at the supermarket (he found it impressive that i knew how to buy food).my parents' house has been overly cluttered with shit, and i convinced my mom to give a lot of shit to goodwill. most of the shit was random gifts from random people - glass tigers, giant miniature sailboats, metal apples on metal plates, wooden russian spoons, a large yellow vase with red chinese dragons (this object was very expensive and had been important to my father's mother), little sculptures, decorated plates and bowls, all kinds of *objects* from all over the world that people brought to us without asking and expected us to keep forever. every solid surface in the house was covered with this garbage. *expensive* garbage, but garbage nonetheless. the dining room table, the desks, the kitchen counter, the shelves, the dressers, everywhere was covered in stupid objects. thirty years of accumulated garbage ate up all the space, collected dust, cluttered the house. we spent the past two weeks collecting all this garbage into plastic boxes and dumping it off at goodwill. my dad wanted to participate in this cleaning project, but he really couldn't. he kept doing bizarre things like brushing the floor with a small brush instead of using a broom. we have one room that's full of books (which we're mostly planning to give away) and he started cleaning that floor with a wet mop, which was damaging the books. we told him to stop, because first we would take the books to some library and *then* we would clean the floor, but he angrily insisted to do it anyway because ""oh i won't damage the books."" the thing is, my dad was already like that when his brain was working. he would often do things that made sense to absolutely nobody but him, and he would fight you if you tried to interfere. it's one of the reasons my mom wanted to leave him. in my opinion, he had undiagnosed asperger's syndrome, because in the wikipedia entry for asperger's it describes my dad's personality a lot. as it turned out, he had no idea that he was using a wet mop (because he insisted it was dry), so i replaced it with a dry broom and he just kept sweeping.there are some objects that my dad would not want to throw away, like the large yellow vase from china, or a sprawling set of ancient wine glasses we never use, or a heavy crystal-glass bowl that was a wedding gift from some cousin, but he wasn't really capable of recognizing that we were getting rid of those objects. he just went along with it.i also found something which i thought was sort of incredible - a diary kept by my dad's mother during the years 1929 to 1933, when she was age 19 to 23. my dad asked what it was and i told him, i said ""it's a diary from [her name] from 1929 to 1933,"" and he said, ""oh wow! i want to read it!"" but then i guess he forgot about it five minutes later. it had been in the garage, sitting in humidity and heat, so i brought it to my room and read it. i can't say it was that interesting - she visited cleveland and new york, and she was in love with some guy named ray who is almost certainly dead - but having a 90-year-old diary from a deceased relative written when she was almost younger than the dog is quite remarkable. (the dog has also gotten really old and she doesn't like to play anymore.)there are a lot of little things that are getting worse. in 2015 my dad couldn't find his way to an elevator in a small hotel. now he can't recognize cabinets that he built himself twenty years ago. or he'll hold up an object that's very obviously a simple object like a cup and ask what it is. my mom installed some hooks in the bathroom for holding towels and he ripped them off the walls because he thought they were door handles for a cabinet that didn't exist.i've been staying home because i don't want to collect corona and bring it home, but last night i went out with one of my childhood friends, mike, and we sat at an outdoor table at a taco restaurant. he knows my dad. i told him what was going on, and mike said, ""he's going to start forgetting who you are."" that comment sort of caught me off guard, because i guess it didn't occur to me that it will get worse. it didn't occur to me that it's sort of a big deal that my dad still knows who i am and that i am here.i sort of avoid my parents, especially my dad, when i am home, because old habits die hard. he needs a lot of attention (even when his brain worked he needed a lot of attention) so i tended to stay in my room with the door closed, and now as an adult i'm doing the same thing. i feel like i am wasting this valuable time while my dad's brain is still working at the level that it is.i didn't expect to write this many paragraphs, i thought this would be a short post. but anyway i guess i would like to spend some more time with my dad, but i don't really know how because whenever i'm in his presence i feel overwhelmingly driven to go back to my room and sit in bed and browse instagram or some such stupid bullshit. i guess i'd like to know what are some things i can do during this early stage while he's still there. like how can i take advantage of this time.",,0
"spoke to someone at the council earlier about setting up direct payments regarding getting mum a carer/sitter while i'm at work.  jesus fucking christ, it's insane.   mum isn't wealthy but has lived frugally and saved so is over the threshold where she has to cover all costs.

"hey homebound caregivers. i  just wanted to send you a note and let you know you are not alone. as you see in all of these posts, we are struggling together... but separate. it truly stinks and i don't know if any of us have any answers to resolve the feelings we have right now. i do want you to know that if you are feeling anxious, depressed, excessively stressed, and even having suicidal thoughts, you are not alone. a recent study by the cdc revealed that the most vulnerable population for these feelings is ""unpaid caregivers for adults- many who are providing critical aid to persons at risk for severe illness from covid...""  as a collective group, we, you, are at a 31% higher risk for anxiety and depression; 26% higher risk for trauma/ stress-related symptoms and a 30.7% higher risk for suicidal ideation.this is no laughing matter. feeling this way is awful and we cannot give good care to those we love when we are so melancholy.  i am right here, believe me i have my own therapist running circles to keep up with me and my fluctuating moods, depression and desire to ""just give up"".here is the deal, i can try to help. i have wanted to create a consulting business to help caregivers, especially during this time, but finances are tough for everyone.  therefore, i can do my best to help and i will do it complimentary.  i have helped several reddit members already and continue to do so.  so, reach out, private message me. we can do email chats, phone calls, and even video chats.  we may not be able to join hands or be face to face, but we can help each other out.  i am so inspired by the chats that i see here:  questions being asked, suggestions being offered. there is a light at the end of the tunnel and today it just maybe our ability to restore our faith in humanity by giving... just to give and create connections.until i hear from anyone, i wish you all the best and i do want you all to stay safe, keep your loved ones safe... and for god's sake... wear your masks!all my best,cathy",,0
"my dad's memory has been on the decline for several years. his friend called me on monday and dropped the bomb that he has been out of work for 6+ weeks, has been messing up little jobs that she gives him (small landscaping jobs - he was supposed to remove tree stumps but ripped out a customer's landscape lighting against their wishes!). basically he has completely run out of money, but he won't tell me. it got so bad that his phone was turned off and there's a $600 bill to turn it back on, his electric was turned off for several days until his friend paid the bill, and his water was turned off.  i think this issue is a combo of him not having money and him not remembering and not being able to work because of his bad memory. he has extra vehicles and plots of land. he, however, will not actually sell anything. i think it's almost like a hoarding situation where he's attached and can't let go. talking about his finances is an uphill battle and he will not share his information. he's so prideful and private, and honestly probably embarrassed that he is in this position. i'm not interested in shaming him, i just want to solve this problem. does anyone have any tips with how to even deal with this? i feel awful because my dad has helped me so much, i do not want him sitting at home without electricity and water! but he won't accept help. do i force my help on him and just go through his stuff and find the account numbers and what not? this may be unethical. or do i try to gently and slowly get him to let me help by talking to him about his feelings/what's going on? thanks in advance!",,0
"a little bit of background, my mother is 61 now, and has been diagnosed for about 5 years. ftd is a very rapid onset form of dementia, that many carers and people are just not comfortable understanding, as it rapidly takes away the persons ability to communicate, comprehend, and address their own needs. my mother would literally sit in a fire, and not realize it. terrifying.anyways, decades ago my mother had a partial denture made. like any severe dementia patient, she does not allow brushing or oral care very easily. my father is her primary carer - while working a 10hr plus job to support, with supplemental care during the day. there is no full time care. supplemental care shows up every 3 hours while he is at work to feed, clean, bathroom break, etc..anyways - flash forward to the question. i live far away, so i have not seen this behavior directly, i speak with my father 3-4 times a week, and he mentioned she seems to drool a bit, and her teeth are bothering her. so he took her in for a checkup. he has no dental insurance.during the checkup, they said many of her teeth are severely chipped. they did not do xrays, and i am not sure if she reacted to any pain from probing, but in my experience when i visit, she does not react much any more. so there is no knowledge of her being in pain, just the assumption from the drooling (which is very occasional).anyways, they recommended pulling her remaining teeth (even though they said there appears to be no inflammation), and fitting her for a denture. they estimate the cost upwards to $3-5,000. my father would pay it, if it meant he ate saw dust for a year, and taking money from me would be a front to his character - and he would never do it - i have tried on many occasions. i on the other hand want to look at this rationally. we do not know, nor can we know if she is or is not in pain, and i fear the outcome of the recovery. the dentist said ""they have dealt with many alzheimers patients before, and it should not be a problem."" they would want to put her out under gas to do the treatment.my mother is a high risk patient. she had been overweight her whole life, and due to sedentary behavior now, even with reduced intake, she is not exactly light weight. she is 61. she cannot indicate any directions, or feedback to any doctor. putting her under, and then having her recovering from a full anesthetic scares the piss out of me, because while she is non functioning in many ways - my dad works with her, and she almost feeds herself (automatic action when spoon in hand type of behavior), and he almost retrains this daily. what i have read is just the recovery from being under can disorient a person for weeks. she reacts poorly to stress scenarios (like new carers coming that she does not know, will change her outward abilities for days on end).now i also think back to my time getting wisdom teeth removed. dry socket, no straws, careful eating... these are all things that would have to be monitored for upwards to 2-6 months depending on the rate of healing, and any complications. after all of this heals, she would then have to be fit for dentures.in the end, my question is this - is it worth it? if there is pain due to a tooth ache, which we are guessing at, is it more appropriate to handle it with an anti-inflammatory like children's tylenol, and focus on seeing a gp instead, to monitor for infection, and other issues. my gut tells me that recovery and the quality of life impact would just not be worth the risk, the pain, and the challenge if we can mitigate symptoms instead.i would love thoughts, advice, experiences, anything to help us come to an appropriate decision. thank you in advance, and fuck this disease!(edited spacing of paragraphs)",,0
"as some of you may know i took over taking full time care of my wifes grandma 7 months ago.  i had a workplace injury that i'm still dealing with in court and grandma was getting bounced from house to house according to schedules.  it seemed like the right move at the time.  so far, with a few asides, everything has been okay and even the family says she's much calmer because of me.last week i managed to fulfill her dream of going home which has had it's own challenges.daughter #3 is in charge of finances and has been paying the bills to keep this place running.  she swears that the ss money and the pension that's coming in only leaves $400 a month for food, clothes, etc, after bills.  weeeelllll i've been living here for two weeks and took a look at the bills.  it's that time of the month and all.  turns out grandmas health insurance is a month overdue and so is her phone bill.  so, today, i get a bank statement in the mail.  turns out grandma gets about $1500 a month.  doing the math from the phone bill and the insurance and having owned a couple of places and a few houses i can estimate what the other bills might be it appears that daughter #3 has been pocketing anywhere from $600 to $800 a month while i've been doing the full time care for $400 (this includes food, clothes, etc..  in the interim daughter #3 bought a new car and her sons suddenly have new iphones with unlimited plans.  daughter #3 is in for a very rude awakening as soon as i get everything together.  her mother needs care a hell of a lot more than she needs that car and her kids need cell phones.i know.. watch the legalities.  i'm very familiar with the court systems thanks to two divorces etc.. but stealing from your family is just wrong when your mother needs help, you've turned her over to someone else to care for, and you're using the funds for luxury items.",,0
"my dad is 67 years old and has been living with what's in my opinion the very worst disease humanity has ever known- aphasia- for about four years now. the word aphasia might not be familiar to some of you, so let me enlighten you: it renders a person unable to communicate. what exactly does that entail? besides mixing up words, forgetting them, flipping them around, turning them inside-out and using them the wrong way, your ability to gesture (and respond to gestures) dissipates. observing him on a daily basis, the best analogy i can make for his situation is that of an astronaut who went for a spacewalk, but his tether broke loose and he was left floating in space for a long time before arriving on an alien planet where means of communication are completely beyond his comprehension. you can tell looking in his eyes how damn scared he is and it kills me. the man who raised me and who i loved more than anything in this world has been crumbling in front of me. the man who moved mountains and parted seas so that i could have a good life is going downhill at an exponential rate and there's not a thing i can do to stop it. his dreams-- our shared dreams-- will now never be realized... there's so much i wanted to do with him still that i'll never get to. with this disease you really do mourn the person while they're still alive. even knowing there's no cure for this, i can't accept it and have been taking it devastatingly hard from the very beginning... i just can't accept that one of the two pillars i stand on is crumbling so fast. had his diagnosis remained at 'just' your garden-variety dementia, coping would have been much easier on my mother and i... alzheimers would of been a walk in the park... but this aphasia... it rendered his ability to communicate with us-- even if just in a heavily fragmented fashion-- completely and utterly useless. he's completely unwilling to cooperate with my mother and i when we try to help him with any of a multitude of tasks... and if we're so lucky as to get him to come in the car for a trip to the doctors office he absolutely never gets out once we're there. the very few words that've stayed with him are merely profanities which he throws at anyone/anything. of course anyone would be infuriated living with this sickness so i understand it, but these words aren't descriptive ones meant to show how he feels... they just happen to be all he's been left with. the only homes designed to handle someone with a case this severe is completely out of our reach at around $11,000/month and there's no insurance that covers it or anything. frankly, i completely understand why they charge what they do as dealing with this disease is a living hell- they deserve every penny. the past few days he's been eating and drinking less than usual and exhibiting some signs of pain, but he simply won't work with us by getting in the car and letting us take him to the hospital. the paramedics downright gave up after seeing how difficult/resilient he was and suggested we get his doctor to put in order for sedatives, which seems to be the last avenue left for us to explore. it's tragic that it's come to this point just to get him to a hospital.",,0
"help! how can i get support??here’s the scenario: my mom, and her husband take care of my grandmother who has mid-late to late stage dementia. my mom is her full-time caregiver and her husband wants to take her on a short vacation (like 3 days or so) to take a break and recharge from the exhausting job she has caring for my grandmother. my uncle who lives upstairs from them (it’s a 2 family house) travels for work and everyone else in the area isn’t available/ or isn’t skilled enough to get my grandma through the day... other than checking to see if she’s safe. my question is:how do you go about getting support services like a nursing assistant/ respite care that is trained in caring for people with dementia? there is a bit of a language barrier, and and just overall uncertainty for my mom and everyone in my grandma’s immediate circle on reaching out for help like this. think partly because my mom has just enough mental energy to get my grandma through the day. partly cultural (hispanic background - i think she feels guilt about allowing anyone that isn’t her to care for her).i’ve been able to help by sending her information to read and helping make dr. appts and finding new drs. she’s been hesitant to get a nurse because she’s worried how my grandma will behave, and thinks its going to cost absurd amounts of money. i keep trying to convince her that she must be eligible for some type of in-home care through my grandma’s medicare, but she insists she needs to go through her pcp to get help. when i called her doctors office to ask if my mom can get information on respite care, home care etc. when she brings her for a follow up - the only thing they said was that “it doesn’t hurt to ask”. it doesn’t seem like her dr is  going to give her the specific information she’s looking for. plus this follow up takes place after this supposed vacation is taking place.  also my grandfather just passed away so part of this is the stress of figuring out how to handle finances that were left for her care etc. it just seems like chaos!anyway, i’d really appreciate any suggestions, links or  feedback on how i can help my mom get a couple days off, and get a trained caregiver to take care of my grandma.i already told her that having a write up  ready with a daily schedule, behaviors to expect, things that work/ don’t work/ etc. would be necessary. but beyond that - any thoughts would be much appreciated!",,0

"hi everyone!  my mom has middle-stage alzheimers and it’s time for her to be placed in a care facility (cannot be left alone, wanders, hallucinations, combative, and so much more that is beyond our capacity to properly care for her).  my question is: how in the heck are we supposed to pay for her care?   back story: she lives in california, does not have long term care insurance, makes slightly too much in social security to qualify for medicaid without using the cost-share option. if we use the cost-share option to get her approved for medicaid, we were told she’d be disqualified from the assisted living waiver program - which does us no good.  we cannot afford $100k per year for a home (or even half of that).  does anyone have any advice or recommendations on services we can look into?  this is all new to us and we are lost.  thank you in advance!",,0
"mending the broken pieces in the summer of 2014 my mother was diagnosed with dementia. at that time she was 63 and living with my grandmother in southern california. later that year, my sister and i made the decision to bring her out to colorado to live with me, until her death in spring of 2019. i find myself today, almost 7 years since her diagnosis, at a loss, unable to grasp who she was, or what she really meant to me. i have become completely numb, totally incapable of love. not knowing how to feel things anymore. i’m never particularly happy, never particularly sad. everything is just grey. recent events in my life have finally put large cracks in the dam holding back all the emotions i have been harboring, throughout the years. knowing what i was about to face, writing this story, was always the plan. somehow i knew it’s exactly what i needed to find myself again. this is the sorry about her and what i experienced, as i start to peel back the layers, understanding them and finally taking the time feel them. to begin this story, i must capture the essence of her and the relationship we had. i was born into this world by an extraordinary woman, not only was she a god fearing moral person, she was the person that always protected me. she never deceived me. in times of confusion, she would always steer me down the right path. she was mother, she was my rock! i don’t think i can recall a time she ever yelled at me in anger. don’t get me wrong, i did get yelled at as a kid, no! david was the most common phrase in my house growing up. it was never out of anger tho, only frustration from what i had just done, or was about to do. i was a handful, always into something. turn you head for a second and i was taking something apart, climbing up on the kitchen countertop or being a ham, performing a circus act in the hallway. i was a tornado of discovery, driven by an active imagination, with enough energy to fuel a power plant. how she survived, the trials and tribulations i put her through, i will never know. all that i know is that she did it with grace. she completely knew me, inside and out and had this peaceful way to guide me. i was born with a very strong will, she must have learned early on, the only way to lead me was by example. it was always the why and never the how. what it took for her to always remain loving and clam, in the midst of the chaos, i would create. this is what makes her the most extraordinary person i have ever known. what it truly feels like to be loved by your mother, is the love you can see on her eyes the second you walk into the room. time completely stops and all you can feel is love she has for you. this is how my mother loved me. the first year i’ll never forget the moment i decided she was coming to live with me. we were on a family vacation in hawaii and i stopped by her room to check on her. she was washing her contact lenses in the the sink. she already had one in her eye while washing the other vigorously under the running water. looking at me with a puffy red, squinted eye she said, “honey, this really burns”. she was washing the contact lens in the tap water of the sink. she must have been in there for a half hour, repeating the same process. moving her away from the sink, i grabbed a hand towel and ran it under some warm water. calmly placing it over her eyes, i reassured her everything was going to be ok. we then headed to the eye doc for a last minute eye exam. we got her pair of glasses, some pain relief eye drops and were on our way. seeing my mother in panic of pain and her not knowing how to stop it, was the moment reality set in. it was very similar to the “loosing cabin pressure” sene in fight club. that moment i knew it was my job to take over. a week later, she came out to colorado. oh man did my mom love elvis, our vacation in hawaii was epic. we saw a elvis impersonator and she thought he was the real deal. it was like a time warp back to the 60’s for her. singing and dancing the whole time, she couldn’t sit still. after the show she got to meet him, we took some pictures for her and he gave her his scarf. just before we left he gave her a kiss on the cheek. she was completely glowing the rest of the trip. the scarf he gave her was wrapped around her neck or on her wrist the rest of the year. i must have washed that thing a thousand times. i tried to make everything about elvis when we got home. picked up a giant diner statue at a swap meet and tons of vinyl records. elvis was playing regularly around the house this year. there’s a 50’s diner close to my house, where we would have breakfast a couple times a week. she always had the same thing, strawberry french toast with scrambled eggs and a strawberry milkshake. i remember being very ambitious that year, i was on a mission to find a solution that will slow the progression of her disease. we went to doctor after doctor trying to get a solid plan of attack. her insurance was still a california hmo plan the and was nothing but thorn in my side. every doctor had a different opinion and they all seemed scared of their own shadows. they were all unwilling to try alternative medications or treatments i found in europe. after countless visits in multiple practices we found a young doctor willing to try something new. he had a let’s give it a try and see attitude. this was a breath of fresh air and i started to get my hopes up again. two weeks later he left the practice and we couldn’t see him anymore. we had to start all over again, that was a very depressing moment, i started smoking again that day. i was on a job site talking about my mom with a client and she turned me on to a article about peter falk. apparently peter developed early onset dementia after a dental visit and died soon after. knowing my mom suffered from periodontal disease her whole life, i scheduled a dental check up for her the next day. the appointment a the dental office went very well. the staff was amazing, i was able to stay by her side the entire time keeping her calm and making her laugh as a means of being distraction. after a panoramic x-ray, the doctor had a ton of questions. i remember the doctor thinking she had been in a horrific car accident or something. the x-rays looked like a scene from a science fiction horror movie, screws and wires everywhere. my mom had a cosmetic surgery to correct a overbite just a year before. i didn’t know how extensive it really was until that day. they also had her on a daily dose of benadryl for almost a year. with the connections to benadryl and dementia, i found during a previous hunt. i convinced myself, that’s exactly what’s to blame. i told myself this countless times and started to become angry. chain smoking a pack of cigarettes later, i realized i had created a false hope. when that hope was crushed, i just started to blame. after some deep soul searching, i remembered what i was taught growing up. my mother taught me, nothing is to be gained from anger but a battle fueled by rage. the only thing you can hope to accomplish with that mindset is, annihilation. battles are won though compassion and understanding. she would have told me, “life’s a crap shoot, there are no guarantees for anyone, just make the best with what you have and move forward.”she had another had saying, “when the going gets tough, the tough get going.” that i never really grasped it until that moment. my outlook on the situation completely changed and it only became about making the best of it. nobody is to blame, it just is. if she’s happy and safe, that’s all that matters.getting back to this mindset is exactly what i needed to be reminded of today. sometimes life beats me down and i loose site of who i am. mom and i were starting to get a routine going then. it took a couple weeks to figure it out. 7am is breakfast. she likes to have a cheese omelet with a slice of toast most days. i can usually sneak in a protein shake, if she’s hungry enough to eat the whole omelet. the nanny comes at 8:30 to give her a bath and hang out for a couple hours. that usually lasts until 10. i’d head out to work until 1 and usually come back to mom in her room changing clothes. she’ll put on everything in her closet clean or dirty. it’s very hard to keep track of the clean clothes vs the dirty ones. it’s ok for now i’ll just do laundry every day, she has fun playing dress up, i thought to myself. we usually head out to lunch around 2. there’s a local bar/restaurant that know us well. we always sit in the same spot and she always gets the same food grilled cheese and a heineken. we hang out for about 45min while i control the music form an app in my phone. she had no idea i’m doing this and gets surprised every time elvis comes on. we make it back to the house, walk around the half block to see the horses, she calls them the big dogs and finish the day with friends on tv until she’s ready for bed. it’s one of her favorites and will keep her calm if she has a beer in her hand. this routine stays relatively consistent the whole year. i start to notice little bits of her cognitive function disappearing, she looses about 10 words each week. this is pretty hard to watch unfold. conversations started with complete sentences and her, mostly aware of her surroundings. now she just has a few little phrases to describe everything and no idea where she is. i first started to pay close attention to the decline when we were brushing our teeth in the main bathroom together. i handed her a toothbrush with some paste on it. i always make a quick joke. this time it was, now this isn’t for your nose. that one always made her laugh. this time she didn’t, she instead smeared the paste all over her face. looking at her completely confused, it felt like my heart hit the floor. it took everting i had to keep it together. i called her a silly goose and said, that’s not supposed to go there, as i washed her face with a towel. i was completely overwhelmed by sadness. i smoked a couple cigarettes in the garage and continued on with the day. that was the first year. i’ll post more in the comments as i write about it.",,0
"hi, i'm new to this group. my grandma was diagnosed with vascular dementia about 5 years ago, but in the last 2 years it has really progressed dramatically. in addition, she broke her left hip 1 year ago, had surgery and made a nearly full recovery in terms of walking and mobility, but this past september broke her right hip after another fall. her recovery from this surgery has made everything significantly worse. she is mostly incontinent now. she used to just have accidents like wetting her depends over night, however she consistently has accidents day and night now. bowel incontinence as well. which inevitably leads to frequent uti's, and when she has a uti she almost always ends up having a few tia episodes. her walking is incredibly shakey, even with a walker, and there are days where she can barely take a few steps. she lives with my mom and i, and we're just getting exhausted. it's so draining, emotionally, physically, and mentally. every morning its a hassle to get her out of bed, changed, cleaned before we go to work. pre-covid, she used to attend an adult day center however obviously they have been closed since march with no signs of reopening soon. so we are going through the nj personal preference program to have a caregiver get paid through her insurance program however they only approved about 30 hours a week for her. weekends are really hard on my mom and i. it's taking a massive toll on my mom and she is 61. i worry about her a lot because of thsi. shes not of the greatest health either, having gotten a terrible 2 month bout of pancreatitis last year, and a repeat attack this past october which lead to her diagnosis being chronic. the worst part is, sometimes, i wish my grandma would just be able to pass away peacefully. she's had such a beautiful life surrounded with so much love, happiness, accomplishments, and amazing memories. she's like a shell of herself now. and i know its making my mom resent her at times. i don't know what i'm looking for in writing this, i guess it's had to vent this out to friends when they don't really understand. and i don't know if it is really feasible for us to put her in a facility. in mexican culture, it's like unheard of, to just drop a loved one off somewhere to live out their days. i also would never want her to feel neglected or abandoned, or not be cared for well. but i also don't know that what we are currently doing now is sustainable or healthy for anyone. our shower is upstairs and its getting harder and harder to get her up the stairs, and it's stressful being responsible for her when she's such a fall risk all the time. anyways. any advice or input is appreciated from people experiencing similar situations. thanks :(",,0
"i'm sort of just looking for a place to vent. it's been a few years since my father was originally diagnosed with dementia. originally they diagnosed him with depression, as that can have memory effects and he definitely was depressed. he's 65 and was in the navy in the mid 1970s, working in the engine room of an aircraft carrier. then went on to be a mechanic for automobiles. we think some of this exposure to chemicals/fumes, as well as head injuries is possibly part of what could have caused the dementia to come on so strongly at such a young age. (his father did have dementia, so it possibly is genetic; we could not afford the testing to find out if it is, so we don't really know.)the reason my mother (his caregiver) made the decision to bring him somewhere he could get professional care is she has to work (obviously) and they live out in a very rural area on a mountain in the forest. it isn't necessarily safe for him to be alone in that environment. near the end she would find him just standing outside in the backyard staring at seemingly nothing. he's moved in now to a home specializing in dementia at an advanced stage, and is apparently settling in pretty well. unfortunately, because of covid, we have been unable to see him since my mother first dropped him off at the va hospital. my mother and eldest sister are having a short window visit with him on friday, and i'm hoping to be able to video chat in and at least talk to him. the last time i got to see him was in july. my sister had a small wedding ceremony with just family. (all outside, masks worn, about 20people max). i want to be able to see him in person, but i'm afraid of crying in front of him. i don't want him to feel bad, or get upset. but also, i can't help but feel that it's so unfair. i'm only 24, and my father of 65 is in a home for dementia. it's not fair for him. it's not fair for my mother. my sisters. my nieces and nephews. and i'm more upset at the fact that the united states likes to show face that they love and care about veterans, but when it really comes down to it, they still get the shit end. even with va benefits this home is a little over $100 a day. his social security check covers it thankfully, but only leaves a small amount left over. hes getting excellent care there which is what we want, but it's so expensive. and now my mom is having a hard time with insurance and all that stuff, because he technically still ""lives"" with her, so they ""make too much"" for certain benefits. i'm angry, and bitter, but mostly i just miss my dad.",,0
"let's just say, i've had a very troubled relationship with my father for the past 40 years.  won't go into all the details, but i had written him off as my father because of how toxic he is.  fast forward to summer of 2019 and he was diagnosed with dementia/alzheimer's.  he lived by himself for the last 20 years and is fiercely independent!  through this time we saw his mental health start slipping more and more.  wife and i talked for hours, but finally reached the conclusion, that we should offer for him to stay with us instead of going to an assisted living facility.  we wanted to give him some dignity before being moved to assisted living/memory care once he becomes more than we can handle.  after months and months of offering, notes from the doctors, false commitments and one walk about.  we finally moved him in this past sunday.  now i have to deal with him, my wife that is being a non-paid teacher for our two kids and my home office.  it it still very difficult to just go with it and not challenge him about all his lies and nonsense.  it truly is one of his worst traits, lying about everything.  this has been one of his biggest issues from early on and dementia has made it worse.  my sister and i have been working behind the scenes to get financial power of attorney (sister) and i was made medical power of attorney way back in 2005 (did not know).  he would say all is good with his finances, but then the notices started coming in for missing payments.  last thing we wanted is for him to loose his house since he only owes $26k.  auto payments for everything were setup!  i have already cancelled his cable (never watched) and internet which will save him over $200 a month.  now have to go through household stuff and have estate sale so we can get house cleaned and put up for sale.  thanks for listening to my rant!",,0
"greetings everyone,i've been a lurker here for about a year now and i want to start with how much strength you all have given me through sharing your perspectives, stories, thoughts and advice.  thank you.i've gotten to the point where i think it's my turn because gosh darn it, i need help.  that was hard.  my apologies if this turns out being long, i'll do my best to keep it concise and short-ish.hindsight is always 20/20, so i try to not be too hard on myself about this.  i think it all started about 4 or 5 years ago.  my mom had a small stroke and it's been a slow decline since then.  i've been suspicious something might be wrong for a long while but always tossed it up to, and was told by others when i asked,  ""she's getting old, this is normal"".  she's 84 by the way.  about a ago my wife and i were forced to move in with them for a month, we live in texas and the freeze hit us hard, made us homeless, so we needed a month to get our living situation restored.  during this month my fears about my mom's condition became undeniable.  i'd get into particulars but i'm trying to avoid a super long post.  suffice it to say, emotions all over the place, unable to stay on task, can't think of words or phrases, confusing things like memories with tv shows, you get the idea.so a approach my mom and dad about my concerns,  my mom became very defensive, offended, aggressive, now she's convinced that my wife steals from her.  keep in mind this has been going on for almost a year now.  their finances are a mess and my mom, who used to be in charge of that, refuses to listen to any advice i have.  they live in filth and get offended when we try to help them clean.my dad knows i think.  but i think he's too afraid to confront her about this considering how nasty she's become so he provides a united front against my wife and i for mom's sake.now, it seems like they don't even want us to visit anyore.  i feel like we've been shut out.  disowned.  it hurts.i don't know what to do.  nobody else i know seems to either.please.  i'm desperate for advice i can work with.sorry for the long post.  i'm going to go cry now.",,0
"so.....i just wanted to see if anyone has any thoughts about this.  and i'm sorry this is long, i just found this sub and i need to tell someone about this.  i'm pretty sure my mother (74) has started down this road.  she refuses to get any test for it, to the point that i'm not brining it up anymore because every time i do she starts screaming at me.  anyways.  this started about a year ago, it kinda snuck up on me.  she would call me (she lives on the east coast usa and i live in the western usa) -- anyways she would call me and ask me to help her balance her checkbook.  she was having trouble with basic addition and subtraction (something she was always good at, she was faster at it than me using a calculator.)  this went on for a while until we determined it was time for me to have access to her finances.  making a long story short, i now have access to everything. she pays some of the bills and i pay the rest.  it hasn't been too bad for a while, save her writing an extra check to her car insurance company for a completely random amount of money -- like $359.26 or something (her premium is $115 a month and had already been paid.)  she had no recollection of writing the check and only when i went into her bank account, brought up an image of the check written in her handwriting and printed it out and sent it to her would she believe me.  not to mention that check put her account into the negative -- i had to use my money to pull it out of the red.  she's set to take an airplane trip soon (i'm dreading that) -- i typed up the entire itinerary for her, dates and times and when to be there....everything.  she's set to leave on the 22nd.  multiple times she's asked me, ""now, what day do i leave again?  the 16th?  is it after christmas?  -- ""no, mom it's the 22nd"" -- ""the 22nd???  you never said that.....""  --  ""mom where did you put the itinerary i sent you?"" -- ""itinerary??"" ...........  about 2 weeks ago she called me at 4 o'clock in the morning, i just happened to be awake so i answered it and she said she was tearing her apartment apart looking for her phone.  looking under her mattress, took all the cushions out of the sofa and chairs.......i said ""mom, your phone is in your hand.  you're using it.""  ---  ""well i know that, but i'm telling you i can't find my phone!!""  i honestly didn't even know what to say.  i think i just changed the subject.  another thing she does is call me for a certain reason but once i answer the phone at some points she starts talking quieter -- almost to herself -- i have to say  ""so what's the reason you called me again?"" -- ""oh yea i wanted to know \_\_\_\_\_"" -- the quiet mumbling also goes into odd tangents..... tonight she called me to ask if i could help her book a doctors appointment (which, when she wasn't explaining it fully and i asked her again she got mad at me).......somehow in this ""conversation"" she ended up talking about my cousin (her niece) who died  in a car accident in 1973.   i forget everything else that was said except when she said ""i'm not dealing with this anymore.  goodbye""  and hung up on me.  at which point i picked up an object in my room hurled it against the wall screaming every 4 letter word you can imagine and then broke down in tears.  but then, other times things are fine.  (relatively.)  i never expected this was what would happen to my mother.  physically, for a 74 year old, she's fine.  i take more meds than she does.  and honestly.......i just don't know.  i'm an only child and she's been divorced since she was pregnant with me.  so guess who is stuck with handling everything?  and, god forgive me, i resent the everlasting hell out of it.  i'll have no one to help me.  my family is fully of selfish assholes, nobody talks to anybody, so i can forget that.  it's all on me.  being as i'm her son rather than a daughter changes the dynamic somewhat if it gets to the point of needing help in the bathroom or such -- we'll have to get a nurse or something because i'm not moving back to where she is (where i grew up.)  i don't even know what i'm asking here but for anyone who got to this point, thanks for reading..",,0
"my mom is 47, and so shes going through menopause and forgetting things. she owns a business, though, that is doing extremely well. she does finances for it and such and is still excellent at her job. a few years ago she began taking a medication that she said affected her sense of memory. she has also been stressed lately because my brother and i are both failing classes, our dog died, she went through surgery, etc. all these things, i think, can be a reason for her memory loss--which is the only reason her doctor told her to get checked. but my mom seems totally fine with everyday tasks, she just has word association issues and occasional forgetfulness. if her doctor told her to get checked, is he just trying to be safe or does that mean she probably has it?",,0

"just a rant, pease skip if you want to. i am scared. i am 30. my mother is 56. still situationally intelligent, coherent but her self has shrunk, her eyes are increasingly primal. she is just about to enter a stage where things may begin to slide. she knows i have said it to her that she is loosing her memory, personality and may have dementia. but she is increasingly unaware of that now. she is showing signs of it more obviously like asking the same question twice. i need to have a sit down with her tomorrow to talk about finances and future going forward. i will have to mention why i'm talking about this so seriously and dementia will come up. i cannot image what she will go through knowing she cannot stop her self fading.  my only friend in the whole world is going away. in front of my eyes. my father is extremely greedy and complete sociopath and will see this as an opportunity to grab from her whatever he can. need to discuss that too with her.much growing up to do in a short period of time for me. wish me luck and fortitude.",,0
my lo has parkinson’s disease and moderate dementia with hallucinations +at least 5 other conditions being managed. he’s in assisted living. my sister and i take care of his finances as a team. our brother who doesn’t want to come to reality falls for getting guilted by our lo regularly. lo is extremely paranoid about his money but was no longer capable of managing it(ie…literally almost lost everything because he never opened the mail) he never remembers anything he tell him about his finances and tries to interrogate our brother and convince him we’re withholding info. in addition to that well meaning friends of his who keep in contact via the phone who also don’t understand the disease process like to tell him things that get him riled up and add to his paranoia. he usually forgets it all fairly quickly but it can’t be good for his brain to keep being reminded that he’s not in control/capable of managing his life anymore. i’m sure others have experienced similar situations and i would be grateful to anyone willing to share their experiences and solutions.,,0
"crosspost from r/alzheimershello everyone,i am in a bit of a jam.my grandmother stopped driving about 4 years ago. her driver's license has expired in that time. does anyone know how or what i can do to get a new form of id for her?i have a durable power of attorney for her in order to manage her finances and bills. is there anything i can do myself without trying to drag her into a state id facility? i doubt she would be able to answer any questions... she has deteriorated quite a lot in the past few months. i assume to even get a state id you have to answer questions...documents of hers i do currently have:social security cardexpired licencepoa signed by her as well as mei might be able to get a copy of her birth certificate... though i am unsure.i am just kind of stressing out, because i only realized today she has no ""real"" form of picture id and this may be come a big problem later.thank you all for any help, and i hope you are doing as well as possible. the holidays can be a hard time for people affected by this terrible illness.",,0

"a little over 18 months ago my father landed in the hospital.   eventually got a dementia diagnosis.  he'd apparently been compensating for well over a year.  medications were a mess,  finances were a mess, etc.  i was named power of attorney,  it was determined he could no longer live alone,  and assisted living was found. fast forward-he's increasingly agitated,  angry,  trying to leave his facility.  i can't deal with it any more-the phone calls from the facility, nurses,  doctors, him.   most recently he went to a nearby hospital for a 10 day psych eval/med adjustment, after trying to walk away 3 days in a row.  i visited him there 2 days ago, where he was adamant  he wasn't going back to his facility, there was no need for him to be in a hospital, he needed no meds,  and it was my fault. just got a phone call from the hospital.   he's fine,  they put him in a cab to go back to assisted living.   it's been 4 days. i'm seriously considering seeing about having him made a ward of the state.   i know it sounds selfish, but i can't take it.   thanks for letting me vent.edit, missed word.",,0
"my mother is 57 and has been showing signs of memory loss among other things for over a year. it started off as just general laziness and forgetfulness but it's been progressively getting worse. she forgets entire conversations, repeats the same stories and facts to me on a daily basis, eats terribly (never cooks, and if she does she forgets the food and it burns). she is also to put this bluntly extremely lazy and has a hoarding mentality. &amp;nbsp;she wants to move from our house to a bungalow because she has a bad back from an accident a few years ago. with the help of my partner i've been doing all i can to clean the place up and get it presentable for sale. she does extremely little to help and will just push junk around from place to place and hide it from me so i don't throw it away. when i point out that she, for example; doesnt need 10 ceramic jugs and that have been hidden away, with no sentimental value or purpose, she will deflect addressing the question of "" do you need all of these? "" and try to either insult me, or point out how i've got say, a letter near the same spot that's mine ( of course this is her trying to say, if your crap is here mine can be too! ) i think this stems from a extreme attempt at 'saving money' as she will try to justify keeping anything in a specific order of; &amp;nbsp;&gt; i was going to use that for x, y, z&gt;that's not mine it was nans ( my nan of course, )&gt; oh i like it&gt; that was from when x, y , z happened x amount of years ago. &amp;nbsp;all of which as you can see, have no real solid basis on why keeping a large variety of dusty cermic jugs make sense. &amp;nbsp;as well as the forgetfullness and hoarding i am expected to do everything financial for her. she forgot to get vehicle tax for 9 months this year, because i didn't do it for her. (i wasn't even aware she forgot about this because she usually does it at the post office). i'm expected to set up everything online, do her car insurance, transfer money, set up direct debits, order items etc, it's gotten to the point where i've even had to do certain training courses for her work for her, not to mention she doesn't even know how much money she has in any of her bank accounts. she has a pension lump sum, and a few savings accounts and i'm in full control of them all and am the sole one who knows how much is in each one. if i hadn't taken this firm stance into knowing the financial details no doubt she would continue to waste money on her hoarding habits, at least this way i can try to dictate her how best to spend her money in order to secure a better house in the future with as much captial left for anything post-purchase. &amp;nbsp;she even got a laptop and promised to learn herself but everytime i tried to teach her she would make little effort and look away from the screen. i even wrote down instructions but she just refuses to learn anything for herself,  the same goes for anything new, including basic things such as car insurance comparison, i'm expected to do it, otherwise she'll leave it and she'll pay more money by staying with the same company, a very strange contrast of behaviour considering how incredibly greedy and frugal she can be. &amp;nbsp;one of the worst examples of her 'greedy' nature is whenever our dog has to go to the vets and there is a price tag attached that she isn't expecting, the first reaction is never ever about the dog's wellbeing, it is always about "" how much do you cost me "", "" i could have gone on holiday with how much you cost "" all in a polite sarcastic voice toward the dog, but this on top of her other frugal behaviour makes it obvious deep down she resents taking financial responsibilty for him. &amp;nbsp;i feel sorry for her because she knows deep down she is having problems but at the same time she has been very abusive to me when i was a child, so i'm now finding it extremely hard to put up with all the pressure she puts on me to live her life for her. i wouldn't mind so much but she expects me to do her things for her and is horrible if i do not do them in the time she wants them done in (when she actually remembers). i'm finding it extremely difficult to help her as she just expects me to live her life for her so she can sit in front of the tv and just sail through life. &amp;nbsp;i've tried on numerous occasions to get her to realise she is having problems and seek help but she is in complete denial and ends up being horrible and upsets me to get me off her case. i'm coming to my wits end trying to help someone that cannot even listen to me respectfully. at this point if i had the funds to move out and leave i would not hessitate. i've been considering going to the doctors and asking them to speak to her, but she would no doubt punish me at a later date for this. any advice is greately appreciated as i have 0 experience dealing with this, all i know is that i can't keep living like this.",,0
"my grandpa was diagnosed with dementia a little less than a year ago. he's a very strong, independent person and just refuses help from anyone. when i try to talk to him about allowing people to help him he just says thing like ""i don't want my brain to go to mush, when you start letting people do things for you then you start to die quicker."" i tried explaining to him that it's not true but no matter what you say he just refuses help in anyway.the things i'm worried most about is his medication. almost every single day he forgets to even eat dinner or he forgets what he was doing 10 minutes ago. i feel like if he can't even remember that, then how can he be remembering to take his pills or he could even forget he took the pills and take them twice.another issue is his finances. as far as i know (he's very secretive about his money) he doesn't really have any bills to pay besides maybe his insurance. but he still gets social security/has some oil stocks. he lives with us and we provide him with all his meals, but lately over the past few months he always seems completely out of money. he calls the bank a lot and i overhear him talking to them. when i bring it up he just says the ""market is really bad right now"" and never goes into detail.my family really doesn't know what to do with him. he refuses to let us help him in anyway, he snaps at us randomly for no reason (which is very uncharacteristic of him), he randomly has dreams that we were mean to him or told him to do certain things that we never told him to do.it's really difficult, we don't want to put him in a home or anything like that because he's lived with us for 20+ years, but we just don't know what to do with him. hoping somebody here knows about what we could do to make things better.",,0
"so today, i got a call from grandpa, who wanted my dad to go over to his house to explain his finances. my dad is in charge of his father's finances, has been for about two years now since grandpa cannot be trusted with his own money. he was scammed twice and lost a lot of his money. a few times, he sold some of his stocks without discussing it with my dad or uncle as he has this belief that he has no money, even though he has a comfortable level of finances. my dad goes over to my grandpa's, thinking that this wouldn't take long. he stays for about three hours and misses his telecon meeting because grandpa was arguing with him on his finances. this has been a problem with grandpa for many years now, but he just can't seem to leave it alone. dad comes home angry and has a yelling fit. he and his father seem to have a strained relationship as grandpa raised his children in a rather abusive household. this may have resulted in dad's anger problems as he would go off if one little thing upsets him. i have been living in constant fear of my dad because he is like a raging bull at times. he has never struck anyone, but his yelling does terrify others. i'm guessing that dad's anger problems are pushing him and his father further apart. could use some help.",,0
"my father in law has dementia. he’s in the early stages, but seems to be declining rather quickly. he was a banker for his entire life and my husband found out from his mother today that he’s no longer doing the bills correctly. they’ve been hit with late fees from a few places and he’s lost bills. this is seriously a huge deal for them - not because of the late fees or lost bills, but because he can’t do this extremely normal and every day task anymore. this was his life. it would be like if a pro basketball player could no longer dribble a ball. i don’t think he’s going to give this task up easily, but it has to happen. he has handled the family finances forever. my mil could take the reins, but she’s very sick too with diabetes that she’s struggling to control. we’ve been fighting for them to get in-home help for about a year. they refused. then covid hit and they even nixed the cleaning lady. we live 4 hours away. he’s an only child. how do we do this? can my husband take over finances from afar? should we try to find some in-home help? we’re worried about covid in that case, though. we are debating moving, but my husband hasn’t been able to find a job in our hometown. we’re lost. any advice would be so appreciated.",,0

"my husband is about 70 years. he still works as an attorney, handles our taxes and finances and seems competent doing so. over the last two years he has become a presumably racist trumpy and this is a definite behavioral change. our daughter has written him off completely for a very particular reason. he has refused ( i choose this word purposely) to  remember details of her life. he questions her repeatedly about minor things, gets answers and forgets them. her last straw happened at a christmas eve dinner where he once again ignored her previous answers but remembered every intimate detail of his good friend's life. the fact is the fellow is a blowhard. he enjoys being the center of conversation. he waits for a pause in order to interject and take over any conversation. i doubt he really cares about or processes the information he gets from other people, at least not in any long term way. as an attorney he needs to listen to clients so i know he is capable of doing so. i have been diabetic for nearly ten years. we have had hundreds of conversations about what i can and can't eat. when i came home last night he said he saw my medication on the counter and asked me if i was diabetic. now i know how my daughter feels. i'm outraged. is it possible he has ignored every conversation for nearly ten years. knowing him, yes i think it's possible, but really? is dementia sporadic? does it effect only a few areas of life before becoming more global? i should add that a few years ago i had him evaluated by a neurologist and nothing organic was found. the neurologist (who is also a friend) said it's possible he's just an asshole.",,0

"my mother had a recent test score of 20 (up from 17 a few months prior but it was late afternoon when she took the first assessment) she's in a retirement facility and still living independent, although we got her a medacube for meds disbursement and there's a daily wellness check-in and one good meal in her plan (right now).  on the testing scale, she is at moderate cognitive impairment.  she has a neurologist.  he has her on donepezil and just started her on a tiny dose of prozac.  i can see that she is slowly losing ground with her memory loss, but has not had any changes in personality besides the normal confusion of not remembering any new information.  her mri shows the typical narrowing of the ""memory centers"" in her brain.  at what point do we get some type of official diagnosis beyond moderate cognitive impairment?  she can ""age in place"" and we can bump up her level of care as she needs it.  but how do we know when she needs it?  she's almost to the point where she can't remember when she's having problems...i don't want to wait until something hurtful happens to her, and i thought having a diagnosis might help us decide on when she needs more help.  another reason we need a diagnosis is that she has a really decent long term care insurance plan that will pay quite a bit of her housing and care once she has some sort of official diagnosis.  i don't know how they find out what is causing the dementia and memory loss and what is causing it?",,0
"**tl;dr:  75 year old parent with short term memory loss is constantly wearing our patience thin and causing us to lose sleep and a bit of our own sanity.  need advice for next steps.**for the last decade we have shared our home with my 75 year old mother in law. she is blind in one eye (glaucoma i think) and takes prescription eyedrops.   she also takes cholesterol and blood pressure medicine.    she is also diabetic.unsurprisingly, she has been increasingly forgetful over recent years.   often bringing up the same gossipy topics at dinner time that we often don’t care to hear again -- not even the first time.  her vision required a family member to take her wherever.   but around the house she had been relatively independent.    cooked her own meals, sometimes for us as well.   generally ate what we ate as long as it wasn’t too spicy or salty or whatever.when she feels a headache, she instinctually self-checks her bp (digital tabletop omron) so a few weeks ago she caught a 200-over-something reading and she was taken to the er.   there they found her sodium levels were very low.  so she spent a week in the hospital.  and the whole time she was calling my wife’s home literally every hour.  “they haven’t fed me.”  (yes they did.)   “what pills do i take?” (the hospital is giving them to you.)  they had to put a “safety nurse” in her room to keep her from getting out of bed unnecessarily and escorting her to the bathroom.  after sodium iv’s and pills, eventually her sodium got back to normal and a week later she was discharged but transferred to a physical therapy place to work on her walk -- which over the years has been more of a shuffle, i assume due to her decreasing eye sight.  but not even 2 days into what was going to be a multi-week stay at the facility, she was frustrated at not being fed (she was) and not getting her medicines (she was).    she exercised her “patient’s rights” and basically checked herself out.  my wife picked up her up the next day. it’s been a living hell at home ever since.every morning we now give some of her pills and eye drops because we don’t want her to self-administer multiple times due to her memory.   then we give her the others in the evening.   and throughout the day she will call (her room is on the other end of the home -- by design)  or she’ll come upstairs (to our bedroom/home office) and ask “where are my pills?”  “we gave them to you this morning” “are you sure? because i feel like i haven’t taken them.  why don’t you say while i’m taking them ‘mom, here is this pill, that pill, etc’”     “that’s exactly what we do.”  sometimes it ends there.  other times it ramps up:   “well i don’t think you are giving them to me…why are you holding my medicine? i don’t want a stroke.  i don’t want to go blind.  give them to me.  you’re killing me.  don’t make me call the police.  you can’t do this to me...”   last week she went to her pcp for a post-hospital follow-up and they did a basic memory test.  something to the effect of “can you recall the three words you were asked to  remember earlier?” to which she then asked my wife who took her to the appointment, “what words? was i supposed to remember?”   so the pcp prescribed donepezil and vitamin e pills, and we are praying they actually do something.  though from what i’ve read, even if it does, it doesn’t help much after a year or two.  and everyone’s experience here seems to vary wildly.on reading this to myself, i admit it comes off like we are simply tired of bearing her burdens and are horrible children/in-laws.   we do our best to put ourselves in her shoes -- being a generation older, once in charge of our lives, then suddenly told that our perception of the truth (i.e. not being given medicine) is wrong.  but being berated exacts a toll on us as well.  even just having to repeat for literally the 50th time in a day that “yes, you took your pills and eyedrops, yes we know you don’t remember this is why you write it down.  what paper?  the paper by the whiteboard where we list all your medicines.  no you cannot keep your pill bottles. because you can’t remember anything and you might keep taking them.”  my wife recently had a baby which was already a strain.  ironically having the in-law live with us was a boon at first, but now she is basically one more child to contend with, and frankly more difficult than any of the real children we have.  my own grandmother developed alzheimers late in her life, and i saw the toll it had on her, my mother, and her siblings and their families.   so as much i feel a prisoner in the present, i dread the future of escorting her to her bathroom, keeping her from eating napkins at the dinner table, and having to (re) child-proof all the entryways into the home.  we were looking forward to welcoming a new pet (or even another child) to the family at some point, but that feels like a distant dream now with our plate of responsibility.financially, the in-law has retirement savings, my late father in-law’s pension, and presumably a very good health insurance plan.  my wife and i know very little of the other programs (medicaid? medicare? social security?) to understand how that would help with future care.i desperately want a return to sanity -- for all of us.  i want to work at home without getting “triggered” when i hear the in-law dialing the cordless phone because 99 times out of 100 she’s going to call us to ask about her medicine.     i want to relax at night and not be triggered by the lights in the hallway coming on because i know she’s going to beg for her pills that she doesn’t remember we gave her hours ago and threaten to call the police if we don’t hand the pill bottle over. for the first time since covid started, i actually want to leave my house to work in a cube and bear all the annoyances of office life instead of working from the comfort of my home -- just to not hear this broken record chipping away at my own sanity.   but that’s not fair to my wife who will now have two babies to tend to.i recognize this is my wife’s mother we’re talking about.  and my wife deserves a lot of credit for putting up with the bulk of the in-law’s repeated questions, criticisms, and lapses.   but she will go back to her own work and career soon once maternity is over.  and while she’s also work-from-home due to covid, it’s bound to revert to the old fashioned office sooner or later, and then who will care for her mother and listen to her fret every 15 minutes over pills she doesn’t remember already taking.police threats aside, this past winter  she almost blew up our house (with my pregnant wife inside) by not closing one of the gas stove top  burners completely.   thank goodness for that rotten egg smell they put in it and that i came home in time to catch it.  my wife didn’t even smell it upstairs.    we’ve since installed a natural gas leak detector.  and then there are the recurring issues.  misplacing her eye glasses, her egg timer, her necklace (why did it move from her jewelry box in the first place? she rarely goes anywhere since covid.  we would find pools of water inside pots and pans in the cupboard that we know she “washed.”like all in-laws she also has a penchant for telling us how to parent and being horribly out of date with all the latest best-practices (on her back, not her belly.   no water, only milk/formula).  and while she’s stubborn about that, her new “mindset” if you will is the last straw, even if it’s not her fault.  many of her other faults i chalk up to just being a product of a different time.  but under it all was/is this thoughtful, kind, generous woman.  and while she’s in arguably an early phase (she has not seen a specialist to get an official diagnosis) my wife and i and other family agree that a memory care facility seems to be a logical next step.my wife has had the “nursing home” talk with her, and she of course is hesitant.  after all, during the day when she’s not pestering us about things she forgot 5 minutes ago, she can still talk on the phone with her few friends/family, operate her tv, etc.  she will proudly pass our pop quiz about who she talked to 5 minutes ago, but not remember what medicines she takes and when.    instead the in-law insists on bringing someone in to help in the house.  but that seems pointless and besides the point.  it will be a replay of the hospital/therapy situation where she thinks this person is withholding her food or medicine, and she’ll just blow up our cell phones anyway.  especially if that person comes in, does their thing, then leaves to care for the next client.  and it won’t do anything for her nighttime trips upstairs, begging for medicine, threats to call the police, etc.i’m reaching out to this community for suggestions, resources, next steps.   she goes back for a follow-up with the pcp to see if those memory pills helped.  but that’s a long 4 weeks from now.  we are trying to get a visit w/ a neurologist sooner than that.   my in-law’s sister’s family (in another state) has offered to have her stay for a couple weeks, but even that is a long two weeks away and is just a temporary reprieve.  i don’t know what else to do. i wish we could take the in-law to the hospital and say this time don’t send her home til her mind is whole again, but we can’t.   or take the in-law to a nursing home against her wishes, but we can’t.  we’re trapped in this living hell.i hope this was readable.   honestly, i feel like we all need help now, and at least i get to vent to an audience that can perhaps relate.   i guess we’re specifically interested in how to cope with this, who else to talk to, how to pay for memory care (if that’s the right place for her to be), etc.thanks for reading and thanks in advance for your help.",,0
"i am a long time lurker, but first time poster. i have no idea if this is allowed here, i need advice on how to approach my mom and brother concerning my dad who has apparent dementia, but is undiagnosed. my dad’s cognitive state has been in decline for some time now and i live three states away and each time i see him, he is getting worse. my mom is unsympathetic and has very little patience. my dad has been semi-retired for about 10 years, and my mom just recently retired within the last month. now that they’re both retired full time, it’s painfully obvious that my dad has seriously declined now that he has someone around to observe him more hours of the day. they somehow made a cross country drive to visit me here in colorado from arkansas. i have no idea how they made it out here because my dad typically does the driving and my mom has to be the navigator. my mom has reported that his driving is erratic, and she had to remind him multiple times of where to turn. they will be staying here for three weeks. just in the last week, my dad has gotten lost in my small rural community and had to ask for directions to find my apartment even though i live just down the street from their hotel. he has no idea which direction the major cities are from our location. as a result, i’m genuinely concerned about how they will get back to arkansas on their own and my 17 year old daughter is going with them for the return trip to stay with them for two weeks before flying back to colorado in august. she knows the way as she’s taken the trip with me multiple times, but it’s unrealistic to entrust her with getting them back to arkansas on her own. other concerns include:1. he frequently talks to himself with full blown loud vocal conversations. 2. he will completely forget a conversation from just 15 minutes prior. 3. has a lack of self-awareness (he tried to give a partially earn hamburger to my neighbor’s dog until i told him no).4. he has difficulty comprehending complex conversations and scheduled road closures. 5. he forgets important dates and often enters them incorrectly on his phone. 6. he forgets common information such as how wifi and cellular data and hot spots work when he previously understood how this works7. his conversations are very circular in which he will ask the same questions that have been previously answered. 8. he acts very childish at times such as trying to randomly pick a fight with me over the dumbest things and will latch on to it until he “wins the argument.”9. i seriously think he’s functioning on a level of about a 10-13 year old. 10. he has difficulty getting around and refuses to take care of his health. he shuffles around like a penguin when he walks. 11. when my daughter got upset, she excused herself to her room to cool off, my mom and i had to explain to him that she went to her room and he had no recollection of this. 12. he frequently gets choked on his food which signals swallowing concerns that can be deadly. we have had a previous incident in our family in which my maternal grandfather confused the gas pedal for the break pedal and drove into a building killing an infant a few years ago and looking back on that we realized we should have taken the keys from my grandfather at least a year or more before this happened. i am scared that we could be setting ourselves up for another incident like this with my dad if we don’t take some action soon. does anyone here have any advice on how to approach this subject with my family? i foresee that we will need to have a serious conversation about this within the next few months where my dad can checked out by a medical doctor to get an official diagnosis, and to eventually take his drivers license away before someone gets killed. this is hard for me because my mom is unsympathetic and my brother doesn’t seem to want to get involved. my relationship with my parents is testy at best. long-term care isn’t an option due to my parents finances and doing so would likely mean selling my parents land and house to afford a nursing home. as quickly as my dad is declining, i suspect that he will need around the clock care within the next 3-5 years.",,0
"i'm posting this 10% to vent, 90% for advice.  and i have a habit of analyzing things from a cool, calculating perspective......but don't let that make you think i don't love my father.  i think in this calculating way to keep myself from breaking down and crying.i feel like my father is --this-- close to being shipped off to a nursing home.  on the one hand, i feel that it will be necessary, but on the other hand, it seems like such a waste, since he is still able to enjoy many parts of his life.  maybe there's some better way.a little background:  dad and i are basically best friends.  we've always spent multiple days per week together (even while living an hour's drive apart), and we've always had similar interests and wanted to do the same things together.he is 81, has some physical health issues but they seem to all be under control.  i know these things are hard to predict, but i expect his brain to (further) fail before his body does.  and.......i hate to hear myself say this......i think it would be for the best if somehow his body could fail before his mind fully tortures him.in my non-professional opinion, his dementia is at state 6.  he knows who his family members are, most of the time.....except when it's night.  he can bathe, dress, and eat, with careful supervision.  he cannot cook, clean, or manage his finances in any way.he has a long-term live-in girlfriend who has now become his primary caretaker by default.  she is cold and unkind, and is never willing to have a discussion about her way of doing things......but on the other hand, her way is the right way about 90% of the time, which is pretty good.  she takes him to all of his doctor's appointments, follows (most of) the doctors' recommendations, and takes care of both his house (cleaning, gardening, light maintenance) as well as all of his basic needs (food, bathing, laundry).  she manages his money and keeps the bills paid and the house stocked with groceries.  by day, dad and i can get in the car and go for long rides, and while we don't do all the things we used to do (he gets bad anxiety in large retail environments, always feels cold outside even if it's slightly chilly), we're still able to do quite a lot-----we spend a lot of time driving around in the car, he can handle small, simple, quiet restaurants, he can handle a quick trip to a convenience store if i need to buy a thing or two.  he can carry on a simple, pleasant conversation with waitstaff and gas station clerks (most of the time).by night, he's someone else.  he gets out of bed to urinate every ten minutes non-stop for several hours, often getting confused in the bathroom and needing help.  then he sleeps for a couple of hours or so.  then he gets up and wanders around the house, slamming doors and yelling, says the most cruel, irrational and nasty things you can imagine (his great vocabulary and wit have stayed with him, for better or worse), and makes threats.  at night, he suddenly refers to his girlfriend as ""the staff"" and thinks she's there to work for him in some way.he hasn't quite fully attacked his girlfriend yet, but it's gotten pretty close.  he's threatened to kill her.  he's shoved and bruised her.  she's terrified of him at night.  since he only sleeps for a couple of hours per night, that's all the sleep she's been getting as well.  this is obviously an unsustainable situation that needs to stop before it gets worse.i just spent one with with him, day and night, and can confirm that everything the girlfriend says is true.the girlfriend said that it's probably time for me to find a home for him, and sadly, i agree.by day, he doesn't remember any of the things at night.  when he's told what he did, he feels terrible about it, and says ""what the hell is happening to me? i must be losing my mind"" and makes it very clear that he doesn't want to hurt anyone, and is terrified at the possibility of hurting and/or losing his girlfriend.  he's too wealthy to get medicaid, but very likely too poor to afford in-home care for very long.  he has a little money in the bank (somewhere in the tens of thousands), but long ago put his girlfriend's name on his bank account.  (which means she has the full legal right to drain the account for herself if she wants.)   his main asset is his paid-for house.  i suppose it's likely the house will have to be sold off to pay for his care.i feel i will have to go to the courts to get control of my father and his affairs. his girlfriend will certainly feel insulted and offended, and there's a good chance that will drive her away entirely. while that will be her choice and not mine, i'll feel bad if my father loses her.  tldr version:  \--dad is a mostly functional human being by day  \--dad is so dysfunctional at night that he's a danger to himself and others, especially his smaller-than-him, also-old girlfriend. and he doesn't sleep at night so she can't sleep either\--while i'm no doctor, i believe the medical options to get him to sleep at night have already been exhausted\--i don't think he can afford an all-night caregiver at home, at least not for long, and even if he can, his girlfriend will find something not to like and will cause problems\--it seems like such a cruel thing to take a man who's fairly manageable for 2/3 of the day, and toss him in the nursing home because he's a monster for 1/3 of the day\--while i have a flexible schedule, i'm only able to spend about 10-15 hours per week with him, maybe even double that but not much more\--i wonder if there's some kind ""adult night care"" place instead of adult day care. i've looked at adult day care and he can probably afford it, but all that would do is give his girlfriend a break to nap and clean up the house. he'd still be a threat at night",,0
"hi everyone, i'll try to make this as brief as i can, and apologies if the problems stated here don't exactly have to do with dementia alone; but as many of you probably can relate to, his relationship with us (me and my sister) is complicated and it's hard to trace the threads.i am 37, my dad is 64 (65 in october). when he was 18, he adolescently tried to race a train and lost, resulting in a tbi that is now manifesting as early-onset dementia. this was only recently diagnosed, though, and all my life he was a slow thinker, borderline illiterate, not ""stupid"" (he could design, build, and fix things brilliantly but his mom had taken him out of school at 16 to work and i think that seriously set him back), but shy, maybe anxious, and a man of few words. and, importantly, largely absent in our upbringing.both my mom and he are alcoholics, which is another topic for another sub, but importantly my dad was largely just not around when i was growing up, even though my parents didn't divorce until i was in my 20s. he worked a lot i think (various kinds of construction but mainly putting in pools), but he was also out in the garage drinking with his buddies, out fishing, or god knows where else. starting in my early adolescence, furthermore, he basically moved into the basement (the stated reason was that the waterbed he shared with my mom upstairs was bad for his back and she refused to get rid of it, though i was never quite convinced by this) and from then on he was barely more than a housemate, or some distant uncle who'd weaseled his way into a basement apartment.so we grew up being used to not having him around, not expecting communication or support from him, and basically operating as a one-parent family. now, he seems to have clued in belatedly to some of this, and seems to want to ask me if/why my sister hates him. i don't think she does, and nor do i, but we definitely don't have much affection for him; my primary emotion about him is pity. and, i know that if he wants to know how she feels he should just ask her instead of me (though he is right in saying that she and i are close enough for me to basically know her pov).he went to a 3-month in-patient rehab two years ago after some kind of alcoholic episode (his dementia diagnosis must have been around this time too), and since then i think he might be realizing that it's likely to be all downhill from here. my perspective, and my sister's, is that we basically don't want any more than the bare minimum to do with him. we don't want to see him dead or in the streets; but taking over his finances, making decisions for him is not something i want to do, or my sister. i feel like we're going to end up doing it anyway because we're good, compassionate people. but i don't think it's going to remedy our negative feelings toward him. so what am i asking here... solidarity, i guess? advice, maybe, but if you're going to tell me ""swallow your pride and bury the hatchet before he can't any more"" i don't think that's going to work for me. i'm the furthest thing possible from a proponent of 12-step, but until he makes an effort to make amends with us regarding the effect his alcoholism had on us, my wall isn't coming down. any similar experiences? similar choices, regrets, validations? i expect that there will be less and less cohesiveness and stability in his discourse with time, and since phone calls with him are already torturously anxiety-inducing for both him and me, i don't expect to want to increase communication with him. we don't understand each other, we don't communicate on the same level, i doubt he has the emotional intelligence to really name his emotions (something i had to learn as an adult because we were so goddamn repressed at home), let alone express them.is it possible to have an ""arm's-length"" relationship with an absentee parent declining into dementia? or am i fooling myself into thinking there's anything but all-or-nothing, that i either just cut him out or dive into power of attorney?thank you for reading, again sorry if not enough of this is directly to do with dementia but i hope there are others who can identify with my experience.",,0
"my dad had a recent fall and has several compression fractures. since covid restrictions, i haven’t been able to see him often in his independent living facility, but when he made it to rehab after the fall, he was confused and having a lot of trouble with conversations. he was angry one minute and fine the next. so, they did some memory tests and they came back with some serious deficits. (he got a 9 of the slums.)my mom died from complications of dementia and her care was much easier - mainly because she was extremely abusive to me (and my dad) throughout my life and i was able to make decisions for her care pretty unemotionally. however, with my dad - i find myself walking on eggshells. i keep looking to him to make decisions and approving of things. he’s pretty resistant about handing over finances and i completely understand that because it is not my strong suit. i’m the only living relative at this point and know i need to do something, but i’m paralyzed at the idea of making the wrong decisions. so far, he’s not able to follow conversations, care for himself (bathing and bathroom), repeats same stories within minutes of each other, gets paranoid and upset sometimes, and is having trouble remembering anything i tell him. i know it just goes down hill from here, so i need to step in sooner rather than later. i know i need to get him moved from independent living. i know i need to control his spending (he’s an amazon junkie and bulk orders things or gets them sent to the wrong address). i know i need to get the power of attorney filed. but i’m scared to do anything until he tells me it’s ok. any advice?",,0
"hello, my partner has an aunt that he’s reconnected with and been helping for the last 5ish years. however the past few months/weeks her health has severely declined. she has been non stop calling and harassing my partner, her neighbors, her tax lady, her finance manager, her friends and even her friends daughter. like 200 text messages or 35 missed phone calls saying she needs help. it has gotten extremely bad and continues to get worse with every passing day. some background on the aunt. her primary doctor recommended her to see a neurologist so she did and my partner went with her. she got an mri scan and the doctor said the memory centers in her brain are severely shrunken. my partner asked for a diagnosis but the doctor kept dodging the question. he ultimately prescribed memantine 5 mg twice a day and told my partner and his aunt that they should come back after 6 months.she currently lives alone in a two story condo with her two dogs. she’s unable to get to the second floor due to hip pain which is where the bedrooms are as well as the washer and dryer. so she sleeps on the floor in the living room and doesn’t wash anything. she’s afraid for her two little dogs to go outside because of coyotes so they go to the bathroom inside the condo. most of her power outlets have been short circuited and don’t work because she’s spilled water on them. my partner finally convinced his aunt to have a caregiver come in and help her but the care giver left immediately due to the state of the home. he’s tried to get a cleaning crew in there but his aunt will last minute cancel or change the locks on the house thinking my partner has given the cleaners a key to her home. she also has an alcohol problem but she got sober but replaced her addiction with pills. this is how she ended up with her current primary doctor because no other doctor would prescriber her the medication she wanted. at first it was xanax and then it was lorazepam which she now takes for her panic attacks. however, the last few weeks/months, were both not entirely sure, she has started drinking again. this is where we have both seen the huge decline in her health. at first we couldn’t figure out why she would have these mental loss/panic attack episodes until my partner found empty bottles of alcohol in her condo. then he put two and two together. her neurologist reported my partners aunt to aps and my partner met the worker when she came to evaluate his aunt and her living situation. the worker gave my partner a number to call for help but it’s just the crises hotline and they’ll only help if his aunt is a harm to herself or others. the police have been called for a wellness check on her multiple times and they talk to my partner but ultimately say there’s nothing they can do. my partner just wants to get her help, get her a stable and clean living situation for her and her dogs, get her clean from the alcohol, and have her consistently taking her medication. we have no idea who to contact for help since she doesn’t meet the criteria of her being a harm to herself or others. he’s tried for a conservatorship but since her primary and the neurologist are kind of slimy they keep pointing fingers at each other and saying it’s not their responsibility but the others. so no one will sign the declaration of capacity. my partners aunt refuses to see any other doctor. she’s refusing any kind of help or assistance despite calling constantly asking for help mostly because she wants alcohol and we won’t give it to her. she’s already lost a lot of weight because she’s not eating and she constantly calls complaining about not having any food despite the fridge and cabinets being stuffed. she’s unable to shower or care for herself. my partner and i live 2 hours away and are unable to care for her full time. he visits her almost every single weekend and occasionally during the week if she has a doctors appointment. since typing this post she’s already called my partner 8 times. my partner as well as everyone who know her want to get her help it just we have no idea how or what to do. my partner and i are both in our 20s and can not afford to pay for services for her because she refuses to pay for them her selves. believe me, we both really wish we could. she also refuses to go to assisted living or be evaluated. we’re just at an absolutely loss. my partner spends anywhere between 3-4 hours a day trying to help her through her panic attacks. it’s exhausting for him and i feel it in our relationship. any help or guidance is extremely appreciated. thank you for taking the time to read this. i know it was long it’s just a lot. also, she’s called another 3 times crying she needs help and to come help her. tldr: need help having partners aunt evaluated as incapacitated or committed so we can get her the help she desperately needs.",,0
"situation is- i'm currently taking care of my mom (74) out of my studio apt. the family that she was living with during covid basically just dropped her off on me not knowing what my life/living situation is or the potential dangers. i'm an only child, dad is dead, rest of my family is about 500 miles away. i work 50+ hrs a week and she is pretty much in my apt sleeping or watching tv all day alone (well, with a cat and dog). she is really early onset and can shower herself so i'm not afraid yet but am taking family leave from work in a few weeks to deal with this. i spend every night after working trying to figure out what to do. getting poa, finding a place for her to live, getting her finances straight (she is in a lot of debt). the main goal is to find her somewhere to live but i feel like i will need to be able to control her finances. it seems so simple, get poa, declare bankruptcy for her, move her out. and i just keep hitting roadblocks it feels like. i'm so busy with work i hardly have time to talk to lawyers and getting poa actually seems a bit harder than i thought it would be. her budget is only $2,500/mo so finding a place is extremely hard (california). she thinks she still has her home or that one of the relatives will let her stay there until she finds an apartment. what order should i take this? poa -&gt; bk -&gt; place to live? thats what i always had thought, but then i got suggestions to find somewhere to live first and asap.and then... my mental health is dwindling. i don't like having roommates in general and now its just.... this. i'm 31 male, single but would ahve been crazy if i was still with my last girlfriend because she lived here. i have no privacy, nowhere to decompress after work which is extremely stressful on its own (mortgage broker) and its starting to affect my performance. i'm tired, resentful at this point, can't enjoy anytime by myself. i just want out. if there isn't anything going on with friends/complex (its a very active complex with volleyball courts, pool, hot tub) i have literally spent nights drinking in the stairwell just hanging with my dog listening to music. even when there is something to do i feel so empty unless buzzed.  i would actually pay to have someone hold my hand through the process. thousands. 10k (serious, if you can do this i will venmo you right now). i'm 31 male, i want my life back, a family, to just be able to relax. my nerves are shot, anything that touches me makes me flinch. constant fight or flight until i can get a buzz. maybe this sounds selfish but i feel like i had to vent.anyways, if there are any suggestions as to how to handle this process or anything else i need to do, hopefully not but, please let me know. if you have a story to share please feel free. i feel like this subreddit of all things is ironically a support group, when you think of support group you think of a bunch of people sitting around in folding chairs but i've read so many stories here that i feel a connection. this isn't the first time i've spilled this out here but it helps. any suggestions, comments, whatever, i feel pretty alone.",,0
"my grandma has dementia and is very adamant about being the one who controls her finances. she consistently forgot to pay her bills, and is now living in assisted living. my mom covers all of her finances and makes sure all bills are paid on time, but my grandma does not understand this and insists she needs to have her checkbook and to be able to write checks.is there a company that can create a fake checkbook? so my grandma can write a check and give it to a nurse or my mother, believing her bills are paid? like i said before, she is upset and worried that she doesn’t have a checkbook and that something bad will happen to her if she can’t pay bills even though my mom covers all that.also, please weigh in if you all do not think this is a good way to go about handling this situation. this is all very new to me, less new to my mother, but my mother was curious if anything like this existed. thanks in advance",,0

"hey, my mom was diagnosed with lewy body back in 2019. her neurologist has been ordering an eeg every 6 months or so and i'm not sure why this is necessary. her boyfriend is convinced it's to ""milk insurance."" is this a common test to monitor progress of the disease or is this superfluous?",,0
"my grandmother just turned 80. over the past year and a half her memory has significantly deteriorated, but she has not been diagnosed officially with anything. some days are better than others, but her previously occasional ""bad days"" are becoming more and more frequent. she doesn't remember who my dad (her son) is most of the time now. she barely remembers her grandchildren and great grandchildren, and if you talk to or ask her about one of them she says she's not sure who we're referring to. she will repeat questions and doesn't remember responses. the past two weeks she has steadily had more trouble remembering who my grandfather is, even though he is her primary caregiver and has not left her alone in months. she will wake up multiple times in the night and try to pack a suitcase and tell him she is ""ready to go home"" even though they have lived in their house upwards of 12 years. she has paranoia about money and people stealing from them (which has happened in the past, but anyone who has stolen from them is long dead). she will dig through paperwork and find old doctor or hospital bill statements and cry to my grandfather that they can't afford such expensive medical bills even though they have no debt, a lot of savings, and very good insurance. two days ago she called my dad and worriedly asked him to come over to ""meet someone"" and wouldn't answer my dad when he asked if my grandpa was home. he went over there, and it turns out she was scared because she didn't know who my grandpa was and called my dad out of fear when my grandpa went to make them dinner in another room. my dad is worried that one day she will call the police or something on my grandpa because she doesn't know who he is. my grandpa is a proud man who refuses in home help, and my grandmother's downward spiral is going to kill him. he is convinced that when she gets ""worse"" that a memory care facility will take both of them, even though he has no memory issues whatsoever. my dad has attempted to explain to him that that is unlikely but he won't listen. the other issue is that she absolutely refuses to go to the doctor or get in a car. she hasn't been in over two years, and my grandpa both can't and won't force her to go. she's never been combative. she doesn't have any major health issues; she is slightly overweight and has knee problems and uses a cane (so she is not a flight risk). we can tell she is getting more frustrated daily, but because we can't get her to a doctor for a diagnosis, we are at a loss at what to do. both of them have never really trusted doctors, and i think this is a major factor in the lack of urgency regarding this situations. i know to even be considered for a memory care facility she needs an official diagnosis. my main worry is that this is going to literally kill my grandpa because he has lung problems. he is so tired and frustrated. i guess i'm looking for any advice that might not be the obvious ""take her to a doctor."" or any tips and tricks would be appreciated. thanks.",,0
"hi:i’m a new member and wanted to say hello. i am concerned that my 80 year old mom is showing signs of cognitive decline and memory loss. i’m not sure how to proceed. just a little background.my mom and i are not particularly close, and we are both independent women. our relationship has had its ups and downs and we’re definitely not the mother/daughter types who are constantly on the phone with each other. i’m (for all intents and purposes) an only child. i live two hours away from where she lives and i grew up – a small town in northern michigan. throughout her work life she was very sharp and good with computers. she worked as an executive assistant to a city manager, and then later part-time in a nonprofit office. she enjoys and is very dependent on technology like email and streaming services. but lately she’s been struggling with it. i got her a smartphone for christmas and it’s not been going well. mostly i got it so that we could text with each other, but she’s keeping it shut off most of the time. i visited this past weekend and we walked through placing an online grocery order. i’ve been placing orders for her during the pandemic, but she’d like to do it herself. i saw that she keeps a folder of word documents with step-by-step instructions on how to do things. we went through the steps of placing the grocery order six times, while she wrote down notes. she would forget things she did just a few minutes prior. she also seems to forget things we talk about in our weekly zooms. i guess i’d like some advice on when it’s time to broach the subject of talking to her doctor about testing. also, when is it time to take a more active role in things like finances, etc? these are all so delicate. thanks for listening.",,0
"my mother is a super-organized business woman (for many decades). very well groomed. almost 83 now. 25 years ago she added a daylight-basement apartment to her her house so that she could eventually have a live-in caregiver (with their own space) and up the chance of aging in place.she is in perfect shape and physical health, but i would say she is in late stage 3/ early stage 4 (out of 7) dementia. her neurologist says she very high reserve. before mcd and dementia, we always thought she'd need physical help and didn't envision ""mental"" help. i think her last moca (sp?) was 24 or 25. she still drives during the day within 5 miles of her home.i handle her books, bills, taxes, investments, health appointments, health insurance, etc. right now she needs someone to come in and go over her calendar with her, make shopping lists, help answer texts and rsvps, text workmen who prefer texts (i.e., never answer their phones), help her look at her grandkids' social media, queue up netflix occasionally, etc. they would also need to go out on errands with her a couple of days a week and help line up about 2 dinners a week to be waiting in her fridge for her in the evenings.since she doesn't need any help with adls and takes care of herself physically, i don't feel inclined to look at [care.com]( for home health or similar. my inclination is to advertise for an ***errand/digital/calendar assistant for a memory-challenged physically-fit senior.*** i picture having two people who just work 6-8 hours a week each. knowing her, she will become close with one or both of them and one will morph in to her dedicated caregiver and possibly move in to her attached apartment next year or so. if they only work 6 or 8 hours a week i could give them their choice of working on a casual labor/cash basis or with official payroll checks.am i crazy to be skipping arranging traditional in-home elder assistance right now? i feel like if i advertise for that i will get people whose strong-suit is their patience with incontinence, bathing, etc., and they will think it's weird that their job is to do the stuff i have in mind. i know every detail of her life and would move in with her if i didn't have 3 teenagers and a husband:). i picture interviewing people first and then letting her meet with my finalists. i picture managing them and giving most of the direction because i remember way more of what my mother needs to be doing (and when) than she does.tldr: is it weird to hire an errand/digital/social/ dining assistant (or two) for a physically sound person with dementia instead of a traditional in-home health worker?",,0

"i’ve been a guardian of my fil who has dementia for less than a month.  we keep telling ourselves that it was necessary and that we did the right thing. i secured his finances and secured other items from his home to make it safer for him and homecare.  homecare comes three times a week. i’m upping it to a daily check.  we live 3 hrs away and we are his closest relatives.  he struggles with his finances, gets scammed, clicks on links and thinks everything is legit.  his judgment just isn’t there any more.  this last month he has started repeating himself and being in loops really bad.  it is frustrating and we are grieving because he doesn’t believe he has dementia and thinks we are stealing from him.  we try to tell him that we secured it for his safety.  but he just can’t remember.  he calls us daily about his money.  he apparently goes to the bank ~3 times a day asking about his accounts and checking his balances.  he forgets his cash at home and wants to take more out of the bank.  i know this has been a slow progression over the last two years but we live three hours away and aren’t faced with it every day.   since i’ve taken guardianship, it is in our face every day.  we are at his house this weekend and it is heart breaking and we feel like we are going behind is back.  he has moments of being mad at us luckily he gets over it and was ok most of the time.  i frankly have to take my hat off to those caregivers that live with or check on the person daily.  i wish we lived closer.  i tell myself things would be different and easier; but somehow i think that dementia is deceiving and it is terrible no matter how close or far away you are as a caregiver.  i’m thankful for this redit. i get on here just to know we are not alone in this and to read how others are doing and dealing with it.  and to confirm to ourselves that my fil really has dementia and we are doing the right thing.  the last few weeks has been the worst and i didn’t sleep well last night at fil house.  i’ve wanted to post something to ask for advice or encouragement or i don’t know.  i haven’t this weekend until now. the movie frozen 2 has the line “just do the next right thing.” it seems very appropriate for this stage of our life.  thanks for listening.",,0
"my mom is stage 5/6 alz. i’m her only daughter. she’s a covert narcissist and i have adhd. she’s always relied on my struggles with adhd to fit her narrative about how hard her life has been just being my mother. i’ve always rejected the manipulation with avoidance and dissociation. this has translated to my mom telling everyone that i dont like her and dont want to be around her and she cant rely on me to be there for her when she needs care, which she knows is bullshit because i have told her repeatedly that just because she cant live in my house doesnt mean i wont take care of her. she does this as a ploy for sympathy and a way to keep me isolated so that i can focus only on her. im almost 100% that narcissism is directly linked to dementia so im sure some of you can relate. anyways - now her pity party stories and manipulation tactics have created real consequences and i’m at my wits end waiting for aps and my lawyer to move with a purpose. my moms husband of 20 years passed in early feb and left her with his sister. he had late stage copd but he ultimately died of covid after his sister gave it to him when they drove down to get my parents without telling anyone the day after christmas. before he died, i had never met or seen this woman. she decided they should move to her house last september and i found out bc i just happened upon a facebook post. a month later they decided to stay and again, i was notified with the rest of the world via facebook. i tried to talk to my stepdad multiple times about including me and keeping me informed in their decisions and what is going on and he apologized and said he would. then two days after xmas their hospice nurse called saying that she was at their house for their appt and their car was gone and their door was padlocked. no one could get ahold of them until we said we were going to call the police and then 2 minutes later the phone rings and they tell us they moved. i couldnt make a trip until early feb and by that time, my stepdad had passed and they had given all the legal everything to his sister. since they moved to her house, she has been a nightmare. she wont give me phone numbers and addresses. she refuses to discuss any of my moms finances with me. they decided to put her in a home, found a place, paid for it, and had a move in date before they ever told me anything at all. she’s been making my mom travel every week and stay with different people and when it was my turn, she sent her away with me with no atm card and no id. my mom has been having regular anxiety attacks when she forced to sleep in all these weird places and this lady just blows it off. i told her that i wanted to move my mom to a place closer to me and asked to discuss all my moms money and she said she wasnt comfortable discussing my moms finances with anyone. she wont show me any docs. she wont tell me whats going on with moms money. she has control of my mom and stepdads house. and now she wont give me my moms new phone number in her new facility - its a private number and the facility says they cant give it out. so i called adult protective services and now they’re going to investigate. im waiting for a lawyer to call me back. but these coupe of days where i’m not able to check on my mom and this woman could be doing or saying anything to smear me, i feel sick to my stomach. how can people do this to their kids?!?! these two dont even like each other and it feels like im just the scapegoat for both of them. i love my mom and i never could have imagined that she would just write her life over to a virtual stranger that she doesnt trust or like just to spite me because i said she cant live in my house. i will never do that to my kids. i feel horrible, conflicted, angry, disappointed, disrespected, sad. im just deflated and confused because all i ever wanted was for my mom to love me- and she just cant.",,0
"my grandmother was diagnosed with dementia/alzheimer's about 4 1/2 years ago. she was living alone about an hour away from us prior to moving in with us. after a pivotal incident, we had her move in with us since our home is fairly large and could acommodate for her hobbies as well (she was an amazing quilter- so she could have her own sewing room). when she first moved in with us, both my parents and myself were working full time jobs (mom working an altered schedule to make it home frequently). she was able to stay at home and essentially function normally with us gone for a few hours. fast forward to today, she is a shell of her former self. she needs constant supervision around the clock. my dad (60) is no longer working and my mother (58) is working full time. i am currently going through hiring processes for my dream job. so my dad and i are able to stay home during the day and take care of her.  my grandmother currently requires significant care due to wandering and confusion. any list of dementia related issues i’ve researched, she suffers from. she is having to be constantly reminded that she lives here. at least every other night she puts her sweater and shoes on, waves good bye, and tells us she is walking home. every night she seems to only sleep an hour or less and wanders through the house. there have been a few close calls. one night she climbed on top of the kitchen counters to get something from the top shelf. she slipped and fell falling at least 6 ft onto the hard tile. another night she wandered downstairs and fell asleep at the kitchen table. she ended up falling out of her chair and slammed her head into the desk next to her. how she did not injure herself is a miracle.i am so scared for her safety. my mother absoluetly does not want her to be in a nursing home. i believe she is reasonably afraid of covid and emotionally scared of not having her mother with her. my dad and i believe she needs to be in a nursing home. not only is this due to her safety, but with only one parent working finances have been hard. it’s getting to the point where my dad is needing to get a part time job. this will leave me as the sole caregiver during the day. i am glad to do this, but in a few months i could be shipped out for 3 months for training if i get this job. which will leave my parents in a rough spot. my question for you guys is when did you notice your loved one needed to be in a nursing home? or how did you talk to your spouse or family member about seeking other forms of caregiving?",,0
"my mil (66) is the one with some form of undiagnosed dementia, as well as what appears to be untreated mental illness. she has always been the sort to distrust medicine, instead believing she can cure herself of whatever ails her by manipulating the spirits of plants. she's always been off kilter in regards to reality, and her dementia is making everything worse. she has hallucinations, delusions, extreme paranoia, hoarding behavior, poor nutrition, poor hygiene, you name it. it has gotten to the point where my partner got durable power of attorney, in order to manage finances and help ensure his mom get medical treatment. after a huge power struggle, he finally gets her in to see a doctor. here is where things are really frustrating us. he attends the appointment with his mom, who if course downplays her issues, assures the doctor that she feels happy and safe in her home, and that everything is totally fine. this of course goes against everthing she says to us on a daily basis. we anticipated this, which is why my partner contacted the dr. ahead of time to let them know of the various issues going on. what we didn't expect is for the doctor to essentially go along with the downplay of issues - and to just suggest to focus on calming down and getting more sleep. on top of that, she is not being communicative with my partner in regards to his mother. while we understand that his mom is the patient, he is her carer and we really need to know what's going on medically with her, or what the doctors gameplan is on how to approach things. the conversation cannot end with just suggesting she gets more sleep, when the reason she doesn't get more sleep is because she thinks a dark figure is peering into her room every night. we would try to get a second opinion, but it was such a battle to get her to see this person that we are afraid it would never happen. so i guess my ask is this - how the hell do you get the doctor to listen to your side and work with you. is this basically impossible unless he has guardianship? i should also point out that my partner is 27, so i suspect there is less respect afforded to him due to his age. we are just so frustrated and honestly scared - this was the light at the end of the tunnel for us and we don't want to be told to just turn around and walk back into the darkness.",,0
"before i say anything, i just want to point out that i'm not exactly an expert on this topic and issue. i've never had to care for or knew anyone with dementia or any of the related forms of it. there are plenty of things that i am blind to and am not knowledgeable about, so if i say anything that's false please correct me so i can edit.i'm very worried for my mom. she's 57 and over the past maybe 2 or 3 years i've noticed that her memory is pretty spotty, both long term and short term. her twin sister remembers a lot of stuff from their childhood, like the stories of them and the things they did with their friends, but she doesn't remember any of it. she remembers some stuff from long ago but that's it. short term, she forgets many things. one minute she will ask me how life's going and my job, and then 5-10 minutes later she will repeat the same question as if she didn't just ask it. my dad thinks it's selective memory maybe because he said that he told her about lawn care coming over in 2 days at 3pm, and she remembered and called him saying that they didn't come at 3. also her arms are pretty shaky, but i don't know if that's because of her high blood pressure or maybe it's related to this.she's out of work at the moment so hopefully soon she'll be able to get a job (she plans on retiring in 3-4 years) and be able to get insurance so she can get a physical and get tested. all i know is that it is worrying me. i guess i just posted this here to get it off my chest. thank you",,0
"treading unfamiliar territory here and trying to understand all these new terms. i hear these words a lot: poa, guardianship, &amp; conservatorshipim trying to help my mom figuring out the best way to deal with my dad's condition, we've been suspecting he has dementia. my mom is 55 and my dad is 85. i am not yet fully equipped with knowledge about dementia and elderly care, but even more so my mom so im trying to do my research myself so i can explain things to her in a way that won't overwhelm her.pardon my ignorance of the law but id like to better understand how a low income family, in this case my stepdad and my mom can benefit from getting guardianship/conservatorship when my dad's condition worsens. i could be wrong, but based on what ive been reading so far, im under the impression that those who get guardianship/conservatorship are mostly the upper class, wealthy family, with lots of properties or those people with will and testaments.my stepdad doesn't have a lot. he's retired and he has his pension which is 700/month, and then his house which theyre still paying mortgage on and that's pretty much it, they don't have properties or businesses. my mom works a job that pays $13 an hour. and as much as i want to help them, i am not yet in the position to financially support them either. i would if i could, no doubt about that.so i understand that poa is a lot cheaper than the two. we plan on getting poa granted to my mom. my dad has been exhibiting symptoms of dementia. she's always been so reliant and dependent on him ever since. she has always let him do all the financial stuff. however, right now the rest of the family just agrees that he can no longer oversee/take care of their finances. ive been encouraging and motivating my mom to take action, and step up. constantly reminding her that the rest of the family is here to help her throughout this whole thing.i guess my question is how is guardianship or conservatorship beneficial/useful to those low income families? can my mom just get the poa and if my dad states hed like the poa to remain active even after he's no longer capable of making his own decisions, will that be better choice than getting the other two since it is a lot cheaper?i guess im trying to know the reasons why we should or why it is still necessary to get guardianship/conservatorship eventually for my dad despite it being so expensive. does my mom need it still even if theres not a lot of ""wealth"" involved?does the government offer any assistance at all when it comes to the expenses getting these arrangements made?thank you so much. i really appreciate everyone here.",,0

"hi guys,i've received some helpful information here in the past with my grand who has dementia. i had some questions hoping someone has any success in relocating their loved ones with dementia. i've been on a waiting list in two facilities for over a year now and i have been calling other facilities with no luck. my grandma is in a nursing facility that is about an hour away from where i live and i was hoping to relocate her somewhere closer to where i live (san francisco). my grandma is currently using a medi-cal and medi-care as her insurance.1)there are facilities that charge 5-8k a month and do not support medicare/cal, how do seniors usually afford these places? it seems like such a high amount of money for one to spend on living without any government assistance. 2) is my grandma lower in the priority list because she currently in a facility? i feel like thats one of the reasons why we're not getting any movement. my grandma has dementia and is constantly screaming and crying (shes bed bound) but when i see her she does not exhibit any of this even when im with her for hours. the instant i'm not around shes been agitated daily and often scratches her head to the point where theres a bald spot on her scalp (no bleeding). she only speaks chinese in a facility that has no chinese speaking nurses. ive tried things like trying to leave the tv on, calling me when she's agitated (doesnt help), nurses try to talk to her and it also doesnt work. she often cries about something from the past like forgetting something, money problems, etc. when i've comforted her about this, she'll forget within minutes of me leaving and cry about other things. she's taken so many types of anti-anxiety meds in the past, i have no idea whats good for anymore (being tired and weak all day or being alert and crying all day). i visit 2-3 times a week but it seems like a small solution to this problem because she'll end up being agitated again within hours of me leaving anyways. i dont know what to do at this point, i feel like me visiting is a short-term solution and i just want her to be at ease. its so difficult to see her suffer like this. i feel like psychologically she'll be better at home but we can not afford the physical support needed to take care of her. i know this is a long post but if you guys have any suggestions, i would greatly appreciate it. thanks!",,0
"my mom was diagnosed with eod, ftd almost three years ago.  in learning more about this disease in that time, i think that she showed early signs of this illness at least 10 years prior to her diagnosis.  she's been a widow since 1987, and i'm an only child with no close relatives for either of us.she lives with her antisocial cat in a 55+ apartment complex on long island in new york.  my husband (36) and i (32) live in an apartment in connecticut, but we visit her every other weekend.  she volunteers at a church thift store a few times a week and goes to that church every sunday.  she also goes to a medical-model day center 4 days a week and finally has consistent at-home care through guildnet gold (basically medicare/medicaid insurance for the elderly) 6 evenings a week.  these daily outtings have been great because she's chatting with new people and participating in many activities.  she's unfortunately, or fortunately, also seeing the progression of dementia in other people which is sad, but also humbling.she's really with it most of the time, but also has had bipolar disorder and manic depression most of her adult life, so she has benign mood swings occasionally (i realize that this could/will get worse).  she also hardly gets any sleep at nights and has experienced this most of her life, so she can get cranky and tired early in the evening (maybe sundowning?).  she also has epilepsy, which her neuro believes is related to the ftd.  all these are controlled by meds, except for the sleep issues.she spends her free time watching tv, walking or gardening.  she consistently asks if we watch castle, grimm or person of interest, and the answer's always 'no'.  all she can relate to are shows and movies most of the time, but this isn't new as she did this most of my childhood.  she also doesn't socialize much.   people would describe her as odd, or quirk-filled.  she feels that people don't pay attention to her, but she's also a horrible listener, to her child and to people.  also, not new, but growing worse because of the illness, possibly.  fyi, her hearing is excellent, she's just always been a selfish, self-centered person.what prompted me to write all this was that she ran low on two of her medications and forgot which doctors prescribed them.  she got super anxious about running low, forgetting the doctors, and about letting me know about it, so her at-home aid called to talk with me.  i spoke with her doctor's aid about her 'script and they informed me that she missed a neuro appointment in october.  it also turns out that she has a bottle of medication with dispense directions that are out of date, and has run out of pills cause of this.  pharmacy now has the correct 'script and she's seeing her neuro next week.i'm thinking i'm really in denial about the progression of this disease.  a part of me thinks that she's ok with these current services, but then things like this occur and temporarily magnify everything.  they are not frequent, but i know they will become frequent.  yes, i know things will get worse, but for now it seems manageable.  am i fooling myself?  my mother?  is that how it is for everyone with dementia and their families?  when did you know, your parents know, that it was the next logical step?fyi, my husband and i checked out two facilities with alps beds, just to get a feel, last year.",,0
"hey there everyone. my name is mustafa and i'm 23. 6 months ago i was on the verge of ending my life .at a very young age where everyone is striving and working hard for a better life. unfortunately for me everything went on pause in 2018 i got diagnosed with osteoarthritis aka (disk degeneration)that's where i had to be friend chronic pain..my past 2.5 years was filled with so much pain that i lost everything in my life.my relationships went down hill , my finances were all spent on finding a cure , uni failed me since i was not able to study due to pain and so much more i sucked it all up cuz i was told there's nothing you can do about it just like alzheimer's. anyways 2020 march arrives and that's when sh*t hits the fan and got fired my job at a restaurant because i forget alot of orders and instructions that i've been given.i realized my brain is not working right. it's like i have conversation with someone in the next minute or two i realize i would forget 90% of what we talked about. let alone just that i couldn't perform normal calculations in my head . man that felt so weird coming from someone who has graduated from a levels 5 years ago with straight up a's and b's.long story short i went through different doctors trying to find what's going on and i would always make sure i'd have my phone recorder on cuz the next minute i'd step out i'd legit forget what they just told me.after weeks of visits i knew that there no hope for me man . literally every doctor said something .i got diagnosed with adhd , depression , anxiety.and the one i hated the most was ""oh i think it's all in your head"". yes sure...i tried all the meds from adderall to anti depressants you name it. they just threw pills week after week. hoping one day i come by and talk about how they helped me..unfortunately none did.i wanted to see how bad my brain was so  i found a test called moca.i think alot of you should know what this is . it's a test doctors put people on if they have cognitive decline. no doctor wanted to test me out or do a scan on my brain so i did the test on my own and my score was literally 5/30. man i knew life was over for me and my parents would have to go through this with me as well which was horrifying.time was passing by and things getting worse day by day for some reason i'd be staring at the window for no reason for minutes.days pass and weird words come out of my mouth and i'd stutter trying to put one sentence together. i think it's called aphasia.i know i'm talking so much about my symptoms but i'm trying to show you how bad my case is. but you might wonder how the hell am i typing this entire post if i had dementia..i'll gladly explain and it's why i'm putting this out.6 months ago that's when i was at rock bottom i discovered a book called ""the end of alzheimer's"" by dr dale bredesen.i was so desperate that if someone told me the cure is to eat a plate of shit . i would do it regardless if it's true or not. it's called desperation for a solution.anyways dr dale details everything a person needs to know about this disease but not just that. he's been able to reverse his clients cognitive decline with a protocol that he has extensively put out in his book .i was skeptical but i wanted something that gives me hope so i decided to follow.  jesus man 6 months in and i swear on my mom's life that it f*cking works.i have recently done the cognitive test and my moca score was 30/30.i'm able to remember conversations , my vocabulary increased , aphasia is vanishing , i can understand movies and so much more..i highly recommend anyone who's watching a loved one die day by day to give this book a shot or hell maybe you yourself are experiencing symptoms of memory loss too . there's hope for everyone no matter how far they are ...i'm not the first one who has come back to life but in the book he shares different stories of his clients who show obvious results and they have gone back to normal life..i feel sad at time i walk by a nursing home next to my house and i see a bunch of elderly probably with severe alzheimer's stuck where they are and never get to truely come back to life just like i did.anyways for me it's been 6 months and i can't say i'm fully back 100% to where i was but jesus i'm so happy things turned around when it seemed impossible..it's a journey and it takes times i can't imagine the how my next years will be. i'm looking forward to uni again 😊yeah and also i forgot to mention that my chronic pain has subsided . i finally live a pain free life. i swear the only reason i posted this is so that someone reads this and hopefully gives the book a shot . we all know how hopeless it is to hear someone go through dementia. if you got any question i'll gladly answer ☺️",,0
"greetings all,&amp;#x200b;this sub has been such a tremendous help to me and my brothers in dealing with my mother's dementia, and i'm eternally grateful for all the feedback i've received over the years.&amp;#x200b;unfortunately my mother, currently living at assisted living with late stage early-onset dementia, has had yet another setback in life. she now has been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer with a life expectancy of 2-3 weeks or months.&amp;#x200b;obviously this is terrible news and the family is very sad about all of this. but now my brothers and i  are worried about end-of-life expenses. &amp;#x200b;my brothers and i can't really afford to pay for these things when they happen in the near future. we were originally guesstimating that mom had at least a few more years left according to doctors, and were waiting to start thinking about this. but now, with the latest diagnosis - she does not have much time left.&amp;#x200b;now we must think about things like end-of-life expenses. funeral homes, cremations, burials, cemetery plots, etc.  and someone suggested i look into life insurance , or final expense insurance to help with these expenses. but i have no idea where to start, or if it's even a possibility.&amp;#x200b;does anyone have any suggestions?  we live in maryland usa.&amp;#x200b;thank you all for taking the time to read this, it is truly appreciated.",,0
"my dad was involuntary committed to a mental health hospital a few days ago, this has never happened before he has been having extensive visual and auditory hallucinations. they keep upping his meds and he continues to have episodes. yesterday both a nurse and case manager called me, panicked. he lives in a different state and i can't see him anyway because covid. the hospital says he has extreme anxiety, depression, and psychosis. he has an extensive family history of alzheimer's and dementia.  piecing together info that he's told only specific people, he's been having all the dementia symptoms for at least one year. last i saw him in person which was 2-3yrs ago, we had a two hour conversation then 20min later he didn't remember having it. he played it off like he didn't want to talk about that stupid subject and we continued on with the day. what am i supposed to do? the case manager said if there's not insurance or cash to place him in long term care or assisted living, he will eventually transition to outpatient support. he is unable to care for himself, he wasn't eating or sleeping before he was taken to the er. if the mental hospital can't control him (he broke into a room yesterday he wasn't allowed to be in because he thought people were there to shoot and kill him), how am i, one person with no medical training of any kind, supposed to deal with him? i am scared he will have an episode when released and actually end up getting shot by pigs because he's an old crazy man acting crazy in public. is there a social worker or some organization that can help? he has medicare and tricare.",,0
"my(29f/disabled) mom (56f) has ftd (frontotemporal dementia). for the longest time i’ve been her “person.” if she needed to do something i’d be more likely to get her to agree. over the past five years her decline has been steadily increasing. she’s still very much herself and may not remember exact dates when asked, but i’m still her person. i normally go to visit my partner in england for a couple of months at a time. she misses me but seems to be okay while i’m gone, and is always happier when i’m back. since the pandemic i haven’t been able to visit him. it’s been since 2019 that i wasn’t gone for more than a week or two at a time. recently i’ve been spending time in my childhood hometown. i have a social support community here. i can be a little more active in my life style here. for the longest time i’ve always said the two things keeping me at home are my mom and the dread of finding new doctors. now i’m at a point where i’m ready to switch and move back to my hometown. this unfortunately leaves me stuck on the position of my mom. i love her and know that her mental health would only rapidly decline if i permanently moved. my dad is at work or drinking (he doesn’t watch her like she needs, he “hangs out” meaning she will not eat or drink if he’s not home or too drunk to go get her food.) before the pandemic we were having an in home aid come once a week. she needs more than once a week, and it is very expensive and not covered by insurance. another reason why living at home benefits not only her but my fathers wallet. i have kind of tasked myself as being her protector and caretaker. which i have no regrets about, i love her and only wish i could be of more use to her. i can’t get her to do basic self care, she won’t take her meds for me. because of my physical disabilities and mental health i can’t often spend the time with her she deserves. i’m really only around to get lunch with her or run her to a store here and there. make sure she eats something. i also have trouble setting boundaries. i know this move would be great for my mental health. but i feel so guilty for leaving my mom in my dads care. tl;dr: do i move and work on growing myself and my happiness or do i leave my mom in my inattentive dad’s care, and miss out on what little time we may have left at a cost to my mental health and happiness?",,0
"on monday we are visiting a memory care facility for my mother-in-law. what questions should we ask to make sure we find a decent place for her?she’s 67 years old and was diagnosed last year. she saw a specialist last week for the first time and he confirmed that while she may have dementia, she has been suffering mini-strokes that have been slowly killing her brain. the result is symptoms that are basically identical to dementia. my husband said the person he spoke with said medicaid would only cover the total cost if she has less than $2k to her name. she currently has about $80k from her various pensions and savings over the years, and they said she could pay with her money (supplemented partially by medicaid) until she’s down to her last $2k and then let medicaid take over from there. we have no expectation of receiving any inheritance from her - we just want her to be someplace close to us so we can visit her for whatever time she has left. does this sound standard/ advantageous? what other questions should we be asking about finances/ quality of care/ etc.?thanks!",,0
"my grandfather has dementia and me and my grandmother take care of him. last march i came to live with them since my school went virtual due to the pandemic. since i've been here i have been looking after him while my grandmother goes to work. at the end of august i will be starting nursing school so there won't be anyone here with him. so, we are looking for an in-home caregiver to take care of him while i'm at school and my grandmother is at work. however, it will cost $20/hr for the 3 days a week we need her, which works out to be around $2,100 a month. my grandfather's social security money is $2,000/month and, my grandmother has been using some of it to pay for the water and electricity bills.  my grandmother has a better idea of her financial situation, but she has expressed to me multiple times that that is expensive for her. so, we have been brainstorming things to let go of (e.g., cable boxes that aren't used often, subscriptions, gym membership, etc.). my grandfather does not qualify for medicaid because of my grandmother's income. and even if my grandmother were to divorce him so that he would qualify for medicaid from my understanding, she would still be expected to pay money towards him. i feel like there should be some other option available so that my grandmother can feel financially secure in paying for his care. she already pays my mom's rent while my mom is working on her dissertation, which is $2,300/month (hopefully this will be the last year that she will be paying for it). and my grandmother doesn't want to just cut my mom loose, but that money really could make a big difference. on top of that, my grandfather didn't save any money before his dementia and, if he had, that could've helped pay the remainder of the money we need for his care. my grandmother also is still paying off the house mortgage. part of the reason my grandmother still works is because of my mom's rent. and my grandmother has expressed other things that she'd like to do with her money that are solely for herself, which she definitely deserves since she really is the head honcho of the family. she is the one who has helped finance things for her children, her grandchildren, her schizophrenic brother, and now her husband. so, i am eager to know of any avenues that we can take so that the home care costs aren't as expensive. thank you.",,0
"so i'm looking into hospice for my dad who has dementia.  been losing some weight but still eating food fairly good. make sure he drinks gatorade and or powerade daily. he sleeps off an on for about 18-20 hours a day. can anyone share their similar experience. his family dr most likely will sign off on it tomorrow. just needs to do a referral.  we have a poa for healthcare and finance in place. is hospice admission fairly easy, no hassle process or do they need bank statements? he is living with me til he needs to go for his final last 2-4 weeks once that's determined. any advice or share a similar experience would be helpful. thank you.",,0
"my mom (72) has mci following a stroke in 2014, though i wasn’t totally aware of the extent of her deficiencies until my dad died in 2019. i think both he and i were in denial about it. since then, i’ve been taking over the responsibility for paying her bills, but she hasn’t wanted to let go of some things (like receiving her mail) and it’s making it a lot harder and i’m screwing this up. we don’t live in the same state (for now - this visit home has me pretty sure i’ll need to move back). things that i could have fixed easily if i had seen the mail when it arrived months ago have become big issues.she lives alone, and during this trip we have both agreed that we should sell the house and look for a small apartment for her. i’ve been doing a lot this trip to move us towards getting the house listed this fall. however, yesterday she got upset with me when i was talking about a recommendation for a realtor and told me she doesn’t want to sell until next fall.i’m scared of her being out here for another year, but i want to be respectful of her autonomy and i don’t want her to feel like she can’t make these choices. she also isn’t regularly taking her medicine (she had last filled her prescriptions in december), but every time i talk to her about it she tells me she is. the house was a mess when i got here. the dog has fleas, etc. she shuts down conversations that are about the doctor, the house, the unpaid bills. and she seems annoyed that i’m spending a lot of time working on all of the paperwork and financial messes (and cleaning). im definitely rambling, so i guess i’m just looking for advice on how to talk to her about this big stuff in a way that won’t make her just shut down the conversation. i really, really want to get her to the doctor and somehow be present because i know she isn’t honest with her doctor (about taking meds, about her ability to manage her house and finances, and definitely about how much she drinks).i’m driving home across the country in a week and i feel wracked with anxiety and so, so guilty. i feel like i’m failing her. a lot of the guides i have found on communicating are more geared towards folks with more advanced dementia and don’t totally apply (she still has a pretty full vocabulary, i think).any help at all is appreciated. i’m grateful for this little community.side note - is it common for people with mci or early dementia to be able to “fake it” in certain situations? when i’m alone with my mom out here for days i can barely see the woman that raised me. constantly repeating the same things, apathetic and withdrawn, etc. then we’ll spend an afternoon with a group of people and she seems mostly okay? or they probably wouldn’t suspect she has a fridge full of rotten milk and hasn’t opened mail in months.",,0
"apologies in advance for the jumble of backstory info and my venting. i have so much to say and am simultaneously having a hard time putting this all into words.my (22f) grandfather (84 next month) is living by himself, and showing a consistent decrease in his ability to care for himself. in all honesty, he really is probably at the point where he shouldn't be living alone. he can't remember how to use the microwave he's used the past 7 years, nor sometimes his tv, his checkbook was nearly $1,000 off before my aunt took over his finances (more on this below).thankfully my grandfather lives 2 minutes from me, 5 minutes from my aunt and 10 minutes from my uncle whom only keeps in touch with my grandfather. he has people close to him who are there to check on him consistently. this is the first time anyone in my family has been in the position of caring for a dementia patient, and in all honesty i feel like nobody has any idea what they're really doing. when my aunt took over his finances, she tried to upend his very particular routine, cancel credit cards, etc. because she deemed it unnecessary and told him as such. his finances were always a huge deal to him, i understand that it’s no longer imperative that his credit score is consistently perfect, but he is still having a horribly difficult time relinquishing this responsibility to her. her attitude and being irritated with him asking constantly if his bills are paid bothers me, because she just can’t realize that he doesn’t want to accept that he can no longer care for himself. i feel crappy for even thinking this, but my mom &amp; aunt’s callousness to this situation makes me feel like they just can’t wait to ship him off to a home with having done no research, for him to die there alone and rarely visited by most of the family. my mom and my aunt have decided they're going to ""sit down and figure out what we're going to do with him"", and this makes me nervous. they both seem to have very little patience and understanding of the fact that his moodiness and irritation is a symptom of his cognitive decline. he was easily one of the most intelligent people i've known, his biggest fear *ever* was developing this disease- i know he's terrified. regarding this discussion on his future care, i was not invited in on this, nor was my older sister, even though we are the two who visit with him the most, do his laundry, help with his grocery orders etc. my grandfather was more of a father figure to me than any other person in my life, so i’m quite honestly pissed. i’ve decided that i would do as much research on symptoms/what to expect as well as potential in-home nurses or assisted living facilities to the best of my abilities and basically force myself into the decision making. i don’t want their lack of desire to care for him to overrule his happiness, comfort and dignity. at this point though, i’m not even sure where to start, most times it feels like i need answers and advice to questions i don’t even have yet. it’s hard because he is still essentially “all there” in regards to his ability to communicate, have opinions, interests, reading etc.  to those of you who have family members in the same boat, where did you begin your search for care? what do you think are the most important things to ask a potential care provider? more importantly though, what can we do to make sure this is as easy for him as we can make it? what should i begin to expect? i know no two people are alike, but i feel like i’m grabbing at straws trying to wrap my mind around how fast everything is probably going to happen. am i being too “nice” about this, making excuses for his behalf or babying him? thanks to everyone who got through this wall of text. i have nobody to vent to who has any kind of experience or knowledge with the situation, i’d greatly appreciate any insight you may have.",,0
"my dad has been the primary caregiver for my mom (58) for a couple years now. last week there was an incident at home where my mom got violent and my dad had to call the police. took three cops to restrain her and they ended up going to the local hospital. it's been about 8 days in the hospital and the restraints have been off for a few, but she still gets very agitated at times with hitting and spitting when we try to get her to eat, go to the bathroom, take meds, etc. the docs and nurses have been advocating on her behalf to go into a skilled nursing facility, but we found out that insurance has now denied coverage to stay at the hospital any longer, and they also denied the skilled nursing facility. it seems like all the care facilities we have talked to will not take patients that exhibit violent behavior.it seems like we're running out of options now. what can we do at this point? the idea of my dad having to take her back home and care for it doesn't sound safe for either of them.i think ideally we want her at a care facility for a couple weeks until they can sort out the meds and get the violence resolved, then get her back home with dad with some in-home assistance.",,0
"my mother was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment due to alzheimer's about 4 months ago. that was after going through the medical chain of command and testing for about 6 months before the dx. she is 72 and is not in the greatest of health. the thing that throws everyone off is that she looks so young. anyhow, she is semi-functional. she can still care for herself daily to a point. she barely cleans and has to be reminded to bathe but she can taxi to run errands without getting lost. she has forgotten to pay bills, and has a nasty attitude often which was not her normal personality. it started when the symptoms first started. anyhow, this is the second month in a row that her bank account has been overdrawn. she sells things on ebay and etsy and now she is being super irresponsible in shipping them. i can't do it for her because of my work/transportation situation. i caught her washing her dishes with her hand yesterday instead of a sponge, etc.she is in denial and won't let anyone take over for her.  she even lied to me about the alzheimer's at first because i couldn't go to the first neurologist appt with her. i figured it out because he put her on aricept and then i asked him at her second appt. her insurance won't pay for any care until her alzheimer's is worse and she goes to the doctor and tells them she's fine. she makes appts and goes to them without me and then tells me afterwords.anyhow, please comment if you have experience with a person who was in denial and was still semi functional and fighting it. i'm so frustrated.",,0
"my mother-in-law has alzheimer's and is currently living alone, but she is progressing quickly. she doesn't have a ton of money saved, so we're unclear on what long-term care or financial planning should look like. what i'd love is some sort of ""elder care"" advisor who would help guide us through this. letting us know the best path to take her finances. letting us know what sort of care is realistic with our financial limitations. most resources so far seem to basically be call centers reading from flowcharts. does anyone here know of any professionals who do this sort of work?",,0
"my dad is 61 and he has been showing signs of memory loss for the last couple of years. he lives alone and i live in another state. i went to visit him recently. he is working and owns his own business, but got let go of a major contract a year ago. i'm starting to worry about him and his abilities to take care of himself, but he's pretty prideful and not open with his finances at all. i know he doesn't have a 401k and has limited savings.anyways, in february this year i took him to see his primary care doctor, and they did a cognitive test which consisted of asking him questions like ""where are you right now?"", ""what year is it?"", etc. he got most of these correct because he isn't senile. however, they told him to repeat back 3 words, they asked him a minute later and he couldn't remember any of them. he is aware of where he is, who people are, etc. but his short-term memory is awful. my grandma passed away from alzheimer's when she was in her 80's, so i know this runs in my family. the primary care doctor didn't want to run further tests, but she agreed to prescribe him aricept and send a referral to a neurologist for further testing. i finally convinced him to pick the aricept up from the pharmacy. but, i just asked if he's been taking his memory medicine and he just said, ""i'm not on those now. i need to call the doc. i'll do that"". which is great but i don't think he will remember to call, he forgets everything. i can call to remind him but it's just becoming to get a bit overwhelming. i'm worried about him, and we haven't been able to really have an open conversation about his memory and he doesn't communicate. he likes to pretend he has everything under control, if that makes sense. it's been a few months and an uphill battle to even get an appointment for a neurologist, too. the one place in town that takes his insurance is booked and hasn't even gotten his referral scanned in and it seems like we are no where near getting in for an appointment. has anyone had this issue? also, does anyone have any tips for taking care of a parent when you live out of state? i want to visit more but it's just been hard, especially since covid hit. i went to visit him last weekend even though i probably shouldn't have risked it? idk.",,0
"hi everyone,tl; dr - have questions about finding documents. is this an appropriate place? i'm glad i found a supportive community with so much experience and information at their disposal. i hope to be more frequent and provide any support/ideas i can :)i somehow just found this sub and have been reading some stories between searches. my apologies; i've been caring for my mother since i graduated with my b.a. in 2013. family fell apart, ptsd, etc etc. i can work much better if i deal with things ""clinically"" as a research project versus commiserating right now. i'm sure others here vacillate between being ok and the smallest thing prompting a breakdown into a pile of goo :) i'm afraid i've already rambled; i've got a complete and total poa/medical poa for her and her husband. i have some information, but mom has developed the habit of just throwing stuff away.mom was the one who ran the house and knew where everything was. they had a filing cabinet with everything - much of which was (probably?) lost in hurricane harvey. my step dad has somehow turned from decent to a legitimate impediment to me or anyone helping. my role has always (supposed to have) been to take care of paperwork, making decisions with doctors, etc. (quick: i'm the durable/medical poa sans restrictions for mother and step dad. also executor of inherited trust which names only me and brother)anyway, the whole story is quite long but i'm struggling with things which i know can be done without a lawyer in texas: * how to find **if** various things exist prior to her death (401ks not rolled over; life insurance, etc)* how to get a will done. they have no real assets (see harvey), but there are things in the house i want for my brother and i. i can't write the will because i'm poa and a beneficiary. i have no idea if she has a formal diagnosis of alzheimer's/dementia, but it's pretty clear if we took her to anyone that she's not in her right mind. * i've taken care of loads of things but i know there are things i'm missing. i've never coordinated end of life/funeral/estates, etc. i have a cursory knowledge of legal stuff but don't know what all goes into death and bequests, etc.i sincerely doubt ~~idiotic~~ stepdad will try to fight me on anything - beyond yelling and being a victim, naturally. he assumes that he'll lose, neither of us have money for attorneys, and the trust/estate/movable property aren't large enough to survive through a probate trial, i'd imagine. if you made it this far, thank you so much for your patience. &lt;3 i'm a grad student trying to finish my master's if only the ~~stepdad~~ family would stop making messes for me to clean ;) i'm certain i rambled; i'm exhausted all the time and other life demands, etc. i also apologize greatly if this isn't the proper forum. please delete me and, if possible, could the mods behind the curtain direct me to a more suitable subreddit :)thank y'all again &lt;3",,0
"hello all,my father is 71 years old and has been fighting dementia and other such issues from the time he was about 65. he's a vietnam veteran and worked in construction his entire adult life. he retired at 64 and within a year was in two car accidents that clearly happened due to lack of reaction time and slowing mental capacity. the first accident was significant (the front axle of his truck fell out after he clipped the back right of a turning car when he didn't see its left turn signal until the last two seconds). the second he clipped another car in a parking lot while leaving. this is when we stopped letting him drive. brain scans after the accident did not indicate anything out of the ordinary.he really began to decline from 68 on and was diagnosed two years ago with pca (posterior cortical atrophy) which is considered an atypical form of alzheimer's and there is some debate on whether he has parkinson's disease or not. from what i have read, pca mostly affects visuals but anyway, he's clearly in the throes on dementia. he cannot be alone, he's losing his memory, asks the same questions over and over again, struggles with walking, etc. my mother makes too much money apparently to not receive any assistance through the va and he did not plan for his retirement and thus does not have long-term care insurance.my mother is in the midst of starting a divorce so that he can apply for medicaid without draining my mother of all of her assets so that we can put him in a suitable home. we have fought for two years about whether dad needs to be in a home but everyone has come to the conclusion that dad needs professional care full time.my sister and i watch him on our alternating days off. my mother is younger and still works full time. my other sister just had a baby and cannot assist. a family friend who is a professional caregiver takes the day-shifts two-three days a week. my two older half-brothers (one who is well off and the other who is not) live out of state and refuse to get involved despite my pleadings. my mother is a difficult woman to get along with and has too much ""pride"" to continuously ask for their assistance (trust me, i've tried).we do not want to put dad in a home currently if we can avoid it for the short term because of coronavirus. he survived lung tumor surgery at 50 and had 1/3 of a lung removed so that would definitely not go well.he can still feed himself, shower himself, go to the bathroom, brush his teeth, shave, etc. he cannot dress himself without assistance. as i said, he cannot be alone anymore, other than for an hour in the morning when he's waking up. after that, his anxiety is too high and he panics when he's alone for more than 5 to 10 minutes.he does experience sundowners during the day that is sometimes super hard to deal with. my sister has gotten medical marijuana for him and that does help somewhat.also, as i've heard with other dementia patients: the man will not sleep.he will sleep for an hour or two at the start of the night and then gets up every hour after in the night to go to urinate. he had his prostate ""steamed"" a year ago due to frequent urination (he was on flomax before that of course) and his lack of sleep was unbearable to everyone. but it has not helped. he cannot retain urine. he needs to urinate at least 7 or 8 times a day and all night like i said. when he urinates, it's rarely more than 50ml at a time.his neurologist says that it is completely dementia related and anything we try to do with a urologist is useless. melatonin has no effect.we finally had a geriatic doctor give him benzodiazepines a few months ago and it had absolutely no effect on his sleeping habits, he continues to get up every hour of the night.does anyone that has experienced a similar situation know of something that will help my father sleep through the urge to urinate? his lack of sleep is leading to premature deterioration and i refuse to believe that nothing out there will work. i hear that they will not prescribe dementia patients certain sedatives because of fall-risks but we need something to help him until this pandemic has subsided and he can get professional help without immediate risk of his life.anything we can ask the doctor about is greatly appreciated.",,0
"i’m taking care of my step dads mom and she cries all the time. i’m pretty sure it’s fake crying most of the time. she just yells “help me” nonstop. i haven’t seen anyone talk about using the “cry it out” method they use for babies. is that not something we should do? because if not, how the hell do you get anything done ever? some days she cries every half hour. and some nights, like tonight, it’s every ten minutes. i told her to “shut up” for the first time. i got so overwhelmed, i’m sick, and tired and i just told her to shut up. i feel a little bad but also i really do want her to just shut up. she can’t get into any trouble seeing as she can’t get out of bed on her own and can’t walk without her walker. so would it be so bad if i just ignored her for a while? closed my bedroom door, turned off the baby monitor, and just ignored her for half an hour? my first half an hour of peace at home since last year when she started getting progressively worse at an accelerated pace? she is on 100mg quetiapine. she started at 25 and it worked for two nights, same with 50mg, and now same with 100. but it only works for those two nights. then it’s back to normal. my step dad never comes to see her. only once or twice a month. we almost put her in a memory care facility but then my mom talked him out of it because it might “disturb her routine.” so now my boyfriend and i are stuck with her for god knows how long with no help. her insurance doesn’t even cover a night nurse. i don’t know how much longer i can do this.",,0
"i 23 (f) have been caring for my grandma since i was 16. she lived by herself until i had to suddenly move her into a nursing home last year. for about 6/7 years, i took care of her errands/doctors visits at least once a week. whenever i had travel plans, i would arrange a neighbor or friend to bring her food and her meds. around the time the pandemic hit last year, i had to go over 2-4 times a week (she lived an hour away) to meal prep and take care of her daily needs. i was paid in lunch meals and coffee. she never really learned english, became a retired housewife at 40, and hasn’t driven a car in 5 decades. so when my grandpa passed away several years ago, she became completely reliant on me, even though i had to finish high school, started college, worked 30+ hours a week in 3 part time jobs, had internships, finished college early and graduated with a masters degree a semester early too. i thought her decline in cognition was a normal part of aging until she had a diabetic seizure (turns out she wasn’t taking her meds like i thought, i think she was tossing them away or something) and the hospital informed me they were diagnosing her with vascular dementia. thank god before things got bad i had her sign a poa and started diving into her finances when she was officially diagnosed with dementia because it occurred to me she maybe wasn’t paying her bills. i found huge credit card debits, helocs, loans, no savings etc etc. i also found she stashed her bills into a drawer and was on the verge of having all her services cut off because she simply forgot to pay her bills. i caught her up to date on everything and consolidated her high interest credit card debt and quickly paid it off. now, after her diagnosis, all of her strange habits from about january 2020 - november 2020 made sense. however, she was put in rehab care for her seizure and i had to quickly scramble to figure out what to do. this is where i’m still having trouble coming to terms with what i had to do. i decided to sell her home of 30 years, the house i sort of grew up in, and most of her possessions because i realized, i could not live in and take care of her daily needs full time. i have zero medical training, and am starting my professional career in a cutthroat field. my student loans prevent me from not working too. well, i was unemployed twice in the middle of everything, but i’m putting all my remaining energy into finding a new job atm. she also fell in a sticky position where she could not afford a live in caretaker in our state on her social security, but did not financially qualify for assistive services or welfare because her social security is too high... the irony. the other stressor was that her home sold in 11 days, and i had one weekend to sell everything. my grandma couldn’t afford an estate sale company, so i spent a solid 72 hours on pure adrenaline selling furniture and all the crap she was semi-hoarding. her extra clothes, photo albums, family docs, and a few china sets are currently piled in my closet. i have now set up her nursing home to be paid for the next three years on private pay thanks to the sale of her home and estate and then she will be on government assistance. she doesn’t even remember her home anymore, and thinks she’s in 1944 in her home country... it’s currently wwii. why am i here? i think i was led to this reddit group because i’m looking for comfort. my grandmas only child, my dad, is incapable of helping because of his addictions. my mom has accompanied me to a few things, and acted as an official translator for my grandmas native language twice, but legally has no role. my sibling is a cancer survivor, and so i can’t give her any responsibilities because most of it involves hospitals, and she understandably has severe anxiety around anything medical and is too young to understand the severity of the finances. any other relatives are long dead or assholes living in another country. i won’t inherit anything because if anything is left over from the nursing home, it will go straight to my father, who will not be giving the inheritance to us. and even if he wanted to, he owes thousands to debtors who will be seizing it all. sadly my grandparents did not set up any protections for me and my sibling against our dad. yes, i have consulted three separate attorneys. it is too late. my grandma’s dementia is getting much worse, but physically she will be living for a long time. she is now seeing her other son who died at birth as a ghostly toddler hanging around her nursing home. she also had a full conversation to “something” standing next to her the other day when i had a window visit. i have chills thinking about it because she talked into the air, and jumped as if someone had brushed against her. i could see the whole room around her, nobody was there. her face turned different and her eyes were not hers for about 20 seconds. she also sees her mom sitting on her bed every night. thank you for reading.",,0
"so my moms social security and pension are going to be paying for the rent/services at a home with a caregiver. she needs 100% of it and is in a ton of debt, i know that credit card companies cant garnish but she owes taxes which i recently learned can be garnished from her ss.is there any help to get rid of this debt with the irs? i can try and make her set up a payment plan but that's still going to be taking quite a bit away. i mean is there a stage where the irs has to back off because she needs somewhere to live?",,0
"my mother has been having anxiety and depression issues for 10 or more years.  memory issues started popping up about 5 years ago.  mostly just words ""missing"" but she can barely get a sentence out now because the words just don't come to her.  my father left her about 2.5 years ago and has since remarried.  they didn't have a great relationship at the end and i don't blame him.  since he left, she tried online dating but unfortunately fell victim to an online scammer and subsequently sent him over $150,000 cad because he ""needed help"".  we knew this was happening, tried to convince her he wasn't real and she fought against us.  we could do nothing to help her, we tried everything.  her dr was convinced that nothing was wrong with her.  come to this week where she asked me for $200 because she had no food.  i told her she needed to talk to me about what is going on because i can help her.  turns out she has lost all ability to budget, and payments were bouncing at the bank.  her bank then closed her account due to fraud.  she was on the brink of losing her car insurance and health insurance.  turns out she had also extended her credit capacity and had loans everywhere and was paying more in loan payments than she has coming in.  all this loaned money was sent to the scammer.  thankfully this week we recognized the extent of the issue and i was able to get her to a new bank and i have power of attorney over her finances now.  also found no food in her house, except for a pack of cheese slices.  she has been living off of the apples on the tree in her yard.  her prescriptions hadn't been filled in 6 weeks or more so i set her up on a monthly delivery from the pharmacy so she gets her much needed drugs.  i noticed her hand writing is getting bigger, and sometimes looks like a childs handwriting.  i am going to try to get her into the drs office this week, which will likely just be a phone call due to covid.  her dr has been so adament that she is fine i can only hope the recent events will convince him she is unwell.  my sister and i have suspected alzheimer's / dementia for some time now so i hope we can get a diagnosis.  any advice or thoughts?",,0
"hi folks,my 68 y/o mother was diagnosed with mild alzheimers this past april (though i noticed issues as early as 2014), and my aunt recently passed from the disease (technically renal failure, but you know how it goes). at the time, when my mother was diagnosed and the doctor said she was only in the mild stages, i somewhat disagreed with him, thinking that she was edging the moderates stages. after my aunt passed, though, my mom seems to take a downturn. here's a list of her current state:-sleeps quite a bit, maybe 10 hours a day.-not really repeating herself, as opposed to my aunt. we delayed getting her evaluated for quite a while because she never did this.-can no longer drive, manage her own finances, prepare her own food unless it's pb&amp;j or microwave, and has stopped the bulk of her cleaning aside from the kitchen (she was a very fastidious person previous and probably vacuumed once a week).-obsessively checks/cleans the kitchen whenever i leave it-wanders around the house quite a bit-has a grasp of the seasons, but i don't think she could tell me the date or even the month if i asked her (she didn't even realize it was christmas eve though we'd just told her the day before)-withdrawn, often speaks/whispers to herself-still bathing mostly daily, but lately has sometimes not changed out of sleepwear (again, unusual for her).-loss of inhibitions (i've heard the aricept made aid in this)most uncomfortably, she's developed several behavioral problems that are almost all directed at me, her caregiver. i've been called a thief and a leech, she's recently tried to block the front door with small stoneware jars (very unsuccessfully, of course), and it's like she can't wait to tell random people about how i've stolen her money or how it's my fault she can't drive anymore.is it safe to say that she's well into the moderate stages of alzheimer's at this point?",,0
"my father is 69 and was diagnosed with this about, meh, 10 years ago. he probably had signs of this before they found it, however. when this happened to him, every thing went to shit. my dad got sick, my life-long animal friend rocky the cat died, this led to my father being fired / forced into somewhat early retirement. my mother never worked and was a stay at home mother. a few years after this, my radial nerve in my right arm was destroyed by a rather uncommon virus, which took away my function of my right hand (which was the dominant one) from my elbow down. this caused me to lose the ability to do my favorite things, such as use a keyboard and mouse at the same time (i wanted to be an electronic engineer), drive my cars for tuning and racing purposes, because they are all stick shift. i couldn't shoot hoops anymore. this led me down the path of substance abuse, which led to legal issues. i want to start my life on my own, as i'm in my mid twenties, but have already been taken away recently due to things out of my control, and don't want to miss any remaining time my father has out on my own only to lose him shortly and regret not being there. i live with my parents and my girlfriend of three years. my mother is on medication for having a botched back surgery, and is in pain and can't move too well. she is always in a bad mood, having to see her loved one fall apart, and from the daily challenges of having to play ""where's waldo"" with 10000 different objects that my father misplaces every day. each day it's a hunt for a wallet, a flashlight, a can of cat food, whatever. my dad was always the ""cool dad"", never scary. oh, heres 20$, go see a movie and get a meal. mom said no to a sleepover? well i don't see why not. is your girlfriend hungry, too? heres extra for her. lets go get you that new game even if i'm behind on bills. i was always way closer to my dad then my mom. he was always the one on my side. now, he's on no ones side. he never got angry, ever. and now, he's angry all the time. no matter waht you say to him, he gets mad. most times, he just stares off into space while i talk to him. then, when i'm done, i will get a ""hmm"", and then he will walk away. i want to talk to him, but i don't know what about. he taught me most everything i know about computers and electronics as well as cars, which i take great pride in. now, when i talk or ask questions, it feels like hes not even paying attention. where i say a statement or ask a question, i basically get the same response, which is nothing. even things i know he knew, or at least should, he won't. his sense of time is greatly distorted. for example, he loves and basically only eats ice cream. hey dad, do you want strawberry ice cream? yeah sure, that sounds good, i haven't had that in 10 years or so, when in reality we had it last month. we have pet cats that he absolutely loves and adores and spends most of his time with, petting or conversating, if you can call it that. i'm glad he has something that makes him happy but it's almost like they are more his family then me. he will buy phone after phone after phone, because he can't figure them out. he thinks that by getting a new phone, he might find one he can actually use. the issue, however, is that they are all android based, and therefore, almost the same. i'm an adult and need to look out for myself but am in a down time recently and could use a small win somewhere. i've been pining over the new cod since it came out, as i thought if i got myself back into something i loved before i turned to substances, it could help with my overall sobriety and keep my head on straight. in the past, he would surely let me pay him back for it. now, i can't even ask because he can't recall what his finances look like and won't take any chances, which i can't blame him for, because in the grand scheme of things, me getting call of duty isn't going to change anyones life, however, it would go a long way towards making me happy. i just don't know what to do. i have no acceptance of this. i don't want to treat him like i see other sons treat their fathers with this illness, treating them like little children, building lego sets, etc, treating them like a baby. i don't want that kind of relationship with him, and would be faking it to him as well as myself if i tried. i don't know if this is terrible to say or not, but some times i think i'd rather him have something that wasn't so drawn out and character ruining. at least if he went quicker, he'd still be who he was and remember the things he did in his life, such as race cars, fly planes, build communications equipment on war boats, build computers, care for all animals, instruct skydiving, do amateur radio for 40+ years, and so much more. now, he's just...some one else. when i talk to him or see him watching tv, it's like hes not there. it's a constant hunt for lost items every day, which he claims were stolen, when no one has been here. he will say something a long the times of "".....did you hear that xxxxx happened this week?"" three or four times at one sitting for dinner. i don't even know the point of me posting this i just have no one else to talk to. my girlfriend, at least partly, thinks that i am just playing off this situation to try and draw pity and that it's not really that big of a deal, or at least that's how i feel. i never see eye to eye with my mother, we butt heads at every opportunity for a reason i will probably never know. most of my irl friends have grown up, moved on, left, or we just don't talk. some left because of the reputation they heard about me and some legal issues. my online friends who i've gamed with for 20+ years in some cases, aren't very close to me any more. some stopped gaming, others swapped games to ones i don't own or can't afford. some grew up, went to school, got married, and are gone. most of my online buddies treated me better then my irl friends. they would come to visit, take me on a vacation, come stay a week here or there, gift me a game so i could continue to play with the group, treated me very well. but they are all basically gone. i don't do social media of any sort so i don't have a way to find people / have people find me, and after losing / switching phones last year, lost the only gateway people had to find me. i enjoy playing league of legends with my male cousin whos a few years younger, as he doesn't judge me and knows most of what i've gone through, but became a full pharmacist and has seen his free time / time to game almost completely diminish. i love sports, but uh, yeah. cleveland. no lebron anymore. rats. i know i'm not any different then any other child of a parent with this illness, but i just hate change so damn much it makes me sick. i literally feel like i wasn't supposed to be born at the time i was, that i was meant for something else. i just can't wrap my motivation (what small amounts their is) around getting an underpaying job, struggling to afford anything i want/ need, having no free time, and then coming home to a depression factory. i don't want to do it, and don't even think i can. so once again i don't know what i hope to get out of this, but, at the very least, thanks for reading. afternoon all.",,0

"hi friends,i am caring for my 71yo father who has been diagnosed with lewy body dementia. he was taking seroquel for about two weeks while waiting for insurance approval for nuplazid. he hated the side effects — said it made him physically slow and exhausted. we switched to the nuplazid a week ago and he says it makes him feel “crazy.” can anyone share any person anecdotes about their loved one’s experience taking nuplazid? more back information for those interested: he has been having “cognitive issues” for about two years, worsening significantly in times of stress (like when my mom was having surgery for example, but has otherwise been manageable). after my mom died suddenly in december things really took a turn for the worst and he has been declining rapidly. finally convinced him to see a neurologist twomonths ago who diagnosed him. he lives by himself in our family home which is across the country from where i live. i have no siblings, so i’ve been traveling back and forth frequently to get things in order for him but it’s becoming rapidly apparent that he is not capable of living alone nor is the isolation good for him. vivid hallucinations started maybe three weeks ago and he went from understanding they were hallucinations to now being insistent that the people living in his house are real.

"i have arranged for an elder care service to start coming to my parents house to help them. my dad (91) has bad memory issues and cognitive decline but no dementia diagnosis. my mom (86) is in good shape...still drives and has a good handle on her day to day stuff....however she won’t / doesn’t want to provide housekeeping chores for my dad....she has enough with managing his finances and transportation. anyway i finally convinced her he needs a cleaner at the very least. his bedroom and bathroom were a horror show until i cleaned them. i live very far away and can’t  be in charge of that upkeep. so tomorrow the service is coming by to meet my parents and talk about what they will do and how often (they do more than clean...physical assistance with bathing and hygiene, socialization, hopefully maybe walking with him for exercise). we haven’t told my dad yet because i didn’t want him to freak out about it....my plan is to tell him tomorrow morning a few hours before they arrive. i’m so scared he is going to freak out...he hates feeling like people think he can’t take care of himself and he gets real mad and yells. he fell down yesterday because he was insisting in walking up this short flight of steps on a deck but he wouldn’t hold the handrail or my arm....just kept telling me to get away from him....then of course he caught his toe and went down. he also got lost in his own neighborhood two weeks ago because he got mad at my mom and stomped out of the house. he called her to pick him up but couldn’t tell her where he was. this is par for the course for his judgment and reactions to people offering him help. please tell me he isn’t going to hate me for having these people come to the house.",,0
"i'm 26 yo and my mom is 56 with ftd/alzheimer's. ever since she's been diagnosed last november, i've been frozen in action. i'm just now starting to take care of her finances and i feel like a total failure. i'm allowing accounts to go into a negative balance because i can't bring myself to switch her autopay. i can't talk to her on the phone (but i can text) because i've been working through some sexual and emotional abuse she did. i recently got medication for adhd, and that's helping a little, but i feel that i can't juggle her affairs, my processing of my childhood/mental health, and my own fumbling life. she only has myself and my brother, but i also can't really get my brother to help. am i just an inflexible, bitter person who can't move forward? i don't think it's wallowing when i want to move on and just can't figure out how. thank you for reading, i'm having a particularly down day (which i'm sure is coloring this post) and it helps to reach out.",,0
"dad and mom getting markedly worse. dad is vocally depressed daily. not sure if any medication is gonna help. all he wants is people to drive him around and provide access to excessive tylenol and infinite road trips. especially if it's family but with no regard to us having to work. i wish we could get him set up with enough cannabis to just sleep away every day except waking up for food. i wish we were all independently wealthy so we could(!) just hang out with him entertaining every moment of every day. i fear it wouldn't matter and he'd still ask for ""the cure"" and more doctors to fix what no one can fix today. they're both showing a recent lucidity around recognizing they're in memory care, so now they hate the fact that they're stuck with people who can't talk or move properly. family overseas seems interested in taking them in, but for how long could they do it and would it be ok for my parents to die or suffer where i didn't know what was happening. am i allowed to disregard their suffering? i'm not even the legal poa for health or finance. but what of my sibling who is? what are the legal minimum levels of care they can give? moral minimum? argh",,0
"dad. 74. highly agitated on his good days, mean/nasty/vicious on his worst. it's *always* been like this, we chalked up to stress but 1000% worse now. he's been in a slow decline for roughly a decade, but looking back the foundations of this started around 1996 when he would sporadically confused family members. now we think he's in a tailspin to the really nonfunctioning part of this.now he's confused and pissed off all the time. suspicious. in denial. his irish twin (10 months apart, twin is younger) just tested mild-moderate on some test for dementia. his mother died of alz when i was a baby at age 68. he will not go to the doctor. had an appointment with an internist  gerontologist. refused to go, blew a gasket. later apologized to our mom and said he was sorry and just caught off guard. please make a new appointment, he will go. this was 2 days ago.yesterday pulled the same shit, saw the appointment still written on their calendar and bugged the fuck out. i got cryptic messages from my mom and drove 2 hours out there to witness his nonsense and record some of it. so vicious and angry. he is combative and pissed off and defensive and mean no matter the approach.i guess we're beat, huh? we need to wait until something really bad happens and she just has to call police? he's fiercely independent, grew up very poor (8 people, 1 bedroom) in a sleepy town, was drafted, worked very hard for everything. i think part of this is he feels vulnerable for once and can't handle it. ig won't see my mom without my dad, so that's off the table. they need to see him in person before doing anything. aside from the mood stuff, he confuses everyone, forgets where he is going or where he is at, has screwed up finances (extraordinarily large donations to charities he's always given to), handed my mom a check for *60,000* dollars last year from some account they had forgotten about apparently (didn't get the whole story on this one but yeah), put phone in the freezer, put remote on phone stand, put remote in freezer, forgets where i live and got upset when i told him i was in philadelphia, doesn't know the holiday or cause of celebration at large family events, etc. please help.",,0
"i have been a bit reticent to talk about this but here goes. long story ahead.i moved back in with my father(now 87) last year. i am on what i hope is temporary disability. was suffering from bouts of vertigo(those have passed) and when they were running every test in the book to try and figure out the cause, they found i was low on testosterone. not that it was causing the issue but they started me on testosterone injections, which led to me getting a dvt in my left leg. now i have to elevate it above my heart to get the swelling out of my left lower leg/foot. i moved back in with him for two purposes, one my disability took over a year to process, so no income or insurance during that time. secondly, he needed someone to drive him to dr appts and such. he has congestive heart failure, his kidneys were failing(they just went kaput and he just started dialysis). i now have income and insurance through ssd(again, hopefully temporary, being stuck at home sucks ass). so i have setup physical therapy for my right shoulder(frozen shoulder) and joined the health club(with a pool) next door. i can do those while he is sitting in the dialysis chair. that is not what i need help with though, which is what brings me to this thread. at times during the past year, my father has went in to bouts of dementia, varying in intensity, from ones i can eventually bring him back out of to lucidity to ones where i had to get the ambulance out to subdue him and take him to the hospital. each time he has been dehydrated. whether that was the cause or just a coincidence, i am not 100% sure. he had the chf and takes diuretics, which keeps him from getting fluid on his lungs but also killed his kidneys. when he goes into one of these states, he does nonsensical stuff, repetitively. like he took a loaf of bread, broke each piece into very small pieces and then took a spoon to mix it up, over and over. also the last major time, we found him in his bathroom, stark naked, shaving his face with an electric razor. he went about that for an hour, with me trying to get him out of there, finally had to get the ambulance to bring some ketamine to get him to the hospital. he was fine after they gave him iv fluids. he does not show all the signs of alzheimer's, as he remembers everyone, he just gets stuck in a loop of repetitive nonsense.just wondering if anyone else here has had to deal with something similar, any tips or possible diagnoses?",,0
"so, yeah, what the title says.  i had a serious conversation where i suggested a sleep study- she told me her friend had one and they didn't find anything.  obviously denial is in effect, but there is also resentment for bringing up the topic.  i talked to her after a week long vacation together, her memory was problematic but her behavior was worse, she has become impulsive about things like crossing streets without looking. what the hell am i supposed to do here?  i'm afraid she will kill someone with her car.  i'm not yet afraid that she will burn her house down by forgetting about food on the stove, but i'm concerned that she isn't taking any steps toward cleaning out her hoarder house and moving to a condo or something.  this is not a situation where she would be considered legally incompetent to make decisions, but that day is coming and plans are not being made.  she has long term care insurance, unless she stopped making payments out of spite.no siblings or other close family members.  she used to be very close with my wife, but my mom seems to blame the wife for me asking her to see a doctor.",,0
"this is going to be a lot, and probably really long... i appreciate anyone who manages to get through some of it. i've only very rarely frequented this sub reddit, as i've kind of just felt lost and didn't feel up to reading it all. i hope that my less-than-sugarcoated approach to writing about my experience with my mom does not offend anyone. i also wrote this over the course of several, sleep-deprived hours. we all have our coping mechanisms. i'm not great at finding humor in this still. there's a lot of dirty laundry from the past that prevents that, still. i'm 26 (27 in a couple months), living with my parents, and my mom has early on-set dementia. she has pretty much three settings:1) desperately loyal housewife: she goes to extreme lengths to please my dad, which recently included forcing her bedroom door closed while i was trying to get in to get toilet paper so i could pee at 2 in the morning. when she's like this, she's extremely paranoid about doing something to upset my dad (even though he really doesn't get mad at her.) when she's like this, she'll often make sweeping statements about how ""oh we all love him, he's so wonderful, aren't we lucky?"" considering the past problems our family had before my mom got sick, it's pretty tough to hear.2) bitter, vicious bitch: self-explanatory. yes, i know it's not ""really"" her, and no, i generally don't let it affect me. our family has always had a pretty screwed up power dynamic, and my mom always had her passive-aggressive side and a hot temper. trying to discern in my memories which times were really her and which weren't have been a thorn in my side. 3) confused child: meek and confused, very much needs help to get a basic command done. we see a lot more of this these days. so yeah, that's my mom in a nutshell. she's been deteriorating for years, but my dad wasn't on board and was in denial right alongside her. my sister and i ended up feeling like we were in some twisted twilight zone where we were seeing things, maybe *we* were the ones going crazy, because no one else would admit to seeing what we did. eventually my sister got a chance to move out, i didn't, and here i am. i've finally figured out what i want to major in and pursue in my life. i've been at the city college on and off for years, working on and off at crap jobs, going back for a semester, rinse, repeat. i've been massively depressed for more than half of my life and fell into the trap of ""well i can handle it."" now i've aged out of my dad's insurance, i have no job, and am living off of about $800 left of financial aid until i find a job. i'm gonna be fine; my dad doesn't let me starve. he will pay for gas if he needs to. but i still feel like i'm just incredibly stupid and useless and doing it all horribly, stupidly wrong. it feels like life isn't worth living when up against the utter crap i can't seem to fix or get out of. my mom is dying, my family is screwed up, my dad is still in denial in some ways, and i just can't seem to find it in me to love anything about myself enough to think i have what it takes to have a good life. the person i always thought would be there to help me figure things out is gone. i have to work so hard to keep my emotional state hidden from my mom because all it does is make her feel upset or scared. i'm so tired.i'm trying really, really hard to prove i'm useful to my dad, because you guessed it, living at home and not having life figured out is a huge self-esteem downer. i do as many errands as my dad throws at me, and will do them at the expense of my time, my gas, and plans i previously had. i handle all of the grocery shopping, i take my mom to appointments if he can't, i am the primary caretaker for our four animals, two cats and two dogs. while i cannot afford to pay for any of them, i schedule their vet appointments, i take them in, i medicate them for fleas and anything else that pops up. i make sure they have food and water, i clean up the litterbox and any messes. i keep my dad apprised of anything going on with them. i make sure my mom eats something. i let him know when we're low on things like dish soap, toilet paper, and paper towels. i cook cold dishes that can last for a few days at a time, most often something like a pasta salad. i try and keep track of what my mom is eating and what she isn't (anyone else have dementia family members who have new cravings every few months?) i notify him of anything out of the norm with my mom. i have worked really, really hard to avoid getting upset with my mom or losing my temper. i'm much better than i used to be, but of course could always use improvement.none of it feels like it's ever enough. i'm still stuck at home. despite the few moments where i feel like i'm doing enough to prove it's okay for me to be home still and figuring things out, there are always the long patches of me telling myself no, you're doing it wrong, you're useless. i live in a very expensive state, so moving out by myself is really not an option. some days i struggle to get myself out of bed, let alone to look for a job. it induces such panic and anxiety in me to even think about going back to the dead-end jobs i used to work, but what else is there when you just have a high school diploma still? i just wish i could feel like what i'm doing is enough, but i don't. tldr: my life is a mess. triangle of take care of mom, get a job and work to save and live, and go to school are constantly at odds with each other and out of balance and i honestly just feel like i'll never be able to feel like i'm doing anything enough. my dad insists he never wanted my sister nor i to be responsible for my mom, and yet when we go over the list of everything that wouldn't get done if we stopped being involved... it goes on. we're afraid he'll wake up one day and lose his mind.is there anyone out there who has anything remotely similar to this situation? thanks for reading up until now. this has all been coming on for months, and it just kind of boiled over last night with me feeling really, really awful about not having a job and my own income. i feel like such a failure, and my mom is gone and not here to help me figure out life. she walks around like a ghost with greasy hair, unkempt clothes. i can't force her to shower. i can't force her to wash her hands. i don't think she's even on a single medication related to dementia, like anti-psychotics and mood stabilizers. i can't force my dad to get a caretaker. and when we finally get one, the relief i'll feel will quickly be replaced with the realization that i no longer have a purpose in this house, and that i'm just wasting space.thanks.",,0
"how exactly does one go about getting a poa or health care proxy or any kind of help at all for someone who needs help but refuses to see it or even go to a doctor to be told as much?my grandma is 70 and has been showing pretty clear, and worsening, signs of dementia for years now. she had a stroke 2 years ago and has been a lot worse since. she was also diagnosed with diabetes at the same time and high blood pressure. they wanted her to do at minimum 6 month follow ups with her new pcp they set her up with and see neurology but she won’t do either. they gave her 6 medicines to take- for the blood sugars and blood pressures and stroke prevention, but she will frequently refuse to even fill them or she’ll pick them up and they’ll sit on her counter unopened.lately she’s been acting more hostile and aggressive, prone to nasty and violent outbursts and just generally unpredictable and irrational. she’s driving but is no longer safe to do so, she just had her electric shut off after assuring me 5x it was fine and paid. she can’t handle her finances at all but the only people she’ll let “help” are her son and grandson in law who both openly brag about just using the money for whatever they want and not particularly caring about her.she’s always been the nastiest to me and anyone i’m with- anyone who actually tries to help her but also holds her accountable for her behaviors. it’s getting to the point i can no longer stomach being in her life but i don’t want to leave her to the wolves entirely. how can i get her help if she will never think she needs it?",,0
"my name is scott and sandy is my mother. i was her first child, born 38 years ago. i will always remember my mother as a highly intelligent being, an advocate, and a positive force of energy.over the past 2-3 years, my mother’s personality has changed. she became paranoid, negative, and exhibited odd behaviors. other family members noticed this change, and like me, didn’t know how to approach it. i experienced her walking into a restaurant multiple times and having to sit at different tables before the right one was found. this was subtle, but there was an odd component of entitlement and lack of empathy for the wait staff and other customers we were cutting off. during another interaction 3 years ago, i asked her if she was going to take a trip to belize where a friend of hers had a condo they offered. she had a concerning, nonsensical reply of, “no, because i’ve never been there.” again very subtle, but stuck out as very odd coming from someone so intelligent. while riding in my car, she would be extremely paranoid, exhibiting verbal expressions of fear during very slow driving to accommodate her. over a year ago, she asked me if it would be a good idea to send someone on instagram money to mine bitcoin for her. i was very shocked that she was even considering something that is clearly a scam, but chalked this up to her being naive about technology. looking back on all this, it now makes sense knowing her diagnosis.i think myself and other family members had written off all this previous behavior as a product of getting older or her possible unhappiness. this all changed earlier this year when we learned that she thought she was in a relationship with multiple tom cruises (yes, you read that right) and singer luke bryan, and had been sending money to people all over the world impersonating these celebrities on the internet. it was quite bewildering to be faced with such bizarre circumstances. i initially tried to talk to her to explain how these people aren’t real and how there are hundreds of predatory fake instagram accounts posing as celebrities. this didn’t work, and she pushed myself and other people away who would question her activity.as this narrative unraveled, we learned that she had been sending large amounts of money, including her claim of sending $20,000 to tom cruise that she has claimed is now owed to her. this prompted family members to take her to the emergency room. nothing came out of that visit and her activity with the celebrity impersonators continued despite our efforts to convince her that she was being taken advantage of. we sent her a news article where a lady in michigan was scammed out of $30,000 by a fake tom cruise, and sent a documentary on this exact phenomenon. these attempts didn’t get through to her.we contacted law enforcement multiple times regarding this financial exploitation and nothing could be done because she would have to report it as a crime and she to this day doesn’t believe she has been wronged. we even have the names, addresses, and bank accounts of people she sent money to… law enforcement can’t do anything because she didn’t think it was a crime. she continued to wire money, take pictures of gift cards, and talk to a whole network of alleged criminals posing as celebrities. she maintained that she was going to marry tom cruise in england and she was going to work for an orphanage and live in a mansion with him that she was picking out. she was also claiming to be in a serious relationship with luke bryan, even though she claimed that he hacked her accounts at one point. i have a voicemail of her telling me about this and about how she isn’t going to be on tom’s private jet, but just meet tom in hawaii. during one exchange when i was convincing her not to go on a trip with fake celebrities, she asked me if she could just go with fabio, because she had seen him at a restaurant a couple years ago. i asked why she would think he would go with her and she said it was because they are the same age.in june, she reached out to me for help with her homework for a class that required her to create a web page. i began helping her and asked her to write a paragraph on lavender. she went upstairs and came down with a blank flash drive, and i explained again that i simply needed a paragraph. this repeated 4 times until she finally wrote the paragraph. this was a stark contrast to her career where she wrote letters, agendas, budget documents, and even a book in her spare time.at this point, i finally accepted that whatever she was going through was extremely serious and something i wasn’t qualified for or successful in helping with despite multiple efforts. doing research, i came across the thurston county behavior health crisis line and reached out to see if a designated crisis responder could give advice. after speaking with them, they determined that they would need to detain her. this was in early july.she was released after several days, and nothing beneficial came from this detainment in terms of a diagnosis or plan to keep her safe. she was immediately back and talking with the fake celebrities. i agreed to help her get a new gmail account so they couldn’t get back to contacting her and this was immediately compromised by her emailing the fake celebrities.  myself, friends, and family have tried desperately to help her on so many fronts. we convinced her to get a new phone and that was immediately compromised. she was detained again in late july, and again released with no real outcome. the positive aspect of this second detainment was a visit by a family friend and ex-supervisor, a neurologist coincidentally. he was able to talk to her and assist us in getting her the medical attention needed. he maintained that this was likely dementia, what we had all been fearing.in august of 2019, my mother was taken to see a neurology specialist at virginia mason medical center in seattle. our fears of frontotemporal dementia were confirmed when dr. isenberg diagnosed her and deemed her to require 24/7 supervision and a guardian for financial and medical oversight. her condition appeared to further deteriorate in late august as we learned she was having hallucinations of the celebrities and family members and was contacting us for help when they “wouldn’t wake up”.  in late august my mother drove by herself and showed up at mcmenamin’s kalama harbor lodge and thought that she had driven down in her car with my sister and celebrity singer luke bryan. when she showed up, she asked what room her husband was in, even though he was not there. she also was texting other friends and family and asking them when they were showing up. the front desk staff were severely concerned and kalama police and a local dcr did a welfare check.my mother was detained for a third time in september as she was trying to leave on a fictitious concert tour with tom cruise and luke bryan. she had her passport and bags packed, and the sheriff found her in her vehicle. she was detained for weeks at st. peters hospital in olympia and finally placed in a memory care facility.now that the courts have appointed her a financial guardian, we have learned that the financial devastation is so pervasive that she had let 3 life insurance policies lapse, took on credit card debt, and spent all her resources.  we think the financial devastation might be in excess of $500,000 if you include the lapsed life insurance policies. she is now unable to afford to live in the facility she resides in because like most facilities, they require private pay for 9-24 months until they will just take medicaid, and these places can be up to $6000 per month. and, you can’t apply for medicaid unless your resources are basically gone. so, it’s a very tenuous and unfortunate situation. frontotemporal dementia has caused my mother to become a very vulnerable person with the sensibilities of child. she was exploited by multiple alleged criminals who took the resources she now desperately needs to have appropriate care until this terminal disease takes her life. she is recently fell and broke her arm, as the disease is presenting elements of parkinsonism, beyond the stark cognitive disability.  i hope that you will be able to help even a little, but i also hope this raises awareness about dementia and the rampant financial exploitation that occurs on social media. be vigilant about mental health with your family and friends.thanks for your consideration and help.",,0
"i am the only support for my 77 yo widowed mother who has moderate dementia.  she is in assisted living (not memory care yet) but lives 10 hours away from me.  she has a handful of local friends and relatives but all are even older than her and have their own medical issues.  none can help in any way other than occasional social interaction.  this means i am attempting to manage all things including finances, legal, medical, etc...., for her from afar.  while i love her, we have never been close.  there is no bad blood, we are just very different people and she has ""disapproved of my lifestyle"" ever since i became an adult and left home 27 years ago.  until i was alerted by her panicking financial advisor that she was nearly broke 1.5 years ago, i had very little involvement with her life....which suited both of us just fine.  we perhaps talked on the phone once every 6 weeks or so and i would visit for 2-3 days once a year.  she has never had any interest in her grandchildren and could not have said what my husband or i do for a living at any point in my adult life.  after the alert from the financial advisor, i uncovered all kinds of ways mom was no longer able to manage herself, including runaway type ii diabetes, months of backed rent, driving without car insurance, pets that were in dire need of medical attention, hoarding, improperly managed meds, bounced checks and late fees all over the place, etc.... that she was unable to manage due to poor cognitive functioning.  so, a lot has happened in the last year.  i finally have a handle on most things financial/legal/medical.  now i am grappling with some secondary issues.  the most pressing being her anger towards me.  i could use some tips on how to ""enter her world"" when she is agitated on the phone.at least once a week and sometimes multiple times a day, she will call me (or my husband) about one very specific topic.  she only calls either of us when she is upset about this.  but even when i call her, the conversation often goes to this topic immediately:  ""everyone thinks i am too stupid to manage my own (fill in the blank here...finances, medical appointments, meds, meals, etc.....).""  she will go on to insist that she was managing just fine until i stepped in and that my involvement is unnecessary (not true). that she never agreed to my involvement (not true, she had the dpoa drafted without my knowledge).  that i am not managing her affairs properly (she believes this to be true because she accidentally reprograms her tv and then thinks i failed to pay the cable bill).  sometimes she will rant elaborate stories about how she selected and moved to her facility all on her own (not even a little bit true) so there is no reason for me to be involved.  she worries i am going to come take her car next (that is true but we have never discussed it).  she feels she is being treated very poorly and tells me she certainly hopes my child does not treat me this way in the future or hopes i am not treating mil this way.  once we are there, i cannot get in a single word.  i never react with anger....but even if i was inclined to, i simply cannot get a single word in anyway.  she gets more and more upset until she either hangs up on me or tells me she hates me and then hangs up on me.  these rants typically go on for 10-20 minutes non-stop.  once it was so bad and vicious that the director of the facility overheard and called me after she hung up to try and console me.  this has been going on for about 9 months.  i try not to take it personally but it does upset me....taking care of her affairs has created so much anxiety that it has (temporarily, i hope) wrecked my life....so getting this abuse on top of that is a hard pill to swallow even if i know it is the illness talking.  and obviously, she is upset too.  and from a  practical standpoint, i cannot get or give any information during calls when this happens.  i am her dpoa but not her guardian so she can and does still make many of her own decisions....which often requires communication between us.my sister, who lives even further away reports that mom rants these same things (about me) to her too.  mom does not get upset with/at my sister.  they have always had a much closer relationship and my sister is not the one doing any of these things.  so at least mom has one ""safe"" loved one to talk to.  i have started letting all of mom's calls go to vm and i don't call back aside from the very rare times there is a legit reason for the call.  but i still need to be able to call her to get business done and to check in.  any ideas on how to redirect or ""enter her world"" to set a new call in the right direction?  there are countless other things that upset her but they are far easier for me to empathize and redirect.  but since these are really about me, or more specifically my involvement in her life, i am at a loss.",,0
"i know that feeling. you're exhausted and frustrated and maybe you can't afford full time care or aren't ready to seek nursing home status ect. as a caregiver you're allowed to feel that way sometimes.  try to see if you have an adult daycare in your area. many provide transportation, have a nurse and allow for socialization for your loved one as well as allowing the care giver a break it might even be covered by insurance.",,0
"i have been posting about my grandpa's dementia and every day it seems he slips further and further into a dark hole, taking us with him. my dad and uncle are in charge of his finances, they did take him to see an attorney some years ago and were granted power of his finances, but almost every week grandpa would ask when they were going to see the attorney. we would tell him that it already happened, but he doesn't seem to quite grasp it. we don't want him to handle his finances because he doesn't have the ability to judge like he use to. he lost money to scams, but we did recover a little what was lost, but the scammers were never caught. the sad thing is, grandpa used to be so good in filing taxes, but he's more use to the ""old"" way, meaning he fills out paperwork or visits a tax adviser. he doesn't like using the computer, so my dad does it for him, but sometimes grandpa would say he already finished his taxes. dad would go through his paperwork and come to find out that grandpa never worked on his taxes. the most frustrating thing is that grandpa would call our house and ask about his finances at least every day. dad would get angry at him and tell him to drop the issue. another frustrating thing is that grandpa would leave the phone off the hook, draining its battery and he would not have a clue why it would be dead. here's the issue that we get frustrated with. as he was declining into dementia, we figured he would be better living in an assisted living. in fact, he went to his doctor some months ago and the doctor said he can't drive anymore as he would pose a danger while out on the road. grandpa didn't take it well and we decided to remove his car just so he would not get in and drive somewhere. in 2019, we did bring up the issue that both he and my grandma could not live in their house because of their fragile conditions. my grandma suffers from arthritis and has terrible back pain. she gets morphine injections to dull the pain, but the drive to the doctors is becoming an exhausting task for her. both of them did think about selling their house and moving into a facility, but then they refused saying they didn't leave their house of over 50 years. my aunt did bring up an idea of moving in with them and becoming their primary caregiver, but we think she will not last as my grandpa is verbally violent and he did psychically abuse his children when they were younger (this was in the days before child abuse was deeply concerning). now that it is 2020, we want them to deeply consider in moving into an assisted living. however, i feel that they will never accept and their conditions will get worse. grandpa is 92 and i believe it is an old age to die peacefully. i know i sound awful, but sometimes i feel death will provide comfort for him and ourselves. we just want the frustration to stop.",,0
"i am generally happy with my mom’s neuro. after a series of doctors he actually diagnosed her for which i am eternally grateful. he has an academic appointment out of a major research institution and is well versed in the current literature. he’s published. he’s pleasant to my mother and helped to get her anxiety semi-under control with meds. background/concerns1.) while her neuro has worked out of the same research institution for years, his satellite offices (where my mom sees him) have changed multiple times over the past decade. this happened again in june. 2.) this transition has been “bumpy” in terms of communication with the new support staff and information seems very confused.  i tried to reschedule my mom’s appt. and get her meds filled and was met with outright hostility, their refusal to call my cell phone, and the statement from staff that “dr. x has never even heard of your mom so i don’t know where you got his name from.” charming, instills a lot of confidence in the doctor and the administration of his office. her appointment at the new place is tuesday, so i’m going to try to feel the place out in person. but i’m going there with a lot of skepticism. 3.) i’m not sure we are getting much out of office visits. his nurse (who i don’t think transitioned to the new office) did a brief cognitive evaluation of my mom over year ago at her first appointment, but that was the first and only time. during office visits the doctor asks about her anxiety and if she is having bathroom accidents but that’s about it. he also doesn’t speak to me separately, so i am not free to fully express what’s going on because it upsets my mom. 4.) i don’t feel like the doctor and i are on the same page with the meds. he hasn’t upped my mom’s anxiety meds in 9 months because he wants her to be on alzheimer’s meds which he says will help with her mood. unfortunately the aricept made her psychotic and the insurance won’t cover the memantine. i actually give zero shits about her being on alzheimer’s meds: their effectiveness particularly out of the early stages are “meh” at best, her neuro actually published an article stating just this, and i don’t understand the point of extending her misery (and ours). i honestly just want her distress alleviated through palliative care. questions: 1.) is a neurologist necessary or even advantageous once the disease has been diagnosed? 2.) if they are necessary, what should an office visit with a neuro look like? what should we be getting out of it in terms of information and treatment?3.) if they are not necessary who should i take her to in order to manage her psychiatric issues? a geriatrician? a psychiatrist? her gp?",,0

"my dad has always been a joker, always the funny guy, a big punster. about two months ago he was diagnosed with parkinson's and alzheimer's. since then it seems like he's going down hill really fast. for instance, about three weeks ago a huge tree in our yard was uprooted by a tornado. it broke up the neighbors house, the chimney on our house, or fences, etc.. you get the idea.. it was a big deal. today as we were leaving the dining room, passing a window that looks out on the damage and he said to me-"" something happened or there, but i'm not sure if it was on their side or ours""  i was blown away! i mean, five months ago he was driving, managing his home finances, going to church and working with his financial advisor. now we are at the point where i have to cajole him into eating and remind him of really basic things. does the decline really happen this fast? is he messing with me? he raised seven kids and i'm the only one here with him and sometimes i feel as though i'm drowning. anyone have any words of wisdom to help me along. please",,0
"need advice:my dad has alzheimer’s and i’m being appointed conservator and guardian.he is my brother’s landlord. according to my brother, in 2008 he promised that if my brother and his family continued to pay rent (which covers the mortgage) to live in the farmhouse, that one day my brother will inherit the farm and can then take over the mortgage he’s been paying down. dad and brother have no contract. two years ago, i asked my brother to please go to mediation with my dad to come out with a legally binding contract showing they both are on the deed to the house and he said “it’s none of your concern.” in 2016 my dad refinanced the farm without my brother’s consent, essentially taking away the eight years of mortgage payments my brother has been paying on the farm. so awful.fast forward to now. we are about to begin the medicaid spend down, and my brother will lose the farm because he has no contract. this will put my brother at $0, as if he’s never paid a dime toward the mortgage, or any other investment during this time.is there any scenario where my brother keeps the farm without paying market value for it?",,0
"today my grandmother who is 77 and is most likely getting dementia was rummaging through the garage and made a mess. i asked her what she was looking for and she couldn't tell me but presented me with several trinkets she found, i said ""thank you but i had those all put away and now theres a mess in the garage, those boxes are storage things"" and she got upset because i was scolding her. i said ""if you could tell me what you were looking for i could have helped you find it but it seems to me you were just snooping"" shes been suspicious of me ever since i took over her power of attorney and now control her finances, shes convinced im stealing her money...anyways, i understand that she gets bored, her day consists of sipping coffee and watching tv (she refuses to do anything recreationally except go to the library) and she decided to go snooping through the garage but ever since that event this morning shes been sulky, wouldn't touch her dinner and only ate an ice cream cone. i feel bad when i have to scold her and i do not belittle her or raise my voice i give her clear and firm reprimand for certain things like any parent would their misbehaving child, but the guilt is always there, i feel bad for having to do it and if i didn't she would have this house looking like a runaway 5 year olds playhouse because her tidy skills are gone...so my question is do any of you have to parent your parents and what are some tips you can give me for those misbehaving episodes. thank you! ps. i feel so guilty now, she was just trying to show me the trinkets she found and i got upset with her for making the mess. am i an awful person?",,0
"my mother has been having some memory issues off and on for a couple years, but it's been worse over the last year. within the last six months, it's started significantly impacting her life.we got the news today (after mris, blood tests, cognitive testing, etc.) that it is indeed dementia and that her symptoms are considered ""moderate"" at this point. since she's been having symptoms for some time, this diagnosis is obviously not a complete shock. but of course we are still reeling.any thoughts on what we (my father and i) need to be thinking about/planning for?my parents are both retired and are financially secure. they already work with a cpa/financial planner and have pretty good health insurance. so i'm not so much worried about the financial side of things as i am about not knowing what to expect from the future and what kind of decisions we will need to make in the next couple of years.any advice or shared experiences would be much appreciated!(crossposted from r/dementia, i hope that's ok!)",,0

"i am so frustrated. my dad (62m) has vascular dementia and is cared for solely by my mom (61f) in their home. they can’t afford in-home help (which their insurance barely pays for) or assisted living (which it won’t cover at all). although he is incontinent, can’t take his meds on his own, falls regularly, and can’t independently shower or use the bathroom, he is deemed too independent for nursing-home-care coverage by their insurance or medicaid. he is currently in the hospital for sepsis, acute kidney injury, pancreatitis, and an infected pressure sore. my mom has taken diligent care for him for almost a decade, but his condition has deteriorated, and it’s just too much for her now. we were both hoping this hospital stay would lead to rehab and eventual admission to a nursing home. but my dad is showtiming and seems to have the ever-rotating cast of providers fooled. they even judged his ability to transfer from his wheelchair (he’s an amputee) to the toilet an 11 out of 13. but when he’s at home, he almost always falls doing that maneuver alone. in the hospital, he’s claiming to have no nausea, no pain. but he’s done nothing but complain about nausea and abdominal pain for a week. and his test results support that. they’re going to end up sending him home with her, aren’t they? she’s going to kill herself caring for him. i mean, he outweighs her by 50 pounds. this is madness. this has happened before. in the hospital and rehab? i want to walk again! i want to wear my prosthesis!” real life: i have literally never seen the man wear his prosthesis. ever.",,0

"hi. can someone tell me the most appropriate person or people to discuss long term finances of a senior with dementia. i’m poa. she has a financial advisor (that we don’t love) and an elder lawyer. basically, she’s living with me right now, but i know eventually i won’t be able to give her the care she will need and will need a facility. she has a decent amount of money but i also know how expensive these places are. her sister lived for 10 + years in the facility. im not sure she has that kind of money. she does not have long term care insurance. aside from trying to be responsible long term - this is also a semi selfish post. she wants me to take her house. she doesn’t understand why i keep saying no. there are a few reasons 1. emotional. it’s my childhood and her house. 2. it’s severely outdated and needs $$3. it’s a hoarded mess 4. my sister technically owns 1/2 with me5. most importantly: i am worried i will take the house, buy out my sister, renovate it, and mom will wind up needing the $$ from selling the house. i don’t want to be kicked out of “my” house. so i need someone to help meplan her long term finances to see if me buying her house is an option or if we need to rent or sell it for her long term finances. did this make sense? i’m typing this on 4 hours sleep at my stepmoms death bedside. sigh.",,0

"please be gentle. (throwaway account). this is not me being callous. i’ve fought for over two years to get dad to make changes for mom, and nothing is done. i want her to be happy, and she’s not, and she’s not going to be in whatever hellhole they stick poor people. i went to a lawyer, set it all up for him. all i get are empty promises that things will change. two years sticks out cause that’s when she gave the lawn dudes dad’s checkbook while i was working and he was out shopping.mom’s 70 now and dad’s 73. mom’s still on all assets. no will, no trust, no poa, house in disrepair, unknown poor financial situation, $100k life insurance policy on dad which might cover the mortgage. florida. i work at home. i know how expensive care is, i have no idea of assets. he doesn’t always tell me when he leaves for an errand, refuses to plan things around my schedule. i might be working or asleep, and my work is such that i am required to have adult/childcare present to not be interrupted. i’ve been home for about 5yrs. i’ve gotten so depressed and suicidal i am now a prisoner of my own body with weight. but me being here seems to be enabling them to ignore everything like clutter and asset management and plans for the future.i have a good friend i trust who needs a place to live while he finds a new job down here, and he has agreed to come and help with cleaning, cooking, supervising, activities and exercise. dad says it would upset mom having someone here. duh! so you want a stranger instead of a friend? i said so you’d rather a stranger be caregiver and guardian than me and a friend. cause if nothing changes, and he gets hurt today, i think state would take guardianship and mom will be locked away from the stars in some hellhole because i can’t take care of her alone and have no legal authority to do so. it's a miracle she falls and doesn't injure herself, but that might not happen next time. he hasn’t talked to me in 4 days since then.at this point i’m not even sure if mom would be lucid enough to sign paperwork. she’s very depressed, does nothing but sleep, wander around, trip and run into things and she has no exercises or activities outside the home. she’s started coughing a lot, and sometimes doesn’t know what to do with the pills we give her. i’m not sure her stage since they still see a non-geriatrician and she refuses treatment. she’s lucid enough to get upset when she cannot open the door or turn on the light switch.so i’m enabling them to continue not addressing the future. i need help, they need help, or i need to move out. they say my friend cannot move in. my parents have screwed me over many times before so i have no reason to trust them, have no security living here.i’ve heard horror stories on how horrible and expensive facilities are, how bad it is to have state guardianship. but what can i do? i know they would have to evict me, but if i leave anything here they have the right to dispose of it i guess.  i was thinking of inviting my friend for lunch and having him just stay. otherwise i’m going to have to move out. i haven’t spoken to mom about it yet because i know it would upset her and she’s been having a rough week. she tends to get angry and mock my attempts to plan for a future.  help?",,0
"so i've been looking around and because  the insurance industry completely underestimated the high cost and high number of seniors living  with chronic conditions (like alzheimer's , parkinson's etc) so their actuarial tables were flawed, and they took a huge losses financially ,.so to resolve this most just left the market (don't write ltc policies anymore) and the remaining ones offer stingy coverage options (most ltc policies have a coverage cap around 5 years) with no rate cap on what you pay in premium prices. keep that in mind when  you consider a skilled nursing facility costs average around $400/day ~ $12000/month . that's why the ltc market is very limited ,because someone with a chronic disease and no other major health issues could live 5-10 years needing a high-level of care. no insurance company wants to be out $1mln in payouts. folks that currently have ltc  plans are facing rising premiums every year like 20-30% increases.so i've looked everywhere and it seemsbasically the middle class is screwed. if your wealthly you can self-insure and just get a live-in caregiver or nurse , if your poor or indigent medicaid will cover you (but quality of care is atrocious in most cases) , middle class is stuck does anyone here have any experience with this? or any good alternatives?",,0

"i mentioned last week that we finally have a social worker coming.  she just left and i'm not sure what to feel right now.  partially relieved, partially overwhelmed, partially annoyed.  the more i learn, the more confused i get. i'm learning all this as i go and i'm fairly easily overwhelmed when i'm this tired.last year, i got in touch with an elder care attorney who basically told me that mom will need a skilled nursing facility since she doesn't have long-term care insurance, just medicare and a supplemental policy.  so the plan was, once she's hospitalized we will have to say she can't come home because we can't care for her properly, put her in a skilled nursing facility, and then apply for medi-cal (medicaid in ca) after she's placed so the facility can't pull the ""we only have 2 beds for medi-cal patients"" game with us. today, the social worker told me i need to get medi-cal first, and if she's approved (she will be, she's pretty poor) get caregivers in, and next hospital stay, upon her discharge, tell them she can't live at home safely and have her put in a care home/assisted liven.  not skilled nursing. i'm confused. does anyone have experience with this?  i hesitate not to listen to the attorney but i need help and it's expensive if we don't get her on medi-cal first. plus, the attorney is expensive, too.ugh. i. hate. our. medical. system.maybe i'll have a better understanding of this once i've (hopefully) gotten some sleep. right now, i am just looking at a mountain of paperwork and phone calls that i don't have the energy to do. i know i have to do it but damn.",,0

"i've been lurking for a while as i've noticed the problems with my dad starting to show since shortly after his wife died at the end of 2020, so i get that this pops up quite a bit. i suppose i'm just overwhelmed. i shouldn't be, but today i finally went into the doctor so it's...real?in the beginning, i was noticing problems with my dads short term memory from afar(i live quite a distance away, so it's been mostly phone calls until this past week). he'll have a conversation with you, but forget you had it by the afternoon. quick to call someone a liar over it, absolutely no recollection. thought this was weird at first, but he's 80 at this point so...old, ya know?he's becoming racist. whoa is he becoming racist. never used to be, but starting to make little comments on the phone. it's slowly but surely becoming such a problem, that other people are avoiding him. but...he's into some crazy things on facebook at this point, so i'm thinking...stuck at home, no wife, older...cranky old man? the covid conspiracy. not the standard one, but the ""there's messages in this, which point to this obscure movie over here, which means that, which means the vaccine will kill me. by the way, they're listening into my calls with you"". ok, that's nuts. i thought i could walk him through things logically...but i can't. he says i'm not making sense. strange...but...what am i going to do? not a lot you can do if someone goes down deep rabbit holes on the net.by last summer, i'm starting to have to intervene. he's getting scammed by anonymous people calling selling bitcoin. i'm fairly pro-cypto, but this was obviously a simple case of someone just taking the money off his credit card. we contacted the bank, canceled the cards, managed to get a refund(yay!), and now he knows to contact me when he gets those calls. during this time though, i find out the family business isn't paying it's bills. wtf is going on? he's on top of this stuff. i confront him, and he says ""you probably missed this, but i'm under a lot of stress! i wasn't paying any attention to the bills while i was caring for my wife. wtf is wrong with you that you would get on my ass about this? just take care of it."". he's always been...brash...so again, alright...maybe i'm overthinking it.fast forward to last week, when i got here. he has no recollection of being scammed last summer, people are calling me because the bills aren't being paid, i find out he's paying insurance on multiple vehicles he doesn't have anymore and he didn't know, there's more people working for the company than i knew about and he doesn't remember them ever being onboard, a friend of his is posting sticky notes everywhere so he knows where stuff is, i see many multiples of food items because he's forgotten he's already got them when he's out, he's stopping mid conversation and walking away because...mid conversation..he's forgotten he's speaking to you, he can't find words and is getting frustrated, he's lashing out at drivers on the roads, talking to someone that isn't there at night, completely unable to manage his finances because he can't do simple math anymore, and hoooooly his memory is strange. his memory about decades ago is beyond on point. like he's recalling something that happened earlier that day. every detail. he's living in the past when he's talking about it, and can't stop talking about it. short term memory is continuing to decline. today? get to the docs office, get a moca test done. score's 27 out of 30, doc says ""you did great! just because of your age though, i'm going to order a blood test and a ct scan"". strange thing to do if he scored great. i call the doc back and he says it's obvious my father is masking. he see's this often in men like my father, his ego simply will not allow him to admit he needs help and it was a hell of a lot easier than saying there's a problem. sending a nurse over to evaluate things as well cause he's been falling.this post is a lot longer than intended. i feel like i'm still in denial. is this what's happening? memory is going, personality is changing...he insists it's stress. am i wrong? what if i'm not?! where do i even start? i'm moving away soon, and no one else in the family is left to help him. i want him to come with me, but he's so dead set on not. wtf do i do?!",,0
"so dad ended up in the hospital and needs to go into rehab for swallowing problems. there were   several decent rehab centers covered by insurance within a half hour with like four star   reviews. but the family member with the purse strings appears to be deciding that   no expense is too great at this point and is intending to pay out of pocket for the  five star - more local still - rehab center where dad will ostensibly learn to swallow  well enough to go back to memory care. i want dad to be well taken care of an all.  but this could end up being like $20k for a single issue. it's hard for me to protest   because then i look like the money grubbing cheap skate wanting to put dad into   substandard care. but to me it's more like ""keeping your powder dry"" for the future   issues and i know from having spoken to him that that kind of expense was not  in his wishes. anyone run into this in their family?",,0
"my parents are separated, though not legally.   dad is obsessed with this idea that my mom keeps more of their money than her fair share.  he's actually believed this even before dementia as my dad has always been incompetent with money so my mom had to always take care of the finances.  so he never understood where all their money went.  mom still takes care of their money as otherwise i would have to do it and i don't want to add yet another task to my plate in terms of my dad.dad keeps texting and telling me over and over again about his plan to find out what money my mom is stealing and how to get the money back from her.the reality is actually that my dad is the one who will spend overwhelmingly more than my mom due both to his more expensive lifestyle and his future dementia costs.  he's actually going to be the one that bankrupt my parents.  so he takes more than his fair share, not her.but he can't understand this and continues to bug me every single day about their money.  what can i do to shut him up?",,0
"hi all, i am very new to this. 2 weeks ago my nana was fairly independent (my younger brother lives with her) and enjoying being home working in her garden. she repeated things a lot in the same conversation but i thought that was the extent of it. i live out of state so phone and text is how we talked and she never let on that anything more was happening. since then, she has been in icu on a ventilator with metabolic acidosis, liver failure and a variety of other things. she hadn’t been taking her medicine. she is better now physically but needs 24 hour care. her insurance won’t cover in home care and the dementia has gotten much worse. she is being transferred to a care facility in a day or two. she called me (still has my number memorized) crying saying she is scared, that the people in the hospital are playing pranks on her and laughing at her. that they come in and bang on things to scare her while she naps and then leave. that she was supposed to get her hair done and no one would bring her a brush even though she asked multiple times. they make the crazy sign and point and laugh at her. she said there are feral cats there and the staff let them in because they feel sorry for them. i talked to a woman in the room with her and asked what was going on. she told me nana is very confused, she got her hair done and didn’t ask for a brush. my nana is my everything, she raised me and my brother and is the strongest person i know. i tried to tell her that sometimes when we are scared things seem different than they really are and she cried and said no one believes her and if i don’t want to help her then don’t. this broke me, i don’t know the right things to say to comfort her. she was on suicide watch until yesterday and she is upset she was left alone because she can’t be alone, that’s the rules. i told her she was much better and didn’t need anyone to watch her and she said i did it, like giving me credit for her being better. i tried to give her kudos instead by saying that she is working hard to get better and she did it all because she is amazing. she basically blew me off with a “whatever” and moved on to something else. what can i say to reassure her that no one wants to hurt her and that she is safe? also, i’m curious how it would work if i wanted to transfer her to a facility close to me? i’ve tried to get her to move to florida with me but she says she is and always will be a cali girl and never wants to leave. i’m just very lost at the moment.",,0
"i will cut to the chase and give you the preface later. i called adult protective services to report self neglect on an 84 year old man i live with. i spoke with a social worker a couple days later and was told that a county nurse will be making a visit within the next couple weeks. she also spoke to the guy who has power of attorney over his medical care (he lives out of state but is planning to move in this house  soonish.) i really need there to be a formal diagnosis for dementia. this man is very stubborn and in denial of everything health related. what would be the best way to do this? he's going to deny everything.i was told by the social worker he hasn't paid all 3 of the utilities for months. he keeps getting shut off notices from the water company but none of them have shut off utilities yet. i'm very surprised nothing has been shut off. he hasn't seen a doctor in several months because his doctor retired. i told him he needs to call his insurance to get a new one but he doesn't listen to me. he's very stubborn and doesn't listen to anyone who tells him he needs to see his doctor. he has a very bad cut on his ankle that looks like it could be mrsa. i expressed to him that i think he has dementia but he denies it even when you tell him about all his memory problems. he loses his money constantly, his car keys were lost for what seemed like forever, he loses his canes for walking, he will ask the same question multiple times within a very short period. he's very moody and grumpy most of the time. he loves to argue with people over the tiniest most trivial things. most recently, he was calling out his dead mother's name while knocking on the guest bathroom door. i had to tell him there was nobody else in the house. most days he's fine but more recently he has started thinking other people are in the house and one time he checked the guest bedrooms because he thought people were in there. he hoards food to the point that when he finally gets to eat something, it has already rotted and expirped long ago. he gets mad when anyone interjects and wants to throw something away. the last jug of milk i saw him throw away had an expiration date of july 2020 and the inside hard yellow slimy curds. he has lost his sense of smell and i'm pretty sure he has no taste either. he doesn't believe anyone else when they tell him his fridge smells bad. he says they have sensitive smells which is not true. one night he went to the grocery store and was gone for a long time. he got taken home by a police officer. he had a blown tire and the cop said he was lost and didn't know where he was. the cop told me he thinks he has dementia and that he really needs to see a doctor because it's going to get worse. and also, he has a suspended license because he failed the written test . recently, he has been having bathroom accidents where he goes in his pants and then it runs down his legs and onto the damn carpet. he refuses to buy adult diapers. my dad bought me a carpet shampooing machine. i moved in here in 2019 for free rent and utilities in exchange for help around the house and yard. i'm not a nurse or caretaker and i don't do anything medical. i mainly do simple things like vacuuming, dusting, raking leaves, trimming small trees, etc. i have no authority over this man.",,0
"my dad died when i was 4 and my birth mom had nothing to do with me. my great grandmother and great grandfather adopted me when i was 4. however, my great grandfather died when i was 7. i'm currently 17 and live alone with my great grandmother. she has been showing signs of dementia for several years but recently it has gotten really bad. everyone around her knows she has it, but she wont get help. she constantly goes through old paperwork, neglecting to pay the bills because she looses them. i have a bank account and pay the bills when i can find them, but the money is almost out. she also wont trust me when i said i paid them and always asks questions about them. she wont pay the car insurance because she has to look over her ""bank statements"" all day and try to make sense of it. she wont get me a car, so i don't have a job. i'm fixing to graduate high school and cant sign up for college because i don't have someone helping me, and don't have a way to pay for it. she constantly babies me, wont let me out after dark because she is paranoid. she thinks the neighbors are the people that murdered her son, even though she has no reason to think they are. people avoid her because no one wants to deal with her. she is disgusting, she pees on herself and puts sheets over the seats and hangs her pants up to dry just to wear them again. she accuses me of stealing her money, which really hurts me because i would never do that to anyone. she asked me who a little girl in a picture was the other day (it was her grandchild). i'm mentally exhausted and my mental health is trash. i don't know what to do, she does not even have a will, so if she were to pass away i would have to deal with all the legal stuff and i don't know how to do any of that. she refuses to think she has any problem and calls me disrespectful all the time for getting annoyed with her. i feel like there is so much responsibility left to me and i don't know what to do, some days i wish she would just pass away and all my problems would go with her, but there would actually just be more. i'm also terrified to loose her because she is my mother, so i try to keep her as far away from me emotionally as i can, so when she does pass away it won't hurt as much, because i'm just used to people leaving me and that is my defense mechanism.",,0
"hi all. my mom has recently been diagnosed with vascular dementia at the age of 73 and is struggling badly with the diagnosis and her changing cognitive ability. she is likely experiencing some sundowner-like symptoms. she is crying a lot, often in the evenings, repeating things like ""i just want to be me"". she's always been a powerhouse in the family, thinking of herself as a bit of a matriarch--always caring for others, taking care of house and home, etc. very ""in control"" of herself and, in her eyes, her family. that said, she's clearly not coping with me needing to take over handling the finances, or my sibling and i doing more around the house. i've tried to get her to talk about what she's feeling. i imagine there is a grieving process involved here, voluntary or involuntary, for all of us. she's also been a caretaker for our father for a few years now--he is not in good shape physically, and we are faced with the fact that we will need to move them out of their house and into a place that is equipped to care for them. my wife and live out of state, but i'm within a day's drive and am spending more time with my parents as i can. my sibling lives in here in the same town with them.last week, her doc told her that this could be the most difficult time of her illness because she is still alert enough to be aware of it and of her mental struggles. she even hinted that things would get easier when she is no longer cognitively aware enough to know of her illness. i don't know the truth of that, but i'm reaching out here, with tears in my eyes, asking for kind words and any advice.",,0

"the line between 'normal aging forgetfulness' and 'dementia' is often up for personal interpretation and difficult to definitively determine.  for the past 2 years, my mom has become more absent-minded in several ways that she's acutely aware of (but not concerned about--that's my job).  i first noticed her having more mood swings that seem to come literally out of nowhere (usually) in the evenings.  she gets all anxious and just has to take her frustration out on someone--usually whoever is nearest.  she has increased her prozac dose from 20 to 40mg per day, as i guess she felt it wasn't working at that dose anymore (she's been on it for 20+ years).secondly, she has frequent memory lapses that involve everything from word recall to forgetting that she didn't make supper that night.  she left the stove on last night ""again"" (according to my dad it's happened before) and said she couldn't remember the word ""grass"" in a recent conversation, referring to it as ""that green stuff"".  she has a harder time remembering peoples' names and other details when telling stories that used to be no problem for her too.  it's like a ditzy-ness or absent-mindedness rather than loss of function...memory lapses that happen several times per day rather than constant/persistent reduced iq.  she has a harder time expressing herself verbally too (according to her).   she doesn't have short-term memory loss or ask the same questions over and over like some alzheimer's patients do.  she can still balance a checkbook, manage her finances, drive to destinations &amp; do other 'big' things...but something has definitely changed in the last 2 years or so.  she frequently says she's ""losing it"" in a joking tone, but i don't find it funny at all :(she has taken lipitor for her high cholesterol for over 10 years now.  i read that statins can cause memory loss, but there seems to be some dispute about whether they actually do or not.  she also takes xanax about 1 time per week, which i know can affect memory.  we don't have a family history of alzheimer's or dementia at all, though i know it's not entirely a genetic disease.i'm literally bawling my eyes out trying to figure out what's going on.  65 seems young for alzheimer's, but i know it can potentially set in at any age.  i just don't know what i'd do if she had some kind of dementia.  are there any non-dementia causes of these symptoms that i've listed?  thought i'd ask here since you folks probably have actual experience with this topic.  webmd is impersonal and not all that specific.  any info appreciated.  thanks!",,0
"my apologies for the misspells, i'm on my phone. i'm sorry for any run on sentences. i'm truly at my ends wit with him. i just don't know what to do or who to talk to. this is supposed to be a big ""family secret"" and i will be shot if he or my mom find out. long story short, my dad who has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia caused by a brain tumor in addition he has lost his finger and hand dexterity motor skills as well as being unable to stand, walk, and sit without aid. he has refused all rehab.  his last job, they left of not good terms. that was three years ago. he has lost his drivers license last summer and is no longer maintaining  his medical liability insurance policy. his job, it requires very sharp knives, slicing &amp; dicing; peoples lives are very much at stake. he is now contacting recruiters in an attempt to show all is fine. he wants short term, travel jobs. he is in denial about his health. he still thinks he can get his drivers license back, even though the state has said no in no uncertain terms. and the recruiter he is working with has him submitting many applications to various employers. i know he is lying about his health situation because he said ""what they don't know won't hurt them."" he can barely use the computer at all. how this person has the strength to put up with it, is beyond me. my mom and i have tried to talk to him about it, but he gets agitated very quickly.  to me, his mind is where he thinks that it is back in a time where he didn't have such health issues and it is attempting to merge with the current time where he does have the issues. and his brain is shutting down all attempts of reason, and even clear examples that contradict his perceived reasoning. i have been his caregiver for over six years now. my mom has poa, but does not have the gall to enact it. nor does she want any hand in dealing with him.  i'm the one paying bills (what i do find and know about as he hoards mail), doing the cooking (have to deliver his meals to his chair), grocery shopping, not much on laundry since he refuses to put on clothes, etc. i'm also trying to get his finances back under control. any little thing he sees on tv he must have, now(!). his actions are very reckless both in this and everyday life. he is going to get himself in trouble legally as well as those around him. other people's lives are at stake. i'm having to dropout of my college studies to keep an eye on him 24/7. and am now enabling the child block on the internet.",,0
"i just wanted to drop in to say hello. my father-in-law just moved in with my family (husband, son and i) at the end of march due to covid. he's been declining for years slowly, but was living on his own until february. he agreed to move into independent living, but then lockdown hit and he felt he was being held prisoner, which was a little true. when he got to us, he was so much worse than we knew. we live in a different city and his two other sons were taking care of things for him in the other town. i arranged for a neuro visit and was completely not surprised with the dementia diagnosis, probably vascular. there are so many things that haven't been done or taken care of, we feel like it is an uphill battle to figure out his finances and insurance needs. his other kids didn't know what to do and so there are big gaps in what we know about bills and other things.  anyway, i'm not asking advice at the moment, just wanted to share a bit and i expect to be back here. i appreciate that there is a group here for this issue and hope everyone is well.",,0
"this is about to be a wild post but i’m in facebook jail and need some opinions. my grandmother disowned us and her children when i was little so i never really knew her. but i knew she was always a very nasty hateful lady her whole life.  and when my fathers father died there was a huge family feud because one sister stole all the money. also important my father has also been very narcissistic. fast forward to when i’m in my twenties; we’re all living together (my father, me, my daughter, and my brother had just moved above us) my dad finds out that his very serious alcoholic mother was in the hospital because she had fallen and laid on the floor for about a week and the people that we’re supposedly taking care of her just left her there and apparently stole her boat and most of her money. after this my father decided he was going to up and move within a weekend. me and my daughter had to find to find a place to live within that weekend because he told his friend at work he could come take everything he left including my stuff if i didn’t get out. (this all happened in a weekend) and i couldn’t pay that high of rent myself. about a year goes by and i’m in a terrible environment but it was the quickest i could find in such a short notice. but as the situation gets worse my dad offers for my daughter, boyfriend, and i to move in with them for a location change while we find a place around here. he says he’s her legal care taker because she has dementia. every since we moved in they have been absolutely ridiculous and makes us go to bed by 8pm (i’m in my mid 20s). they started saying my boyfriend couldn’t stay randomly after he had been (most respectful man ever) and since were knew to the area looking for jobs he started sleeping in my car. they wouldn’t even let him use our bathroom and made him go outside. we get jobs and they start acting as if i was stressing her out because her dementia and that i need to get out immediately  (keep in mind i just got a job and ive just been work my ass off to get out) it would take forever to name all my reasonings. but long story shortened my father make ridiculous rules, act ridiculous, and every time his excuse is because her illness. which knowing my dad he only wants her money when she passes. he’s made that very clear i have pictures. he only uses the dementia to enforce something he wants, he uses it out of selfish gain. his mother (my grandmother) constantly is calling me a bitch and bringing up stuff my blamer narcissistic father over exaggerated and tried to make himself the good guy. i could be very sweet or not even say a word and every single time i leave the house even to get something out of my car she gets up and locks it and says she tried to keep me out. she doesn’t want me here. i’m a bitch. but i could literally do nothing but it’s because certain things my father will blow out of proportion to manipulate her into hating me too. (he’s always compared me to my mother who he despises) one incident i literally got out of her way so she could take her walker down the hallway and she says “god you’re such a bitch” i’m completely shocked it was common respect to let her go by and my father continues to thank her for calling me a bitch and in front of my daughter to. anywho the actual point to this is. i think my father is manipulating her into thinking she has dementia. and using it as a strong use in their legal case trying to get all the money back that the people stole from her. my dad wants her money. i think she signed the stuff over them drunk and didn’t remember. she drank the moment she woke up to the moment she passed out. i think sge did it while she was drunk and after falling and then realizing the stuff is missing. my father stepped in to try and get that money he feels belongs to him back. and he’s using the dementia as a case because it looks bad if she was drunk. and that was on her. so they wouldn’t get the money back. other reasons to back up my theory;- she never ever goes to doctors visits -no hospital papers or medical papers of diagnosis- the only medicine she takes is over the counter and vitamins - the only people my father is ever on the phone with for her is insurance people trying to get the money back (not doctors) - she remembers everything he says to her about me enough to where every time i leave she tries to lock me out- she got a stimulus check and older citizens legally being taken of by others did not qualify for a check so there’s no proof he’s her legal care taker-she never has doctor letters of bills in the mail -she gets a social security check my dad freaks out over. he hates me checking the mail or grabbing their mail with my own to be helpful because he doesn’t want me to see their mail. -while on the phone with the insurance people he makes sure to tell them it’s alzheimer’s that she has not dementia. and that’s why she can’t do it herself. but always tells me it’s dementia. - she’s in very good health. she can take care of herself, she moves around by herself, puts her own clothes on, showers on her own, washes dishes fine. she has no symptoms. my father uses it as a clutch so i have to obey because he’s very controlling of every aspects of my life. and if he feels like i’m my own person, he does things to knock me down so i know i won’t ever be anything without him or ever be better than him. i think he started being so terrible to my boyfriend who is like a super human and very respectful because he was threatened by him because he is everything my father wanted to be man wise. anyway i’m just mainly trying to get some opinions on this subject. do you guys think she has dementia / alzhimers? or can you compare how someone you know that has it acts? i’m curious. because something is very sketchy around here and i just want to get away from them.",,0
"hello all,my father is 71 years old and has been fighting dementia and other such issues from the time he was about 65. he's a vietnam veteran and worked in construction his entire adult life. he retired at 64 and within a year was in two car accidents that clearly happened due to lack of reaction time and slowing mental capacity. the first accident was significant (the front axle of his truck fell out after he clipped the back right of a turning car when he didn't see its left turn signal until the last two seconds). the second he clipped another car in a parking lot while leaving. this is when we stopped letting him drive. brain scans after the accident did not indicate anything out of the ordinary.he really began to decline from 68 on and was diagnosed two years ago with pca (posterior cortical atrophy) which is considered an atypical form of alzheimer's and there is some debate on whether he has parkinson's disease or not. from what i have read, pca mostly affects visuals but anyway, he's clearly in the throes on dementia. he cannot be alone, he's losing his memory, asks the same questions over and over again, struggles with walking, etc. my mother makes too much money apparently to not receive any assistance through the va and he did not plan for his retirement and thus does not have long-term care insurance.my mother is in the midst of starting a divorce so that he can apply for medicaid without draining my mother of all of her assets so that we can put him in a suitable home. we have fought for two years about whether dad needs to be in a home but everyone has come to the conclusion that dad needs professional care full time.my sister and i watch him on our alternating days off. my mother is younger and still works full time. my other sister just had a baby and cannot assist. a family friend who is a professional caregiver takes the day-shifts two-three days a week. my two older half-brothers (one who is well off and the other who is not) live out of state and refuse to get involved despite my pleadings. my mother is a difficult woman to get along with and has too much ""pride"" to continuously ask for their assistance (trust me, i've tried).we do not want to put dad in a home currently if we can avoid it for the short term because of coronavirus. he survived lung tumor surgery at 50 and had 1/3 of a lung removed so that would definitely not go well.he can still feed himself, shower himself, go to the bathroom, brush his teeth, shave, etc. he cannot dress himself without assistance. as i said, he cannot be alone anymore, other than for an hour in the morning when he's waking up. after that, his anxiety is too high and he panics when he's alone for more than 5 to 10 minutes.he does experience sundowners during the day that is sometimes super hard to deal with. my sister has gotten medical marijuana for him and that does help somewhat.also, as i've heard with other dementia patients: the man will not sleep.he will sleep for an hour or two at the start of the night and then gets up every hour after in the night to go to urinate. he had his prostate ""steamed"" a year ago due to frequent urination (he was on flomax before that of course) and his lack of sleep was unbearable to everyone. but it has not helped. he cannot retain urine. he needs to urinate at least 7 or 8 times a day and all night like i said. when he urinates, it's rarely more than 50ml at a time.his neurologist says that it is completely dementia related and anything we try to do with a urologist is useless. melatonin has no effect.we finally had a geriatic doctor give him benzodiazepines a few months ago and it had absolutely no effect on his sleeping habits, he continues to get up every hour of the night.does anyone that has experienced a similar situation know of something that will help my father sleep through the urge to urinate? his lack of sleep is leading to premature deterioration and i refuse to believe that nothing out there will work. i hear that they will not prescribe dementia patients certain sedatives because of fall-risks but we need something to help him until this pandemic has subsided and he can get professional help without immediate risk of his life.anything we can ask the doctor about is greatly appreciated.",,0

"hello everyone. i'm not really sure where to start with this. perhaps i'm just seeking guidance on here or comfort. or both. my father is almost 78. lives by himself. he fought in vietnam and so therefore is a vet. about 7 years ago family friends started to point out to us that my father has started to suffer memory issues. we could see it then, and it's very evident now.the good news is that he can still take care of himself. in terms of hygiene, driving and basic daily stuff he does well. but, his memory has definitely gotten much much worse. my sister in law pointed out awhile ago, that she sees signs of dementia. i then started to research it and it makes more and more sense now. it's pretty clear that he has undiagnosed dementia, and i have absolutely no idea what to do.part of the problem is that i live in another city, roughly 150 miles away. at this point i need to start thinking of getting power of attorney over his medical and financial right?how do you do that if my father is in denial. in fact, i can't even bring up the issue with him for fear that he will get upset and kick me out if his house. he does that sometimes when he's confronted about this kind of stuff. here is an example;a few years ago some family friends, who we've known for nearly 40 years, had mentioned to my father that he's developing memory issues. he then got upset with them and refused to talk to them for almost a whole year. my brother has mentioned that to him too a few months ago. my father flipped out, kicked him out of the house and then called his wife to tell her what a piece of sh$$ my brother was. so yea, how exactly would i get power of attorney over anything if my father acts like that? i'm afraid to even breach the subject for fear of being shunned.so there are a couple things that i have been thinking about.do i need to consider moving back to my hometown to keep an eye on him? i have a family and a career. my wife has a career. do i just up and leave them to move 150 miles away? how could i possibly do that and still pay for the house we have? i couldn't just allow my wife to take on the burden of being a single parent and paying all the bills just so i can go stay with my father. no, i don't think that is the solution. or is it?my brother on the other hand, he and his wife live in the same city as my father. however, my brother isn't the best person to take over my father's finances and medical decisions. i'm not sure if it will matter, but my brother isn't biologically my father's son. he is related to our mother who had him before she met my father.aside from that, there are tons of reasons why my brother would not be the ideal person for power of attorney. he's terrible with financial decisions. he's the type of person that would win a million dollars and not only blow through it in a few weeks, but also end up owing someone money by the time the million was spent. he's terrible with finances and has always made bad decisions. besides, he's got a bad drinking problem, so yeah, that's out of the question.my brother's wife on the other hand, i could definitely rely on her, but once again, i don't fully trust her to be in charge of his finances. so there it is. i'm open to answering any questions. i just need some guidance. thanks for reading!",,0
"hey, so some context. i (23m) recently became the primary caregiver for my 94 year old grandfather. he raised me and we don’t have any other family. how do you deal with the feeling of being overwhelmed? it’s been about 6 months since he’s moved in and it hasn’t gotten any better. it took a lot to move him up to me, reestablish all his care in a new state, and i’ve basically given up my career to try and take care of him so he’s comfortable in the end. not to mention i’m expecting my first child in two months.his condition as of late hasn’t been great. he’s been refusing to eat, drinks some liquids, incontinent, sleeps most of the day, and as of late he’s been talking to my grandmother (deceased by 5 years). unfortunately, requests for coverage for assisted living were denied and his insurance only will pay for about a months worth for a care taker. i’m just trying to do right by the man that raised me.honestly, i’m not too sure what i’m asking here. just looking for reassurance or any other kind of advice, i guess.",,0
"my father has never been a typically caring or loving person. lately though he has become increasingly angry and will yell and swear at my mom over the dumbest things. he refuses to watch or talk about anything besides news and religion. he constantly complains about pretty much everything. he dwells on things and creates strange scenarios that cast him as a victim. he has suddenly become obsessed with the finances and will make my mom go over accounts and etc with him and then ‘remember’ things that ‘should be there’ and then yell at her. he has been trying to convince her she needs to go to the doctor and gave tests run for dementia and alzheimer’s, but i honestly think she is stressed and depressed from being constantly badgered. in short does any of this behavior sound familiar to those that have dealt with getting a family member diagnosed?",,0
"still no willingness from my wife to see a dr, and her obvious cognitive problems are getting much worse. i’m anticipating a huge blowup when i sell my wife’s car, which has been sitting nearly unused for close to two years. i’ve let the battery die so she can’t drive and she ignored her dmv notice of license expiration, but keeps saying she’s going to drive it and  “don’t dare sell it.”it’s time to pocket the $2500 and stop paying for the insurance. but i know this will be a major blowup and not one i can discuss with her. any suggestions on what i know will be a very difficult time? i was thinking of positioning it as we can use that for a trip she keeps saying she wants to take.  of course, covid complicates the choices for that, too. thanks",,0
"my so lives with his grandmother(77f) who is often alone when so is gone for work. i admit i do not like her and you can see my previous posts about my issues. that's why i want an outside opinion in case i'm using my dislike for her to look for signs of dementia.poor impulse control/poor judgement. she suddenly wanted to get a large dog after decades of yorkie sized dogs. her reason apparently is for protection in her home. she hasn't been attacked and her neighborhood is one of the safest in the city, but she knows that so wants a big dog. she heard about labradoodles and became obsessed and pushed so to get her a puppy. the puppy is now 5 months old and she is complaining about troubles controlling him on walks. she wanted to buy her granddaughter a car for a while now but hasn't done any searching with her until suddenly she was told of a ""wicked deal"" on a used car at a dealership an hour away. grandmother doesn't tell her daughter or granddaughter about this plan until the woman shows up and wakes the girl up and takes her to buy this car she heard about. girl doesn't have her full license and just got laid off. the old woman bought a $20,000 sedan for a young girl to learn on without talking to the girl's mother or other family. you don't get a fancy car for a first time driver due to higher odds of them hitting something and to keep insurance costs down. the starting cost for insurance for new drivers is sitting at $2000, a newer, pricier vehicle will likely be $3000+. so warned her that this purchase will wipe out a large amount of their bank account. not to mention maintenance, gas, insurance costs that grandma has to provide since the girl doesn't have a job. overall, her ability to gauge consequences seems compromised.worsening language skills. she is having a harder time remembering english words and is preferring her native french. her accent is becoming more noticeable too. she is constantly mixing up my so for his uncle and me for the uncle's wife. several times today alone she called me by the wife's name and her grandson by his uncle's name. we have to constantly ask for clarification when she is talking to us. she will start random topics from nowhere, ""she said...."" ""who are you talking about we were talking about the dog."" ""oh the lady across the road was talking about..."" repeated questions. she asked us three times how the dog reacted to us coming over since she was out when we came. we responded each time and she acknowledged us responding each time. i pointed out that she has asked the same question three times. she instantly got defensive and argued that she didn't hear us the last two times.her driving is really poor. i noticed that her parking is odd. she will have like 3-4 feet between her front bumper and the curb. she makes very insecure and jerky turns, she sometimes leaves the turning lane she is in.poorer memory. she forgets where she puts things constantly. she asked me how ripe my melons were from the garden. she helped me grow butternut squash all summer which seemed odd to mix up. despite multiple trips to my apartment, she still isn't sure where to turn. i'd like to think that her behavior is typical for early dementia, but now i'm second guessing myself since i also detest being around her. so and his mother have admitted she is showing mental decline but refuse to speak with the grandmother about what they are seeing for fear of making her angry.",,0
"i’ll try to keep this as short as possible.my grandmother has dementia and is unable to take care of herself independently. she receives my late grandfather’s pension as well as other benefits for her necessities.before she had dementia, she asked my father (her eldest son) to handle any of her finances. prior to my father, her younger son (my uncle) was given the responsibility by her to take care of her money. however, he would just spend it on himself most of the time. therefore, my grandmother asked my father.since she had been diagnosed with dementia, her memory faded very rapidly, to the point she is not aware of anything around her. and now she is unable to take care of herself.my grandmother used to pay for every bill in the house. she would also pay for groceries most of the time. my uncle would just spend his money on himself or his wife. he would barely contribute in to the house even though he worked and lived with my grandmother.ever since she has become dependant, my uncle quit his job and he and his wife decided to take control of her finances claiming that they have ‘the right’ to use her money for themselves because she lives with them. my uncle’s wife also gets care allowance which she spends on herself.in fact, they don’t even take care of her properly, she needs personal care which is not given to her fully as my aunty claims that my grandmother is too aggressive with her so she cannot be bothered to deal with her. my aunty doesn’t even give her a bath regularly.they drop my grandmother off to my parents house every week and she barely stays in her own house. they justify this by saying that she is not just his (my uncle’s) mother but also my father’s. so it is also his responsibility to take care of her.my father doesn’t work. however, he takes care of my mother who is blind. it just pisses me off that my uncle and aunty spend all of my grandmother’s money on themselves and buy expensive furniture etc.but they’ve never bought the necessities for my grandmother( except the cheapest adult diapers).and then they have the audacity to accuse my father of not fulfilling his duty as a son.i honestly don’t know what to do",,0

"hi everyone,  my father,brother, and myself live in a house on my grandpas land, he’s in the house next door. about 10 years ago he was overjoyed to have us, now that he’s in the middle stage of alzheimer’s he’s getting really angry we’re here and keeps telling us he wants to sell the property. he’s decided we moved in without his permission and that were “taking over”. just to clarify moving is not an option, my father just built a new house on the property, and when my grandpa wasn’t sick he wrote my father into the will as the sole beneficiary of everything (my dads an only child and basically the only family my grandpa has). before he got sick this was always the plan, he was overjoyed to have us taking over the property once he passed. this is in texas if it makes a difference.  has anyone dealt with something like this before? we’re headed to the department of aging in texas tomorrow to try to figure out how my dad can take control of my grandpas finances and guardianship over his health. this is purely from the standpoint that we want to take care of him, and we’re worried that soon he’ll need to be put into assisted living, and he’s not ever going to admit he has a problem, so we’re going to need to take matters into our own hands while also insuring we aren’t left out in the cold if he gets angry one day (as he so often does) and sells the property from under us.",,0
"apologies in advance, i’m on mobile and tired.three months ago i moved in with my ageing grandparents (70s) under the pretence that i will help take care of them until they are gone and they will leave me the house. my grandfather is in okay health despite being in heart failure after a heart attack in january. he is still active, still sharp as a tack. he drinks to much but he’s working on that. my grandmother on the other hand...three years ago my grandmother was the matriarch of our family. a jolly woman of 300 lbs, she ran a tight ship, hosted a podcast for a distinct special needs group that she had advocated for the past twenty years . she kept up on everyone’s birthdays, she baked as often as she could, would regularly make the hour drive to see her kids grandkids and great grandkids. today my grandmother is under 100lbs, we don’t know how as we’ve gotten her any foods she wants. she lays in bed constantly as she says sitting in a wheel chair hurts her tailbone even with 2 donut pillows (she does get in the wheelchair for about an hour or two for special events like christmas). her once thick salt and pepper hair has almost all fallen out and what is left is frail and white. she will only walk to the bathroom when she absolutely has to, dribbling the whole way. her short term memory is 100% gone. i can tell her “grandma i’ll be back in two hours i have to run to the store, i’ve left your lunch in your mini fridge and the dog is outside” and i will return home to her angry that i’ve left her unattended and she doesn’t know where the dog is and she hasn’t touched her lunch. she claims her feet hurt to walk on because she’s let her toenails grow until they’ve started to curl under.  the major problem is that she absolutely refuses to see a doctor. my grandfather had a nurse from their insurance out to check on both of them and she flipped her damn lid. screaming that he hated her and that there’s nothing wrong with her she’s just old. but we all can see otherwise. we are in washington state and i believe my grandparents are on medicare. i don’t know where to start considering she absolutely refuses to see any medical help.",,0

"my (44) dad (76) has been showing cognitive decline in the past several years. the main symptom by far has been memory loss. he is still pretty sharp about some topics, but i'll hear the same story and get asked the same questions again and again. he doesn't seem to be showing other symptoms, such as getting lost, and his vocabulary is still pretty good. he seems to be able to do his regular tasks, such as making coffee etc. he thrives best when he can stick to a regular routine and be in familiar places.his memory loss symptoms are becoming quite noticeable and it has got me thinking about the future for the sake of my mom (76) who would be/is his primary caregiver. this issue is that he is deep in denial, and i can tell he works hard to hide his issues/confusion (i.e. he will change subjects, dominate the conversation, or go quiet etc. in order to avoid showing his lack of memory about certain things). because of the responsibilities he holds (including overseeing their finances, and doing all the financial investing), i think that the next step is some sort of medical assessment. they live part time in a small community, where the local clinic did do some sort of short cognitive test last year that apparently showed he was ""fine"". however, my mom (who is dealing with her own issues around denial) did not get the results directly or follow up with that doctor. we got the results through him, so i'm not sure how accurate what we heard is. they share a family doctor in a larger nearby city where they live for the rest of the year, and he gets check ups with this doctor, but my mom has not yet taken to time to alert their doctor about this. obviously that previous test was not comprehensive enough, and i feel that the next step is a proper assessment so we have a better idea of what might be happening. however, how do we convince him to get such testing? and also convince my mom to take a more active role in tracking his health?",,0
"in 2007, my wife began to manifest symptoms, odd behaviors (increasing incrementally), and struggling mental health.  since then, she has developed severe addictions to medications (initially pain relievers and sleep aids) and she came to enable addiction in one of our daughters.  over time, she began to isolate more and more, withdrawing from all of her friendships and social engagements, except for the enabling of our addicted daughter.  epilepsy, depression, anxiety, paranoia, ptsd, addiction, and fibromyalgia all became her rallying cries.  we spent fortunes on doctors, residential treatments, counseling (psychiatric and marriage), not to mention various extensive treatments for ptsd (neurofeedback), and nothing helped.  in 2015, thinking it might be alzheimer’s, she underwent the standard neuropsychological testing regimen, and the local neuropsych said that she had mild cognitive dysfunction, but that the inconsistencies of the test outcomes suggested psychiatric issues.  two years of psychiatric work followed, with absolutely no progress and continuing increases in dysfunction.  that test was repeated in 2017, with the same neuropsych telling us to get a different psychiatrist. i could not stop the destructive (addiction) and dysfunctional activities, so i separated from her and obtained a legal separation (at this point, i was being “harmed” by her addiction and fraudulent activities).  i continue to provide all of her living needs (home, car, insurance, food, utilities, etc.), and see her regularly, but have gone on with my life, forming a new relationship with a woman who is healthy and supportive of my situation.about five years ago, i read a “white paper” about frontotemporal dementia and brought it up with her care community, and it was brushed off.  i have come to understand that our local community does not have any real awareness or expertise with respect to ftd, and i am really angry that we spent thousands of dollars and thousands of hours chasing what turned out to be incorrect diagnosis and treatments.  and i now know that i might have been able to be more helpful had we been able to access good information.in essence, the lack of intelligent, competent expertise contributed to the destruction of our family, and now, finding out, from experts far from home, that this is ftd, feels like such a failure, for me, and for my family.  it is just awful!  dealing with the disease is bad enough, but being told it is a dozen other issues, and thinking all these years that she could “choose to do things differently” when she was, in fact, losing her mind, is the ultimate angry resolution, for me and my adult children.it is simply a shitty failure, at all levels, and for a medical community that constantly talks up it’s acumen, intelligence, and brags about being the ‘best in the world’ i say an angry “fuck you”!",,0
"okay, this will probably be a long one. my friend is 26. his mom is 62. within 1.5 years or so, she went from a fully-functional college professor to near-invalid. some of the things that have happened...- she has zero short-term memory left. she remembers her childhood and whatnot, but her memory is blank for the past 10 years or so.- she frequently digs out old bills and mail and insists that she just got them.- she screams and cries all night, every night. - she sees people who don't exist in the house, and believes that the family is conspiring against her in many different ways.- she will randomly switch to a ""baby talk"" voice in the middle of conversations, and will begin speaking gibberish here and there.- she will take out all of the food in the fridge and scatter it all over the house. friend can no longer keep anything in the fridge.- in her nightly rage fits, she has smashed a tv, numerous appliances, and a glass stovetop, as well as turned the oven on high and stuck wads of old mail in the toaster (but didn't turn it on.) all small appliances and sharp objects have been locked away.friend has two brothers, he's the middle one. dad basically isn't in the picture. neither of the brothers live at home, and never help with care.friend keeps the house via his job and mom's disability checks, but she's becoming increasingly dangerous to herself and the house, and it's more and more of a risk to leave her home alone. she went to the doctor once, got a vague diagnosis of alzheimer's before she threw a fit and they had to leave. it's basically too dangerous to take her in public at this point. she needs round-the-clock supervision and care, and friend is prepared to put her in a home. however, he has no idea how to find out about her insurance situation, etc. we're sure there's no nursing home insurance, her disability definitely won't cover it. what are their options, if any?thanks, everyone.",,0

"found out the hard way when i tried to make a withdrawal that didn’t go through. the state called me to tell me after i already had figured out what happened and figured out who the conservator would be. i kinda knew this would be on the horizon after my dad saw the most useless psychiatrist ever. she took him off his anti depressant, and made a recommendation to the court that someone else be appointed the conservator. i was hoping that 1) it would take more time; this appointment was at the end of july and 2) that she would hear my plea that this isn’t what my father (if he was in his right mind) or i would have wanted, and that this potentially could ruin my life as i know it. i helped him sell his previous house late last year in a high cost of living area, and to move to a new house in the same state with lower cost of living. i didn’t have malicious intent, but did want to ensure that my needs were met; food, medication, clothing, etc. he constantly accused me of wrongdoing because i wasn’t able to devote my life to constantly shopping for him, and didn’t want to spend $200+ a day buying himplants. i already cut back a lot of my expenses. it took me a long time to find stable employment where we live now and now i’ve had a job for a month… making half of my previous income doing 2-3x more work. i’ve barely been able to pay off debt and pay bills, let alone save anything. i do have some peace of mind knowing i’m no longer responsible for his financial or medical logistics. i was in way over my head with that and now don’t have a responsibility on me that i can’t handle. however, i have no idea what the future has in store. i don’t know if i’m going to be kicked out of my house. i don’t think my dad is going to be happy when he realizes a court appointed conservator is going to be much more expensive and give him much less of what he wants than i would have. i know there’s a probate hearing coming up next month, but have no idea what that means or what to expect. my friend who used to be a caretaker mentioned that it’s possible i could insist on being paid for half the value of the house, since my name is on the title. this would be the most ideal outcome, since then i’d have a safety net and the ability to figure out a plan. idk how realistic that actually is though if they don’t want to sell the house in the immediate future. he hasn’t declined enough to need to memory care. if anyone has gone through this and has any idea of possible outcomes to expect, that’d be very helpful. any support or advice is appreciated.",,0
"i'm curious about the communities experience with discovering the signs of early onset dementia in their loved ones. what were the signs, how long did the process take to receive a diagnosis, what was that journey like, do you have any recommendations for a neurologist or neuropsychologist in new york city by any chance?for some context, my mother (62) has been out of work since june 2020. she exhausted her short-term disability and was terminated. i (24/f) think the jobs insurance is still trying to contact her doctors for a diagnosis. there is no diagnosis. she has seen a neuropsychologist who said she has cognitive decline but it's not on par with dementia so we just have to wait and see it get worse. i'm drowning because my mother has not maxed out her credit cards. she only received 1,000 a month for social security retirement and now i'm all of a sudden the sole breadwinner in the household. i live with my mother. i'm an only child with no family support system. i want to move out and live my own life and not have to take care of my mother. i'm just curious how long it's taken for other people to get a diagnosis because this journey to getting my mother one is insufferable. i need help.",,0
"i haven’t been able to see my mom (54 f) in 7 months now, during this time i can tell her condition has worsened and it’s very hard to keep her entertained when i call her, i blow kisses at her and make funny faces and sometimes she’ll respond back and it’s like a game for us but i am wondering what else can i do from a distance to help her mental state not deteriorate so fast. she still recognizes that i am her daughter or at least someone she loves, but she can’t hold a proper conversation, she repeats the same mix of words constantly but she does get agitated if she hears someone talking about her condition, i think there is still part of her deep down. how can i keep conversation without being condescending? i feel bad that i talk to her like a baby but she reacts happily to it, and my dad and brother who live with her are not as affectionate. i just feel lost, i’m hoping my finances improve so i can put her in daycare once this pandemic is over but i feel useless right now, i was her caretaker until last year and i feel like i’ve abandoned her and i don’t know what to do.",,0
"my grandmother has lewy body dementia. in short, she should have been moved months ago. this is partially due to my grandfather's denial and finances. additionally, her doctor seems to almost be in his own denial. the family was told that my grandmother needed a wellness check before entering a home. the only thing he will schedule is a telephone appointment. i do not believe half of the messages are even being passed on to him.i was discussing this along with other things (possible wandering, dangerous delusions, etc) with my personal therapist. she said it sounds like my grandmother is becoming dangerous to live with. i agreed.so, who is responsible for finding a nursing home? the doctor, the family? what was your experience? anything and everything is helpful. thanks!also, if it matters, we live in north carolina.",,0
"howdy, this is a master post of what i've learned about caring for a relative with dementia.  i'm not a health care professional, i've just been through this four times and want a post to give to those who are new. this post combines six other posts.  constructive criticism is welcome.  it's written without covid in mind; it changes things, of course, but most of this is still applicable now and the rest will be again.  there's not a lot of sugar-coating here so if you're in a bad headspace, read this later.  dementia is a progressive, incurable disease that results in death.  half of everyone who lives long enough will develop dementia.  there are multiple types of dementia, but absolute diagnosis of the specific type usually cannot be made until after death.  specific things will make dementia worse: infections, dehydration, surgery, radiation/chemo, hospital stays, changes in routine, traveling, broken bones, alcoholism, etc.  most sufferer's progressions follow a similar pattern, but everyone's specific journey will be different.  note that this progression can take months or decades.  there are things that can be done, we think, to prolong or prevent the onset of dementia symptoms.  a diet low in sugar and alcohol but high on plants and fiber like the mediterranean diet can help.  exercise is essential.  those who speak two languages are half as likely to develop dementia, and people with higher educational attainment develop debilitating symptoms much later than those with less educational attainment. &amp;#x200b;# begin the journeyonce you suspect dementia, get your elder the best long term care insurance you can find.  use their most recent physical you can get; if it's too old, get a new one asap.  do not mention to the doc your suspicions about memory issues; family seems to pick up on these 1-5 years before they show up on the actual diagnostics, and it'd stop you from getting good ltc insurance.  read the contract and see how long you have to wait to get a dementia diagnosis after the policy goes into effect, so to not invalidate the insurance. this is the time to get your legal paperwork in order.  get your power of attorney or equivalent, and get the different forms the different institutions require.  your bank will usually have a notary on hand who can notarize things for you.  speaking of banks, consider moving finances to a credit union.  cus are non-profit: they don't make money off you by charging fees.  this small difference every month can save a lot of money for later, when you really might need it.  care homes are expensive.  also, get your long term directives in order.  what does your elder consider important to her quality of life?  what daily activities does she consider necessary: if she can't do that, it's not worth it?  does she want cpr?  life support?  for how long?  how does she want her body handled?  where to be buried/ashes to be scattered?  your doctor may have a booklet that will help you go through all of this, which can be filled out, notarized, and filed with your doctor/hospital so they have to honor her wishes. then get a dementia diagnosis.  many times a simple problem like a uti or other infection can appear as dementia-like symptoms, so rule out other (solvable) problems first.  if your relative is resistant to going to the doctor, offer to take them out to lunch, or ask them to keep you company while you get a prescription from the hospital's pharmacy, and then take them to their appointment.  yes, it's devious, but nothing happens without a diagnosis.  once you're sure of dementia talk with your resources both professional and family.  your healthcare may have a memory care or elder care group that can help you understand what's going on and what's going to happen.  bring your relatives, or bring them back the brochures.  there will be a lot of very difficult questions from relatives/friends who are not in the loop, such as ""what can we do"" and  ""what's the cure"".  the answers are ""take care of her until she dies"" and ""there isn't a cure"", which they won't like to hear, but will have to accept from the professionals.  so having someone else answer those questions is usually a lot easier.  if they know generally what the progression is you're less likely to come up against issues with them later.  so many relatives think ""oh, they're just hanging with grandma, how nice!"", when the truth is so much darker.  half of all caregivers will develop diseases or die while caregiving; it's often one of the worst, most stressful things we will do in our lives.  get a support group going for yourself, early, while you're still able to find time.  get a therapist if you can.  look around for what help is available where you are.  you go to [alz.org]( and use their resources.  out where i am we have a lot of local resources for home care and supplemental care, i hope you have the same or better.  you can find this by searching for ""elder care"" and your city, county, country, province, etc.  day care, respite care, and other programs are, frankly, essential. this part is important and ongoing.  start looking at where she is in the progression of the disease and make plans for the next step.  not planning for the future is the biggest mistake most families make.  they're so incredibly busy just barely taking care of today's needs that they're not ready for the next step.  my aunt was  literally hoisting my grandmother onto her back to get her from her bedroom to her chair in the front room, and then took care of her during  the day... and that was all she could do.  when grandma caught a cold, the coughing kept her from holding onto my aunt's shoulders so she couldn't get out of bed.  that led to the beginning of bedsores, so she had to go to the hospital.  instead of letting it get to that point aunt should have had in-home carers, lifts, equipment, supportive mattresses... so many things would have made life easier for both of them.  but aunt was too busy -- or overwhelmed -- with the massive job of caregiving.  prepare for the next step while you can. apply for government-paid in-home caring/recompense/assistance now, because by the time your requests are approved, she'll probably need them.  apply for a place at the best memory care facility you can find/afford now, because you can decline placement over and over and over, and just be put back at the head of the list for the next available spot.  during covid we found that the places with union workers had the lowest numbers for covid infections, controlling for many variables, due to the workers having access to ppe, so that's a consideration you might want to look for.  your country/states' department of social services will probably have a rating on all their care homes that might be helpful. many places are big enough that they provide multiple services, from respite to simple assisted living to locked wards, often via different wings.  respite is like checking your elder into a hotel for a weekend: the facility will take your elder for a bit to give you a break, and will help familiarize her with the facility.  these facilities will be able to transition your elder from one stage to the other via professionals.  this is very helpful because caregivers just compensate and compensate and compensate, burning themselves out far past the point where they should have transitioned.  keep in mind that these places run from 60k to 200k per year.  that insane price, along with the proof that elders are healthier longer at home, are why most people keep their elders at home with them for much longer than we used to.  but sometimes a care home is just necessary.  there are placement services which will take your elder's requirements (ostomy care, diabetes, hoyer lifts, meds, etc), distance from your home, and prices into consideration and get you a list of facilities.  they're very helpful and usually take recompense from the homes themselves so they don't cost you anything. save what you can.  talk to your mom and get recordings of her voice.  get tapes of all the family histories and stories you'll ever want to hear.  get her involved in alz groups as an aid or an assistant  so when she's a participant she'll still want to be there.  find out what her favorite music is, download it onto an easy-to-play format for when/if she has bad days.  get out the old pictures and see if she can identify the mystery faces. if you have access to it, look into high-cbd products to see if your elder has a good reaction to them.  dementia progression typically includes depression and anger, and most patients also experience sundowning, sleeplessness, and/or agitation.  cbd can help with all of these if it's well tolerated.  please check with your doctor first, there are a few medications that interact very badly with cannabis.  i have personally had very good luck with mary's medicinals' ""the remedy"" and a high-cbd edible but had to try a few things to find what actually worked.  and boy howdy they really do help. these are things you can do instead of worrying.  i do these things because not doing them is a bad idea, and they help me work through the grief.  activity helps dispel fear and anxiety. &amp;#x200b;# the progressionthe sufferers and caregivers who do the best with this disease are those who plan for the future.  they know what the next stage is and they've already done the research and signed the papers.  the ***best prepared*** progression is usually:1. ""impaired  cognition"" noticed by family, usually in ""help me find my car, i don't remember where i parked it"" situations.  electronic gps like a tile can help here.2. poa/healthcare poa signed by sufferer3. all financials nailed down, local laws researched, support group/network for caregiver found and activated4. dnr, ""quality of living"", death, corpse arrangements, burial arrangements discussed ahead of time5. long-term care health insurance attained (asap, the longer you wait the more expensive it will be)6. shared home prepared for sufferer to live with caregiver (separate doors, ramps, extra rooms, extra baths, ada furniture, doorways, hallways etc)7. patient diagnosed with dementia, usually ""mild to moderate"" stage8. this is usually when their driving starts to suffer.  taking away their keys usually provokes horrible rages, there is another option.  go to your country/state's department of motor vehicles site to submit their form for retesting an elder's capability to drive.9. medications to deal with side-effects prescribed, such as sundowner's, violent tendencies, hallucinations, etc.10. medications to help with actual alzheimer's prescribed.  they are usually not very effective, but are expensive and have serious side effects.  some experimental treatments, such as specific forms of light therapy, are showing promise but these will not be available from hmos for 7-10 years  from now.11. driver's license revoked, usually automatically after diagnosis &amp; medication12. apply to state/fed/insurance for any assistance, from financial to in-home.  this may take many tries and many years.  talk to your hospitals' elder care representative.13. if sufferer is violent, hallucinating, or wanders, talk to local authorities so they can be prepared.  this may not be appropriate in certain jurisdictions or for certain families. 14. get an electronic tracker, bracelet, or other identifier for any wandering patient.15. around this point a few sufferers take their own lives to spare their loved ones from dealing with a body without a mind.  this is not common with boomers and silent generations as they generally believe suicide to be a sin, but we're seeing it become more and more common in patients who are younger.16. this is the point where we used to institutionalize our elders. it was very common in the 70's and 80's and even 90's to put them in care homes.  now we know that they decline much faster when institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home, where they get better  care.17. in-home care becomes necessary during the day.18. 24/7 in-home care becomes necessary or the patient needs to be admitted to a memory care facility.  this is a locked ward where trained professionals deal with hallucinations, violent tendencies, etc.  this step is usually triggered by a tragic incident, such as patient wandering and being found by authorities, patient harming caregiver, patient injuring self, etc.  memory care facilities are not cheap, they can run between $4,000 - $14,000+ a month.  &lt;&lt; this is where  caregivers with insufficient preparation or insufficient healthcare access burn out... badly.19. patient loses memories entirely, needs help with every daily activity20. patient loses ability to feed self21. patient loses ability to swallow&amp;#x200b;this will be posted to both r/alzheimers and r/dementia.   i hope that anyone else can chime in if i've missed anything.",,0
"hello i live in the uk and my mother has been recently diagnosed with early stage alzheimer's. we are currently working with her to organise her life so she can live independently as long as possible. there are two areas we need a bit of help and advice in. 1: my mum currently lives independently with some help from her family with shopping etc. however we recognise the alzheimer's is a degenerative condition and therefore she will require day to day care at some point in the future. how have you guys introduced home care and what form has it taken? what care providers have you used? etc2: finances have recently become an issue as she has been the victim of multiple cold call scams. we have power of attorney and are currently in the processes of taking over her bank account so we can keep closer control. how have you guys minimised exposure to people trying to take advantage? what systems are there so my mum can have access to money for the day to day but not exposure her self if she gives, for example, her card details to someone trying to rip her off (happened multiple times now). any advice would be much appreciated, even if its just links to good websites to look at. thanks!",,0
"hey there everyone. my name is mustafa and i'm 23. 6 months ago i was on the verge of ending my life .at a very young age where everyone is striving and working hard for a better life. unfortunately for me everything went on pause in 2018 i got diagnosed with osteoarthritis aka (disk degeneration)that's where i had to be friend chronic pain..my past 2.5 years was filled with so much pain that i lost everything in my life.my relationships went down hill , my finances were all spent on finding a cure , uni failed me since i was not able to study due to pain and so much more i sucked it all up cuz i was told there's nothing you can do about it just like alzheimer's. anyways 2020 march arrives and that's when sh*t hits the fan and got fired my job at a restaurant because i forget alot of orders and instructions that i've been given.i realized my brain is not working right. it's like i have conversation with someone in the next minute or two i realize i would forget 90% of what we talked about. let alone just that i couldn't perform normal calculations in my head . man that felt so weird coming from someone who has graduated from a levels 5 years ago with straight up a's and b's.long story short i went through different doctors trying to find what's going on and i would always make sure i'd have my phone recorder on cuz the next minute i'd step out i'd legit forget what they just told me.after weeks of visits i knew that there no hope for me man . literally every doctor said something .i got diagnosed with adhd , depression , anxiety.and the one i hated the most was ""oh i think it's all in your head"". yes sure...i tried all the meds from adderall to anti depressants you name it. they just threw pills week after week. hoping one day i come by and talk about how they helped me..unfortunately none did.i wanted to see how bad my brain was so  i found a test called moca.i think alot of you should know what this is . it's a test doctors put people on if they have cognitive decline. no doctor wanted to test me out or do a scan on my brain so i did the test on my own and my score was literally 5/30. man i knew life was over for me and my parents would have to go through this with me as well which was horrifying.time was passing by and things getting worse day by day for some reason i'd be staring at the window for no reason for minutes.days pass and weird words come out of my mouth and i'd stutter trying to put one sentence together. i think it's called aphasia.i know i'm talking so much about my symptoms but i'm trying to show you how bad my case is. but you might wonder how the hell am i typing this entire post if i had dementia..i'll gladly explain and it's why i'm putting this out.6 months ago that's when i was at rock bottom i discovered a book called ""the end of alzheimer's"" by dr dale bredesen.i was so desperate that if someone told me the cure is to eat a plate of shit . i would do it regardless if it's true or not. it's called desperation for a solution.anyways dr dale details everything a person needs to know about this disease but not just that. he's been able to reverse his clients cognitive decline with a protocol that he has extensively put out in his book .i was skeptical but i wanted something that gives me hope so i decided to follow.  jesus man 6 months in and i swear on my mom's life that it f*cking works.i have recently done the cognitive test and my moca score was 30/30.i'm able to remember conversations , my vocabulary increased , aphasia is vanishing , i can understand movies and so much more..i highly recommend anyone who's watching a loved one die day by day to give this book a shot or hell maybe you yourself are experiencing symptoms of memory loss too . there's hope for everyone no matter how far they are ...i'm not the first one who has come back to life but in the book he shares different stories of his clients who show obvious results and they have gone back to normal life..i feel sad at time i walk by a nursing home next to my house and i see a bunch of elderly probably with severe alzheimer's stuck where they are and never get to truely come back to life just like i did.anyways for me it's been 6 months and i can't say i'm fully back 100% to where i was but jesus i'm so happy things turned around when it seemed impossible..it's a journey and it takes times i can't imagine the how my next years will be. i'm looking forward to uni again 😊yeah and also i forgot to mention that my chronic pain has subsided . i finally live a pain free life. i swear the only reason i posted this is so that someone reads this and hopefully gives the book a shot . we all know how hopeless it is to hear someone go through dementia. if you got any question i'll gladly answer ☺️",,0
"i’m still fairly new to this. my dad (57) hasn’t been officially diagnosed but he’s been on a rapid decline for the last 2 years and closer now to a diagnosis.my mom has been going through the disability services for almost a year, has a disability lawyer, and we are close, but i am shocked how hard it is to officially go through. i know with covid things are taking longer but has anyone else experienced this? she has some some money to fall back on but idk how people in more dire need go through this.my mom is also taking on more shifts as she is the only one working and it’s getting to the point where my dad cannot stay home alone for long periods. not to mention being afraid of him letting the dogs out by opening doors often, he is very restless and has fallen down stairs, locked himself out of his room (he now does not have a lock on his door), and cannot care for himself or needs anymore. we are always nervous about him getting hurt or breaking something if no one is around. he has tried to put things in dvd players that don’t belong among other problems with electronics. how are people affording nurses or someone to do home visits? insurance doesn’t cover it. if we get disability with that cover it? money is getting tight. how are you all affording nursing homes/memory care? sorry for the questions, i would just like to know as much info as possible! please share your experiences and other helpful info. we are located in nj if that helps.",,0
"our family has reached a dilemma. a month ago, my siblings and i agreed that it was time for dad to quit driving (mid-stage non diagnosed alzheimer's). he does not feel that he is dangerous, and is stubborn. nobody wants to be the bad guy, so we felt his doctor, who has done cognitive tests, could get the ball rolling. so the doctor requested a common form from the dmv, (which the dmv sent by mail to dad) with a deadline to submit a physical check. the form also has space for the doctor's opinion. doc put on the form that he recommended a new road test and advice from a neurologist. so the ball is in play, with a deadline of jan.31 to submit results to the dmv.some background: dad's mother died of alzheimer's and he never dealt with it emotionally. he has never talked about his feelings, ever; the stereotypical tough farmer bit. we all agree that his *knowing* that he suffers from alzheimer's (even though it's obvious to everyone around him) and that his family knows it, would really crush him. we just want him to sleep well at night and be comfortable. so we decided that he could do a road test, which he won't likely pass, and that would make the neurologist appointment moot anyway. losing his driving freedom would be the lesser evil here for sure. now that the gp has referred to a neurologist and an appointment was made, if it goes on the record that this appointment was declined, could his life insurance later use that as a reason for denial? the rest of his physical exam shows him to be in excellent physical health, except for blood thinner (wayfarin) that he's been taking for about 15 years.if anyone has had similar situation, please share your experience.",,0
"i've created this topic in hopes of receiving some guidance to help my help-resistant father who is a 66 year old, white male, with a family history of dementia, chemical dependency, and heart disease (which he's been diagnosed with).  my dad has a clear case of alcoholism. the effects of being impaired by alcohol and the symptoms of dementia can seem very similar to me. however, on top of this, he is on a temporary medication to resolve an abnormal heart beat which caused crippling flu-like symptoms for months. the side effects of this medicine are also extremely crippling including loss of balance (needed a cane to walk) and my family believes ultimately causing depression.  he also may have hearing impairment which makes him appear to be disengaged during many conversations. we are going this week to get tested for that, which i hope helps to improve his quality of life. in terms of his possible dementia: his mother had it as well as his aunt (on his father's side), however his aunt was actually diagnosed with alzheimers while i don't believe his mother was (please excuse me if i'm showing my ignorance to these diseases). i'm going to list some signs but i'm not super knowledgable on these diseases some may not be signs. the list:* short term memory severely hindered. forgets plans, medicines, entire conversations etc.  * when his mother was diagnosed with dementia my mom pointed out that she would only ever talk about her childhood and never acknowledged her grandchildren’s childhood when the conversation was about her grandchildren. pretty much she’d bring many conversations back to herself somehow. well, i’ve noticed my dad does this too now, but in relation to any conversation. it is literally impossible to have a conversation with family friends without him interjecting their story with a personal anecdote about himself as a child but also sometimes as himself during current times.  i feel like this is related to dementia because of the history with my grandmother who didn’t do this until her diagnosis but also because this is a new behavior for him too. * if he does tell a modern story he will tell it at least 5-10xs over* insomnia* he has a blank stare where you can just tell what you’re saying isn’t computing at all but this is usually at night after drinking all daymy question is: how can my family tackle this? so many issues that have similar symptoms or whose symptoms blur from each medical condition.  i feel like he can’t be the only one who drinks like a fish and who also shows signs of dementia, but when i searched this sub i couldn’t find many relatable topics. i also don’t know how to convince him to go to treatment. i’ve asked him to go before and he resists the concept. he knows we won’t judge him at all. i don’t understand why he won’t get help for this.my goal would then be to determine if his symptoms are the acute effects of being drunk pretty much all the time or if they are indeed dementia symptoms.  since most of the time my family interacts with him he is impaired, it makes it nearly impossible to know. i’ve learned about something called “wrap around care.”  it seems like its usually for at risk youth, but from what i understand its a team of medical professionals, from a variety of different specialities, who help get someone back on their feet.  does anyone know if there is anything like that for adults? is it something insurance is inclined to cover? thanks so much for any input and i am sorry if this really lengthy. there are just so many ongoing issues. i'd been away for four years and i sort of came home to this 6 months ago--it wasn't always like this.",,0
"my mom's frontotemporal dementia is worsening rapidly and my family's at the point where we can't take care of her ourselves anymore. unfortunately, she's 62 and will be switching to medi-cal in january (she's on dad's military insurance now but loses it when he turns 65 and he's forced to go on medicare), and i'm having difficulty finding affordable options for care, as most places i've checked don't accept medi-cal and charge upwards of $5000/mo. she needs round-the-clock assistance (or as many hours of in-home care as possible), which makes it even harder.i'd love advice on where to look for care options or anything else i should keep in mind. i've been scouring websites like coveredca and dhcs to see what's covered, but i'm in such a distraught state that trying to find the information i'm looking for is getting overwhelming, and navigating the government sites is honestly confusing. any leads or clarification (even if it's from the websites i've already checked) would be greatly appreciated.",,0
so i will try to keep this as short and concise as possible. my grandmother has dementia. she was having slight hallucinations but within about a week is having full on delusions. we believe it was due to being on new meds that interacted with each other. she is now off the meds but the problem hasn't gone away. the real question is we don't know what to do. my mom is her caregiver but she works 2 jobs and my grandmothers insurance has denied her claim for in home care. they only live a block away from each other but with all the doctors visits and everything my mom doesn't have the time or energy to do a lot of leg work. she doesn't know where to start and she feels helpless. my grandmother has a case worker but they are no help. does anyone have any advice on who my mother could call to get some help? she just doesn't know who to contact or really what questions to ask. any help would be greatly appreciated.,,0

"hi.  i currently live in so ca but the rest of my family are all still in baltimore including who i am talking about.  my grandfather (93) definitely has dementia.  he sundowns, accuses my 86 year old gramma, who can’t walk,  of letting men in to have relations with them. he’s cantankerous, defiant, extremely mean and verbally abusive.  3 times my mom and aunts have had to wrestle bats out of his hands in the middle of the night. here’s the issue.  he will not go get tested or seen.  thinks nothing is wrong with him, it’s everyone else. he sits next to my grandmother day and night, uttering venom at her, and honestly, i think it’s slowly killing her.what can be done about this situation?  is there a way to make him go?  are we just stuck?edit to add: both have health insurance through medicare and kaiser, and make decent money through retirement and social security.",,0
"i don't really know why i'm typing this, i guess i just need to vent with people who will understand.my mom has been diagnosed with dementia a few months ago. we kind of knew it was the case, but a pet-scan (which was incredibly expensive as she has no health insurance for we can't afford it) confirmed it. she has real trouble speaking as she can't find the words she wants to use, and in result i can barely understand her, every sentence she speaks turns into a game of figuring out what she's trying to tell me. she can barely stand up without falling for some reason, and affording the exams to figure out what's wrong and go to a specialized doctor is very difficult for us (we live in brazil, btw; public health doctors are hard to come by because of the humongous waiting lists). she can't eat, she hates every food in the planet, except for some fruits (and even then, she doesn't like them as much as she once did). no doctors ever say anything about this, but it's been taking a toll on her quality of life, as she barely eats because she's disgusted at the food. i prohibited her from driving most of the time (she crashes and scrapes the car pretty often), and i don't have a license either, so i can't take her to places. i feel like the responsability on me would get even heavier if i learned how to drive, so i've been avoiding it.my patience unfortunately runs thin as it's so hard for me to see the state she's in that i've been answering to the situation by getting angry at her, even though it's not her fault at all. she has always been independent and smart, and now she's getting more dependant on me by the minute. she can still sort out her meds, but for how long? she's been getting precarious with her personal hygiene, and she won't let me help her as she doesn't feel she needs help.i feel infuriated and extremely sad at the thought of having her dependent on me. i don't think i could deal with it. i even decided i don't want kids because i don't want to take care of another human being like this again. taking care of her and seeing the way she is right now has been taking a toll on me. i have a psychologist and take meds for ocd, but it's just not enough for me to deal with this in a healthy manner. my therapist says i should try to have more light-hearted moments with my mom, but she's depressed as well and doesn't want to do anything other than ""watching"" tv (she barely pays attention to it and/or doesn't understand what's going on).i know she'll get worse and that things won't get better at all. which makes me feel completely hopeless. i get thoughts about how if she died, things would be better, as she will only get worse from now on and has little hope of having a better quality of life, which makes me feel horrible with myself. she says all the time that she wants to die. she complains all the time about how she can barely eat or walk or talk, and it feels like torture to me hearing this everyday. she doesn't talk about anything else, practically, just about her symptoms. i just feel like escaping this situation all the time, but i have few escape valves. few things give me pleasure anymore, and i'm having personal problems with how i view my own life, work and relationships. i feel like i might get depressed if i don't better my life in some way. it's just so much to deal with at once.i'm an only child, so i have no siblings to help me take care of her. i have to get out of work during my work hours to take her to doctors and exams, which greatly restricts the jobs i can have, as they have to be home office and with the freedom i have in my current job (however i don't have a computer to work at home, as i work editing videos, and the pc i do use belongs to the company i work in right now). i feel stuck, freedom-less. i'm 26 and been dealing with her decline since i was 24 or something like that.she used to have an addiction to slot machine games and i've been dealing with that since i was 17 years old, taking care of her money for her and having to deal with her lies and emotional breakdowns  because of that. it's taken a toll on me as well, but i use to have hope that she would overcome it. she eventually did, thank goodness. but with the dementia, it's different now. i have no hope left. not even one bit.sorry for the wall of text. i needed to get this out of my system.",,0
"this is all new changed behavior. father in law is either in denial or mom in law has made him sworn to not tell us/my husband too.  i think she is trying to hide dementia.  she clock watches at about 3pm. then rushes me to make dinner so she can be out by 5pm. she used to hang out until 8-9pm. i assumed this was to get home before the sun goes down. she had hallucinations 2 years ago, speaking of break ins that never happened. she thought people were in my basement, there wasn't. she thought someone was in our driveway stealing my car, nobody was there. she thought there was a fire in the bbq, there wasn't. then it just stopped, or she learnt to not speak of her hallucinations. she drops stuff all the time. falls all the time (she is 64). stooped. shuffles feet. she went through this phase she'd txt demanding for money or asking for social insurance number. she would say something is broken, you'd go there, its fine. mood swings, picking fights.  she will watch tv and say she went to school with a celeb, not like her to say this. she gets stuck on things. she used to txt me all the time to ask what the name of paint i used in my house. she'd ask daily. the latest behavior is lying (obviously not her fault). she said she had a surgery its infected. shes had no surgeries recent. she says she has a heart surgery coming up. then few days later says she has another surgery coming up. i told my hubby i think its all in her heard. its like her mind is stuck on surgeries lately. it used to be stuck on money and banking stuff. the paint. if we invite her over, she agrees then the day before makes up a reason why she can't. no hard feelings.  father in law avoids our questions and calls. thats another story. hes struggling with his mental health by caring for her i think.  just wondering, this sounding like dementia ?",,0
"the sidebar says ""don't suffer in silence."" and aside from close family members, i have been.my mother was diagnosed around 3 years ago with mild vascular dementia. now it's moderate. my dad and brother have been taking care of her, but my brother has a family and my dad is exhausted and can't keep up with the shopping, yard work, etc and keep an eye on her.sometimes she doesn't know where she is (at home) and doesn't know him. she can't see very well (although her eyes are apparently fine). she has extremely poor short term memory. she will ask me several times in the course of a conversation the same questions, and say the same things. she seems to remember old memories when i bring them up, but doesn't have much to add to the conversation other than to seem happy/surprised/etc. my phone calls with her are breaking my heart. i want to be there for her as she was for me, and i'm always strong for her on the phone, but it's hard to hold back the tears. she's getting worse and worse.the biggest hurdle for me is that i last saw her about 20 months ago since i live in the us and she's in the uk. affording plane tickets and getting time off is difficult. last time it was a struggle to get childcare for my kids (i only brought the youngest). she misses me. the most i've been able to do is call regularly. she can't use the computer, can't read/write, etc. even if i did visit, my help is temporary and i can't be there for emergencies. she has an emergency button on a necklace that's tied to a service that i help set up for her when i was last there, but she wouldn't know to push it now.to give my dad a break, after him resisting for a while, he had her admitted into a care home for a week. i just got off the phone with her today and she's not happy there and misses him terribly, and i felt so awful that i couldn't do anything for her. her voice was so sad, and she's never really been one to show any sadness to me - she's protected me from that until now. i don't feel i can tell my dad what she said since i don't think it'd do any good. he needs a break anyway, and it'd just make him feel bad. my brother is on vacation, which he also needs.we've set up power of attorney (financial and health).1. what can i gift to her overseas? i didn't do anything for her last birthday as i couldn't think of a single thing besides beauty parlor vouchers and sending flowers. she's beyond jewelry, books, movies, and many other things that involve sight, thinking, etc. i don't know her clothing tastes well enough. she may not remember a gift that i got her 30 minutes afterwards, but it makes me feel better.1. my young kids used to speak to her over the phone, but she struggles to hold a conversation even with me now, and the kids generally aren't great on the phone. how do i ensure they have lasting positive memories of her? i blame myself for the distance, but there's not a lot i can do. she has a grandchild, my nephew, that she sees regularly, which i'm glad for.1. i know dementia is a terminal disease. i don't know what her life expectancy is, and i don't know if it's possible to tell? not sure i'd want to know. she's recently started not eating as much and that worries me.1. how should i use this time now to prepare for the future? how do i prepare emotionally? what happens when she no longer knows my name, or me? she can't remember my kids names or ages already. those that have been through this, what did you wish you had done that you can no longer do? she was the one that knew my birth weight and time. i can never get to ask her that now.1. have any of you gone gotten professional help for yourself, someone to talk to? i have thought about calling my insurance's nurse line, but the hassle and stress of going through that may be counter-intuitive.i want my mum back :(",,0
"**edit:** thank you everyone for your advice and resources, i appreciate it so much and i have no idea what i can say to get across how reassured i feel. i'm going to be discussing some of these things and giving resources to the rest of my family, and hopefully we can find somewhere nice or at least have some external support network that we can rely on. thank you so so so muchthrowaway so that family doesn't see this in my main account's history. i don't really expect anyone to read this thoroughly but i just wanted to get it out there in the ether so maybe i can feel like there might be someone out there that can empathize with me.so a bit of background: i was raised in america by my american father and spanish mom, so i caught bits of spanish but i basically lost my fluency when i was a kid. still, when my grandma started showing signs of alzheimer, i was able to help out around the house and communicate with her when she needed something. since she's turned 90 her memory and cognition have basically just been on a sharp downhill decline. i'm leaving to university soon but until i do i'm kind of my grandma's caretaker while my mom works, since my dad can't speak a lick of spanish.today was a lot different. she seemed fine and even seemed to remember important details about her life, like the fact that her mother is not alive anymore. i thought that meant today was going to be a good day but for about forty-five minutes i've been basically doing my best to keep her from leaving the house.for some reason, she seemed to have this idea that this ""other girl"" (a recurring character, probably based off of me?) in the ""other house"" (which does not exist) has all of her stuff and that we need to go pick it up. she also seemed to think that there's some child we need to take care of? i know my spanish isn't great but she was literally rambling incomprehensibly and no matter what i said, she wouldn't really clarify anything. i don't think she really trusts me atm.so she was basically yelling at me while trying to open the door, though thankfully the locks are pretty hard to open and there's a chain that she no longer really has the dexterity to use, nor does she remember it's there. i tried to call my mom, who is obviously still fluent in spanish and who my abuela seems trust more usually, but she wasn't picking up the phone so i basically just tried to get her to calm down to the best of my ability while trying to get ahold of my mom.my mom finally called back and i heard her trying to bring my grandma back to reality but i'm just sitting here basically crying my eyes out because i'm stressed out. the worst part is that i don't think there are any options for us going forward, like we can't put her in a home because they're either expensive and not covered by her medical insurance or they straight up won't accept her because beyond her dementia she's not actually ill in any way. i'm just so tired and i feel selfish for wanting to just move out already because that just puts more burden on my family and i'm afraid of what's going to happen.sorry that this is super long and rambly, i'm basically typing it up moments after this all transpired.",,0
"hi all,i was hoping someone might be able to provide guidance as i'm in a dilemma. a family friend (late 60s, ""ronnie"") who took guardianship of me 15 years ago is now heading into the thick of frontotemporal dementia. unable to cook, eating raw food, dressing inappropriately, aggressive in certain situations. she also has severe aphasia affecting spoken and written communication.  ronnie still lives at home with her spouse (late 70s, ""sam"") on a rural farm property. **sam is unable/unwilling to take any action to alleviate stressors surrounding her condition and leaves it to me and sam's sibling to resolve, though we have no legal rights regarding assistance.** we are both overwhelmed and have no permissions to engage with any primary care providers aside from a community aphasia support program (who no longer replies to my attempts to contact).  **there is a concern that their adult son ""bob"", with a history of substance abuse, incarceration, gun violence and internet bullying may appear at any time and throw a gigantic wrench into things**.--------------------**what's we know/what is being done so far:** * community aphasia group liaising with dementia/memory support group for therapy stream switch* community aphasia group connecting with community care access connections for homecare assistance (have been unable to get info from them for the last 10 days)* ronnie had her license suspended for medical reasons in june* working with family friend to downsize farm* have transferred vehicles into sam's name so they may be sold* will was re-written to downsize inheritance values and change power of attorney to sam's sibling  -------------------**what we don't know:**  * what the will actually says (lawyer will not provide a copy to anyone but ronnie or sam; sam continually fails to source a copy or tells us to do it for him. sam does not know what is contained in the will)* whether the family lawyer is acting out of bounds by entertaining will adjustment requests by ronnie + sam at this time (sam has no idea what is going on and between aphasia + dementia, ronnie is not in a state to make changes) * whether a power of attorney for personal care was defined in the will * at what point is capacity to consent/capacity to make decisions assessed when no request for an assessment is made* how can a request for a capacity assessment be made when the requestor is not someone legally defined under the substitute decisions act* where the medical care team + aphasia team + community support team is at regarding in-home and medical assistance for ronnie * state of ronnie &amp; sam's finances/bills, as ronnie has always handled them----------------------**problems:*** sam is completely helpless. he does nothing to facilitate movement. he could not even get together vehicle ownerships for the day i took off to drive up and perform the transfer. he had two weeks' notice and constant reminders to do so* ronnie has become an alcoholic in her dementia - she should not be drinking but sam is afraid of her as she becomes physical (hitting, punching, brandishing knives) when denied. *i have not witnessed the knife sccenario** ronnie's aphasia combined with dementia makes it impossible to know whether she has true capacity to consent* ronnie's prior power of attorney has faded out on us, so sam changed poa for both of them to his sibling* sam's sibling does not want anything to do with this and participates grudgingly as it she is going through her own struggles right now* bob, their son, is an abusive alcoholic who has been jailed twice. is an internet vigilante. pushed ronnie so that she cracked her head off the floor 5 years ago, which accellerated the progression of her dementia* the added pressures of this situation resulted in me taking stress leave from work to pursue mental wellness (medication + counselling), and now sam things i should come live with them and care for ronnie (sorry guys, i'm a monster i know, but i absolutely cannot perform care duties - ronnie was a narcissistic abuser to me during the guardianship period and i do not feel comfortable)--------------------*where i need help:* * how do i kick-start any consent capacity assessments?* how do i get involved in a medical/legal sense when sam, ronnie's spouse, is the only legal actor right now?* how do i avoid just mic-dropping and walking out on this shitshow?  to whoever read this whole mess, thanks so much. i really appreciate it.",,0

"mom (73) has not been herself on several occasions and in early february, police called me (2 hours away) to her house to assist because she did not want her husband there.i forced the issue that day and miraculously eventually got her to her doctor's office and got a diagnosis of advanced dementia.since then, the police have been there several times for what are civil matters. most recently, in a bout of paranoia and rage, she was attempting to kick her husband out of the house and bit him as he was trying to restrain her.the police were called again and since she insisted she was healthy, she (and her husband) were charged with assault and disorderly conduct.again, the police called me (despite them both insisting i would not be called) and i was asked to help them come up with a plan.rather than discuss anything with me, my mother blamed me for what happened and called multiple times to leave messages to say she was disowning me and i think disinheriting me. she wasn't making a lot of sense, but i think that was her intent. i wasn't even there. i didn't call the police or even ask them to call me, all i did was answer my phone!now the county prosecutor has been calling me (again, unsolicited) and requesting that i intervene since my step dad has not taken any actions to handle the situation apart from getting a lawyer.of note, i was informed that the lawyer told the prosecutor that they think i am trying to get their money! i have no idea where this is coming from. i have never been one to ask for anything from my mom! she sometimes offers, i may protest, but she insists, so i allow it - such as when my late brother would ask for a few thousand for team uniforms for a bike race and she wanted to gift me an equal sum to make us ""even.""i want less responsibility in my life, not more! i do not want to tend to their finances.i did call their lawyer after the diagnosis to request a copy of her living will so i know what her medical wishes are, but that is only because she gave me a large package of their wills and trust documents, but despite my stepfather's living will being in the packet, hers was not.so, i guess i go up there this weekend to talk, but what do i do??? where do i even start?what if:1. they refuse to discuss it?2. stepdad may have started the poa process, but does not come up with an actual plan of what to do for her?3. they say they have a plan, but do not disclose what it is to me nor act on it?all of the above are very viable possibilities for this weekend and i am overwhelmed even thinking about it.",,0

"i'm sure this has been asked a hundred times before.  i dunno; i didn't check.  i just joined the community a minute ago and need an outlet.  i've sought legal help as well.since i can get rather long-winded, i'm using bullet points for brevity.  my adhd will have me handily jumping around:* i moved in with my mother to help her out.  i'm employed ft, great job, benefits, etc.  in other words, it wasn't to ""mooch"".  i see the dementia first hand.* my sister is well aware of our mother's condition.  we discussed it at length last january.* i learned during the above conversation that my sister talked our mom into putting my sister's name on our mother's checking account.  this isn't to pay bills on behalf of our mother.  she just has her name on our mother's checking account.* my sister has stopped taking my phone calls.  every time i contact my sister about something our mother did, i do it four (4) different ways (so she can't say she didn't get contacted).  whether or not this helps legally, i dunno.  i leave a voice mail, send a text, send an email, and send a message on the book of faces.* i won't go into all the symptoms; you're all familiar with them already.  * my sister lied about making an appointment with a gerontologist for over a year - since that talk in january, 2019.* march, 2020, i contacted an attorney.  a petition has been filed for guardianship of a disabled adult, etc., etc., etc.  i was the last human appointment for that attorney before the quarantine.* the petition has been filed, a guardian ad litem has been appointed; updates from the attorney aren't great but (i guess) covid and all.* before all the legal crap, i had called the state, the county, etc. to describe the signs and symptoms.  state referred me to the county; the county referred me to the local elder abuse hotline so i could report self-neglect.  i was told since our mom has full ""legal control"" -i don't remember the term they used- there was nothing they can do!

help - i’ve posted here before and this community has saved my sanity. so much empathy and sensitivity thankyou to the kindness of strangers who all have dementia in common. 🙏🏼🙏🏼i am in a very difficult situation. my mother with vascular dementia is constantly blaming me for putting her in a home and now she wants to do a new will and write me out of it. i am her only child she has no other family. i have worked tirelessly for 12 months cleaning up her incredibly messy life at the cost of my health and happiness. but she’s truly just always been bitter i don’t know why it’s just her personality now i have cancer. i was diagnosed last month and i’m not well. i’m fighting and going through chemo. i have bot told her and i do not intend to got good reason. she has no true friends only 2 people she calls every day and both of them have been involved in taking advantage of her financially. she speaks to everyone about her bank account balance which is considerable. she has been scammed out of thousands of dollars. if i tell her i have cancer she will automatically tell those scammers who will just hover over her even more in hope of getting a piece of her wealth. she did a will less than a year ago and has done the right thing and put me as her sole beneficiary.now she’s claiming that i’ve done wrong by her by putting her in a home and she wants me disinherited.it’s causing me so much hurt grief and to tell you the truth i’m feeling little desperate. i don’t know what to do. i know those people have put ideas in her head about a new will they are truly evil people. they even convinced her i was a drug addict (they gave never even met me or spoken to me). they just want her to believe that i’m her enemy. i’m her financial manager which is similar to poa and means i have orders from the supreme court to look after her finances and pay her bills etc. i do have the orders til the end of her life.what do i do? i’m beside myself and with being diagnosed i need to get well i need to fight for me life. i need advice i can’t ignore her as she just continues to ask for a copy of her will (as she wants to show her friends) and she wants a lawyer. she won’t let up. this stress is truly the last thing i can cope with right now.,,0
"my fit, well-groomed, well-dressed, pretty active, physically healthy 82 year old mom has been worried about her memory for 5 years now and she has brought it up at every doctor's appointment (i go to all of them with her). she always answers their questions about what day it is, who is the president, etc., correctly at her appointments. she repeats herself a lot to the doctors, though, so i know they know she has at least normal cognitive decline. she also has a few days a year where she is super sleepy and in an altered mental state (saying weird things as if she just woke up from a dream) and i was so worried about her on one of those days that one doctor scheduled her for a brain scan that came back fine/normal/typical.  the most dramatic elements of my mom's decline are her near-total loss of ability to do simple math, manage accounts, etc. she blanks out on the mere existence of accounts that she's had for years and she also can go through 5 or 6 checks trying to get one bill paid. she recently made one of her kids current (not springing) poa and resigned as trustee of her revocable trust with 2 kids as co-trustees. i know all of her accounts, obligations, bill due dates, etc., and it's my hope that she stays as willing to be pampered in an administrative respect as she has been so far (all of her kids, myself included, have pitched taking over her affairs for her as a form of pampering and she has been willing to accept the help (which she needs). anyway, **i find myself wondering where this is going and whether i'm letting her down in not being super vigilant about getting her diagnosed(?).** sometimes i read about lbd and think that's going to be her (super sensitive to medications, talking in her sleep a good deal and occasionally getting up at 4 am, thinking she has an appointment that she needs to dress for and get out of the house, etc.).  i'm told she's very atypical in that--in mere social situations-- she's very mainstream, kind, appropriate, beautifully dressed, etc. (she may not remember people's names, but she'll greet them warmly and say ""forgive me, i'm forgetting how we know each other?"") i guess i keep expecting her to behave unlike herself in addition to forgetting things, but she is just herself less all of her business acumen and computational skills, etc. (and less her memory of many peripheral people, past vacations, events, etc.).  **is hers a familiar/typical progression? she's definitely accelerating in losing her memory and what's left of her ability to manager her affairs, but she's still herself.**",,0
my mother was diagnosed with vascular dementia almost 2 years ago. there’s a little mental health mixed in just to make her more interesting. she also on the  narcissistic spectrum - all the colours of the rainbow 🌈 she  is very bitter towards me since she blames me for losing her independence and being in a home. i’m her poa and she barely understands what that is and thinks i just go shopping with her money. she is always always asking about her money and where is it. i tell her it’s in the bank safe and sound. she also wants to know how much there is. the problem is she has financial scammers that are still in regular contact with her. she tells them everything how much money she has and since they have already taken advantage of her in the past i do not trust them but sadly she does. she has a mobile that she can make calls from but i’ve diverted all calls to myself. that way anyone trying to call her get me and hang up. i don’t want her constantly divulging her finances to these people and i’ve noticed she’s now started to call new phone numbers to people i do not know. she makes friends with people very quickly states they are her ‘best friends’what in the world do i do? i don’t want her to think i’m hiding stuff from her but i also know that she mouths off to every one including nursing home staff about her finances. it’s embarrassing and makes me feel very vulnerable as her only child.i need to protect her and me. i even found out that one of them tried getting in a lawyer to see her to do a new will. i nearly had a heart attack the only reason they didn’t succeed is cos of corvid. i’m in a constant state of panic and it’s affecting my health. the home can’t stop people from visiting her but they seem to mostly only be in contact with the phone.,,0
"from mid 2018 to early 2020 i lived in my family's vacation home while attending classes. my grandma lived less than 5 minutes away. during this time i would visit her almost daily for hours. her symptoms began with delusions and paranoia. i immediately knew something was wrong and at this point in time the rest of my family was on board with me when i said she needed to see a doctor. however as her symptoms progressed much of my family fell into denial. i witnessed my grandmother hallucinate, cry, beg to feel better. i witnessed her tear up her house looking for money she was convinced some man had stolen. i witnessed her stare out her window for hours saying she saw kids playing when there was nobody there. i saw her lose weight and watched as her quality of life dwinded. i was there every night and hugged her when she was frightened of the man who she said sat in her chair. i begged my family to get her serious help. i remember them constantly telling me she doesn't have dementia she doesn't have dementia. nobody would listen to me. i am currently 22 and had just turned 20 when i moved up north. my family saw me as a child. my words held no weight. the worst part is that they saw it too, they just chose to ignore the signs. my aunt and uncle lived next door to me and therefore also frequented her house. they saw what i saw, maybe not to the same degree as i spent the most time with her but they saw it nonetheless. they had her see neurologists, they had her put on vitamins they thought were her eyes, they thought it was everything but dementia and refused to listen to me. my family is large, very large. not one single person made an effort to get her the help she needed. i had no control over the family finances so i couldn't just do it myself as much as i wanted to. we have the money for a live in aid, we have the money for good doctors and facilities. i know dementia is incurable and eventually leads to death but i also know there are ways to greatly improve quality of life especially when treated early.today i visited her for the first time in 6 months. i moved back downstate at the beginning of 2020 and covid made it quite hard to travel.she did not know who i was. my grandmother, the woman who helped me through the hardest times of my life, the strongest most amazing woman i know, asked me who i was.currently one of my aunts is living a few houses down from her and takes care of her. i no longer try to speak my mind on her care as it was made clear to me that my opinion means nothing. i don't know if she's seeing doctors or getting the care she deserves.i told my sister how distraught i am that for so long my family blew me off and ignored me and know that my own grandmother doesn't recognize me. they finally admit she has dementia.my family has been telling me that i need to visit her more before she dies. i want to scream at them, scream that i was there for her every day when she was hallucinating, i want to beg them to tell me why they didn't listen to me, why they didn't listen to her.it's too late now and i expressed to my father and sister that i was upset that nobody listened to me. my father blew me off and while my sister was understanding and supportive i think she thinks i'm overreacting. i really miss my grandmother, i don’t know how to  deal with any of this",,0
"my father started cognitive decline a few years ago. he was very neglectful and basically ignored my sister and i in favor of his wife’s kids. until he started to get bad and his wife left him. my sister and i are the only ones who have stepped up to care for him. he’s stubborn and won’t let anyone manage his finances, we spend hours helping him with various things only to discover he’s undid our work. after 3 years of caring for him im at the end of my rope. i went on antidepressants, i am in therapy. that didn’t stop me from having a full blown meltdown at work. they asked me to rake fmla to care for myself. less than one week into this my father had a massive heart attack so the entire “self care” break was spent in the hospital feeling massive anxiety and exhaustion. now he is facing round the clock care, and will probably run out of money before he dies. the money he left is was basically his olive branch because he knew he was a shitty dad. i was going to use the $ to get out of a job i loathe and go back to school to do what i’ve always wanted to. now he will die penniless and leave us nothing more than likely. i feel shallow for resenting him, for feeling transactional about it. but it’s deeper than that. when a parent has neglected you and then you find yourself caring for them when no one else will .. i honestly don’t know how to cope anymore. i am in an ocean of depression and anxiety and dread with  no end in sight",,0
"my gran was moved to a memory care facility last year. she lived with us since 2014. when we cleaned out her mil suite attached to our house, we were left with containers upon containers of shit just thrown together that we didn't have the brainpower to organize at that time. ""i'll get to that later"". well, those boxes are taking up 40 sq ft of space in your basement, and ""later"" is looking a lot more like ""soon"".it's silly to jump into it without a plan. so i made you a plan. i developed your method. you have one less thing to think about now in this emotionally taxing project. get your coffee, and read through this guide. you're going to freakin' conquer this. let's make sense out of that chaos.here we go!**determining the scope**take a gander at your stack of bins and boxes. take out each bin and rustle through it. focus on identifying what you’re going to be working with.example: for my gran, we had notes, paperwork, photographs, household items, “memories” (more on that later), and more fucking paperwork.**number your containers**this will save your ass later and help keep you organized. number each box and tub. physically. write on those things with a thick ass sharpie “tub” or “box” and then a number. it doesn’t matter where the box came from. it doesn’t matter what order they’re in. just as long as you establish inventory, you’ll be grand.example: i have tub #1—tub #5 and box #1—box #6**isolate one box &amp; make room**take out a container from the collection. place it in a comfortable spot where you have room to move around. you may be getting up and moving from place to place, so make sure your room is clean and clear of obstacles. a clean room is a must. put all the other containers in a separate area away from your organization room. trust me. if you look at it, it will only intimidate you.**establishing categories**you know the term “when organizing, never touch anything twice”? that’s bullshit in this kind of project. we are taking this rollercoaster in steps. the purpose of, what i call “round 1”, is to separate trash from the important stuff, and put ‘like with like’.you’re going to make an area, preferably with another big empty container, for each category. here are the categories that will mostly encompass everything you’re bound to find in the hoard of miscellaneous small belongings thrown together at the end of a clear out.memoriesphotographspaperworkpaper memories“i have no idea”trashlet me go over each category.""photographs"". every photograph you can imagine. even the printed ones. not the ones in frames. if you want to be really progressive, keep the polaroids seperate from anything else. the two types of chemicals used in the processing of the types of film degrades both of them. portraits, cat pictures, garden pictures, the literal only picture of your great grandfather. all of them.""memories"". these are objects, artwork, books, etc. anything a person keeps for any reason until they leave the earth. or your house. a lot of them are only sentimental to the individual and don’t mean much to you. don’t evaluate this concept yet. focus, remember your categories. move along.""paperwork"". this is the serious shit. your boxes will. will. have paperwork that you do not know if you should keep or not. place every 'document' that is professional correspondence, medical records, housing inspections, homeowners insurance, receipts, etc, into one designated ""paperwork"" box. don't stress yourself out wondering what it actually is and if you actually need to keep it just yet. just determine if it's administrative paperwork or ""paperwork memories"" and sort it first.""paperwork memories"". this can sometimes be easy to determine, and sometimes it can be difficult. because in my gran's final year or so living with us, she clipped everything out of the newspaper from articles on bird care (she has no bird) to saving full page advertisements. there was also a lot... and i mean a lot of notes that she wrote down from day to day that don't make a lick of sense. a grocery list. the word ""hair"". someone's phone number. the name ""nick"". the name ""lenore"". notes from my mother who was her primary caretaker. notes that say ""i'm going to the store. i will be back by 2pm. i love you."". if in doubt, keep it. and go through it later. but these are still paper memories and go in the ""paper memories"" box. this also includes stuff that is obviously important and needs to be stored like college diplomas, yearbook pages, letters from loved ones, cards, etc.""i have no idea"". you will come across some shit that's just... weird. like you really won't have a single idea what to do with it. make a box for your confusion and come back to it way later.“trash” is anything you determine to be trash. if you don't need it, and it doesn't tell a story or represent your mother, let it go. you might not want the scribblings of your parent in their decline of mental capability. you may want to hold onto those pieces a little bit longer. that is absolutely okay.**things you will need for sanity**you’re almost ready to go through your first container! you will need a couple of things to keep yourself organized.1. post-its (brand name. they stick much better)2. a couple of black sharpies. i say a couple because you will misplace it every single fucking time you put it down and you need to be able to pick up another while the first one is probably sitting under a pile of crap.3. buy at least 3 boxes of sandwich baggies (sealable) and 4 boxes of freezer baggies (gallon).4. a notebook on a clipboard and a hoard of pens.5. trash bags. get the good brand.6. white mailing labels.7. file folders8. scotch tape**opening pandora’s box**once you have all of your supplies within arm’s or leg’s reach, your organization room is clear, you have one container, and you’ve had your coffee… put on a playlist. pro tip: nothing sappy or sad. one sad tune is enough to keep you tunneled on a certain object for way too long and emotionally exhaust you enough to cut your organization day short.open the box. take a breath.when you come across any of these things, grab a gallon baggie, slap a blank mailing label on it, and grab a sharpiephotographs or polaroidsadmin paperworkpaper memoriesexample: baggie labeled “tub #1 – photographs” or “tub #1 – admin paperwork”**the bulky important paperwork**this is something i learned the hard way. you’re going to come across certain things that take you a couple of minutes to figure out. and they will be bulky, but skirt the line between important admin paperwork and memories.for example: i found scatters of 400 pages of my gran’s book she published in 1998. it took me a good minute to accumulate all of the pages. and they just kept showing up in boxes. for like 3 days, that manuscript was its own category. i threw them all together in the end with the “paper memories” category.**label. all. non-obvious. items.**the term “when organizing, you should touch everything only once”, has a more important mental and psychological message, which is “when organizing, you should determine what something is, only once”.that folder in tub #3 that just says “west palm beach”. at first glance, you don’t know exactly what’s in that thing. could be anything, really. so take a look inside. grab a pen and a notebook on a clipboard. write down the contents of the folder.for example: on my notebook, the “west palm beach” folder had homeowners insurance, property tax assessments, receipts, email correspondences, inspection reports, final floorplan, and a couple of other things i don’t really remember.grab a post-it note, or a piece of paper big enough to tape onto the outside of the folder. write down, in sharpie, on the note, the contents of what is in that folder.why: when you go through the collection’s stack of paperwork during “round 2”, you won’t have to spend critical time and energy determining the contents of every folder. when you have big bold labels on stuff, you’re saving your brain from expending energy doing critical thinking later on. you really don’t want to have to pick up the same stack of “west palm beach” 3 times, and every time having to flip through it to figure out the contents. do the dirty work the first time, and you will save yourself the trouble later.**use those baggies!**so many things can fit into baggies! notes. tiny school portraits. business cards. newspaper articles. they can all fit into baggies! label the bag with a the container number they’re in along with the category they belong to, and fill those babies up!method established. work through your collection.go ahead and sort the rest of the containers into your designated categories.sort yourself as you sort their stuffnever let your piles become super crazy and unorganized. if you have a hoard of labeled baggies just sitting around without being put into their main category, take the time to place them there. it is really easy to let the process take over your entire room/house/life. don’t let it. clean as you work.**rome wasn’t built in a day**remember: rome wasn't built in a day. it will take days, maybe even a few weeks, to go through every single thing. especially if you're getting rid of their clothes and food and dishes, furniture, etc as well. you may have put off the boxes and tubs because of the physical and mental and emotional exhaustion it creates. you need to give yourself breaks, remember to drink water, and remember to drop everything and come back to it if it's just getting to be too much for you. you have time. and the process takes time. so take. your. time.just as an aside: i really, really want to emphasize a practice of self-care that i had no idea existed until this: taking your time. it's easy to have a cup of coffee and rush through half a box, but you will be burned out, exhausted, and super irritable every single time. taking your time will help you be more organized and will let your brain go through the process with ease rather than make it feel like it's some sort of race. you will thank yourself. remember to eat. don't become too tunnel visioned. don't get too caught up in what you find. and do not try to create more categories unless you absolutely need to.**“round 2”**you will end up with containers filled with categories rather than containers filled with “uhhhhh”.the photo container will be a whole project within itself. save that baby for last.sit down with a category and start figuring out if you need to keep it, keep it and digitize it, shred it, or toss it. the digitization process is also another project within itself. if you determine you need to digitize a document, shove a label on it saying “digitize”, a label of description of the contents, and then put it in a new “digitize” category.i have a method for digitizing and organizing your documents that i will probably write up another time (i’m still doing this and figuring out a solid method. i’m not finished, and i won’t be for a while).like with likeput things related to each other in their own folder. in “paper memories”, you will need to determine sub-categories.example: “paper memories” went from a box of loose papers to \~7 sub-categories such as “phyllis’s education” “love letters from nick” “children’s artwork” “cards” “notes” and a couple others.another example: “paperwork” went from a box of loose papers to a crazy amount of sub-categories including “sale of west palm beach house” “medical records 2016” “receipts” “bank statements” “lawyer” “miss kitty’s vet records”, etc.**bonus round: “photos”**once you finish everything but the photographs, you can move to the photos. but you will have trained yourself enough through the first process to know how to sort the photos. and it's basically along the same lines as subcategorizing the other categories. i have about 2000 photos, and i think i have even more at the bottom of another box. so far, i have 34 categories of photos. everything from ""roeltgen family 1996 - 2006 sonora house, tx"" to ""cindy's wedding"" to ""strange photo tour of cindy's house"" to ""granny pre-1985"".i’m still working on photos. it’s a trip. but it is super rewarding.**all in all…**you will become much more comfortable with the entire sorting process the more you go through them. and it will get much, much easier.i wish you the best of luck. may the organization gods smile upon you. you’re not a robot. you will get through this. and i am so, so, so sorry for your loss.",,0
"i mention the uk because partly i'm wondering about resources the family (my sister, dad and i) could access or use.  tl:dr my nan had vascular dementia (early onset) and passed away in her 60s. my mum's (50s) exhibiting some worrying symptoms that may be due to post menopause/hrt but kinda seem like maybe they're not and i'm shitting myself. and looking for any options to deal with it.  long story:  my mum's mother passed away several years ago from (i believe) vascular dementia - we were told this is a hereditary type and more common in women?   a huge part of her problem was her total social isolation - my mum and her brother never got on with their mum (their dad died when they were teens) and left home asap. my grandmother stopped working when she had kids and never went back, lived in council housing that required very little interaction with people and claimed a pension (i assume i was younger and didn't get super involved at the time) church groups and other old lady clubs were constantly dropping by and checking in and asking if she wanted tea or her grass cut etc. she'd stubbornly tell them to piss off and she wasn't a charity case, eventually they stopped bothering.   from what i recall of visiting as a child she wasn't great - like nothing awful but 'children should be seen and not heard' quite old fashioned (you can't have children if you're not married!) and racist - the point is she wasn't the friendliest, made no effort to get out and stimulate herself and actively pushed people away who would have otherwise helped - even family.   part of this is why some of the signs took so long to be noticed - she was angry and snappy at the best of times and we only saw her a handful of times  a year.   anyway, i don't want to dwell on that to much, it's simply for context.  my mum recently (few years back) went through menopause (confirmed over by her gp) and during that period and ever since has just been...not right.   she can't organise herself (she used to run and manage a busy day care plus the household)&amp;#x200b;she forgets things unless they're listed or on a calendar, she needs reminding multiple times where she's supposed to be or what she's supposed to be doing. she get angry at people for reminding her, and angry at herself for having to be reminded.   she does things that make no sense (like my parents have two fridges and veggies always go in one of them, she'll put them in the wrong one - i know it seems minor but it's something she'd never have done before)  it reached a peak over the summer when she had some unexplained bleeding and went to the hospital for a few tests (nothing untoward just lady parts being lady parts and it all cleared up) she was a wreck. she had to be hand held to every appointment, my dad had to take notes for her, she got lost in the clearly signed hospital and (armchair psychologist here) i'd say she had a full blown anxiety attack and anxiety for several weeks, she compulsively made lists, lost track of them, made them again and then fished the shredded pieces out of the bin when we threw them out, whilst getting angry with us. she called me in tears because she got lost at the hospital and she kept calling herself stupid and 'better than this' i spent almost an hour calming her down and then having to speak to my dad to get up to date with her medical stuff so i could talk to insurance for her. the only minor upside is we had a small bonding moment over how awful anxiety is!  we put a lot of this down to menopause and hormones - i know first hand from my own experience with bc how fucking mental the wrong balance can make you! as part of the fix for above she had an iud - half of hrt therapy.  the 'final straw' came about a month and a half ago when she passed out in the kitchen, fell and knocked her tooth out - she was obviously shaken up and what bit of confidence she had is slowly leaving her (she wouldn't even ring the gp to make an appointment because she said she couldn't keep it straight in her head what she needed) and  since then we've spent the last few weeks back and forth to the gp convincing her to try the other half - oestrogen gel.  i went to one of the appointments with her and ....it was like taking my toddler, she just sat there quietly letting me explain these really intimate things to this gp, i felt awful and patronising, like i was stepping all over her. she just said thanks and could i text dad the details cause she'd already got a bit confused.  about 4 weeks ago she finally started and we've been holding our breath hoping that this is the answer, the gp did say it should start working almost right away even if it takes a few weeks to go full swing. she has a follow up in a couple weeks.  last week we went away as a family together and the length of time we spent together made it really apparent there is still something wrong.   she seemed almost 'off' half the time, she didn't read anything, she didn't talk much. she joined in with the things we did (like snooker) but got angry at what (in years gone by) would have been good natured ribbing (we're all terrible at snooker xd) she said 'the rules kept changing' .  she tried to make tea by putting tea bags directly into the kettle, and then claimed she didn't do it and got angry - honestly it felt like she really truly did not have any recollection of doing that action.   &amp;#x200b;she's not quite as bad as her mum in that she kept working up until redundancy about 15 to 20 years ago maybe. my dad earned enough to not worry about it and my mums always been a home maker, so she liked being home and my dad liked not having to do house stuff. since i had my son shes loved being able to care for him as well and it's one of the few things i see her really light up about.   she's never really been a hugely passionate person, she loved cross stitches and puzzles but her eye sight makes that hard, social wise she had my dad - both of them are just each others best friend and rarely socialise outside of the odd couple friend they have, so she doesn't have a lot of hobbies and she stopped driving years ago and is now too nervous about it to take it up again (and more recently she's got really anxious about the bus) she's almost voluntarily housebound weekdays. she cares for my son a couple days a week (and she is fantastic at that, although i am starting to worry slightly but it's like with him she switches back into old habits and has it together) and we're always over at the weekend (i love my mum to bits and the running joke is i never left home xd) so she's no where near as bad as my nan was - but it's still heavily reduced and very little mentally stimulating activities or things that really keep you on your toes yanno?  it's to late for her to go back to work (her career credentials have expired and regaining would be like starting from scratch as it's changed so much in childcare) she has very basic it skills (as much as i love her i wouldn't wish her on the office of my worst enemy!) and frankly she's just to nervous about everything to be of any use doing much. i'm worried the window for keeping her mind active and working has passed....and whilst i'm glad my son can help, the second i think he's in any chance of danger i'll send him to nursery full time (and my mum totally agrees, her biggest fear is accidentally hurting him)  i firmly think, regardless, she needs counselling for anxiety but getting my mother to understand my problems with anxiety and depression has been a long up hill struggle that only really achieved her acceptance that /i/ think i have a problem. i suggested she may need to talk to a professional and she just sort of brushes over it. my dad is only marginally better. she absolutely does not want to admit this is a problem, she may have a problem or that that problem may not be solvable with a course of tablets or similar.   and all of this is made harder by the fact all of us have full time jobs and i have a child to run around after as well. we will absolutely figure something out to run her where she needs to be if we have to, but regardless of intention and desire the fact remains we're all adults with families that also need care and time - luckily we all live about 3 miles apart!  i'm also aware we lose our patience with her and that makes it worse. my parents have always been sort of low key bickery but recently it's like every weekend is them snapping at each other and with the best will in the world, even knowing she might not be able to help, some of the stuff she does is maddening - i guess sometimes it's akin to asking my kid to get something and him getting distracted by a penny half way through - like i get it! but also dude come on! i asked you to go get your shoes!i try and help by cooking but then she loiters in the kitchen looking lost and helpless and i feel bad because now i feel like i'm taking away the things that made her feel useful &gt;&lt;  i'm so sorry for the huge ramble, i am so so scared this is early onset like my nan and there's nothing we can do except watch it get worse. i don't know where to ask for help, i don't know how to get her to come get help, i can't even talk to my dad and sister properly because we're all skirting round the issue hoping the gel will work and she'll start getting back to 'normal'. and i'm looking at my dad who's so far the opposite you'd probably peg him as early 40s and just wondering what the fuck he's going to with my mum over the next decade and then the rest of his life if this does go 'worst case scenario' .  i'm hoping to find some information about how i could approach an appointment to discuss this - should i make one for me alone (can i even discuss someone else in an appointment for me?) should i take her with me and ask to speak to the dr alone for a moment, should i just straight up mention it in front of her?  does anyone have any hrt experience that could tell me i'm just being an impatient twat and to let it work or adjust it?   is it better for my dad (as her husband) to try and seek help?   are there any uk counselling services for this, or is going through the gp the best?   are there any things we could passively encourage her towards that might help her mentally in terms of activities/hobbies/clubs etc without her feeling to 'old' or 'helpless'?",,0
"my mother over the past few years has had symptoms of dementia that came on slowly and would get slightly worse slowly. it went from her saying a wrong name or forgetting maybe every 3rd visit to every second visit to every visit but that was over maybe 6 months. about 3 weeks ago my mom stopped wanting to eat. this was sudden. i usually stop at her favorite bakery and bring her a donut or fritter and she is happy and eats it right away. she refused to eat the bakery items. she also stopped watching tv. the tv used to be on 24/7 in her house.  again a few weeks before she was watching the animal and cooking shows she likes and then nothing. her confusion was so much worse. she says she tries to get out of bed and sit on the side of the bed and then she looks up and two hours went by and she does not know what happened. time seems to be a big confusion, suddenly she thinks it is night time and it is morning. she was sleeping constantly and complaining about dizzyness. her hygiene went downhill and she was not dressing properly for the weather or for modesty. she was having horrible time just walking around her house to go to the bathroom or get food. her walk was never fast before due to a bad knee replacement surgery but she could get around her home. i got her to agree to go to an urgent care and they sent her to the er. the er found fluid on her brain and the er doctor thought maybe something called normal pressure hydrocephelus? they admitted her and we live landlocked and there is only one neurologist and neurosurgeon for that hospital and for over 100 miles. the doctor said the fluid was not the issue, ran a few tests and wanted her to go to a rehab  facility to see if her self help skills, balance, walking etc could be improved. multiple people tried to talk her into this and she refused and we got the call she has checked herself out. i guess if she can answer like 5 question, her name, the president, her birthday where she is , they consider her ""okay"". my son was like why did they not ask her the time ! very true because i went to pick her up and she was upset because she thought it was night but it was 1pm and she was confused about the whole day's time frame. can she have really lose so much functioning in a few weeks. going from sitting and eating with you watching 90 day fiance (sometimes getting the couples names wrong or confused but still trying to interact)  to just not eating and starring at the wall? and having no interest in anything.  i have possible some serious surgery coming up, i am actually going to the surgeon in the morning to discuss it. myself and my husband and our kids (who cant drive) are the only caregivers. she has no friends and will not deal with any church help. she has good insurance and long term health care. should i try and get a second opinion about the fluid on the brain? travel is very hard , the closest second opinion is 120 miles away and it is a large city hospital that is overtaxed with patients and not the best choice but closest, the closest choices that would be research or university type hospitals are 300-400 miles. or is this just dementia getting worse rapidly?  the best way to describe it is like a horrible depression came on, she has no interest in anything, no desire to eat, and just sits there.thanks for any advice. i have a call into home health and i was able luckily on dec 7th able to make changes to her medicare so she will have more options for rehab/home health in 2020 before care before long term heath care can kick in. she had me sign paper long ago after my father passed about her medical care and end of life care. it was 25 years ago so i don't remember much. i do know she added my husband a few years ago. when i called medicare supplement plan they said they had me and my husband as authorized to make changes, and when i called for home health to come out and access her , they said i was listed to do that. i know before her last surgery she took out what she kept calling her pull the plug paperwork and went over her wishes and my husband and i were the 2 on that paper. i also had a checkbook to pay her bills with my name on it.  i put a call into her lawyer but it will be a few days. i do know the doctor said because she answered those 5 questions right, she had the choice to check herself out and i could not over ride it.",,0
"this sunday my dad (83m) fell, hit his head and was found by emt’s. (he pushed his button, but not right away).  we don’t know how long he was down.   by the time the helicopter got him to the hospital, it had been 2 hours after the emt’s called me.   there are no signs of a stroke or a concussion.  however he is fully in dementia. right now he has no idea who he is, who i am, or who anyone is. the first day he was like a 3yo in a hospital bed with nothing to do.  yesterday he got violent and injured 2 of the 1 on 1 nurses.  eventually haldol was given, which slowed him down, but he was still aggressive.we had known he was slowly going into dementia, and up until last week, he was doing fine living alone at home.   last year i had arranged seemingly random visits from his friends to check on him given how secluded his home is.   i live 4 hours and a ferry ride away, so visits usually aren’t more than once a month.  i have full poa i believe (medical yes, didn’t bring the rest of the packet because i thought it was another fall).  his supplemental insurance is good, so is there any tests we should have done?  the doctor has said he doesn’t expect the hallucinations to stop for at least another week maybe longer.  this doctor has been the best that he has had in a long time; completely willing to listen and answer questions anytime.   i don’t know what is specialty is, however i am been told by the nurses, he is their ‘specialist’ for dementia patients.  here (in a nutshell) is what he told me last night:  the medications are almost out of his system, however he is getting progressively worse.  it’s his belief that the head hit is what the definite cause of the onset of dementia (initial thoughts were alcohol or od).  if there is a break in the hallucinations, it won’t likely come for at least another week.  and his new ‘normal’ will still require him to be put into a home.  i hope i got that right....it has all been a blur.  dad and i have had a difficult relationship most of our lives, and right now i am his only family.   other than waiting, finding all the documents (i have them at home) and eventually, finding him a home, what is next?  what do you wish you knew at this stage? what do you wish you had at this stage?  my support system is 1200+ miles away and could fly them in if i must...thanks (52m)",,0
"my father is a senior that drinks 12-15 beers and about 1 bottle of brandy per day. i have tried every avenue possible to get help for him and have failed miserably. he exhibits all the symptoms documented of alcohol dementia / wernike-korsakoff syndrome / wet brain. his ability to problem solve is only limited to being able to obtain his next drink.  he has had his resources exploited, stolen from, been in and out of the hospital due to his extreme alcoholism, and has literally been self destructing for the last 5 years since the loss of my mother. he is a vietnam vet that has never received proper treatment for left over phycological effects of his service. he was just treated with drugs like lorazapam and then cut off with no support. this just caused him to self medicate with more booze. when confronted about his drinking he will simply tell me he will put a revolver in his mouth and pull the trigger. this even earned him a trip to the mental healthcare center where they released him in a few days with no plan (not even a discussion). it is even difficult to get them to confront a patient about alcoholism. i had to beg them to clearly explain his situation as he was in total denial. all government agencies, crisis workers, va, health/mental health care professionals have failed to help this situation simply because he refuses help. as long as he knows his name, can count to 10, knows the abcs, and does not appear to be an immediate threat to himself or others nobody seems to care. family physician does not seem to want any involvement with this matter. i asked a crisis worker from human services ""so your telling me the only thing i can do is sit and watch his finances and resources be exploited by a known meth user (that is pretending to be a healthcare worker and his wife!!!) without his knowledge as he self destructs?"" the answer: ""we would not like to see anything happen to him, but yes."" the problem is that he is not even credible to defend himself due to the dementia and alcohol use. so this is an open invite to predators as the sky is the limit!  this was once a hard working, stand-up, family oriented person that has has been reduced an outright drunk that cares about literally nothing including himself. he will not stop drinking until it puts him in the ground. the system is clearly broken and there is no help for people that are in this predicament until it is too late.",,0

"today’s projections of the size of the incoming dementia epidemic assume that the age and intercourse associated variables will stay fixed over time, with the getting older inhabitants alone driving the projected improve. drawing from latest research, there’s reasonably constant proof that dementia incidence is declining in high-income international locations. consistent with worsening cardiovascular danger issue profiles in east asia, there’s some proof that recommend rising prevalence of dementia in that area. let’s increase the present traits in prevalence in incidence of dementia, and the survival with this sickness.  ## backgroundthe foundation for assumption that age- and sex- particular prevalence of dementia will stay unchanged over time comes from research, together with these printed by alzheimer’s disease international (adi) that evaluate gradual lower or improve in prevalence over very long time intervals. the prevalence of dementia, or the proportion of the inhabitants affected at a degree of time, is a product of its incidence and the typical period of the illness episode, from incidence to demise. a decline in age-specific incidence is feasible, if we deal with the publicity to suspected parts resembling [low education in early life]( hypertension in midlife and smoking and diabetes.## dementia prevalencein the medical research council cognitive function and ageing study (mrc cfas) research, a statistical decline within the prevalence of dementia was seen between 1993 and 2011, which was according to a bigger however statistically insignificant decline in prevalence in zaragoza, spain and a decline within the prevalence of moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment seen within the health and retirement study (hrs) within the united states. contrasting this, three research from sweden and the u.s. point out a steady prevalence of dementia, whereas a japanese research of secular traits discovered a rise in dementia prevalence of 23% between 1980 and 2000.## dementia incidencetwo u.s. population-based research, considered one of african american inhabitants in indianapolis, in, and the opposite derived from the framingham heart study, supplied a statistically important foundation for discount within the incidence of dementia. the same annual charge of decline in dementia incidence (-3.0%) was reported in an evaluation od german insurance claims information. repeated surveys in stockholm, sweden, are additionally present information according to a decline in dementia incidence. on the opposite hand, population-based research in ibadan, nigeria and chicago, il, usa, indicated a stout incidence of dementia over 11-year intervals.",,0
"i’m just wondering when you think it’s time to start looking into nursing homes for your loved ones with dementia?i don’t like the idea of it but i know that it may one day be a reality. so i want to be prepared and i’m wondering if there are any early signs/behaviours/memory loss i should be aware of that are signs my dad is heading in a direction where i won’t be able to care for him anymore at home?right now he seems ok. his recall of words, places, people’s names and general recent memory is quite bad and his ability to follow and understand conversations is not very good but not entirely gone. his ability to manage his finances has been non-existent for almost a year now- i took over all his financial responsibilities. he has some paranoia (that the bank stole his money) he still tries to clean the house but forgets to use cleaning products, he just uses water. same with dishes, he will “wash” them like normal but forget to put soap on the sponge.  i remind him daily about his pills but wouldn’t forget all the time if i didn’t. i don’t think he showers every day but i don’t think he never  showers...but this past summer he did smell once in a while and i had to tell him to shower which he didn’t want to. i’m not sure if he brushes his teeth often... it’s hard to know those hygiene things because i’m at work all day and he is home alone. that’s pretty much his state right now.",,0
"i just need to rant and get this out, thank you.my single mother (56 yo) has been diagnosed with frontotemporal lobe dementia and her spinal tap protein analysis suggests alzheimer's as well. she has had other issues for as long as i can remember (borderline or bipolar, unsure) that have caused strained relationships and self-isolation. she was physically and emotionally abusive to my brother and emotionally and sexually abusive towards me. in short, she has always been a nightmare to deal with. most of her friends and family don't want much to do with her anymore. i am currently helping her with her finances and somewhat emotionally from out of state, albeit terribly due to a recent concussion and adhd.  this summer was the first time i acknowledged the sexual abuse and emotional incest (thankfully with a therapist), and i feel very lost. i've held a surplus of compassion for her and mental illness in general up until this point, but my anger has consumed it. to be honest, i want her to die. i love her and i hate her, and i don't think i could separate the two emotions in my lifetime. i don't want to deal with her any longer, but no one else will take care of her either. i am a poor caregiver in this emotional state, we were fighting yesterday and i almost told her to go kill herself. part of me just wants to hand her over to the state, but i don't think i could ever return to my hometown if i abandoned my mother like that (small town, very traditional). i'm not even sure it's an option with the state of arkansas.",,0
"he was diagnosed this year with mild cognitive disorder which develops into dementia in 80% of people. i have seen him change over the last 4 years or so. his memory and cognitive function. i have chronic severe depression and an anxiety disorder which i have to manage on a daily basis. small task are often difficult for me. i don’t have much energy. his wife is his primary care taker but she is unwilling/incapable of some basic things like managing his medication. so i help as much as i can but i can’t really manage that much. watching him decline makes me so incredibly sad. i feel like i am losing him even though he is still alive. i feel guilty because i am unable to help him as much as i’d like to. things like making phone calls to insurance, managing doctor appointments. my energy gets used up by doing these things and i get very overwhelmed and anxious. i have to limit how often i go to his house for my own self care. so i go about once a week now. but i end up using all my energy doing things like setting up his pill dispenser and i have no energy left for just spending quality time with him. i was at his house yesterday when an old friend of his stopped by. my father had a difficult time keeping up with conversation with his friend. it was so sad. i am hurting so much. my father has always been the reason i am able to stay alive and keep fighting my own mental illness. i don’t know how to cope with watching him get worse.",,0
"long story short, my 64 year old mother had an incident, ended up in the hospital and we had to make the decision to place her in memory care because she clearly demonstrated she could no longer safely live alone. as a result of our denial we let her get to late moderate/early severe stages of her dementia and still live independently (we took control of her finances and did get poa when she was in the initial diagnosis stage). we had to acknowledge that neither my sister nor i could care for her at home due to space and time constraints.so she's been in a ltc facility for the last month and currently the place presents well and we have not had any complaints about her care and the treatment by the staff (it helps that the covid regulations are such that although we can't go to her room, we can have visits and take her offsite whenever we want). she doesn't realize she's in a nursing home or ltc facility.  she even gets a little anxious that she won't be able to get back into her place when she's off the floor. what's killing me emotionally and zapping my patience is that she says at least every third sentence that ""she wants to move"".  she hasn't voiced any complaints about where she is other than she doesn't want to be there anymore.  she's currently trying to convince me that she could live in her church (which she can't) or when we're driving she'll point to different buildings and suggests that she could live there (""no, mom, you can't live in the football stadium, on a boat, in this office building, in this boarded up house, etc.""). has anyone been in this situation and have any tips on what helped them?  she's being stubborn about talking to other residents, the staff, or even leaving her room (it's been a struggle to get her to the shower room even). i'm at the point where i'm dreading taking her calls or visiting because between her and my 8 year old i have developed negative patience.  also i'm concerned that when she talks to other friends and family they will think that she's been mistreated or that there's something wrong and then i have to face the blowback. tl;dr: any tips on helping a parent adjust to a memory care facility?",,0
"tldr: mother in law was excited to retire soon but now suddenly dealing with fil with dementia.my father in law had a brain injury during a surgery in february and now has serious dementia symptoms. before surgery he was a bit forgetful but mostly capable of living independently (traveled on his own, drove a car, did the finances, etc.) after the surgery he's incontinent, can now talk but only says a few words and it's unclear if he really gets what they mean, and needs 24/7 care. my mother in law is the primary caregiver and she hires someone to watch him during the day while she's at work. she hates her job and was excited to retire this september. she's been talking for a few years now about being able to travel, sleep in late, watch her grandkids all the time and take them places. that's all out the window now, well not all of it but certainly the freedom to do whatever she likes whenever she likes. she doesn't sleep in anymore because he gets up at 6am and despite child proofing the house he can still cause a lot trouble left alone (he's already peed in the living room once :/) we have lots of supportive family in the area to give her time off to go do something for herself but it's never enough. and she seems almost depressed at the thought of her retirement. my father in law is physically healthy and my mil mentioned at one point that she can't imagine caring for him like this for years, let alone decades - the best part of her retirement. the worst part i think is they never really got along. they sleep in separate rooms and my fil has always been sort of a jerk. never mean to me directly but often had rude things to say about others including my mil. he's also much bigger than she is so it's tough to force him to do things. we have often talked strategies because he acts very similarly to my 2 year old, but my fall back is always to pick up the toddler if he's not listening and she doesn't have that option, she has a tough enough time just blocking him from going somewhere.how do you all handle it? when you didnt expect this to be your life. how do you find happiness? my heart is breaking for my mother in law. this can't be a sustainable way to live. but what are the alternatives? we are all already supporting her as best we can with the little things (child proofing, grocery shopping, watching him while she goes out, visiting with the kids) but it just doesn't seem like enough. i think a care facility or at least adult day care is needed but up to this point she's been very against it. both for feeling guilty about ""putting him in a home"" but also for financial reasons.",,0
"my mom is in early stages of dementia and has had asthma for most of her life.  it was untreated during a majority of it because of lack of insurance.  i haven’t paid too much attention to her inhaler usage in the past but now that she can’t drive, i’m the one who is overseeing her medication.  i’ve watched her take her inhaler and she does two puffs in a row pretty quickly, i’ve always been told with mine to wait in between puffs.  i don’t expect to be able to retrain her to use her inhaler quickly but she seems to go through them pretty quickly.  it seems every 3-4 weeks she needs a refill, her daily one should have 120 doses so 2 months worth.  i plan on calling her allergist tomorrow and scheduling her an appointment to discuss my concerns but i was wondering if anybody has had a similar experience and has any advice to handle this.  i did initially keep track of her doses but it frequently ended up in an argument because she felt like we were controlling her and telling her what to do.",,0
"i've been dreading this for a good long while, but today i finally saw my dad. i live in a different country, and we haven't spoken for years due to him being a lifelong alcoholic. in late 2019, my older brother, who also has severe mental health issues (and has been living with my dad his whole life) was put in a mental health facility and my dad was taken to a nursing home when it became clear that he couldn't take care of himself. we've been estranged for years now and never really had a good relationship, but i was planning on visiting last year, and then covid happened. he's had one or two visits since being admitted from other family members, and apparently at first he was still able speak, although incoherently. sometime this year, he completely lost the ability to form words, and mostly just strings together gibbrish words that are more like sounds. when i saw him today, i could tell that he recognized me because he got visibly excited and emotional. he cried a lot, clutched my hand tightly, and sometimes smiled and tried to communicate. i knew it would be bad, but i wasn't prepared for how devastated i would feel. he wasn't a good dad, but i know that he loved me. i cried a lot too and tried to make him smile as much as i could. he still seems like he enjoys being around people and always greets all the nurses with a big smile. i tried to see if he understood written words, but it didn't seem like he did. he is wheelchair bound and i'm assuming can't do anything by himself at this point. it's difficult to get any kind of  useful information out of anyone here in the nursing home, based on his inability to communicate i've deduced myself that he has frontotemporal dementia and that it seems pretty advanced. the government appointed someone to be in charge of his finances since no one was here, and i don't know what to expect. they're also apparently moving everyone out of this facility and that's in the process of getting sorted. i know i shouldn't feel guilty for not being here to take care of him, but seeing him was extremely difficult. earlier this year i started seeing a therapist and left my demanding job because of stress and depression. i'm afraid of everything else that comes next, and i wish i knew when it would just be over. i'm the youngest son of 3, and i know that my two older siblings would be completely useless at taking care of any of his affairs. i just want him to able to live his last years (if he even has that long left) in relative comfort. i don't really know what i'm asking in this post, just had to write it down in between the crying. if anyone has any similar experiences with advanced frontotemporal dementia, please share what to expect if you can.",,0
"first off, i so appreciate all of you in this sub. i've been reading through posts since fil came to stay with us a couple months ago and it's been an absolute life saver.fil has been diagnosed with alcohol induced dementia and depression, and exhibits a lot of fear and paranoia whenever we try to get him out of the house. he used to want to go for walks all the time but now even just in the neighborhood he wants to turn back pretty quickly. we've also bought a lot of stuff for us to do around the house - easy games, coloring books, puzzles, etc. but for the last few days it's just tv and movies all day. he'll look away from the tv and tell us he's tired of it but then turns down any suggestions we offer him.we can barely get him to talk either, and when he does it's just a few words. several weeks ago he was talking up a storm. i can't tell if these are signs that his dementia symptoms are getting worse or if his depression is maybe getting worse. i know he feels trapped here with us instead of back in his home, so i'm just desperate to find anything he's excited about to try and help him out! we're starting the paperwork for medicaide this week to get him into a memory care facility, and i'm hoping that process goes quickly. we're doing the best we can for him but i know he needs so much more. we've considered some kind of adult day care but the costs would put a pretty significant strain on our finances.sorry, i know this post is all over place. we've been so stressed and exhausted trying to find our way through this, i have trouble staying focused and organizing my very disorganized thoughts. anyone have any advice on ways to try and get him more engaged?",,0
"i was referred over this direction from r/childofhoarder. i know there is probably a lot of overlap, and also with depression, too. my almost 69-year-old mother is living in a squalor hoarder situation. she's never made the best decisions about her life, especially regarding her house and stuff. i am concerned that she may be progressing into dementia but i'm not sure what to attribute to her hoarding and what to attribute to possible dementia, if that makes sense? i'm in the process of trying to help her with her finances and get her to doctor's appointments she's been avoiding, and eventually get her out of the house and into somewhere safe. she signed over voluntary power of attorney to me after she basically handed over her inheritance to my aunt for nothing and we realized it after the fact, so i have some legal ability to help her, but not the power to unilaterally force her into anything as she can withdraw the power of attorney.   what should i look out for as a sign of dementia? what can i expect from dealing with her if there is dementia on top of the hoarding? where can i take her to get tested that she would agree to go? i'm sorry i have a lot of questions but i'm just realizing things are worse than i thought, and it's possible its more than the hoarding that i'm going to have to deal with. thanks in advance.",,0
"my grandpa (70) got diagnosed with dementia after my grandmas passing when he was about 64 he has since then lost weight dramatically. he’s on multiple medications to try to make him hungry (including weed which is legal in my state) he eats to our knowledge half a meal a day and drinks meal replacement shakes for the rest which are supposed to be used with a full meal for a high amount of calories. he lies to us and tells us he eats, when we look for what he tells us he ate we can’t find it. i live about an hour away from him but will be moving back to my hometown at the end of this year. i think i’m going to have to move in with him and take care of him since his only kid who will step up thinks feeding him one meal a day is sufficient. he also lies about showering but we can all tell he hasn’t showered in months. i haven’t gotten to the point of telling him to get in the shower and i’ll wash him, but it’s getting to that point. do you guys have any advice on how to get him in the shower alone, or how to get him in the shower so i can clean him without him being embarrassed about me seeing him naked? the real question of this post is how can i make him gain weight if he doesn’t eat, for reference he is 6’4 and weighs about 90-95 pounds. i’m very worried he is going to end up in the hospital very soon with a feeding tube. we don’t want him to go to a nursing home but his insurance does not cover a home health nurse.",,0

"13 years ago my brother started experience mental degradation, where he went from a smart honors student (got first place in a school spelling bee) to having the mental capabilities of a 2 year old. his first doctors concluded it was schizophrenia. we have a new doctor who is absolutely sure that there is no way schizophrenia could cause such mental degradation. he looked at his medical history and noticed that a bully beat him up before his mental degradation started, and suffered hits to the head (i was aware of the attack but not of head injury). he received a ct scan but it came out clean. he received a mri scan a few years after the majority of the regression happened, but that also came out clean. they were both seen by neurologists. they concluded that his degradation was not neurological but probably psychotic. the psychiatrist we have been seeing concurred but he was replaced by a new one who said there is no way schizophrenia can do the type of mental degradation that he experienced. the psychiatrist is pretty sure it was a head injury after looking at his mental records, but doesn't really know what to do next, since both scans came out clean. to be honest, these doctors aren't exactly the best, but they from services we get from the county due to his disability. he was dropped from his health insurance a while back and he had to go on the state health insurance of medi-cal (california). these were the same types of doctors who misdiagnosed him for 13 years. i've been trying to look for ways to get services on my own. although the majority of the degradation happened in the first 2 years, ever year he gets a bit worse. we're afraid we're going to completely loose him in a few years. does anyone have any ideas on what we can do? his health insurance is a state health insurance (medi-cal), which most specialists don't take. i have heard of recent improvements to brain imagine technology in recent years, such as the 'brain bucket' these scans to detect disorders that ordinary scans are not able to do. does anyone know if a way to go about getting these more advanced scans?",,0

(she lives in my house... i am 33 and single). i thought i was going to be able to handle this. when i was a kid my great-grandma had alzheimer's and she lived with us. i was a latchkey kid and even as a literal child i was in charge of her / alone with her most days. she was with us until she had a stroke and we couldn't care for her anymore and she went to a nursing home (she passed away less than a year after that). i just don't know what to do anymore. i think i might be getting to the point where i can't do this myself but there is literally no one else. before things were bad she made me promise her i wouldn't put her in a home... but now when i think it's something i might have to do i don't even think i can. even the not great memory care facilities cost $1,000 more than i make in a month... never mind that i obviously also need to pay my bills, eat, have my own medical needs, etc. i've already added a part time job in addition to my full time one. i have some help at home when i'm at work from the day from my uncle (my mom's brother and pretty much her only other living relative) but he's disabled so the support is pretty minimal.&amp;#x200b;i just don't know what to do and i feel like i'm completely in over my head and i wake up most days wishing that i didn't wake up at all. please someone tell me what to do.",,0
"(from a previous post of mine as per request.)&amp;#x200b;**i am going to be the bearer of bad news because it's easier to hear from an anonymous source.  if you're feeling awful and depressed, stop reading now.  this is a hard thing to take in.  make sure you're ok before continuing.**​dementia is essentially untreatable, irreversible, is a horrible thing to live through, and ends in death.  there are a few drugs out there, but most of them don't do much and the side-effects are worse than their benefits.  there are a few human drug/treatment trials going on, but they're few, far between, you have to live near a hospital that offers them, many times they don't work, and anything they do find is years away from being available to the public.the sufferers and caregivers who do the best with this disease are those who plan for the future.  they know what the next stage is and they've already done the research and signed the papers.  the ***best prepaired*** progression is usually:&amp;#x200b;1. ""impaired cognition"" noticed by family, usually in ""help me find my  car, i don't remember where i parked it"" situations.  electronic gps like a tile can help here. 2. poa/healthcare poa signed by sufferer, or other documents such as trustee, etc. 3. all financials nailed down, local laws researched, support group/network for caregiver found and activated4. dnr, ""quality of living"", death, corpse arrangements, burial arrangements discussed ahead of time5. long-term care health insurance attained (asap, the longer you wait the more expensive it will be) 6. shared home prepared for sufferer to live with caregiver (separate doors, ramps, extra rooms, extra baths, etc)7. patient diagnosed with dementia, usually ""mild to moderate"" stage8. medications to deal with side-effects prescribed, such as sundowner's, violent tendencies, hallucinations, etc.9. medications to help with actual alzheimer's prescribed.  they are usually not very effective, and are expensive and have serious side effects.  some experimental treatments, such as specific forms of light therapy, are showing promise but these will not be available from hmos for 7-10 years from now. 10. driver's license revoked11. apply to state/fed/insurance for any assistance, from financial to in-home.  this may take many tries and many years.  talk to your hospitals' elder care representative.12. if sufferer is violent, hallucinating, or wanders, talk to local police so they can be prepared.13. get an electronic tracker, bracelet, or other identifier for any wandering patient.14. around this point a few sufferers take their own lives to spare  their loved ones from dealing with a body without a mind.  this is not  common with boomers and silent generations as they generally believe  suicide to be a sin, but we're seeing it become more and more common in  patients who are younger.15. this is the point where we used to institutionalize our elders.  it  was very common in the 70's and 80's and even 90's to put them in care  homes.  now we know that they decline much faster when  institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home,  where they get better care.16. in-home care becomes necessary during the day.17. 24/7 in-home care becomes necessary or the patient needs to be  admitted to a memory care facility.  this is a locked ward where trained  professionals deal with hallucinations, violent tendencies, etc.  this  step is usually triggered by a tragic incident, such as patient  wandering and being found by authorities, patient harming caregiver,  patient injuring self, etc.  memory care facilities are not cheap, they  can run between $2,000 - $10,000+ a month.  &lt;&lt; this is where  caregivers with insufficient preparation or insufficient healthcare  access burn out... badly. 18. patient loses memories entirely, needs help with every daily activity 19. patient loses ability to feed self20. patient loses ability to swallow​please note that this progression can take months or decades.  i hope that anyone else can chime in if i've missed anything.​eta: thanks to u/[mitzukai\_9]( for the tips on costs, and added/modified points 1, 5, 9, and 18.",,0

"i can't believe this. i've worked in healthcare with hundreds of dementia patients and my own step father was just diagnosed with iti'm in cali and my parents moved from a small foothill town to a house in the bay area a week ago and he has fucking lost it. we saw no signs of dementia (well he would forget when people are coming over and such) and this week he doesn't remember to dress himself, feed himself, brush his teeth. he is constantly paranoid that people are going to break into the house, that all our money is gone, that he is being watched through the smoke detector, he even thought we were going to take his money away. it is like we lost our step father in the span of a week.they still have to settle into their house it's full of boxes, my mom has essentially always relied on my step father for practical matters and now it's all on her. they don't have resources they are familiar with nearby, the first pcp we visited said he couldn't even make a fucking psych referral for us???? apparently he doesn't know any?? they have to somehow sell their old house even though i don't think he's going to sign the paperwork so idk how we'll get power of attorney or how long it'll take. my mom seems completely unable to figure out many things for herself and us kids are trying to step up doctor appointments and unpack for her. she got a call that his vitamin b level is normal but low and is immediately panicking that she doesn't have vitamin b supplements and it's like she is unable to prioritize correctly.this feels like hell. his behavior is miserable, exhausting and freaking us out. there is endless work to do in the new home and it's just cold and full of boxes and my step father just wanders around telling us that all the accounts have already been hacked and they'll be kicked out in a few days. my mom doesn't know how to handle their finances, how to sell the old home or anything it feels like.i live an hour away, but my sister is closer and is going to be there a lot but i don't think she can handle all this on her own and i have step sons and just got my nursing degree and am supposed to take my boards and my husband and i were going to try and have kids and i feel like my life is crumbling and i can't do anything anymore. my mom can't handle this alone and i can't make my sister do it all either so i gotta step up. fucking hell",,0
"sorry for the long story. there is a summary of my question and a tldr at the bottom.  i want to give some backstory. my mom got early onset alzheimer's/dementia and over the course of 8years i watched her completely forget who she was, who i was. near the end before we put her in a care home i was changing her diapers. she would talk to her reflection in the mirror like it was her friend. i'd come out in the middle of the night sometimes to find her just standing there staring into darkness or facing a corner. it was really unnerving. she started getting symptoms when i was about 16 or so and she died when i was 23, my younger brother only 18.  her dad died of alzheimer's but his didn't set in until he was around 80years old. her symptoms started when she was about 40. she always said she wouldn't die of that disease and technically, she didn't. she progressed really rapidly in the care home and in her last few days she became violent, attacking other residents in their sleep. so she was sent to a psych and they prescribed her some medication. well this medication made her really dizzy and a couple days later she fell and hit her head. she died of brain trauma/internal bleeding. so her statement did stand true in the end, she didn't let that horrible disease be the thing to take her out.. although i believe she died long before her physical body did anyways.. now none of that is really the point of this post. since she had early onset that means she carried a specific gene that caused it. this is hereditary so me and my younger brother have a 50/50 chance of carrying it. this gene can be found in a dna/gene test.  if i carry this specific early onset gene it is pretty much 100% that i will get early onset alzheimer's. if i don't carry it there's still always the chance i can get it later in life but it's not a certain thing.tldr:  if i don't carry the early onset gene id get some bit of peace of mind. but if i do carry it there are 2 cons and 2pros that come to mind. con #1- it will most certainly effect  health or life insurance right? con #2- i feel like i'd psych myself out and think about it all the time, worry if any small thing i forget is symptoms setting in etc. pro #1) i could likely start trying tests studies treatments &amp; prevention methods early on and pro #2) i would try harder than i have been to live my life to the absolute fullest knowing that i could die in my 40s. i already live by this to an extent as i know every day isn't guaranteed but i'd definitely spend a lot more time doing the things i love in the next 10years or so. i know in the end it comes down to what i want to do but my question for you is, would you want to know?",,0
"my mom lives with us. she’s only 67 but after losing her job 3 years ago she has rapidly declined. she seems much slower to speak with, it’s almost frustrating listening to her talk .. searching for the words.. sometimes decides she doesn’t even know what she’s saying and says never mindrecently (1 month ago) she started chatting through facebook with a scammer / catfish that had convinced her he was a well known professional athlete (i’m leaving his name out) just let it be known he is exceptionally famous and 28 years old . she began a romantic relationship with this person believing it was the athlete.. after coaxing her to deposit a couple of fake checks (she didn’t know of course) and sending portions of money back to the tune of over $10,000 she finally realized and listened to her family and admitted it was not the athlete and was a scammer. she felt embarrassed and very sad/ upset. her bank wanted tons of money and she just scraped by on social security. days later she starts another romantic relationship with a person pretending to be a semi famous musician. she talks about it at first then begins to hide it from everyone. her finances are absolute chaos so i have the small few hundred dollars she has left to her name. she asks for $100 to open a new bank account because the old ones all closed on her. she then proceeded to go buy gift cards and send them to this new scammer. she talks to him as if they are in love and will be married soon.. after two weeks of chatting and of course he’s wanting money from her and asks several times and tells her to ask me for it. clearly i anyone thinking rationally he is pressuring her for money and manipulating her blatantly.she claims she knows this is wrong but she also will lash out and scream at anyone who tries to confront her about this issue. it’s strange to see someone that was considered highly intelligent and successful so far gone from reality she believes these scammers ridiculous stories for needing money and will harm her own financial well being, lie to her family and even lash out in anger when confronted.i don’t know if this is psychological or cognitive or what! i need to get her some help. any advice??",,0

"hello, i’m hoping to get some insight on how my girlfriend and her family can get financial assistance with getting her grandmother (patient) and her grandfather into a long term care facility. her grandma is in her 80’s and has severe dementia. at this point she remembers nothing, and is verbally and physically abusive. last summer she fell and broke her hip, that lead to a horrible few months of recovery. in the last 2 months she’s fallen 3 times and hurts herself constantly. since she’s in pain it only makes her attitude much much much worse. she is absolutely unable to care for herself of course, and my gf’s family cannot care for her by themselves. they’re not equipped to deal with her at all. her grandpa is in his 90’s and constantly is the target of her anger and abuse and when gf and her mom try to intervene, they then get the brunt of it. his health is also starting to slip further and further as this goes on. gf’s mom is a single mother and a teacher and gf is an admin assistant at a school so their funds are very very limited. i offer to help in anyway i can, house work, yard work anything, but i can’t help much financially either. at this point they don’t know what to do and believe there are absolutely no options out there. even the thought of splitting up the grandparents scares them for her grandpa’s sake. what options are there for helping pay for a memory care facility. insurance, non-profits, is something like go-fundme or anything like that the best bet?any advice can make a big difference for them so i welcome anything y’all can think of. thank you",,0
i’m in the early stages of petitioning for being guardian of my mom as a person. but i’m also debating if i should be guardian of her estate? she has no assets. literally nothing except a little over $800 a month from social security retirement that gets deposited into her bank account. i just got her into a nursing home which i was told medicaid will cover it. i’m not too keen on legal matters and i don’t want to deal with finances or bookkeeping. i don’t want to get a lawyer either. i’m thinking it would make my life more simple by just letting someone from the corporate guardianship entity serve as guardian of her estate? or would this be a foolish move in the long run?,,0
"tl/dr:my mother with frontotemporal dementia requires assisted living which she can’t afford &amp; strongly resists. she has multiple influential acquaintances who are encouraging her to resist her diagnosis and the efforts of her family to assist her.--------------------------------------------------------------------hello to you all. i’m sending my best wishes and empathy to you as you struggle with your own hardships, before you read about mine. this sucks. i appreciate you providing a venue to vent, and discuss.  hang in there.*my mother is in her mid sixties. she lives in the (us) state of wisconsin. she has been a compulsive hoarder for the past 20 years, without health insurance or psychiatric care/diagnosis of any kind until reaching seniority. beginning 5 years ago, it became more apparent that she has worsening cognitive issues. subsequently, a psychologist diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment (mci), and a neurologist further defined this as frontotemporal dementia (ftd). her doctors recommend that she be placed in assisted living and relinquish her driving privileges. she displays no self-awareness of her condition and maintains that she is in perfect mental health.she remains physically active and healthy.she maintains several harmful close friendships, made since the beginning of her cognitive decline. they encourage distrust of her doctor’s advice, and her family. i suspect that these individuals are trying to posture themselves to receive her limited assets, under the guise of assisting a small fringe church which they mutually visit. we have attempted to reason with these individuals, to no avail.my sibling and i have been caring for her this winter. we are removing items from her home, and keeping her in a temporary apartment where we provide her with all necessary supplies. this arangment will no longer be available to us soon.we have been able to keep her from driving for the winter months, although she has become increasingly combative about being kept from driving. her doctors have been quite vocal about disallowing this. she resists this.we intend to sell her small home on her behalf and to put her finances in a burial trust, as the upkeep of the home is obviously beyond the scope of her abilities. she resists this.we have activated financial power of attorney and are managing her accounts. she obsesses over the details of these accounts, regardless, and attempts to intervein.a medical poa has been signed and is kept in reserve should it be required.her income is limited to her medicare/social security benefits, very meager pension allotment from a previous marriage, and a state grocery allotment. her income is approximately $12k annually. and the possible sale of her home which is in very poor condition may result in a trust containing $90k.my sibling and i are seeking advice/ideas from the community regarding:1. how best to proceed in a manner which will allow her comfort within the limitations of her financial resources. additionally, have we overlooked $ resources available to her?2. how to limit the influence of predatory acquaintances.3. how to assist her in coming to terms with her new limitations.",,0
"my father was diagnosed with advanced dementia on monday.  yesterday they officially said he can sign for anything himself.  today they said he could be medically discharged, so his insurance won't pay for his hospitalization.  also today they gave us the guardianship paperwork, which thankfully my uncle said he would do.  so we have to go to court to get guardianship, however long that will take, and once that's established we can apply for the state's long term insurance, and then once he gets that he can go into a locked unit of assisted living, if a spot is available.  and until all that can happen, he's on the hook for the hospital bill.  this is going to get ugly fast.",,0
"my nana is 67, been dealing with the affects of losing her memory for a few years now. she has lived with my mom and moms boyfriend for about 2 years now. she has a friend who calls and cares about her, but this woman is drama. whenever my nana talks to her she starts talking about how she's going to run away back to her home state and live with her ""boyfriend"" who's 80. his wife had alzheimers for decades and just passed away a year ago. but she talks shit about my mom to this friend. my mom and her boyfriend made the decision to transfer my nanas car into my moms name. its easier and my mom is able to put it on her insurance so she can trade between her suv and nanas car for her work commute. my nana doesn't get that she can no longer drive it and yes, my mom has explained the reasons behind putting the car in her name, etc. but she hides her keys in her purse, the hides and forgets where the purse is.i guess i'm just venting now.but, **tl;dr** how do you guys deal with alzheimers family members trash talking their caregivers? what about when the one with memory loss forgets how awful they were to their child, who is now the caregiver?",,0

"hi.  i could use some advice.my mom was recently evaluated by a neurologist and although we're awaiting more tests, the initial diagnosis is dementia.  not surprising, we suspected it for years.  she's currently in a nursing home for an injury and we don't think she'll ever leave - she might scale down to assisted living, but overall, this is the safest place for her.almost  everyone has accepted this new residence, even mom on some days.  everyone except my deadbeat sibling who keeps contacting her for money.  the typical explanation is so they can get a place together once she gets out, but she recently asked me for $6,000 to pay the ""electric bill"" (i have the checkbook and am paying the bill's for her).  mom calls family, friends, even the bank requesting blank checks to bail the sibling out of every financial responsibility.  we've all cut contact with this person and mom needs her money to pay for her healthcare expenses.  everyone has tried explaining this to her in different ways, but nothing sticks.  any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",,0

"hello everyone. sorry for the rant/vent but i just... need a platform of sorts to let some things out i guess...?  as the title suggests, my grandmother has alzheimer's disease. it's late stage. i feel like i could just wake up any day now and learn that she's passed away and it weighs on me.   i'm 19 years old- so pretty young still i would say. i am also a full-time college student and so these things just continuously put weight on me every day. i am so afraid of her passing suddenly and the grief will just completely wreck my school life. i almost flunked high school due to depression and so i am trying not to make any sort of repeat with this newfound ""chance"" i now have. it's conflicting- because part of me feels awful for just ""waiting"" for her to pass away. of course, i don't want my grandma to die, but this disease has destroyed her so much it's like she's just a physical shell at this point. she is my last grandparent, after all. but at the same time, me internally hoping that she will at least die when i am not in school is such a terrible thing to think about and i feel so... selfish, quite frankly. she's the one with the disease, after all.  every week or so, i see her- except it's just a depressing experience at this point because alzheimer's has taken such a toll on her. i'm trying to spend at least a good amount of time with her while she's still here but it's hard to do so. she's incoherent and does not remember me nor a good chunk of my relatives and requires assistance to do the majority of things if not everything. i'm not surprised at this but it still hurts a bit, you know? plus, i know she is the only person holding my family together because her children aka my aunts and uncles are in a feud over finances and god forbid what happens after she leaves this realm.   i've been crying tonight like i do every few weeks nowadays when i think about her. my parents do not know about this. it's just so stressful, and it also feels like i'm looking into the future because dementia runs in my family. my other grandmother also passed from the same disease before i was born. every time i notice my parents forget something it just sparks a tinge of pain within me because of that fear that they will develop the disease too and i can't really do anything about it. i was also raised in a culture where children are expected to take care of their parents when they're older, so the possibility of me having to be a care-giver myself one day also haunts me because i've seen what it is like and also feel a bit selfish for not wanting to do such a thing.   i really don't know what to do anymore, or how to even properly cope with something like this. it's a cruel cycle of waiting for her to die so she can finally be at peace and then feel bad for thinking such a thing. am i a bad person for thinking it'd be better for her to pass away at this rate? how am i supposed to live knowing about this slow and cruel decline towards death my grandmother is facing, and that she's almost at the finish line? i've always wanted for her to see me graduate but i know it is likely that she will be gone by the time i finish any sort of degree. seeing my friends be able to interact with and spend time with their own grandparents is like a stab in the chest reminder that i will never be able to have such a relationship. i am happy for them yet i can't help but feel... jealous about it. i do have a few very vague memories of my grandma back before alzheimer's got to her, but i've since long forgotten a good bit of it myself- such a cruel twist of irony, isn't it. i love my grandma very much but it also hurts so much seeing her like this. i am in pure agony.  still, if you're still reading this, thanks for your time. really. i may not know who you are but just know i am thankful you'd put off some of your time to read this. i do not expect a lot of attention and for this to just float around in the reddit ocean forever and that i am content with. i just want to let some of my thoughts go, and after typing this i think i feel a little bit better. well, i stopped crying a bit ago at least, haha. maybe i can finally go to bed.",,0
"my once-frugal 75-year-old mother, diagnosed recently with dementia, has made many donations to various political candidates and other random charitable causes over the past 18 months. she has been financially scammed numerous times over the past 18 months, in one case giving out her social security # over the phone. she insists that her money is her money and she can afford to make donations and she can spend her money however she likes. it is true that she is financially secure and technically can afford to make these donations but it is awful to see this money flying out the window when it will soon be needed to pay for her care.she receives stacks of fundraising solicitations in the mail every day, spends hours looking at all of this mail, opening the envelopes and putting paper clips on various letters, putting forever stamps on the return envelopes.  if my sister and i do not secretly remove some of the mail while she is not looking, it piles up in stacks and she begins writing more and more checks. currently there are hundreds of pieces of mail covering her entire dining table and is piled up on chairs, in boxes, etc. if she catches us taking it, she gets angry at us.today after i picked up two full brown bags of unopened fundraising mail from her home, i discovered i had also accidentally picked up her check register, which apparently had been left amid one of the stacks. my sister and i are both poa for all finances including on her checking account. when she discovers the check register is missing what do i do? do come clean and tell her i have it and she can no longer have it? do i pretend i don’t have it? do i return it to her?  she is increasingly making incredibly poor financial decisions that are absolutely out of character for her, however for now at least she is still paying bills on time and is not always so impaired that she might not figure out that i am likely the reason her check register is now missing.",,0
"this is kind of a long rant but i just don't understand some of the actions my family members are taking in relation to the care of my grandparents. they have been both diagnosed with rapidly progressing dementia and alzheimers within the last 7 months. my grandfather is definitely worse. he's mood has changed, and he's joyful and happy all the time which is nice. he's never forgotten who i am and he knows what i'm talking about. he'll also ask me how things went two weeks after the fact, so he's still there. my dad took over his finances last summer and has severely restricted my grandma's spending. she has a credit card limit and her card gets declined when we go out for dinner. they did this because she was buying my aunt too much stuff (who's mentally unwell and lost her son).  they have over 10 million dollars so it's not really a problem for her to spend money, but i get it. i just found out my grandma was diagnosed 2 months ago with dementia and alzheimers as well. i didn't realize how bad she was, i just thought she was getting forgetful when she would tell me the same story after a few hours. they now have 24 hr care, which is great. but i am no longer allowed to sleepover and i'm so upset about it. i can now only visit from 1-8 pm to put them on a strict schedule. i only slept over because it made them happy and i liked having breakfast and reading the paper with them in the morning. i also worked as a home health aide for 14 years so i thought i could help them if they needed it. i'm graduating with my phd in may, and my dad told me they couldn't come to my graduation. i'm so sad about it, and i get that it messes with their schedule. but they really wanted to go. are these restrictions to make them have a set schedule normal? i just want what's best for them, but i don't understand why taking away things that seem harmless and make them happy is helpful. i don't have a good relationship with my dad and my stepmom, so i think it's also me feeling resentful towards him.",,0
"hi i'm new here, dealing with a family member who is likely in the beginning stages of dementia. thanks to covid we had to wait a long time to get her to a neurologist, but the appointment is around the corner. what can we expect?what i'm mainly concerned about is that since she doesn't believe anything is wrong, she will downplay everything to the doctor. a family member will be present with her at the appointment so she doesn't go alone. ideally we'd be allowed to speak the doctor privately without her present, because some of the things that need to be said are uncomfortable to say in front of her. for example, i think it needs to be pointed out that she has basically stopped bathing aside from washing her hair in the sink with dish soap, but that's kind of embarrassing to bring up in front of her.i guess overall i just don't know what to do if she doesn't think anything is wrong, and i was hopeful that we'd get a definitive diagnosis (maybe not from this first visit, but eventually?) that would help her understand what's going on and realize she needs more help. she is making all of these grand plans for her life that absolutely should not happen with how bad off she is right now. for example, she wants to adopt a dog, but she couldn't even take care of her cat and we had to rehome it. she wants to buy a house, but she can barely manage an apartment at the moment (it's starting to look like an episode of hoarders). she couldn't handle her finances at all so we've already taken over that for her. imo she needs to move to a retirement community that has a memory care unit that she can eventually transition to if/when she gets worse, but she is not receptive to that idea at all.anyway thanks in advance for any advice, and for just for letting me rant a bit (figured this community would be understanding).",,0
"i've been taking care of my mother with diagnosed dementia for a handful of years now and it's become too much for me. she needs more care than i can give. and i want my life back, i want to go back to school and start my life together with my fiancée. i want to live my life for me for once, i want to sleep through the night without having to get up and talk down someone's delusions. i'm sick of having my life dictated by this illness, i'm sick of never having any time at all to myself ever. my mental health is complete garbage and i'm having difficulty taking care of myself. i'm exhausted.both of her poa's have been activated, were working with the adrc to get long term care set up. we're almost at the finish line with the applications filled out and we're just waiting now.in the meantime it's been discussed with my mother that i'll be moving out at some point and we need to find a good place for her to live. we all know memory care is going to be the best option but of course mom thinks she's ""just forgetful"". she has become super fixated on this idea of moving in with someone and being their caretaker. she's freaking out about moving somewhere where most of her money will go to her care (she doesn't think she needs any extra care) and she won't be able to bring some old furniture. not that she's able to keep track of any of her finances anyway or has any idea whatsoever how much money she takes in or what she has to pay.any advice or shared experiences on placing a loved one in care when they don't understand the level of care they need?",,0
"my mom had a sudden change in vision and needed surgery in september. there were no beds at our local hospital so they lifeflighted her to a city about 300 miles away. the surgery was done through her nose (her pitiuary gland was pressing on her optic nerve). my mom came through the surgery fine, she was her ""normal"" self on facetime, andf the doctors said she would be home in 2 days. i got transportation arranged (they don't tell you when there are no beds due to covid they pay to take to you another hospital but they do not pay to tke you back). this was my first time having to really use my financial poa, and a great learning lesson. then nothing from the hospital for 4 days. i paniced and had to file compliants to get answers. it was scary being so far away and my mom's cell phone was disabled! she had developed mengitsis after the surgery. the hospital said she was safe, they had her in a small covid safe room (no windows) and she was getting iv's. i talked to her and she did not know who i was or our family was. it was hard. her baseline before the surgery was forgetting where she was going in the car or why she walked into a room or if she took her meds, but she knew who i was still and her family was and she was very sharp still on long term finances. the doctors signed papers saying she was not aware and i needed to take over all medical and finacial decisions so i was called for every med change and procedure and had to give permission. her blood cell counts got better and the medical staff said the meningitsis was getting better. she did get more peppy in her speech. she was not as sleepy sounding but still so confused about where she was what day it was and who people were. she would claim she was being held prisioner or in a drug rehab facility (she was in a neurology floor icu i confirmed no drug rehab in the building) she would claim she was outside all night (i know she was not i was in constant contact with the nurses). the doctor said she developed post operative  delirium.  they said this would get better when she got home. they finally got a bed a nursing home back at home and she was transferred. she has been a a facility close to me for almost 3 weeks and she still has this post operative  delirium ?, she is so confused as to what medical staff have come in, what time of day it is, she will claim she has not been showered for 2 weeks (not true) or that i have not visited for days (when i have been there every day . many times 3-4 times a day, and there is covid sign in so it is on the sheet i was there for hours).  she will say that kids were at her door screaming at night (no kids allowed, doubled checked, thr nurse says it is  delirium halliculations). the nursiing home staff is super nice but way understaffed and it is hard to get answers. one staff memeber (someone high up in an office) said iif my mom still has this post operative delirium a month later, it is likely her new norm? it is such a huge decline from pre surgery plus she is so angry. she will yell you have not visited me, and say bad words and i an exhustated and have visited her 2 times that day but she yells and she flashes her diaper(the surgery left her incontinent which is been very hard) and says crude things. this again is a shocking 1 month change. i have looked up post operative delirium and had no idea how common it was in patients over 75. &amp;#x200b;now i have to make decisions and i have sat with the lawyer and i have the power to make almost every choice i can think of. she is going to be released soon. she wants to go home, to her home. no way she can go home alone. the other factor is when she got sick i was in the process of moving out of state. like i had sold my house and my spouse had a new job in another state and we had offered on a home. our plans at the time were for her to live at her home with help and then we had located long term facilities in the area we were moving to that my mom was familiar with (she used to live in the state we are moving to) that she agreed to.  now this level of help she needs is so much higher then 1 month ago so what i had lined up will not work. now my spouse and one child are  cross country and myself and my son are renting part of a home trying to stay nearby my mom. i have not got a good nights sleep in a month, i have lost almost 20lbs (and i was not overweight), i just want to have my own space and some quiet (the retirement city my mom is so hard to find a rental, hotel room, it is booming and i am lucky to have the small noisy sapce i have but i just want to cry some nights, it is so loud and i am used to quiet) and sleep but i cant leave my mom yet. she says i do not want to move (yet she does not know where she is right now). she is angry and just so hard to spend time with. i have the legal paperwork and i can write a check for her to move, i can put an addition on my new house for her to stay there, i can pay for a nursing home or assisted living, i have the control but she is so angry(before the surgery, she was fiesty and opinionated  but not angry like this). her wish is to go home locally and have caregivers (which she can afford) but i , her only family will be over 2,000 miles away.  her pcp says while she might be able to go home, with her many issues, she likely will be back iin a hospital or care center in 6 months to a year and i will be far away. the pcp says take her with me, the nursing home says take her with me, she has almost no friends left in the area, sadly most have died or some have moved back to be with family. the local medical care is very hard to come by, the city boomed and doctors did not come to meet the demand. do i just force her to come with me? or do i let her stay and most likely fail and come back for her. i worry about people taking advantage of her in her if i am not close. it scary to see the lack of workforce. stores are closed, restuarants are closed. one of the reasons i am losing weght is at 8pm i leave the nursing home and the city is already closed due to no workers. i cant find a grocery store or fast food place open after 8pm. previously i was easily able to find a nice stay at home mom to come help with housework or errands who was happy to make some extra money, but that is gone. ther rates for in home care were $15 an hour and now are $40+ if you can find someone and with my mom's anger she is not going to be a patient someone wants if they have a choice. &amp;#x200b;if yoiu read my whole long story, thank you so much. so my main concerns are is this post poerative  delirium her new norm?  since she already had memory loss, did this surgery and the complications just send her downhill faster? should i move her or leave her ? i want to respect her wishes. i have been very careful with every medical choice and financial choice to answer as if i were my healthy 50 year old mom not what i want. she does not want to move so i dont want to go against her wishes but her wishes are no really the best medical choice for her and not the best choice for support.",,0

"my mother (63) just approved for ssdi and received a lump sum from her ssdi claim (\~$6,500) from december 2021 when she was officially diagnosed with frontotemporal. she was just approved for a home aid 3.5 hours, 7 days a week through medicaid, and i am scared. the home aide will start on july 1st. i'm afraid that the lump sum will now make her ineligible for medicaid, and all the work i put in to get us here will be null and void. my mom's ssdi payment will now be closer to the monthly limit for medicaid eligibility as well. additionally, since july 2020 we've been in a process with my mom's previous employer through their insurance to get my mom on long-term disability after she exhausted her short-term disability. they're waiting to receive the doctor's notes from her psychiatrist evaluation. i'm not too hopeful about my mom being approved by them but if she would be approved she would be receiving a lump sum from 2020 and that would definitely make her ineligible for anything.i don't know what to do. i looked into medicare and it doesn't look like they provide home aide's, it also looks like my mom has to wait 2 years? or 1.5 years to qualify for medicare since her ssdi was approved from when i submitted it in december 2021? it sounds like that or until she's 64. i'm so confused.",,0

"originally posted in r/agingparents and someone suggested i post this here.my dad (66) and i have never been close and i've always wanted to be. that's not really the point of this post, but it matters. he's uncomfortable talking about much of substance and always seems to feel ill at ease, like he isn't sure what's coming out of his mouth and not certain of where he is. he wants to make people laugh but not be laughed at. he's always been a proud man. i keep his jokes going even when they don't make sense, and our conversations are usually light. sometimes though, his stress overwhelms him and he cries to me about what may or may not be real problems and i don't know what to say.i live 1100 miles away, and my siblings found out last october that our dad was diagnosed 2 years ago with lewy body dementia and alzheimers. the only reason his wife told us was because he was hospitalized and they could no longer hide his symptoms. i just found out he was hospitalized again yesterday to have his meds readjusted. late sunday night, he tried to walk over to his neighbor's house because he was convinced he had been hired to manage a football team and he needed to be next door to start work. his wife tried to redirect him and he spoke angrily to her and pushed her. so now he's back in the hospital and i'm a wreck.i'm going to call him but can somebody with more experience please help me know what to say to him? i always try to meet him where he is and act as if whatever he says is perfectly ordinary conversation. it's sad, but i can do that. it's his anguish that kills me. when he cries about not having any money and tells me he was robbed, what do i say? i have no idea what their finances are, and furthermore, i was told never to contradict someone with alzheimers. hell, my dad never liked being contradicted when he was healthy. i don't know how to comfort him. it seems impossible to get him off that track and it destroys me to know he's suffering and not be able to fix it.please help.",,0
"my husband’s very sweet grandmother was diagnosed awhile back. she is in her 80s and has luckily progressed fairly slowly, but her short term memory has degraded enough now that it is causes problems. she had been living in florida with her husband, but when he died last year, the grief pushed her into the next stage of the disease. she moved to be close to her son (my father in law) in an assisted living home that has memory care in a separate suite. she is not yet in memory care. her long term memory is quite in tact, but her short term memory is very bad now. she can no longer follow a recipe and baking used to be her passion. during a recent family reunion, i spoke with my mother in law about how her husband was coping. he can’t enjoy his time with his mother anymore because everything is surrounded by this layer of stress. he is in charge of her finances and she asks the same questions over and over.  then my mother in law said something that concerned me.she said “we’re just waiting until it gets worse because then it’ll be easier. she fights us on every decision, but when she forgets everything we can just do what’s right for her and she won’t remember.”then she looked at me and said “don’t worry. we won’t ever put you two through this.”i’m so sad that they think of it as her putting them through this disease. i’m sad that they don’t see how, as frustrating as it is for them, it is worse for her. she is still with it enough to know that she is forgetting. all they say when we ask how our grandmother is doing is “she’s exhausting”i asked how they were going to keep from “doing this to us”. my father in law’s solution is to kill himself as soon as he gets a grim diagnosis and my mother in law doesn’t know. my husband and i live across the country and there isn’t much we can do to help, but i am worried sick about all of it.any advice or suggestions or thoughts would be helpful.",,0
my grandma has dementia and is in the nursing home. my mother has always taken care of her and her finances. years ago they bought a house together it was in gram's name but mom paid for everything.  at some point in the early 80's gram added my mom's name to the deed but didn't tell anyone till years later. when that was discovered no one corrected it. the state knew this when gram went into the home in 2017. they said nothing about it. now my mom gets a bill for $30000 saying that this wasn't paid due to gram owning half a house. does anyone have advice? my mom is also on a fixed income so paying it out right or buying gram out isn't an option?,,0
"ughhhh, i'm just very angry about the whole thing. i've been fighting with my bf for a while now about getting his mother onto a waitlist for a nursing home knowing that it'll be about 2 years before she gets placed. he has refused to and is now saying she doesn't have the low-income insurance that she needs to get onto the waitlist. i'm frustrated because he isn't doing anything to get his mom the proper care that she needs and it's going to get way worse before it gets better.we live in a 2 bedroom apartment and the bedrooms and the bathroom is on the second floor. she's gained a lot of weight in the last year and is having trouble getting off the couch and the stairs are making her tired. i don't think she has much time left before she is unable to navigate them. she is also complaining of problems with her bowels constantly, of having diarrhea, which i suspect is her articulating that she is getting close to losing continence. bf is convinced that isn't the case and that it's simply her diet.she is also getting increasingly aggressive. she is irritable and angry with both me and my bf's sister. she yells, swears and threatens violence. she also hurls a lot of racist statements my way (i'm asian). his sister and i are on the same page regarding her care and needs and it's frustrating that bf can't see it that way.his biggest problem is that he doesn't want her to feel afraid and that's why he's resistant to her going anywhere. i understand his fear, but i feel that she is going to be afraid regardless and that it would be better to get her acclimated to a new environment sooner so that she has a chance to recognize her surroundings. i worked as a nursing assistant to get through school and it's been really frustrating. i've worked in nursing homes and they're not as bad as people make them out to be. yes, they're not home, i get it, but they're not jails. i've been trying to help him navigate the waters but he's been resistant to any help. when she was first placed on her meds, i mentioned that she should be on an antidepressant because of her behavior and to help her sleep. he eventually decided to take her off of it without telling anybody because he felt that i was too pill-happy and trying to overmedicate her. that led to a solid 2 months of her crying constantly, being angry with everybody and just having a really rough time before he realized that she really needed the meds.i'm worried that she's going to need assistance toileting, and bathing soon and she won't let him help because he's a boy, and she's violent towards me. it's unrealistic to expect his sister to drive over constantly to help because mil is violent towards her as well. i feel like he is setting us up for failure because by the time she really really needs help, we won't be able to get help when we need it.he told me yesterday that he'd rather the two of them move into a studio apartment and he can just deal with her so that she can die in her own bed. i'm really tempted to let him do it, but that would be a catastrophe, he has a very low patience threshold, constantly loses his temper, and isn't able to give any sort of structure to her life. i'm just feeling like i'm watching a very slow-moving trainwreck and i'm tied to the rails.",,0
"my non biological grandmother developed severe alzheimer’s in her early 60. my step mom is now almost 60 and appears to me to have some tell tale symptoms and i’m curious if anyone has any input on this. i’m planning to talk to my doctor about it next week.lately outside of telling the same stories over and over and then also forgetting a ton of things from leaving personal items behind she seems to have lost grasp of time... like talking about her biological son like he is still a child.. when he is 23 now .. or bringing up stories from 20years ago like it’s within the last year...the biggest red flag im seeing and i’m hoping to get feedback on is that she is currently working.... 90 hours per week between 5 different jobs. i’m not kidding either.i sat her down to ask her why she is desperately working and seeking additional jobs... she told me she “has to work!!!”... i dig into her finances and she doesn’t need to be doing this. i told her it was wayyy overboard. two jobs maybe ok... she isn’t broke... but she tells the story of her job searches with this victim energy. the sad part is she has been working this much for almost 2 years now.i know this might seem out there, but has anyone witnessed anything like this? she is in complete denial. i crunched the numbers.... it’s not about her finances it’s like she is working herself to death with no rhyme or reason.i’m hoping someone can chime in. i honestly feel like she is starting to show early signs and somehow i’m worried this excessive working is a part of it.",,0

and the rest will be again.  there's not a lot of sugar-coating here so if you're in a bad headspace, read this later.  dementia is a progressive, incurable disease that results in death.  half of everyone who lives long enough will develop dementia.  there are multiple types of dementia, but absolute diagnosis of the specific type usually cannot be made until after death.  specific things will make dementia worse: infections, dehydration, surgery, radiation/chemo, hospital stays, changes in routine, traveling, broken bones, alcoholism, etc.  most sufferer's progressions follow a similar pattern, but everyone's specific journey will be different.  note that this progression can take months or decades.  there are things that can be done, we think, to prolong or prevent the onset of dementia symptoms.  a diet low in sugar and alcohol but high on plants and fiber like the mediterranean diet can help.  exercise is essential.  those who speak two languages are half as likely to develop dementia, and people with higher educational attainment develop debilitating symptoms much later than those with less educational attainment. &amp;#x200b;# begin the journeyonce you suspect dementia, get your elder the best long term care insurance you can find.  use their most recent physical you can get; if it's too old, get a new one asap.  do not mention to the doc your suspicions about memory issues; family seems to pick up on these 1-5 years before they show up on the actual diagnostics, and it'd stop you from getting good ltc insurance.  read the contract and see how long you have to wait to get a dementia diagnosis after the policy goes into effect, so to not invalidate the insurance. this is the time to get your legal paperwork in order.  get your power of attorney or equivalent, and get the different forms the different institutions require.  your bank will usually have a notary on hand who can notarize things for you.  speaking of banks, consider moving finances to a credit union.  cus are non-profit: they don't make money off you by charging fees.  this small difference every month can save a lot of money for later, when you really might need it.  care homes are expensive.  also, get your long term directives in order.  what does your elder consider important to her quality of life?  what daily activities does she consider necessary: if she can't do that, it's not worth it?  does she want cpr?  life support?  for how long?  how does she want her body handled?  where to be buried/ashes to be scattered?  your doctor may have a booklet that will help you go through all of this, which can be filled out, notarized, and filed with your doctor/hospital so they have to honor her wishes. then get a dementia diagnosis.  many times a simple problem like a uti or other infection can appear as dementia-like symptoms, so rule out other (solvable) problems first.  if your relative is resistant to going to the doctor, offer to take them out to lunch, or ask them to keep you company while you get a prescription from the hospital's pharmacy, and then take them to their appointment.  yes, it's devious, but nothing happens without a diagnosis.  once you're sure of dementia talk with your resources both professional and family.  your healthcare may have a memory care or elder care group that can help you understand what's going on and what's going to happen.  bring your relatives, or bring them back the brochures.  there will be a lot of very difficult questions from relatives/friends who are not in the loop, such as ""what can we do"" and  ""what's the cure"".  the answers are ""take care of her until she dies"" and ""there isn't a cure"", which they won't like to hear, but will have to accept from the professionals.  so having someone else answer those questions is usually a lot easier.  if they know generally what the progression is you're less likely to come up against issues with them later.  so many relatives think ""oh, they're just hanging with grandma, how nice!"", when the truth is so much darker.  half of all caregivers will develop diseases or die while caregiving; it's often one of the worst, most stressful things we will do in our lives.  get a support group going for yourself, early, while you're still able to find time.  get a therapist if you can.  look around for what help is available where you are.  you go to [alz.org]( and use their resources.  out where i am we have a lot of local resources for home care and supplemental care, i hope you have the same or better.  you can find this by searching for ""elder care"" and your city, county, country, province, etc.  day care, respite care, and other programs are, frankly, essential. this part is important and ongoing.  start looking at where she is in the progression of the disease and make plans for the next step.  not planning for the future is the biggest mistake most families make.  they're so incredibly busy just barely taking care of today's needs that they're not ready for the next step.  my aunt was  literally hoisting my grandmother onto her back to get her from her bedroom to her chair in the front room, and then took care of her during  the day... and that was all she could do.  when grandma caught a cold, the coughing kept her from holding onto my aunt's shoulders so she couldn't get out of bed.  that led to the beginning of bedsores, so she had to go to the hospital.  instead of letting it get to that point aunt should have had in-home carers, lifts, equipment, supportive mattresses... so many things would have made life easier for both of them.  but aunt was too busy -- or overwhelmed -- with the massive job of caregiving.  prepare for the next step while you can. apply for government-paid in-home caring/recompense/assistance now, because by the time your requests are approved, she'll probably need them.  apply for a place at the best memory care facility you can find/afford now, because you can decline placement over and over and over, and just be put back at the head of the list for the next available spot.  during covid we found that the places with union workers had the lowest numbers for covid infections, controlling for many variables, due to the workers having access to ppe, so that's a consideration you might want to look for.  your country/states' department of social services will probably have a rating on all their care homes that might be helpful. many places are big enough that they provide multiple services, from respite to simple assisted living to locked wards, often via different wings.  respite is like checking your elder into a hotel for a weekend: the facility will take your elder for a bit to give you a break, and will help familiarize her with the facility.  these facilities will be able to transition your elder from one stage to the other via professionals.  this is very helpful because caregivers just compensate and compensate and compensate, burning themselves out far past the point where they should have transitioned.  keep in mind that these places run from 60k to 200k per year.  that insane price, along with the proof that elders are healthier longer at home, are why most people keep their elders at home with them for much longer than we used to.  but sometimes a care home is just necessary.  there are placement services which will take your elder's requirements (ostomy care, diabetes, hoyer lifts, meds, etc), distance from your home, and prices into consideration and get you a list of facilities.  they're very helpful and usually take recompense from the homes themselves so they don't cost you anything. save what you can.  talk to your mom and get recordings of her voice.  get tapes of all the family histories and stories you'll ever want to hear.  get her involved in alz groups as an aid or an assistant  so when she's a participant she'll still want to be there.  find out what her favorite music is, download it onto an easy-to-play format for when/if she has bad days.  get out the old pictures and see if she can identify the mystery faces. if you have access to it, look into high-cbd products to see if your elder has a good reaction to them.  dementia progression typically includes depression and anger, and most patients also experience sundowning, sleeplessness, and/or agitation.  cbd can help with all of these if it's well tolerated.  please check with your doctor first, there are a few medications that interact very badly with cannabis.  i have personally had very good luck with mary's medicinals' ""the remedy"" and a high-cbd edible but had to try a few things to find what actually worked.  and boy howdy they really do help. these are things you can do instead of worrying.  i do these things because not doing them is a bad idea, and they help me work through the grief.  activity helps dispel fear and anxiety. &amp;#x200b;# the progressionthe sufferers and caregivers who do the best with this disease are those who plan for the future.  they know what the next stage is and they've already done the research and signed the papers.  the ***best prepared*** progression is usually:1. ""impaired  cognition"" noticed by family, usually in ""help me find my car, i don't remember where i parked it"" situations.  electronic gps like a tile can help here.2. poa/healthcare poa signed by sufferer3. all financials nailed down, local laws researched, support group/network for caregiver found and activated4. dnr, ""quality of living"", death, corpse arrangements, burial arrangements discussed ahead of time5. long-term care health insurance attained (asap, the longer you wait the more expensive it will be)6. shared home prepared for sufferer to live with caregiver (separate doors, ramps, extra rooms, extra baths, ada furniture, doorways, hallways etc)7. patient diagnosed with dementia, usually ""mild to moderate"" stage8. this is usually when their driving starts to suffer.  taking away their keys usually provokes horrible rages, there is another option.  go to your country/state's department of motor vehicles site to submit their form for retesting an elder's capability to drive.9. medications to deal with side-effects prescribed, such as sundowner's, violent tendencies, hallucinations, etc.10. medications to help with actual alzheimer's prescribed.  they are usually not very effective, but are expensive and have serious side effects.  some experimental treatments, such as specific forms of light therapy, are showing promise but these will not be available from hmos for 7-10 years  from now.11. driver's license revoked, usually automatically after diagnosis &amp; medication12. apply to state/fed/insurance for any assistance, from financial to in-home.  this may take many tries and many years.  talk to your hospitals' elder care representative.13. if sufferer is violent, hallucinating, or wanders, talk to local authorities so they can be prepared.  this may not be appropriate in certain jurisdictions or for certain families. 14. get an electronic tracker, bracelet, or other identifier for any wandering patient.15. around this point a few sufferers take their own lives to spare their loved ones from dealing with a body without a mind.  this is not common with boomers and silent generations as they generally believe suicide to be a sin, but we're seeing it become more and more common in patients who are younger.16. this is the point where we used to institutionalize our elders. it was very common in the 70's and 80's and even 90's to put them in care homes.  now we know that they decline much faster when institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home, where they get better  care.17. in-home care becomes necessary during the day.18. 24/7 in-home care becomes necessary or the patient needs to be admitted to a memory care facility.  this is a locked ward where trained professionals deal with hallucinations, violent tendencies, etc.  this step is usually triggered by a tragic incident, such as patient wandering and being found by authorities, patient harming caregiver, patient injuring self, etc.  memory care facilities are not cheap, they can run between $4,000 - $14,000+ a month.  &lt;&lt; this is where  caregivers with insufficient preparation or insufficient healthcare access burn out... badly.19. patient loses memories entirely, needs help with every daily activity20. patient loses ability to feed self21. patient loses ability to swallow&amp;#x200b;this will be posted to both r/alzheimers and r/dementia.   i hope that anyone else can chime in if i've missed anything.",,0
"apologies if this is the wrong sub. my husband has been diagnosed with mild dementia. his neurologist is pressuring me to get a power of attorney. i am his wife (first in line as next of kin) and all of our finances are in both our names. does anyone know, do i still need to have a power of attorney done? at the moment, his symptoms are mild; some forgetfulness and some days he describes as ""foggy"", but no huge changes.",,0
"my questions are:      **1 - does this sound like it could be beginning dementia or something else?**   **2 - do you have any advice about or experience with long-term care insurance?**   **3 - do you have any good resources or book recommendations for people suffering from cognitive difficulty, or for their families/caregivers?**any input or links/resources will be appreciated!  my mom has been having some cognitive issues for several years. she is 56 and retired at 54 because she was not really able to keep up with her job and it became too overwhelming (she worked in it, same job her whole career). i feel like her personality has changed somewhat also and i feel bad about this, but for the past few years i've been feeling like it's not worth talking to her about anything because she won't remember anyway.   my (f, 31) brother (24) and dad (57) live with her. they are in denial and try to claim it's just **add/adhd** and that her brain doesn't pay attention even when it seems like she is, so i went to the doctor with my mom in october and she tried an add drug that did not help her at all. she is an intelligent person but she was **diagnosed with adhd when she was kid** (at that time it was referred to as minimal brain dysfunction) although she never got any help or treatment for it and it didn't seem to have any real barriers to her schooling or it career until later in life (late forties/early fifites).  when we went to the doctor for add/adhd in october, the doctor didn't seem to think advised her to get a **neuro-psychiatric evaluation** but i told him not to order it yet and not put it in the notes because she might want to get some type of **long-term care insurance** and doesn't want to **disqualify** herself from that. it's expensive though, so it's a major decision, and i know my dad is doing research and trying to make the best choice.  she also has developed a **hand tremor** in one hand only, in the last 6 months (her estimation). my dad swears she always had this, but she definitely didn't. i only noticed it when she was swiping her credit card at the doctor's office, and the doctor noticed it as well.   overall i feel like my mom lives a normal life and she **does remember some things**. she is also able to keep up with the family laundry and still knows tricks to get out different types of stains, etc. she can do grocery shopping if she has a list, but she might miss a couple things (which happens to everyone sometimes). she can cook simple/standard things like tuna helper, grilled cheese, spaghetti, etc. but gets overwhelmed by cooking more than one thing at a time.   she is generally able to set appointments and keep them as long as she writes them on her wall calendar correctly, and i think she checks her calendar every day (then makes notes to herself). however, an example of some cognitive trouble is -- when we went to her doctor in october, she went to their old office location that had been closed for over a year and was really confused when she couldn't find the building (it's now a different business). then she thought they moved across the street so we went there, no luck. i googled where the doctor practiced and the first address given was a hospital that is familiar to us, so my mom said ""oh yeah, i remember going there - you just park in front and check in"". so we drove to that hospital but my mom couldn't figure out how to get to the front parking lot. when we went to check in and gave the doctor's name, they said he didn't have an office there. eventually we got the office address and went there, and my mom confirmed she has been there before but just couldn't remember where it was. i later realized the reason why the hospital rang a bell for her was that she had been there a few weeks earlier to accompany my dad to a colonoscopy appointment.   she also hit a couple curbs while driving that day (i drove after that). it was like she **knew her brain was failing her and she was scattered and uneasy** about it. when we got home after the whole ordeal i told her i wasn't mad and it wasn't a big deal to reschedule, etc. but she couldn't relax and she thought she was having a heart attack. i think she was having a **panic attack**. i do think she is definitely having issues with anxiety, and probably depression too. i think she has tried some **anxiety and depression** medications but says they don't help.  here are some examples of the cognitive issues i've noticed:* **has to take notes** **when she talks to anyone (in person or on the phone)**. if you ask her a question about a phone call she just had (like with grandparents), she has to refer to the notes and she can only tell you the answer if she can find it in her notes. also, if she has to relay information into a short text message to notify other family members, it takes her several hours to do so when it should only take a couple minutes.* **asks the same questions within minutes**. then asks the same questions throughout the day, again the next day, on and on forever. she pretty much **doesn't remember any conversations**. it puts a strain on everyone. it's hard to maintain a patient and pleasant attitude when you've answered the same question 3 times already in the past 20 minutes all day long. i feel like we are good at answering repeated questions until about the 4th or 5th time and we all start to lose our cool.  my mom doesn't know it's the fifth+ time she's asked so if she gets a sense of our annoyance, she'll say ""well you know i don't remember things, be nice to me"". and we're annoyed and thinking, well if you know you don't remember anything, why do you even ask questions at all? what is the point, really?* **not able to plan anything or solve basic problems**  she can't plan out christmas gifts or do christmas shopping anymore, unless she is just assigned a couple of specific things. she used to plan family vacations and get togethers, but now planning anything involves too many details for her to keep track of. she cannot be in charge of anything.  even simple things like two people carpooling to one place, then driving separate cars, etc. would be an example of a detail that she can't keep straight in her mind. so even minor things like camping nearby or going biking then to a restaurant is something my dad would have to plan the details for. and someone would need to keep her on track like remind her which car she should be in, which car she came in, etc.* **not able to learn how to play new games, even ones for young children** (5-6 year olds) that only have a couple of rules.  example: i bought ""taco, cat, goat, cheese, pizza"" which is a children's card game. even after playing several rounds she was unable to remember how to play or what the objective was, yet the kids picked it up quickly. she then opted to sit out from playing because she recognized she wasn't catching on (this is what always happens, but at least she tries). she also used to like puzzles but when i brought one for us all to do as a family she gave up pretty quickly and just started holding up single pieces and asking people if they know where it goes, which was very unproductive and not a normal thing when people are doing a puzzle as a group.* **everything is overwhelming to her**. she cannot find the time or willpower to sort through a pile of mail, make a christmas card even though she wants to send one out, etc. even though she is retired and doesn't do anything all day. she retired two years ago and literally has not accomplished anything or taken up any hobbies or anything. (and their house has a lot of clutter corners/piles and unfinished projects)* causes fights and confusion among family members because she will **offer to do something, then act like she didn't** (or vice versa - decline/refuse to do something then act like she never declined).   small personality changes  1. **strangely attached to things** and she never used to be that way. when i tried to throw out some of my old stuff i found, i later found that she had gone through the papers i had recycled and items i planned to donate and kept them. there was a bugs bunny stuffed animal that she put at the foot of her bed because it ""makes her happy when she sees it"", which is a pretty bizarre thing coming from her. she puts random cute stuffed animals around the house as decorations and she never would have done that before unless they had some kind of special significance.  2. i also think she has a **more ""jokey"" personality** than i ever remember. she seems to make jokes about everything, or interject brief funny commentary about things on tv, but they're never very funny, it's usually stuff she has said before, and sometimes it doesn't even make sense. maybe this is to compensate for not really being able to converse in other ways.3. **occasional strange fixations.** example -she wanted to buy venus brand razors but they had to be a certain kind, and she didn't know exactly how many she wanted, but it couldn't be too few or too many. we had to drive to 4 stores so she could settle on 5-pack of venus razors (3-pack was too few, 8-pack was too many -- even though she'd use them eventually and buying in bulk is a better value). in the past she would never do something like this, she'd likely just buy what was on sale and call it good. it was just weird.  i have a lot of examples and i've started keeping a list, but this is the main gist with a few examples. thanks in advance for any thoughts or suggestions you want to offer.",,0

"hello i live in the uk and my mother has been recently diagnosed with early stage alzheimer's. we are currently working with her to organise her life so she can live independently as long as possible. there are two areas we need a bit of help and advice in. 1: my mum currently lives independently with some help from her family with shopping etc. however we recognise the alzheimer's is a degenerative condition and therefore she will require day to day care at some point in the future. how have you guys introduced home care and what form has it taken? what care providers have you used? etc2: finances have recently become an issue as she has been the victim of multiple cold call scams. we have power of attorney and are currently in the processes of taking over her bank accounts so we can keep closer control. how have you guys minimised exposure to people trying to take advantage? what systems are there so my mum can have access to money for the day to day but exposure her self if she gives, for example, her card details to someone trying to rip her off (happened multiple times now). any advice would be much appreciated, even if its just links to good websites to look at. thanks!",,0

"**tl;dr:** grandma goes to an adult daycare during the weekdays and that helps a lot. dad's getting paid as a caregiver by the state (thanks to everyone who pointed out that this was a thing!) and we may be able to move into a new home! grandma's memory and logic skills are getting worse, but at least we'll be able to make her comfortable.every time i've posted here i feel like i'm being a bit of a downer ([1]( and [2]( respectively)! so i decided i'd like to throw in some good things that have been going on with my grandmother and my family's life in general.we've been managing. mom had the entire summer off which helped a lot, and we got my grandmother into a really nice adult daycare from about 10am-2pm, so she usually comes home exhausted and with some crayon drawings or gifts for good behavior. my mom hasn't put anything on the fridge since my brother and i were little, but we're starting to see it fill up again! we've also noticed a dramatic improvement in her general moods on most of the days that she goes to the adult daycare. if anyone else's loved ones need something to keep them occupied, i'd recommend looking into adult daycares if their insurance covers it. they come pick her up in the mornings and have a social worker that can help us in the process of possibly finding a permanent home for her if possible/necessary.dad's also started getting paid for being a caretaker (it's not much, but every little bit counts!), so i guess he's technically out of retirement in a way? i'm always surprised by how much he loves her (even moreso than his own biological mother, but that's another story for another day really). he told me that the reason he feels motivated to keep taking care of her is because of one time, while he and my mother just started dating, when he was deathly ill (like, almost literally). she nursed him back to health over two weeks with love and chicken bone broth. it's those little reminders of how much we love her that keep us going, really, even if she's not really the same person.i finished my first year of university as a transfer student and will be graduating this next year. i'm the editor of a club and will be responsible for designing fliers and banners and stuff, which is exciting! i'm also the ta for a class designed to acclimate incoming students to the culture and workload the university. i'm also going to be writing an undergraduate thesis that i may get to present to undergraduate research conferences!right now, mom, her cousin and his girlfriend are trying to convince grandma that her mother did indeed pass away eleven years ago (i'm not fluent in spanish by any means, but i can repeat ""tu mama fallecio once años pasado"" flawlessly now!) so things aren't always great, but things are ~~sloooowly~~ moving into a more positive place. if anyone actually read this entire thing, godspeed. even if you didn't, [here's a fun video]( cheers!!",,0

"i think many of us here have placed our hopes on something that would soothe, comfort or engage our loved ones with dementia.  i have learned, yet again, that dementia is a formidable foe.my mother is getting into the later stages of dementia and is in memory care.  she's always loved dolls and babies and i thought i would get her one of those weighted baby dolls to cuddle and coo over.  i read all the reviews.  i made my amazon purchase carefully, spending more money than one should for a doll.it arrived.  it was adorable.  it was huggable and sweet faced and i couldn't wait to see my mother's reaction.  oh, she loved it and exclaimed over it!  a true hallmark moment.   then, another resident came over to exclaim over the dear baby and its wee feet and soft skin.   she looked so wistfully at the doll in my mother's arms that i felt like santa with an empty toy sack.sigh. that resident has no real family.  i felt terrible.   it was sad.  i went home and bought another doll and waited for the amazon truck.i bet you think a hallmark moment is coming, don't you?i took the doll over to memory care this morning...cue the violins swelling...!ha.  the lady wanted nothing to do with the doll.  she was having a day and rejected it.  i said to the staff, it's okay, if someone else would enjoy it...sigh...they can have it.  the staff said baby dolls were much loved and someone would surely enjoy it.  they added my mother was crazy about hers.i checked in on my mom in her room.  no baby doll.  i asked, where is the baby doll? ""what doll?"" she asked in confusion.  i said, ""the new baby doll!"" as i started my search through the closet and under the bed.  my mom said, ""someone stole it""  just as i opened her nightstand to find the poor doll crammed in the lower drawer.   she was surprised to see it but told me to take it away, someone would want it and steal it!on my way out, i saw a resident had fallen asleep cuddling the other doll.  there's no hallmark moment in dementia.  there are things we can buy to make our loved ones' lives easier, but as i have learned, we can buy dolls or fidget blankets or memory marker boards or therapeutic mechanical cats and none of it will make a bit of difference to the person who has no idea where they are or who their family is or that they used to have hobbies and careers.all we can do is our best, but don't take it personally if the things you are trying aren't working!","The Doll, or How I Learned I Cannnot Buy a Dementia Fix",1

"first off, i am not for sure saying he has alzheimers, but i am pretty positive that's what it is, though i want a proper medical diagnosis. his uncle had it, his brother has it, and his dad seems to have it. my dad is almost 65 and for the past four/five years my mom and i have noticed a severe decline in his memory. he has many symptoms from strange behaviors, to motor function impairment, to speech impairment, to word recall, etc. however, he refuses to acknowledge his problem or get help. his doctor told him, ""as long as you're remembering how to get home, you're fine."" to me, this is pretty negligible as early intervention seems to be key. he has lost a lot of motor function in his fingers and can barely pick up coins or other small objects. this worries me because he recently got a foid card/gun. i don't fear him being violent towards me or my mom, but of an accident. sorry to ramble, i just really would appreciate any advice on how to get him to seek help.",How can I convince my dad to get diagnosed?,1
my dad (80 yrs old) was diagnosed with alzheimer's a few months ago.my parents decided to sell their house and move to a much smaller property. the new place is much easier to look after and is in a community block for old people. there is a warden on duty 24/7.ive been trying to help clear out the house as the new place is much smaller.dad has been a hoarder all his life but it seems to be getting worse.everything i try and throw away he will take out of the trash and put back in the house or try and find a use for. from little bits of rag to large items of furniture.at this rate they will be moving at the end of the month with all their belongings and end up living in a cluttered manner.any advice?i had another question.he has a brother (in his 70's) who lives in another country. historically they haven't been that close and apparently fell out over some minor thing a decade ago.they exchange christmas cards but that's about it.i get on well with my uncle and speak to him a few times a year.he always asks about dad.i was thinking of mentioning dad's diagnosis and state to my uncle. i don't know if this is a good idea but if i was in the same situation i would want my brother to know so we could have a chat before the alzheimer's took over too much.would my actions be seen as meddling?i suspect my dad would be upset and angry with me.dad is very much in denial and hasn't mentioned his diagnosis to me or my siblings. he knows i know and i think he asked mum to tell me.from my understanding at some undefined point in the future his verbal reasoning will diminish alot. i was hoping he would also see that and take the time to spend time with me and discuss it frankly and say anything now before it's too late.thanks,Dad (80) diagnosed recently.

"aromatic compounds such as those found in essential oils (via aromatherapy), ginseng, and marijuana have been studied in the treatment of alzheimer's disease.  these compounds because they are excellent hydrogen donor partially reverse oxidative and nitrostative damage done to critical receptors, transport systems, and enzymes needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, stable mood, sleep, social recognition, and alertness.  the following article explains the interplay between oxidative stress, amyloid beta proteins, and metal binding (especially copper and zinc) in alzheimer's disease.  a few points to add to the article: without oxidative stress there is no amyloid, amyloid by attracting metals such as copper and zinc can contribute to this stress but is not needed for this stress, and once copper and zinc are entombed in amyloid plaques they no longer do any damage.  anti-amyloid drugs that target plaques have made no difference in the disease and anti-amyloid drugs that target amyloid oligomers only make a difference in those with the apoe4 gene(s) who have higher levels of amyloid oligomers than those without the gene or genes.  so without further explanation here are some key findings of the research: # designing alzheimer's therapies at the molecular level*overview of a rational strategy for designing compact aromatic molecules with multiple reactivities against pathological factors found in the alzheimer's disease-affected brain and the chemical series studied in this work.*  *sometimes the most complex problems actually have very simple solutions. a group of south korean researchers reported an efficient and effective redox-based strategy for incorporating multiple functions into simple molecular reagents against neurodegenerative disorders. the team developed redox-active aromatic molecular reagents with a simple structural composition that can simultaneously target and modulate various pathogenic factors in complex neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer’s disease.*  *a number of pathogenic elements such as reactive oxygen species, amyloid-beta, and metal ions have been suggested as potential causes of alzheimer’s disease. each element itself can lead to alzheimer’s disease, but interactions between them may also aggravate the patient’s condition or interfere with the appropriate clinical care.**for example, when interacting with amyloid-beta, metal ions foster the aggregation and accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides that can induce oxidative stress and toxicity in the brain and lead to neurodegeneration.* *because these pathogenic factors of alzheimer’s disease are intertwined, developing therapeutic agents that are capable of simultaneously regulating metal ion dyshomeostasis, amyloid-beta agglutination, and oxidative stress responses remains a key to halting the progression of the disease.**professor lim said, “this strategy is straightforward, time-saving, and cost-effective, and its effect is significant. we are excited to help enable the advancement of new therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders, which can improve the lives of so many patients.”*[***",Aromatic Compounds in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,1

"my dad's memory has been on the decline for several years. his friend called me on monday and dropped the bomb that he has been out of work for 6+ weeks, has been messing up little jobs that she gives him (small landscaping jobs - he was supposed to remove tree stumps but ripped out a customer's landscape lighting against their wishes!). basically he has completely run out of money, but he won't tell me. it got so bad that his phone was turned off and there's a $600 bill to turn it back on, his electric was turned off for several days until his friend paid the bill, and his water was turned off.  i think this issue is a combo of him not having money and him not remembering and not being able to work because of his bad memory. he has extra vehicles and plots of land. he, however, will not actually sell anything. i think it's almost like a hoarding situation where he's attached and can't let go. talking about his finances is an uphill battle and he will not share his information. he's so prideful and private, and honestly probably embarrassed that he is in this position. i'm not interested in shaming him, i just want to solve this problem. does anyone have any tips with how to even deal with this? i feel awful because my dad has helped me so much, i do not want him sitting at home without electricity and water! but he won't accept help. do i force my help on him and just go through his stuff and find the account numbers and what not? this may be unethical. or do i try to gently and slowly get him to let me help by talking to him about his feelings/what's going on? thanks in advance!",Dad who is 61 with undiagnosed early dementia will not accept my (26F) help and is not paying his bills,1

"hi everyone, i'm new to this subreddit, so i apologize if this topic has come up already. but i'm in desperate need for help. my mom, who is 71, almost 72, has shown signs of dementia i'd say as early as 60 years old. it was very minor back then, but i'd say in the last 2-4 years, it's gotten significantly worse. my mom is in complete denial about it and/or is just completely scared. she watched her own mom succumb to the disease 27 years ago. it was never diagnosed as alzheimer, although i've had my doubts that she might have be misdiagnosed. either way, she watched her own mother go through it and i can tell she is terrified of it happening to her. but that's the problem. it is happening to her. she is somewhat aware of it and admits that it's a problem, but only ""when she's stressed"". otherwise, she thinks she's totally fine. one of my sisters, my dad and myself had a gentle ""intervention"" with her 2 years ago which got her to go to a neurologist. she did have a mri to rule out any kind of strokes or any signs of possible alzheimer's. according to her, everything came back normal. however, we can't fully trust that she told us everything truthfully because part of the appointment she was alone and it wasn't until later that my dad finally joined. my sister (the one at the intervention) brought it up to her again last night and said that my mom was on the defensive almost immediately and got really mad/upset and kicked her out of her room. do any of you have any suggestions to help us convince her to go back to the doctor's? are there any treatments such as medications, therapies, etc she could try that might help? i know there is no cure and most alzheimer medications only help in prolonging the onset of more symptoms, but don't stop them completely. are medications out of the question since it hasn't been diagnosed as alzheimer? *i should describe her symptoms: she has excellent long term memory. like scary good. but her short term memory seems so minimal. she's gotten to the point where she asks us the same questions multiple times in one day. sometimes within minutes of each other. she has to leave notes around the house to remind her of things constantly. she will completely forget conversations and will adamantly deny things, despite me having evidence (example, she left a voicemail on my phone and when i played it for her, she claimed that wasn't her and someone was impersonating her). and don't get me started on the repeated stories. she hasn't lost the ability to do activities of daily living, and she's still able to drive, however, she's too uncomfortable to drive anywhere outside of her own town. her personality has changed too. she's almost reclusive and her once social life as dwindled down to 1 solid friend/neighbor and maybe a handful of other people she occasionally interacts with. she's become very judgmental and kind of angry with everyone but especially to her kids. i understand that everyone can suffer from the repeated story syndrome. i'm super guilty of it too, especially with mommy brain. but this is so much different from that. please help!!",i need help convincing my mom to seek help,1

"one day i was in ikea looking for a good sofa to jerk off on. i hopped on each sofa and took my dick out and started to stroke it. i had my favorite porn playing in the background(not revealing what it was because it's kinda weird). i went up and down my cock until i was ready to blow my load. i managed to stop before the floodgates broke loose. the store wasn't very busy this day so i didn’t get kicked out. after my session, i went to the restaurant inside ikea and had some famous swedish meatballs. the meatballs were subpar and gave me a slightly upset stomach. i didn’t think much of it, and i went back to shopping. i sat on the couch beat my meat and got off. this routine went on for a while because had high requirements for my couch. it had to be under 5000 dollars and the seat had to be comfortable for my bottom. it couldn’t be too prickly or too cold. after hours of wanking, i finally settled on a couch. the sofa was perfect. the seat was made out of smooth and thick fabric. i decided that i should reward myself and let it all out. it turns out that a lot of teasing can weaken a man’s penis and allow for a quick and far cumshot. i got cum all over the floor and the table that was sitting in front of the sofa. at this point, i had mixed emotions. i did not know if i should be proud f such a large cumshot or if i should be ashamed for making such a mess. the store was nearly abandoned, but one old couple walked by as i pulled my pants up. they saw the mess that i had made but did not assume that the white liquid was cum. the couple called management over to clean the mess because the couple wanted to buy the sofa as well. a couple workers came over to clean it up and asked what had spilled. i beat around the bush until the workers noticed that there were no cups or trash cans present near the sofa. then one of the employees had a disgusted look on their face. the employees excused themselves to the corner of one aisle and had a discussion. the came back and asked, “sir is this your cum”. i was young and scared so i responded yes. then the employee ran out and got the entire staff into the store. they got gloves and a mask and cleaned it all up. then the manager came and checked the security camera footage. there i was with my phone on a porn website and beating my meat hard. the manager looked deeper into the camera footage and found that i had sat on all the couches butt-naked and jerked off. to make matters worse, one of the couches i had fapped on had a small turd on it that came from my meatballs earlier. the manager said that i had to pay for all the damn couches and that i was banned from all ikeas. i was invited to his office to discuss plans to pay off the couches. the bill was over 200k dollars since i sat on many couches and had to pay numerous fines. i did not have that kind of money available so, the manager made me pay 50k up front and took some land i owned to get the rest of my money. on the bright side, i get to keep all the couches that i sat on. my house is not that big and cannot hold that many couches so i had to get rid of them all.",Ikea management not caring enough,1

"this has been going on for a few months now. my mom (turning 65 this year) told me that she's been having concerns about her memory recently, and even set up an appointment with a neurologist to address this. i haven't heard anything about the appointment and her demeanor hasn't changed, so i don't think anything came of it. another doctor suspected her concerns could be due to a b-12 deficiency, and after taking b-12 injections for a while, i thought the issue could be resolved. but then two weeks ago or so she re-expressed these concerns while watching a special about dementia on tv, and my feelings have come back full force. she tells me that she's bothered by how she sometimes can't retrieve the names of things, including people. i asked if it's just normal ""tip of my tongue"" type stuff, and she says it doesn't feel that way. i've noticed that she's been more easily agitated/irritated these last few years as well. multiple times a day, i'll be going about my day and then something, anything, will remind me of dementia and all these depressing thoughts and feelings will just wash over me. i'm only 21, so i feel way too young to be dealing with any of this. i'm hyper-aware of everything my mom says and does, and i know this isn't healthy. any tiny behavior that could indicate some sort of memory or cognitive slip-up gets flagged, despite the fact that myself and other people in my family have similar slip-ups on a regular basis and i don't think they bothered me when coming from my mom in the past. i feel like they might be more frequent now, but i have no way of knowing for sure since i acknowledge that my fear could be distorting the picture significantly. pros for my mom: she's highly educated (phd), works in a demanding and intellectually stimulating (but stressful...) position, she eats plenty of fruits and vegetables and has an overall healthy diet, she enjoys puzzles like sudoku and reads a lot for fun. her side of the family doesn't seem to have a history of alzheimer's or dementia. her father was very sharp when he died and her mom was a little ""eccentric"", but nothing too disabling (she died in her 80's). cons: she has a lot of abdominal fat (type 2 diabetes, ""apple"" body shape), some high inflammation markers that haven't been reigned in, although she claims they don't cause symptoms (autoimmune issues run in my family), her job keeps her fairly sedentary, and she deals with a lot of stress.  i bought the book ""the end of alzheimer's"" by doctor bredesen and have been urging her to read it. she already takes some supplements but i've been working on a list of others i'd like her to take. the only way that i can feel somewhat hopeful and upbeat is by telling myself that even if she's in the very early stages of cognitive decline, all of this could be halted or even reversed. my paternal grandma has dementia and lives nearby, and watching her decline has been so traumatic for everyone. clearly this is where the majority of my fear comes from. her body is fairly resilient, but her mind is gone. i've seen how ugly dementia can be, and her case isn't even as severe as it can get. if either of my parents had to experience that, i don't know how i'd survive it. i already struggle with depression, and this would be the final nail in the coffin. i don't want to just let go and live in the moment. fuck that. i want to feel like there's *something* i can do to prevent my parents from dying in one of the most horrible ways imaginable.",I've been losing sleep at night ever since my mom told me about her memory concerns.

"i'm posting this 10% to vent, 90% for advice.  and i have a habit of analyzing things from a cool, calculating perspective......but don't let that make you think i don't love my father.  i think in this calculating way to keep myself from breaking down and crying.i feel like my father is --this-- close to being shipped off to a nursing home.  on the one hand, i feel that it will be necessary, but on the other hand, it seems like such a waste, since he is still able to enjoy many parts of his life.  maybe there's some better way.a little background:  dad and i are basically best friends.  we've always spent multiple days per week together (even while living an hour's drive apart), and we've always had similar interests and wanted to do the same things together.he is 81, has some physical health issues but they seem to all be under control.  i know these things are hard to predict, but i expect his brain to (further) fail before his body does.  and.......i hate to hear myself say this......i think it would be for the best if somehow his body could fail before his mind fully tortures him.in my non-professional opinion, his dementia is at state 6.  he knows who his family members are, most of the time.....except when it's night.  he can bathe, dress, and eat, with careful supervision.  he cannot cook, clean, or manage his finances in any way.he has a long-term live-in girlfriend who has now become his primary caretaker by default.  she is cold and unkind, and is never willing to have a discussion about her way of doing things......but on the other hand, her way is the right way about 90% of the time, which is pretty good.  she takes him to all of his doctor's appointments, follows (most of) the doctors' recommendations, and takes care of both his house (cleaning, gardening, light maintenance) as well as all of his basic needs (food, bathing, laundry).  she manages his money and keeps the bills paid and the house stocked with groceries.  by day, dad and i can get in the car and go for long rides, and while we don't do all the things we used to do (he gets bad anxiety in large retail environments, always feels cold outside even if it's slightly chilly), we're still able to do quite a lot-----we spend a lot of time driving around in the car, he can handle small, simple, quiet restaurants, he can handle a quick trip to a convenience store if i need to buy a thing or two.  he can carry on a simple, pleasant conversation with waitstaff and gas station clerks (most of the time).by night, he's someone else.  he gets out of bed to urinate every ten minutes non-stop for several hours, often getting confused in the bathroom and needing help.  then he sleeps for a couple of hours or so.  then he gets up and wanders around the house, slamming doors and yelling, says the most cruel, irrational and nasty things you can imagine (his great vocabulary and wit have stayed with him, for better or worse), and makes threats.  at night, he suddenly refers to his girlfriend as ""the staff"" and thinks she's there to work for him in some way.he hasn't quite fully attacked his girlfriend yet, but it's gotten pretty close.  he's threatened to kill her.  he's shoved and bruised her.  she's terrified of him at night.  since he only sleeps for a couple of hours per night, that's all the sleep she's been getting as well.  this is obviously an unsustainable situation that needs to stop before it gets worse.i just spent one with with him, day and night, and can confirm that everything the girlfriend says is true.the girlfriend said that it's probably time for me to find a home for him, and sadly, i agree.by day, he doesn't remember any of the things at night.  when he's told what he did, he feels terrible about it, and says ""what the hell is happening to me? i must be losing my mind"" and makes it very clear that he doesn't want to hurt anyone, and is terrified at the possibility of hurting and/or losing his girlfriend.  he's too wealthy to get medicaid, but very likely too poor to afford in-home care for very long.  he has a little money in the bank (somewhere in the tens of thousands), but long ago put his girlfriend's name on his bank account.  (which means she has the full legal right to drain the account for herself if she wants.)   his main asset is his paid-for house.  i suppose it's likely the house will have to be sold off to pay for his care.i feel i will have to go to the courts to get control of my father and his affairs. his girlfriend will certainly feel insulted and offended, and there's a good chance that will drive her away entirely. while that will be her choice and not mine, i'll feel bad if my father loses her.  tldr version:  \--dad is a mostly functional human being by day  \--dad is so dysfunctional at night that he's a danger to himself and others, especially his smaller-than-him, also-old girlfriend. and he doesn't sleep at night so she can't sleep either\--while i'm no doctor, i believe the medical options to get him to sleep at night have already been exhausted\--i don't think he can afford an all-night caregiver at home, at least not for long, and even if he can, his girlfriend will find something not to like and will cause problems\--it seems like such a cruel thing to take a man who's fairly manageable for 2/3 of the day, and toss him in the nursing home because he's a monster for 1/3 of the day\--while i have a flexible schedule, i'm only able to spend about 10-15 hours per week with him, maybe even double that but not much more\--i wonder if there's some kind ""adult night care"" place instead of adult day care. i've looked at adult day care and he can probably afford it, but all that would do is give his girlfriend a break to nap and clean up the house. he'd still be a threat at night","Father is mostly OK by day, but an aggressive terror at night",1

"my dad was diagnosed with dementia a year ago but shit has gone downhill suddenly and a lot has happened in the last two months. my niece and i have fallen into the position of caring for him from two different cities. i decided to start doing some personal writing about it on my blog. for reddit purposes, i'm copy/pasting. also i think all of you would understand it better than publishing it on facebook with people i know but don't really want to hear from. here's my first post...thanks for reading.&amp;#x200b;a few days after thanksgiving, my dad ran away from my niece’s home where he was staying after running away from his home in kentucky. he wandered the streets for a few hours until my niece found him and tried to take him home. unfortunately, his dementia has progressed to include “behavioral disturbances,” a very clinical way to name uncontrollable emotional — often violent — outbursts. he threatened to hurt my niece or smash the windows. on their way to the local hospital, he ran away again.throughout his life, running away has always been the ultimate solution. he has run away from his marriages. he has run away from his children. he has run away from his landlords. he has run away from his jobs.said another way: my dad has been trying to escape his own life.throughout my childhood, i can remember a lot of the excuses for leaving jobs. they usually revolved around broken promises; the job was harder than they said, a promotion was not coming around the corner, employee housing was not available after all. his most recent job, which he took at age 71 in early 2021, wasn’t the right fit because he didn’t need “fat women” telling him how to drive — he had driven professionally since the 1970s.he had the job for three weeks before quitting. he probably didn’t need it anyway.the excuses for leaving other things – women, children, landlords – were similar and sometimes more abstract. he left us in las vegas in the ’90s because the gambling was too much. he left other women because they were too controlling or whatever. sometimes he would just wave his hand at a problem and say “naaaaah” and that’s all it would take.he has been in the hospital on a legal hold since nov. 28. it occurred to me that he is technically homeless now. he literally has nowhere else to run. he’s scared. he’s sad. he’s suicidal.we’re a few days away from getting him into a group home. the family feels a deep sense of foreboding. what if he doesn’t like this place? what if he finds an excuse to hate it? what if he runs away again? everyone has asked the same questions.two months ago he finally said he was fed up with his home life in kentucky. he didn’t like how his wife was treating him. he had threatened her a few times, too. he packed up a barely functioning 2007 honda odyssey and started driving around on his way to las vegas. he got lost. went home. and tried again the next day.he made it to new mexico where my brother and niece tried to meet him. he forgot he was meeting them. the new mexico state police found him instead. my brother and niece took him home to las vegas.in las vegas, he stayed with my brother and sister-in-law for a week or so. but he didn’t like their house, he said it was too loud. he made threats there too and bailed again. this time my niece picked him up at a gas station and took him in. he liked it better there. for a time.when i visited during thanksgiving, my dad pulled me aside several times to discuss his plans to escape. he grew paranoid people would steal his money. this is apparently super common with dementia victims. once the gate broke on the gated community, he found a way to escape. that’s when my niece picked him. full circle.i never put the escape mentality together until now. my brothers have always thought of it the same way. as a kid it felt like one-offs; often easily justified to a pre-teen. as an adult, now i see it as an underlying theme.where does it come from? a feeling of rebellion? the ultimate expression of independence?it’s fascinating though. because his need to run, to be free, to escape, has been his ultimate prison.when he runs from marriages, it brings along alimony. when he runs from children, it generates court-ordered child support. and when he runs from that responsibility, it creates mountains of debt. when he runs from landlords, it destroys his credit. when he runs from jobs, it leaves him impoverished.there is no money to steal from him. and if there was, it would already be spoken for.he built a prison of bad choices. there is no way to truly run away from six wives and five children. most of us are still here. but now he has dementia. and he’s locked inside his own brain; a place he can never escape from. the walls will just close in tighter every day until they crush him.it’s inescapable.",My dad has been trying to escape his whole life,1

"my mom's short-term memory has been declining for about five years. i'm 20 now, and my mom is 63, but i remember that she would have little lapses in my high school days such as when i'd need to be picked up from school. i know there were more tiny things, but i can't recall any more examples. since i left for college, she has lived alone, and my siblings don't live near her, so most of our observation has come from breaks and holidays.two christmases ago, i got her a sweatshirt. she tried it on, said it was a bit small, and put it on the back of a chair. the next day, she picked it up and asked whose it was, and my siblings and i told her that it was her present. she tried it on again and had the same reaction, as if it were the first time she were trying it on. this was the first time something more substantial seemed to be completely gone from her memory (but incidents like this are still few and far between).towards the beginning of this year, there were a couple times that i came home from school for a weekend, and i had called her in advance and told her when i'd be coming. when she got home from work and i was there, she asked if she knew i was coming home.a lot of times she doesn't remember details well the first time unless it's something particularly extraordinary or shocking. it often takes her at least two to three times of hearing something before she remembers it, but sometimes my siblings and/or i will repeat the same information 20+ times until she remembers. some examples of things that she has asked about or forgotten multiple times during the time i've been home this winter break: the gender of my pregnant cousin's baby, the gender and name of the dog my sister just got, who duchess is (my roommate's cat, and i talk about her frequently), whether i've watched a madea christmas, and when i'm picking my partner up from the airport.i know it'd be best to bring these concerns to a doctor, but i don't think she's ready to accept that it could be something serious. when she knows she's forgotten something, she usually gives an alternate reason for forgetting (it's winter, i told her after dark, etc.). my sister suggested she visit a doctor, and she said she was just having empty nest syndrome.this got a bit long, but is this similar to anyone's experience of alzheimer's in its early stages? she doesn't seem to have any other concerning behavior besides short-term memory loss (i.e. no issues with motor skills or anything of the sort). does this look like any other condition besides alzheimer's, or maybe even normal age-related issues?",Does this sound like Alzheimer's onset?,1
"i don't even know where to begin. my dad (76) has dementia. i finally made the hardest decision to place him in memory care. i researched facilities, visited and looked for signs of abuse, got a list of questions to ask, and got a new job to afford to supplement his savings. i thought i found the perfect fit. the nurse that came to do his assessment agreed that they would be a good fit. i moved him in and started a three-month-long nightmare. **tldr**: the people who were supposed to help me and give my dad the care that i could not provide kicked him out with no notice, and now he has nowhere safe to live. he was baker acted (in fl) for behavior issues within the first month. the police took him to a facility that didn't know how to manage dementia patients and that facility dropped him off in the er after the mandatory 72hrs. he was in the hospital for days, drugged up and nonresponsive because no medical information was shared with the hospital, and i was not told he was admitted.by the second month, they started complaining about his hygiene. he was not bathing and refused to let them bathe him. they ""tried everything."" by the third month, they were calling me daily, at all hours, complaining about his ""violent"" and ""aggressive"" behaviors. i became anxious every time my phone rang (11pm, 1am, 3am, 6am, 8am). they also sent him to the er multiple times for a ""time out"" and so that the hospital could verify it wasn't a uti. the medical bills are still rolling in. (side note, who the f\*ck in the united states sends people to the er as a time out??? that's not sustainable or affordable for anyone! and three visits in one month at that?!)on may 11th, i got a phone call at 10am that they were discharging my dad and i had three days to remove him and his belongings, which is usually a 45-day notice. they would also not be refunding the remainder of the month, they would not be returning my community fee, and we are blackballed from moving to any of their sister properties in our city (there are 7 of them, and 5 of them have memory care). the amount of fear, anger, stress, anxiety, frustration, and all the other negative feelings i have? i am distraught and am not medicated enough for this. the facility was supposed to help me find a new home for him, and every place they recommended has no availability. i reached out to my eap through work, and they found some facilities. i also reached out to ""a place for mom"" to get more help. i reached out to prior facilities that i toured, and they either have no availability, or he needs to be admitted into the hospital to be medicated. i don't know where i'm going with this post. i guess i just want to let you all know that memory care facilities will sell you a dream and give you a nightmare. i thought my biggest issues would be elder abuse and covid-19. turns out, it's a lack of training, sharing resources between assisted living and memory care with no additional training, resource shortages in caregiving, and no psychiatrists on site. now my poor, miserable, ""violent"" father doesn't know what is going on, has been manhandled by police and staff more times than i could possibly know, and has no place safe to go. i can't help but feel like this was all my fault. maybe he would have been better at home? maybe i should tell my husband adios and live with my dad full time? maybe i should have vetted the organization more? maybe i needed to spend $7000 a month or more instead of the ""deal"" of $5000? my dad turned 76 on may 14th. instead of spending his birthday surrounded by family and friends, he spent it in a geriatric psych ward that i placed him in. the hospital staff says he's so gentle and kind. i hate this.",Memory Care has failed me,1

"i just found out about this sub tonight. basically, i'm wondering if there's some sort of underlying reason for my dad's recent behaviour and how, or if, we can help him.as background, my father first began exhibiting symptoms of dementia around six or seven years ago. he refused to seek medical treatment despite our strong urging. our local physicians have only been aware of his condition for the past year.i moved back home to our small town after finishing school to help my mother and him. the three of us live in our family home, which we've owned for decades.in the past few weeks, dad has been waking up in the middle of the night - typically around 2 or 3 in the morning - and making loud noises, waking up the rest of the house. when asked what he's doing, he says he's going home. (he says this while standing in the bedroom where he's slept for the past 20+ years in the home he owns.)last night, he wandered out of the house and spent the rest of the night walking around town - we went searching for him and only found him at about 6 a.m.it's the third time in the last four nights that he's done this.in the evenings, he sundowns quite badly. he keeps asking, ""are we going home tomorrow?"" or ""where are we right now?"" or ""where are we going to sleep?""when we answer the question, he gets visibly agitated - he's so convinced that he's not at home that he swears and shouts and us when we try to explain, or when we ask him questions about why he thinks he's somewhere else or where he thinks he is.the three of us are getting maybe an hour of sleep a night if we're lucky. it's starting to affect my mother and i at our work - i've been unable to finish all my work and my bosses are breathing down my neck.we have looked into getting respite workers to come in and help take care of him, but they are simply not available where we live.we've got no idea what to do next. where to we go from here?",My dad is trying to leave our house during the wee hours of the morning - how can we help him/get him to stop?,1
"i've always been closer to my dad then mom. he is 68 years old and has been dealing with his dementia for about 7-9 years now. i'm a pretty bad son and have gotten into lots of trouble i wish i didn't and feel terrible that i can barely even take care of myself let a lone him. i've been selfish and have caused my family, on top of myself, a lot of problems because of poor decision making. he's starting to get real bad in the sense that i know no matter what i ask him, he won't know. restaurants we visited, games we played, directions to someplace, even technical things like measurement conversions, car info, etc. he graduated with masters from ohio state and case and has always been, at least in my opinion, the smartest person i know. i consider myself very intelligent and well spoken however he's probably responsible for most of what i know. even if i spent year reading and learning a topic, it was because i was inspired or interested by him in the first place. amateur radio, computers, racing cars, flying plans, anything. anyways, is it bad that i feel like he has accepted what is happening to him and i don't want him to? i'm not sure if is ok with this situation or not, but it sure seems to me like he is. is it bad of my that i don't want this? i don't want him to be okay with this. because i'm not. i want him to be upset and looking for answers / ways to help or deal with this. not just, ok this is what it is i'm just going to live out my life. part of me feels that deep down this is upsetting to him but he certainly doesn't show it. he doesn't get angry or sad, or at least let it show, about the problem. he certainly gets angry now over conversations, when he was the least angry / confrontational person i ever knew growing up. now, he angers easily. but it certainly isn't over his condition. i don't know what i expect, but i don't want him to just be okay with it and live out his life. is this wrong of me to feel/ think like that? i hate that i can't say, hey dad, remember those 12 years of diablo/ world of warcraft? remember that street race you won? remember when you took me xxx / we tried xxx? i don't want to have to pander down to him and treat him like i little kid. i saw on the front page of reddit a few days ago about a guy who has an older grandpa who  has this, and he was given much praise about how he takes legos over to him and they sort them by color / build  them. i don't want to do that. i want to live being able to do stuff with him and create memories and not spend my time just treating him like he has a major problem. every one , or at least most people i hear about, are dealing with this with this grand parents. this is my dad. he isn't even 70! i was born later then most of my friends. most of my friends have successful healthy parents who are in late 40's , mid 50s. why did i roll super older parents with no living grandparents to ever meet? i guess what i'm saying is, i don't want the dynamic that front page kid had with his grand father. i want a normal one. and i want him to feel upset that he can't have that normal dynamic with me anymore. is this wrong of me?",Acceptance question,1
"tl/dr mom came 100 miles to deliver candy after all, we declined a visit. they visited 89 year old aunt instead.well, she couldn't just let it go. while the conversation seemed somewhat productive yesterday, today she was dead set on delivering easter candy to her grandkids, despite our state's stay at home orders, despite the 100 mile drive, and despite us telling them that we are not having anyone inside our house.today we receive locator notifications that they were on their way into town and we had not heard from them. when they got within a mile, they called and asked if they could stop in. my husband told them leave it on the porch and they may not come inside. (there is always that added stress of elderly needing a bathroom and it being an emergency, but not today. not on my watch!)i intervened from work telling him to lock the garage door (they have an opener but no key) and get the kids so they don't open the door, but allow them to speak on the phone through the front window.my husband was 110% annoyed and i was torn between setting the tone of not rewarding their bad behavior and kindness since she will not retain any lesson intended by not allowing a visual window visit.i prepared my kids and husband with an easy excuse of having to get back to a video conference call for school to prevent them from staying too long and the inevitable emergency bathroom need.in the end, they dropped off the package, said happy easter at the window and left. this was after a half hour of sitting at the school parking lot trying to prepare the cards for my youngest's birthday and easter for both of my girls. so, what was in the package after all of the hoopla?4 cards, 4 envelopes, none signed, no cards inside their envelopes, no gift for the youngest's birthday, and some easter candy.my husband sent me these pictures to vent his disbelief: much ado about nothing so, yes they came, and yes they left. it was uneventful.however...after they left, the locator showed them going in the wrong direction! they were headed to the other side of town and they have now been at an 89 year old aunt's house for over an hour.i can't help but wonder if she let them in to be polite, or if she was just as oblivious as they are. i wonder if she was afraid when they said they were coming to visit but didn't have the assertiveness to tell them to stay away. i wonder if my mother told her version of the truth and said she had been staying home, when in reality, they have not spent more than 2 days in a row at home since this started. they have been to multiple grocery stores every couple of days, yet still ordering takeout frequently - when they never used to spend much eating out at all. they have even visited 2 separate walmarts in 2 separate counties on the same day. my mother cannot sit the f#$k down and stay at home. she is anxious and agitated naturally, with nervous energy coursing through her body. the fact that they are supposed to stay at home is festering in her and driving her out in public more than she would have if there were no orders.but, they are adults. unfortunately, he won't stand his ground and do what is needed to protect themselves and others. she has always worn the pants in the family and now it is the inmate running the asylum.",Mom and the Easter candy - an update,1

"i(28m)was raised by my grandparents and lived with them( here in alabama) until i was 25(brief stints living away before then) as a child i would have nightmares of my grandfather(55 at time of passing, he married my grandma when my mom was 9 making him my step grandfather) passing and only ever began to cry when i thought about the death of one of them. just before the start of covid my grandfather offered to use his va loan to buy a house big enough to accommodate my girlfriend and i and her two kids as well as them and the dog they've had since i was 17 however due to the tumultuous nature of the housing market post covid we couldn't find anything to accommodate my grandmother's(family with dementia 71) physical needs as well as my s/os needs(mainly based around her(36f) kids(12f &amp; 9m) needs like staying in that school system. fast forward to december of last year, my grandfather passed away in a horrible way that could have been preventable had i been more aware of the signs(went septic due to gallbladder disease) and died alone in the selma hospital(which kills me even now to type). i had roughly 6 minutes to greave before the reality set in on how bad my grandmother's dementia was. my mom initially agreed to travel back(in the evening) and forth(mornings) from her own home to my grandparents so she could remain in a familiar environment. this lasted for 1 month to the day until my grandmother had a sundown event to which my mom responded by having her hauled to the hospital and attempted to have her admitted the next morning which she didn't meet their criteria for. the next weekend right after my 1st negative covid test she asked me to watch her for 4 hours only to tell me after the fact that she refuses to take care of her anymore. my grandmother has now been with me for  about 2 full months and it's all gone to shit. my significant other can't handle the stress(ers) dementia has brought in. my grandmother had to go from living in a 2900 square foot home with just my old man and their dog to a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 kids and an adult that are strangers to her almost even without the dementia. i'm trying to get their old home sold to give myself some financial wiggle room as they were still paying on it. in just the last 2 months on a 40k annual i've shelled out between 6 and 9k in expenses including slight renovations to help the value of the house. i sit now at my storage facility almost 2 hours away from their home and about 5 minutes from my apartment where she is sleeping with the kids and my s/o home while this moving crew(we have no extended family really and my mom hasn't been much help as our relationship was poor even before my grandfather passed) i want badly to get back i to therapy which i'd started before he passed so unexpectedly but i hate dealing with someone who simply sympathizes and ""understands"" i need the kind of answers that will help me grow and get past childhood issues and now his trauma. meanwhile i'm praying i can honor his memory to ""take care of his wife and helps dog"" since there was no living will. all i have now is her, the dog, and poa but due to the dogs abused living before my grandparents rescued him he's always been possessive over them. he recently bit my s/o again and she wants him removed from the home. which is the best short term solution but i know it'll cause further decline. i was overwhelmed before i caught covid and now i feel like i'm either about to just barely hold it together or lose everything and end up on a 72 hour hold. no help, no non busy friends, no family able to help regularly. f*** man why did he have to die alone, the man upstairs can be so cruel.",Barely keeping it together,1

"my family is currently caring for an uncle who was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia over a year ago. when we first noticed the changes we took him to a neurologist who did various brainscans and things as well as other tests and diagnosed him as having this type of dementia.for quite some time now my uncle hasn't really been able to communicate with you, outside of the occasional ""yes/no"" answers you're lucky to get one word if you ask him something, no full sentences or anything. our primary care doctor recently set up an appointment to a psychologist for him. from what i could gather reading online a psychologist is usually the person who can tell how ""far"" along the disease is and the stages and is meant to help the families prepare for how things will get and what to expect, etc. we get there and after the doctor started to try and talk to him but he wasn't really responding to the doctor's questions he literally asked us why we even brought him there? like it was some huge inconvenience or something or that we shouldn't have even bothered (there was literally no other people there waiting to be seen or anything). we explained he had dementia and he came back at us and said ""how do you know that?"" while we told him that we had seen a neurologist and everything who had did tests and told us that he had frontotemporal dementia. then he badgered us about not bringing these ""tests"" with us (we had no idea we needed to, his office did not call or tell us to bring anything). to top it off the last things he said was that he had never seen someone like this and that dementia doesn't affect the ability to talk. after he said that i was completely floored, anyone with google can see that language and communication is very much a part of what dementia affects and something that will eventually get harder on the person to do. sorry i just needed to vent this out, i still can't believe someone like that is a doctor, let alone running a business that hasn't went under. we plan to tell our primary doctor what happened and to never go back there to see him, even though he made another appointment in the end. &amp;#x200b;",Had one of the worst experiences with a doctor today.,1

"hello r/dementia!i am from austria, and i have a degreee in what is called ""socialcare with main focus on eldery care"" (loosely translated). people with my degree get a two year training in nursing (which means i am basically trained for everything that contains eating, mobilisation, cleaning, observing, incontinence, reacting in emergency situations, giving medication and a lot more), with an extra focus on the eldery and the diseases that come with old age - diabetes, strokes, arthritis, and especially, dementia. i am trained in different theories about dementia, i know the pure medical definition, i am trained in validation by naomi feil and other approaches of the disease, like the tree-worlds-model from switzerland. we learn how to understand dementia-patients and how to support them on their way, and make it easier. i am well aware that many of those who care for their relatives have no clue of how to deal with difficult behaviour. how should they if nobody told them? dementia is hard for those who have it, but also very hard for the wifes or husbands, for the kids and grandkids that care for dementia patients. that's why i wanted to make an ama. you can ask me anything, on the medical side, but also on how to deal with different aspects of the disease and how to deal with diffucult behaviour. i can also give insights on what may cause some of the strange things dementia patients do.i will try to explain everything as good as i can.

"hi all,first time posting so please be kind :-) my father is 62 and for the last 3 years i’ve noticed his mental state steadily declining, more so in the last year or so. it all started when he made me a cup of coffee in one of my kids sippy-cups, when i commented on this he then made a cold cup of coffee in a normal cup. the whole scenario was bizarre and it was clear he was flustered and confused. since then it’s been a string of incidents; he gets stuck driving around roundabouts, forgets where he’s going on a motorway and panics, has caused a handful of minor incidents at his work, couldn’t tell you who was prime minister or president, and generally has days where he’s very withdrawn in himself, barely talking and asking odd questions when he does (e.g at christmas he asked me if the lights in my kitchen ceiling were sprinklers) he has seen a doctor, who referred him to the memory clinic, he failed his memory test quite impressively bless him and now the next step is a ct scan and then referral back to the memory clinic for diagnosis. he’s accepting that his mind isn’t what it used to be, but he’s desperately sad about it, as we all are, but i’m glad he is seeking help now and not further down the line. his short term memory is shot, worse on bad days, good days are still occurring for now. he’s not had a definitive diagnosis yet, and i’ve not much support as my partner is all “you never know it might be nothing” but that kind of dismissive attitude isn’t helpful at all when the truth of the situation is that i don’t know how it could be anything else less serious. how can this have any other outcome 😔 he feels too young to be disappearing already. i had to show him how to write a christmas card this year.... i’m sorry for the long post. my heart is breaking before we even know for sure. i guess my question is: how many of you knew in advance of an official diagnosis? could my gut instinct be wrong? i feel i have no where to turn. my sister is just coming to accept the situation and is not coping well, my mum is the same, though she won’t show her emotions. i feel very alone","Worried about my father, would love others experiences and opinions",1

"i live in las vegas, my mother is in georgia.  this is the fourth visit. my mother and i had no relationship, and now we do. i knew when she started calling me last summer and saying things like, ""god bless you"" i knew things were serious.this visit i came out to see an attorney and get advanced medical directive, power of attorney, and a will done.  that happened yesterday afternoon. after months of telling me she had an attorney to see but could not find the name of the person and all she needed was, ""to update the will.""  after fruitless searching at her house for the existing will, at the attorney appointment she said she had never had one done. to be perfectly frank (the whole point of this post) i'm bored sitting here and a bit exhausted. the attorney appointment was a big step. it's done. the will and other forms are simple. and now the formality is after it's prepared and i've seen a draft to get her to actually go sign it. i suspect it will be another $450 round trip just to ensure she goes and signs it. mom just asked me why she hasn't heard back from the attorney and she isn't sure he's any good.  it's saturday and like i said...met with him yesterday morning. she needs the tv on constantly, can't stand having ""no noise"" yet she's never paying attention to it and wants to talk to me constantly. i'm a fairly quiet person and get distracted easily (add) so it's irritating...always was. there's a lot of old feelings coming back especially this visit. we've had the conversation 8 times at least today about me getting a copy of the will. when her mother died she didn't get a copy of a different will she wasn't aware of until two months after my grandmother died.  the house that was to go to her was already sold and she has no idea what happened to any of the contents of the house. she doesn't want that to happen to me. so continues to repeat it despite me repeating the attorney is going to email me a copy in draft and in final form.by the way, that isn't what happened with my grandmother. the will part is true, but the house was sold with my mother's participation. she got the net proceeds from the sale. she needed help getting back on online banking since her bank was bought out and is transitioning over to a new website. she continues to ask if she needs new checks because they say the old bank name on them and if the checks are going through because she doesn't know. i look at her check register. she's perfectly balanced the checkbook and is marking when every check she writes clears. she just asked me to help her get back on the computer so she can she her bank account because she doesn't know when her retirement and ss money comes in. we did that yesterday too.and another thing bothering me. the notion of ""get her to a neurologist"" that well-meaning friends are telling me isn't quite that straightforward when you live across the country, or even when i'm here.  she claims she will find one and i don't need to worry about it. i've finally (this visit) gotten the name and information for her pcp which i told her i will make an appointment with to get a referral to a neurologist. i contacted four neurologists around the atlanta area that i knew i could at least take her to. three are not accepting new patients, one is ""not that kind of neurologist."" but i don't have to do that, her cardiologist said he would find a neurologist for her.  the same thing she told me in november...",The Fourth Visit...,1

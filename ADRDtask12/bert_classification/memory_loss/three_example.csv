"she is in the late stages of alzheimers, and every night she asks me ""have you ever been here before?"" and i say of course and explain to her that we are still in the town we have lived in for over half a decade, which just confuses her and then she will ask again in a minute or two.my question is what can i do to make her realize that she is home?",1,1,"My grandmother has lived in the same house for 57 years, and now she is convinced that we've moved to a house ""down the shore"""

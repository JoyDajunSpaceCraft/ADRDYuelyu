"if this is jumbled i’m sorry. please bear with me. when i was in high school, about 7-8 years ago, my grandpa went to see his aunt and uncle in mississippi, he had a heat stroke or heat exhaustion, can’t remember which. they had to restrain and sedate him because he was fighting the nurses so hard. my grandpa was probably around 140 pounds at the time, he’s always been lean because he’s very active. he basically raised me, more than my dad or my mom truthfully. he’s always called me squirt, and when we finally got to mississippi from tennessee, he was just waking up from the sedation and didn’t know he was restrained and i was the only person he recognized. he woke up and looked at me and said “hello squirt!” and asked me to scratch his beard and he seemed fine. now, he has either alzheimer’s or dementia and me and my mom go see him every weekend so my grandmother can go get her hair done because it’s her “one out away from him” i’ll get into that in a second. the last 3 weeks, he’s not known me or mom. a little over 2 months ago he knew who we were and he was repeating stories a lot, just standard stuff people with alzheimer’s or dementia do. he fractured his hips ages ago and it’s now gotten so bad that the head of his femur is basically gone, just a big bright spot on his x ray. he and my grandmother have been married for 55 years and my grandmother has always been kind of awful to him. for 54 years he has waited on her hand and foot, coming from across the house to give her something that’s not 5 feet from her. well the last year is when things have really started getting bad. my grandmother, who knows that we will fight for my grandpa tooth and nail, has told me and mom and just about anyone who will listen really, that he’s doing all this “just to spite her”. we finally get him an appointment to see the best specialist in the area to get him officially diagnosed and start a better treatment plan and possibly get him in studies and she schedules a fucking hip replacement surgery the week before the appointment. this is after she had put off making the appointment for the referral for 6+ months and making an ass of herself scheduling the appointment because they didn’t have an opening until april and she thought that was too long to wait. so his primary care got him on some memory meds which had been helping and then my grandmother cut his dosage without telling anyone or consulting the doctor. she screams at him, she argues with him, and if he pisses her off too much she wont feed him. she refused to cook him breakfast or supper the other day because he “threatened her with a knife” after he had cut up his shirts. my grandmother is also very dramatic so what we assumed happened is the same thing he does to me and mom occasionally where he’ll pull his pistol out of his pocket a little and say “do you see this? i take it with me everywhere” (spent casings are in the gun, no live bullets by the way, we’ve already thought about that). speaking of the gun, my grandmother also said she should just take that gun and go out in the backyard and shoot herself since he “hates her so much all of the sudden” and “she doesn’t understand what she did wrong”. we’ve tried to get her to take classes with us on how to care for people with these diseases and she says she doesn’t need anyone to tell her how to take care of her husband. i understand this is hard on her, it’s hard on him, it’s hard on all of us, but she’s not making this any easier by treating him like a child and talking to him and about him the way she does. i feel so guilty for not seeing my grandpa as much but i can’t stand to be around when my grandmother is there because i can’t tolerate the way she talks to him and how she talks about him like he’s not there and i can’t yell at her in front of him because then i’m acting like he’s not there too and i refuse to treat him any less than i ever have. all of that said, how do i stop being so upset about this all the time? if i stop being busy all the time, or work gets slow i start thinking about all of this and i start to cry and i can’t do that at work. i would love to do therapy but i work 60 hours a week and my schedule varies so bad i can’t really set appointments as far out as they usually require and i don’t have a ton of money to throw at it. i’m already on anti-depressants, i just don’t know what else to do. tl;dr- my grandfather has maybe dementia and mostly doesn’t know me anymore and his wife is terrible maybe abusive. how do i stop being upset?",1,How do I stop mourning my grandfather when he isn’t gone yet?
"i'm sure others have experience with helping your lo get dressed. i typically help my grandma because she does not remember to take her overnight pull up off and dress correctly. some mornings she just stands there and does not try to dress herself. i'll prompt her to remove her nightgown (she has to pull it off over her head) and she will just stand there and shrug her shoulders. then i prompt her by touching it/pulling it up slightly at the shoulders and repeating that she needs to pull it off. i don't like to remove it because she has back issues and not great range of motion in her shoulders. then once i do pull it off she just kind of stands there. and the process just becomes more difficult because then she pretty much refuses to help. she has incontinence so most mornings her nightgown is wet (or will be shortly from her sitting) so i don't want her left in it. but when i'm met with her uncooperative attitude, i'm not sure what to do. other than just getting her dressed and hoping that changes her attitude. how do you handle these situations?",0,Dressing issues
"my mom started showing clear signs of cognitive decline 2.5 years ago - word loss, trouble with directions, odd personality changes.  over the last 2.5 years she's gone from there to dementia stage 6 or 7 - she doesn't speak, is incontinent, and can't do anything on her own.  we just moved her into a memory care unit over the weekend, and it feels like something we should have done much sooner.  i suspect she'd quietly been in the first stages of dementia for a while, and then when she got lyme disease in summer 2016, it precipitated a quick downturn.  at first we thought the lyme was causing the word loss and stuff, but she was treated for late-stage lyme and didn't improve, so we had to embrace the reality that it's dementia, and not something curable.  i know that the earliest stages of dementia are often imperceptible to family and friends, and only in hindsight do we get the sense that something might have been wrong.  but i can't remember enough to really say when my mom might have started down the dementia road.  in the few years before she became obviously ill, she was uncharacteristically unkind toward my brother, and had some other lapses of judgement that i wonder about... i feel like i can't figure out what was ""the real mom"" and what was the disease.  as i try to remember the old her, it would be so helpful to be able to sort out some of the emotional stuff from her time before she got sick.  does anyone have experience with this kind of fast-moving dementia?  how long do you think the early phases last when the disease then progresses so quickly?",0,How long was my mom sick for?

"i haven't posted in a year, but thought i'd give a semi-positive update since there aren't a ton of those in this forum.see [here]( and [here]( for background.since his initial hospital stay in october 2019, my dad has been staying in alabama with family. however, at the end of last year, the neurologist that he sees gave the opinion that he is in stage 6 (of 7) of alzheimer's. i was pretty surprised by this because he still makes his own coffee, microwaves food, changes his clothes (when he's prompted), and goes to the bathroom by himself.the doctor told us that we needed to start thinking about putting him into care or getting full time help. there is no way my dad would go for full time care being in the guest house with him, so we started looking for memory care facilities.my sister and her family recently moved back to ga from ca, so we decided to get him into a place near where we both are in ga. this way, once covid restrictions aren't so tight, he can see both of us and his nephews regularly.we are moving him in on feb 26 of this month. there has been so much involved in this process. we had to get his pcp to fill out forms, get a chest x-ray, a tb test, and a pcr covid test (the last two still haven't happened yet). because he is in al, it was also just easier to buy him new clothes, toiletries, linens, etc., than try and figure out what of his is still usable (he will not shower for weeks or change his clothes so a lot of his clothes probably need to be set on fire). i had to get special labels printed to sew inside his clothes like he is going to camp (my fun project this weekend).the place we are putting him in is really nice, so i hope having socialization and help will help his mental health. he'll have people to cook his meals, do his laundry, monitor his hygiene, and just hang out with him. it's 4k a month for his semi-private room, which means he will eventually have a roommate (he doesn't have one yet) and they will share a kitchenette and bathroom. he has enough savings that we can pay for this for 4-5 years.as i've mentioned elsewhere, he is only 63 (too young for age-based medicare here) and he has too many assets (money &amp; real estate) to easily qualify for medicaid. i am hoping to get the house he owns sold later this year and then i will be looking into putting all the money into a trust so that he can qualify for medicaid.this stuff is so confusing, but we've got a decent handle on it right now and i am feeling optimistic for the first time in a while.tldr: finally getting dad into memory care later this month, hoping it will relieve some of my constant anxiety about his condition.",1,Moving Dad into Memory Care

"hi all, i hope you read this and are well! i (f23) live at home with my sister (f29), parents (f,m61), and grandmother (f86) who has dementia. my grandmother's dementia is in the moderate stages--her memory is mostly spotty and her cognition is starting to go. she is my mom's mother and she's lived with us for about 5 years, since my grandfather passed.to try to make a long story shorter, my mom has put herself through a lot of stress trying to take care of her. my dad has very reluctantly been supportive (which is worsened by the fact that he and my grandma never had a great relationship) and i generally find him to be more stress-inducing to my mom than supportive. my aunt has been a c u next tuesday (this includes having tried to financially abuse my grandmother in recent years by taking money from her) and is an additional stress. my mom also has a full time job (but will hopefully be retiring soon).in recent months, i feel like i've been noticing my mom's memory become spotty. sometimes we'll have full conversations about something and then hours later she'll bring something up as if we never talked about it. she'll also ask me certain things repeatedly over the span of hours/days as if she completely doesn't remember. one of the biggest things is that it gets really bad with alcohol. she behaves the exact same way that my grandmother does and will completely derail a conversation and tell the same story 3-5 times with complete cluelessness as to how she's commandeering the conversation.i'm worried that the stress of caregiving and the fact that dementia runs on my mother's side will be all the factors for her to start developing dementia.i guess i'm wondering--has anyone else experienced or seen this happen with caregivers? is this something i might just be overly sensitive to because of my grandma? if this is likely to be happening, are there any things i can do to talk to my mom about this concern and see how we can try to alleviate some stress? i hope she can do things for less stress but also don't want to make her overly self conscious or stress her out more for no reason.",1,Caregivers developing dementia?
"hi, the title kind of explains it. i've been caring for my grandpa since november 2015. doing his laundry, dishes and getting his groceries. things like that. it was his birthday today, he's 87. after we all went out for lunch with the family, i went back to his place to help him put away gifts and to wash his feet (he has poor foot health so i soak them for him and apply the necessary creams so they don't get infected).  when the visit was over, i went to leave and gave him a hug. when i hugged him he aggressively grabbed my chest and put his hand up the back of my shirt. he muttered that i was ""too much for him"". i'm kind of horrified. i fully understand that he was not in his right mind when this happened and even though this happened only a few hours ago, he doesn't remember it at all. i also realize that this kind of behaviour is common in patients with dementia. my family knows all about it, and when my mom tried to talk to him about what happened, he said he simply didn't remember. she also called his case worker today and we are now finding him a higher care facility that can take him sooner than later. i love my grandpa. this is the only time he's ever acted this way towards me. i don't want to let this incident change my opinion of him, but frankly i feel angry, disappointed and violated. i've never been assaulted by a man in this way and i think that's why it's effecting me so much.  i'm posting this in hopes that someone has been in this situation and can offer me a different, more positive perspective on this incident... if there is one. i don't want to feel angry and would like to move on. tldr; birthday grandpa groped me and now i feel weird about him. seeking perspectives/advice",0,27/F was felt up by grandpa with dementia.

"**tl;dr: is it elder abuse or illegal for my mom to just stop taking care of my elderly grandmother who legally is in charge of her own actions? does my mom need to turn her over to the authorities to take care of her or sometihng?**not sure this is the right place to post this, but i will give it a try.my ngrandma has been emotionally abusive to my mom for her whole life, and as a result my mom has basically been brainwashed into thinking that she is kind of worthless and that she has to keep taking care of her nmom. ngrandma only got diagnosed with dementia a year ago, but my mom has been helping her a lot for 15+ years, and the demands just get higher as the years go on. ngrandma refuses to accept that she has dementia, and says that my father (who she hates) told the doctors that she has dementia and that's why they said she did. she thinks they are all lying. she is physically in bad shape, she has had two knee replacements, she has really bad back problems and her legs are not the same lengths which causes her to walk hunched over and unevenly. she had her gallbladder removed in november so she is supposed to be on a low fat diet, but she doesn't like it, so she just gets diarrhea all the time, sometimes on the in her pants/on the floor. she has fallen a number of times and hasn't been able to get off the floor without both my mom and me picking her up. she was in the hospital at least three times last year because she fell and hallucinated and called the police. despite all of this, she refuses to go into a nursing home or get home care. she is *somewhat* open to home care, but i know she wants someone white, educated, and preferably jewish to take care of her. in the meantime, my mom is the only one who takes care of her, sometimes with my help. she is constantly abusing my mom by criticizing everything about her from her appearance to her life choices to her children's behavior. she calls my mom every day, gets in long arguments with her, asks her to come over and help her clean up all the stuff she has all over her bed, asks her to buy her food but then can't think of what she should eat, makes her take her to doctors appointments, etc. if my mom were to stop taking care of my grandma, would there be some kind of legal ramifications? does she need to like, tell the police that there's an elderly woman who can't take care of herself or something? my grandma legally has capacity which means she is legally in charge of herself, so i don't see how there could be any legal requirement for my mom to take care of her.also, is it elder abuse to tell an old person you wish they were dead? because i have said that to her, not because i am threatening to kill her or because i really want her to die, but because if she dies then she will go away. if we could just ship her off to siberia it would be just as good. anyway, she keeps threatening to call the police and implied that i will go to jail for saying that to her because it's elder abuse. i don't think we are abusive to her, and if we are ""technically"" abusive in some way, it's only because she is so abusive to us and we can't stand her, but my mom also pretty much fails to see any way to not be in this position despite other people explaining ways to get out of it.",0,Is my mother legally obligated to take care of her narcissistic mother with dementia?

"i'm a dude who used to work for an ltac, nicknamed death valley. we had all the usual patients, people who's family's didnt want them dying at home, motorcycle victims, the works. we were a few miles down the road from the gun and knife club hospital. but i was non clinical, always checking in on patients equipments, rentals ect. i was able to compartmentalize and see people succumb. to dementia over months, or during their stay.then the pandemic. i last went to church with my grandmother, 88, in february 2020 where she walked, and talked normally. in july 2020 i got a call from one of my grandparents neighbors saying she was wandering in the street aimlessly. by october 2020, she couldnt sit on the couch for long, and just slide to the floor. my grandfather, 92 couldnt keep up care so i started daily help visits. picking her up, moving her, cleaning the floors from code brown episodes. that went on for a solid 4 months ish? i ended up getting help from the whole family but i physically damaged myself in the process. i needed unhealthy amounts of caffeine and slept inconsistently or not at all and i developed great knee and lower back pain, ended up finding out my kidneys were swelling and i had a partial tear in my lcl .after this our family started to call around for help, as she was all over the place, she would be paranoid, violent, speaking to dead relatives ect. but we found home hospice help, and i was able to get healthier, but not 100% yet. i am still there with them 5 days a week, changing and cleaning, just with nurses help now, and its wonderful.the thing i cannot wrap my mind around is how quickly things went down hill. i mean i understand the pandemic sucked and social isolation was terrible but ti go from functioning to bed ridden, unable to communicate or walk in under 8 months was radical. my parents and i were wondering how to keep her in the house, now we cant figure out how to keep her in the bed. i understand about the mental aspects of things, but to see her eyes twisted in rage, from my grandmother who never would curse but liked rum and coke and virginia slims until she quit, to a face that is twisted in rage and doesnt even recognize me, that she can get physically violent ( though at 88 not much force behind the hits and bites) and profane. it is unreal what this disease does to people. there is more i'd like to say, but it is going on quarter to two am, and these things keep me awake every so often.i do apologize if this is breaking the rules, or venting ect. i just really wanted to talk to someone whom i didnt have to pay to do so.",0,Help me understand
"hey all! coming at you from a few weeks ago (i never responded, and i'm sorry. sometimes i really just need to rant.)i'm feeling a little more refreshed as a caretaker lately, but with that comes the realization that i'm often the ""translator"" for the behaviors my mom exhibits, and the would-be problem solver. currently we're experiencing many, many issues regarding the use of the bathroom with my mom. i'll briefly outline the problems here. bear with me please, as this is a.. complicated issue with many different aspects:a. she uses the bathroom frequently. she likely goes 20-30 times in the span of 24 hours. she was checked for a uti a few months ago, but have been pressuring my dad to get her checked again. i have explained to him before that uti's are *common* and that we need to check for them regularly.b. she uses *a lot* of toilet paper at once. absolutely way more than necessary. as a family of three, we were having to buy about 24 rolls *a week*. my dad's solution was to give us each our own roll of toilet paper to use, and then hide the rest of it. naturally, this has not had the intended effect he wanted. it just results in my mom wandering, not wiping, and obsessing over finding toilet paper. it's also frustrating really needing to go pee, only to remember i left my roll back in my room.c. she obsesses over the possibility of an accident occurring. as a result, part of her frequent bathroom trips are due to anxiety. she stuffs washcloths and extra toilet paper into her underwear to ""avoid"" accidents, and has been caught wearing as many as three pairs of underwear at once. sadly, many pairs of my own underwear have been lost...d. the toilet paper that she stuffs in her underwear? she ends up using that. she will then pull her underwear back up with it still in there. sometimes she puts it in the toilet, sometimes she doesn't. either way, she's walking around with soiled toilet paper in her underwear, or worse - having it break down and get stuck. i have tried to attack the problem head on and get her to take it out many times a day, i have told my dad he needs to get her to take it out, but the other shoe has yet to drop. while my mom continues to deteriorate and do just about everything incorrectly or unsafely, she retains her insane level of stubborn and irrational anger when i attempt to get her to be clean and/or safe.i know it's not ""her"", but i don't know what to do. i've tried being kindly, i've tried being direct and firm, i've tried doing the whole ""ready to change your underwear?"" shtick, and nothing works. i can only reasonably get through to her when she's mildly confused, and it does not take long for her anger and hatred for me to resurface.e. she's wiping back to front. i recently realized this because she has suddenly become more comfortable with asking me to be in the bathroom with her if we're not at home. these infrequent trips tends to be the *only* time i can get her to be clean and safe.f. she's leaving pee all over the toilet seat, and she refuses to use the bathroom in her own bedroom. as a result, i'm consistently forced to wait for her to get out of the front bathroom, or walk into their (parents) bedroom at night to use *their* bathroom. i'm currently stressing over a possible bladder infection for me, and when i need to go, i want to go. i'm sick of waiting for her to get out of the bathroom and then being grossed out as i clean the urine off of the seat. *i don't sit on my own toilet seat in my own home anymore.* i've been squatting over it for months. what on earth do we do? we've tried depends but getting her to wear them consistently is a problem, and my dad relies on me to remind him of us being out of *anything*: toilet paper, specific foods, paper towels, diapers, cat and dog food, etc. i do a good job, but sometimes i slip up. i feel we're at the point where she needs someone to supervise her using the restroom every time, but how do you break that barrier when she's often so incredibly resentful and resistant to even gentle explanations and help? she hates wet wipes (she doesn't like being wet anymore, which is what makes her insistence on having wet toilet paper in her underwear so ironic) so i can't even get her to use those for cleaner wiping. i'm at my end. i keep telling my dad we've got to do something, we have to tackle this, we have to watch her, but nothing changes. i end up being the bad guy at 3 in the morning when i'm losing out on sleep shepherding her back into her bedroom as she wanders and goes to the bathroom 5 times in 10 minutes. my dad sleeps like a frigging log.help? thanks for reading this gigantic beast...",0,Bathroom Hygiene Issues /W Mom

"my grandfather is in the later stages of alzheimer’s, he is entirely dependent on the family for everything. he cannot speak coherent sentences and has forgotten how to express what he’s feelings (finding food spicy is expressed by shivering). he cannot use the bathroom on his own, and really the only thing he remembers how to do is chew. sooo you can imagine our horror when we hear him loudly saying ‘allah’ repeatedly at 4 am. (he was never a religious man but ever since the dementia, the only word he seems to remember is ‘allah’. it’s always always on his lips). my sister ran downstairs and to the pool area where his voice seemed to be coming from. it was pitch dark and she couldn’t see a thing. as her eyes adjusted, she realised he was standing smack in the middle of the pool. we got him out, poor guy was shivering and my uncle gave him a warm shower. he wasn’t hurt at all. what freaks me out is— the path from the door to the pool is full of random and irregular steps, and the fact that he walked all the way without falling is amazing. and he didn’t even fall in the pool, he walked to the pool steps and got in, while it was so dark (he’s also nearly blind in one eye and he wasn’t wearing his glasses for the other). it’s not like he would remember this route because he hasn’t been swimming in years and we keep him away from the area. it just blows my mind that he didn’t slip because god knows that if he had, none of us would have known until the next morning. i swear he’s got angels guarding him or something.",0,Grandfather walked into the pool at 4 am

"about 4 years ago, i was going through a divorce and in need of a place to stay.  so i crashed in my mom's spare bedroom, intending to only stay a few months while i figured things out.  but, about three months after i moved in, she was diagnosed with dementia.  so my siblings and i discussed things with her, and being that it was early stages, she pretty much understand everything we were saying.  it was decided that i would just continue to live with her to ensure that she was safe.  plus i became her chauffer as the doctor forbid her to drive anymore.  and the slow decline began.  it really wasn't too bad.  especially compared to what others have gone through.  she never got aggressive or violent.  she got frustrated at times, like when she looked at picture of someone and couldn't figure out who it was, but she knew that person was important to her, because otherwise why would she have a picture of them.  and she would get depressed when i would tell her who it was.  it was heartbreaking to see her not recognize her father or her sister or her grandchildren.   but, overall, things weren't bad.  she never wondered off or anything like that.  then 2022 happened.  she tested positive for covid on the jan 7.  she recovered from covid, but never got her strength back.  on feb 4th, she went to the er. she was diagnosed with a severe uti and spesis.  she was admitted to the hospital.  on the 2nd night her oxygen dropped to 48% and she was rushed to the icu where she spent 2 days.  after that she was moved back to a regular room and spent a total of 10 days in the hospital. she was then sent to a rehab center.  she has not made any progress and today the rehab center informed us that they will discharge her  on the 18th.  but, she needs 24/7 care now.  so, she will have to go to a nursing home.  and i guess she will just spend the rest of her life in a bed.  frankly, i've reached a point that i never thought i would.  if she's not going to get any better, then i'm hoping the rest of her life isn't going to be very long.  my prayers are now asking god to take her.  let her go to heaven and be with my dad and with her parents again.  dementia sucks.",0,Mom isn't coming home.

"hi, my father (79) was diagnosed about 4.5 years ago and honestly for all that he's pretty high functioning, speech is unaffected, feeds, dresses and cleans himself without assistance etc etc. i (35) live at home with both him and my mother (72) to help out as best i can and for the most part we were plodding along well enough. however the last few months have thrown a lot of turmoil into our lives and i don't know if my father feels unable to help or if he's not understanding what is going on.basically my mother was rushed into hospital at the beginning of july with major breathing/eating difficulties and after emergency surgery to debulk a tumour and fit a tracheostomy, a weekend on a ventilator and a nervous week of waiting was diagnosed with a thyroid lymphoma. she spent almost the entirety of july in hospital and has been home around three weeks or so. in those three weeks it is looking more and more likely that my father doesn't really understand the realities of what is going on with my mother. for example despite my mother's best efforts the strap holding her trach over time starts to smell as the mucus that leaks from her stoma soaks into it and dries. my father has gotten it into his head that this is because my mother isn't washing herself properly and that the smell is body odour basically, i've explained it a couple of times but he doesn't get it. generally speaking she's finding life with a trach awkward and quite simply my father is standoffish at best. my mother thinks he might actually be jealous of the care and attention she's been getting. either way his reluctance to help is really getting hard to cope with. i'm up multiple times every night to help my mother out (most often it's just setting up and putting her nebuliser to go as her throat dries out a lot especially at night and the trach makes the mucus hard to clear), my father will sometimes wake up and basically lay there watching. i feel like he just thinks he can't help but then other times it seems like he just doesn't get why we're doing this stuff that is waking him up. i'm holding things together for the moment but as time goes by i think i'm going to struggle and could really use my father's understanding if not his active support.",0,I don't think my father understands what's going on

(i don't live close enough to be able to help like this often.)anyway, i just wanted to say that instead of trying to change what he was doing and getting mad at him/hurt for not knowing my name or that i'm his daughter, i was able to just be with him as he is.  it helped me let go of some of my anger and reminded me that i love him and that he is still my dad.",1,I found some much needed grace today...

"dad79 has been on the dementia decline for about 5 years now. i try to get here as often as i can - parents live in puerto rico - i live in the states. i was here last march and in just 8 months there’s been more issues. it absolutely drives my mom74 and my brother50 (lives with them) crazy when dad starts telling his stories. yes, it is annoying when he is like a record repeating over and over, word for word, stories from his youth. stories about other women before my mom. some stories become so outlandish, he flew a plane and landed it in a field. in his stories he is always the hero that everyone looks up to. he’s the best! people got up from their seats to let him sit and bowed to him offering respect. never ever was he like this. bragging wasn’t his style. mom can’t get him to shower or change his clothes. he doesn’t make it to the toilet and is often in soiled underwear. when i was here in march i took him to a podiatrist because he was limping so bad, his nails had begun to curl under his toes. he was combative when we got there and didn’t speak to me for a the whole day. that was the last time his toe nails were cut. eight months ago. once again he’s refusing to go. he refused to be vaccinated. he agreed and once he got to the clinic he wouldn’t get out of the car. a nurse came out to the car and he tried to kick her. then jumped out of the car and hobbled down the road. earlier today someone had come by to do some yard work. dad always took care of everything meticulously and i could see the confusion as he watched someone else take over his chores. so i asked him to take a ride with me and see some sights. it gave everyone an hour break. and i got to drive him around laughing and joking.",0,Just a Vent

"hello.  my father takes care of my mom with advanced dementia.  he hired a local agency and there is 24/7 coverage at their house, so that he can work from home and get sleep.  there are gates to prevent her from going up stairs.  cameras in every room that can be monitored. about a month ago, she wandered off, while a caretaker was there and my dad was working.   it was shocking, my mom never showed the inclination to wander off.  luckily there were already slide locks in place on the doors (too high for my mom to reach) that could be used to prevent it in the future.last week, a different caretaker was there and my dad was out of the house.  i think the caretaker went upstairs to get something, and my mom uncharacteristically went out the door.  a neighbor found her.  the care team was notified, they need to always use the slide locks.  that particular caretaker will not be used again.well, the neighbor who found her must have called adult protective services.  they came while my dad was out, talked to the main caretaker.  aps was told that my mom had wandered off five or six times.  i have no idea why the neighbor would say that, as it is absolutely untrue.

"i hope it's ok that i made a new account to post here.my husband is 61 and we've been married almost 35 years -- a good marriage, we've always said. i started noticing changes a couple years ago, but he's always been the scatterbrained professor type so i didn't really think anything of it (until i look back now)...and he attributed things to work stress, being tired, etc. about a year ago i began voicing my concerns and asking him to see a neurologist. he flat-out refused -- too busy, too much money, there's nothing wrong, etc. for what it's worth, we do ok financially and he *is* busy with work, but still. in the last six months or so, his demeanor has changed drastically. he has become paranoid, easily angered and frustrated, hostile and hateful towards me. he's accused me of ""scheming"" against him, trying to ""exploit"" him and steal ""his"" money, and gather ""ammunition"" to divorce him. this is *not* his mo at all and is nothing short of crazy talk. no amount of my trying to reassure him that i'm genuinely worried and that my concerns are coming from a place of love has made any difference. i tried reasoning with him, i tried humor and, yes, i even got downright insistent and belligerent about it. all to no avail.  i finally called our two sons and asked if they would try to convince him to get evaluated (which felt like betrayal, but at that point i didn't care). they did and he agreed (vehemently denying the things he said to me above), but he never said anything to me about it (and had previously said that if he went to the dr., he would not allow me to go with him). i found out the name of the dr. and called her to share my concerns. i told her my husband said that i couldn't go with him, but that i told him i would be calling her and didn't have a problem with her telling him i did so (so as to not feed further into the paranoia). she told me that he filled out their on-line forms and listed me as the emergency contact, but specifically said that she was not to share his medical information with me. i found out (through the oldest son) that an mri has been ordered. i also found out that the dr. deemed my husband competent to make his own medical decisions. other than that, i have no idea what transpired and when i ask my husband, i get a blank stare in response.my husband still works full-time in a very technical and high-pressure job. i can't believe they haven't noticed changes, too, but i don't really know his co-workers and certainly none of them have called me to express any concern. he still drives (and has gotten turned around a couple times on a familiar route when i've been with him). again, excuses: he was tired, it was dark, it was foggy, etc.maybe i'm putting the cart before the horse because a diagnosis hasn't been made yet, but i feel in my gut that there's definitely something very wrong here. i think i know dementia when i see it, yet i'm still hoping against hope that i'm wrong. i suppose it could be a brain tumor or something else much less sinister, but i'm trying to wrap my head around this and be proactive. at this point, i feel like my hands are tied and i'm at a total loss. whatever ""it"" is, it looks and sounds like alzheimers to me...so i ask: can anyone offer any suggestions to open the lines of communication? some approach i haven't thought of? something (anything!) to convince my husband that i'm on his side and i only want to help?? if this is ad, then i get it that i may be expecting too much. i just want to try everything possible to advocate for my husband in any way i can. i appreciate your reading this and i will be so grateful for any advice you may have to offer. thank you.",0,Looks like Alzheimers to me.

for some reason this post wasn't allowed in r/askdocs which is mildly infuriating so asking here and hopeful a doctor will respond. my mom was diagnosed with lewy body about six months ago by her neurologist with input from a psychologist who tested her. she was prescribed medication to deal with hallucinations. no follow-up appointment was provided and although it wasn't explicity stated that no more appointments would be necessary there was a general understanding that there simply wasn't anything to do be done about the onset and progression of the dementia. we've since moved her in with us and intend to look after her for as long as we are able.her symptoms have progressed and at my mother's insistence we've reached out by phone a few times about meeting with the neurologist but we don't hear back beyond his assistant telling us she'll check to see if he thinks an apointment is necessary. we never hear that an appointment isn't necessary.i don't want to pester a doctor if there's no point in scheduling a follow-up. i know this is incurable and we know where this is ultimately headed. but i don't want to give up scheduling follow-ups if they're any way helpful for her either.what position are in here?,0,Should we not expect follow-up visits after a dementia diagnosis?

"my dad passed away three years ago today from this terrible disease and i still struggle with it. rational me understands i lost him long before his actual death but emotional me still holds onto this weird idea that if i could do something that would make him proud he would remember. this carried over well past his death. i’m writing this to tell you all to watch out for your own mental health. you can not receive validation from someone who is gone, and if you are a care taker, please remember to acknowledge your own needs and live your own truth.my dad took great pride in me being a good golfer. amongst his friends that became my identity. one time he asked me to take a year off work and pursue this dream. he used to try to sign me up for us open local qualifying and while i had spurts of really good play, i was never of the pedigree to actually compete in that arena. i have mental health issues, diagnosed with ptsd in my early 20s from suppressed child hood trauma. basically i developed the yips. i literally shake so bad over 1 foot putts that i miss them because my inner child fears the bullying that comes from missing something so simple. if no one is around i make them though. then his dementia came, i decided to for go achieving independence in my 20s and lived at home with my mom to help take care of him and my mom. i became obsessed with the game, i would do insane things like hit 400+ balls in the middle of winter at a “heated” driving range daily, i even qualified for a few elite amateur tournaments. none of this really mattered or helped him remember because he was so far gone he would claim i won things i didn’t to his friends. i didn’t care, i thought i could still achieve that validation and it was nice having someone believe in me more then i ever did.after his passing i medicated through the game, i was hell bent on qualifying for the us open. i found work in florida so i could practice year round. i was desperate for that validation and didn’t care that i was sabotaging my personal love life by going on this grandiose journey. my game got pretty good and i signed up for us open local. unfortunately the qualifier was rained out that year and the date it was moved to i would be coming off a 25 hour shift. i still wanted to try, and when i got home i changed into my golf clothes and sat on the couch. i fell asleep, woke up late and missed the tee time. i called my mom sobbing. this was 2019, i didn’t learn my lesson because i basically repeated the same process in 2020 except this time covid cancelled open qualifying. looking back 2019 was my best chance. i had (more) mental stability and other things in my life were going well.however the kicker to 2020 was covid took my job away, it was terrible for myself, friends, and ex but i finally had this opportunity to have that year to really train like my dad wanted. i took it and ran. i thought i was doing him proud but i was really just ignoring my own emotional needs, growth and relationships. i was being selfish but at the time didn’t view it as such. to compound the problem and dream i won my club championship this summer. i say this is a problem because the way i won it. it went to a playoff, and in front of who knows how many people i hit my approach to a foot. instantly i was known by everyone in the club and i had a reputation as a badass. no one (other then my playing partners) knew i missed 9 putts inside 3 feet over the two day tournament. ironically the kid i beat in the playoff conceded my tap in. we played the first round together. he even helped me read putts the first day which ultimately calmed me down. i feel like training in the cold helped heal my ball striking mind and wonder if i trained short game in the cold i could achieve the same results. but i’m getting side tracked with that statement. after beating tyler in the playoff i confided in his dad that i felt bad for winning, this was the first time i won anything golf wise and have lost in playoffs before. it’s brutal to be on that side of things. it is not fun to say the least. he yelled at me for saying this to him. but at the same time i wouldn’t of gotten my mind in the headspace without tyler’s kindness during the first round.the problem with winning like this is that people talk, all of a sudden i had a reputation for being this badass golfer who did something amazing despite the pressure. everyone at the club knew who i was and it was hard to remember basic things like everyone’s names. everyone wanted a game, and if i’m being honest i like the game for the solitude. i love playing by myself as a means to clear my headspace, but my game was to a point where people wanted to see it and the attention felt nice. i finished the year strong, and was determined more then ever to make a 2021 us open run. i trained the off season harder then i ever trained. i had a brief stint in florida, i left despite my (now) exes wishes. florida seemed appealing because work was coming back to that state because they didn’t give a fuck about covid, but ultimately i was putting the goal first. unfortunately the day i left to go down there one of the guys i was staying with attempted suicide. the other guy didn’t tell me until i got there two days later (i drove). i had just entered hell. my ex gf was distant because i left, the guy i was staying with was unloading on me and the company had asked me to keep it quiet to protect him. i had no one to turn to. i was also sleeping in the same bed he tried to hang himself off of. i had so many questions, i wondered if he tried because he knew i was coming down and didn’t want me there. jobs also kept cancelling. with no work or income i decided to head back home. i also missed my ex.me and my ex were growing more distant, but i was still hell bent on this goal. i found an indoor simulator space to practice in. the guy cut me a deal, 200 bucks to train all winter as long as i came in off hours. so i’d wake up everyday at 4/5am drive to the suburbs and hit 400+ balls. my ex never gave me a hard time about waking her up during this and that’s something i took for granted. i was making big strides in club head speed and shot making, the space even had a putting green in there! this is where golf is a bitch. to an extent it doesn’t matter how much you practice if your mind isn’t right. in february unemployment claimed they over paid me 12000 dollars. to deal with this i had to keep my phone on me at all times. i became screen addicted and neglected my exes needs. part of the process was being on a call back list, so everytime my phone rang or went off i had to be there. i can’t explain to you how mentally draining it is to be attached to every notification you get on your little pocket dopamine. it’s beyond distracting. this lasted for four months, non the less i persisted with my dads dream.opening day on the golf course finally came. on my way to the course someone ran a red light and totaled my vehicle. i should mention i live in a big city and have a 40-60 minute commute to the course. i didn’t believe i was that injured and was hell bent on making opening day so i got my roommates car and went and played. i’m actually did ok for the first few holes until i realized i had whiplash. i remember sitting in the parking lot crying to my friend because i had worked so hard effectively for nothing. i knew the year was dead, i knew i was injured but i didn’t know the toll it would take on my mental health. i started physical therapy for a herniated disc in my neck and had some upper back issues that restricted my swing. i began rushing between golf pt and work. the entire time i had to have my cell phone on me and the number of calls from ambulance chasers was exhausting. i persisted with the dream because it’s all i had. it had become my identity. one you thing you should learn about trauma brain is the importance of slowing down. when this happened i was effectively rushing every minute of every day. instead of adjusting my goals i turned it up, and this can cause a lot of problems for someone like me. on top of this i didn’t exactly look hurt; so while my play suffered my “friends” who once adored me when i was good were dismissive and devaluing. i’d hear stuff like “i want to play with the old version of you” (three days after the accident) “golf is a lot harder when you have to work for a living” etc. essentially i became a circus act for people i thought were my friends. golf culture can be toxic, it’s a privileged world, and speaking up about other people’s poor behavior did not go well for me.during this time my girlfriend and i were growing distant. my new job had me working till 8 so we saw each other less and less. she immediately recognized my struggle and tried to get me in therapy, something i put off. covid shut down my industry so i finally had work again and with pt and training how was i suppose to add therapy on that? also how was i suppose to turn down work when we’re shut down for 18 months! i already had to work pt in around that.a week prior to the qualifier she tried to break up with me. it was a day before my birthday and a week before the qualifier. i was devastated to say the least. we still had issues from me leaving that we never addressed and while we had a beautiful relationship before i left things just were off. i shut down emotionally and didn’t know how to turn my situation into an opportunity. i was hurt, just really really hurt. so i isolated. i came begging back and she gave me a chance to redeem myself. i tried to explain the situation and she just grew mad at me. and i don’t blame her. i wasn’t putting her first, i wasn’t even putting myself first. i was attempting to find closure in the worst possible way. i was ignoring growing as a person and an adult and chasing scores because that’s who i became. i withdrew from us open local. emotionally i was a wreck but my neck and back weren’t at a place to compete. the usga will actually punish you if you don’t perform well in these and there are other usga tournaments i have a more realistic shot of playing in. (i’ve missed usga mid am by a shot or two in the past). i was so unaware of my mental heath at the time because i was so focused on being ready for that tournament. even if my body was ready i doubt i could of succeeded. ironically i’m pretty well versed in sports psychology books but i feel like that topic does not do trauma justice if you want real help seek a professional.this past summer was much of the same. at work i was trying to get out of doing some heavy lifting because of the pain and i felt devalued to the company despite having a pretty long tenure there. i was painted as lazy and didn’t want to work. no one seemed to care that i literally had took jobs for them that cost me unemployment dollars because of how that’s set up or that i literally took a job that paid less then unemployment because i saw it as an opportunity to grow new skills. i’d try to talk about mental health with friends but i was met with things like “so what you have golf” like being able to control a golf ball means my brain functions properly. there was also a large empathy gap between the people who stayed on to work and those of us that got unemployment. they didn’t know that by working one day a week as a fill in it was actually costing us hundreds of dollars when we were just trying to survive. and i didn’t understand the stress they were under just keeping things afloat.my golf game came and went in phases. i couldn’t handle gambling even friendlu bets. i eventually disconnected from the group i normally played with because i became a punching bag. hurt me shooting 76 wasn’t good enough for these people and it was hard to meet the unrealistic expectations they had of me considering my situation. i’d only be treated the same if i shot a score. i started playing alone. i love playing alone. i could be me, free from judgement and my scores reflected that. i always wondered how many golfers there are out there that are good enough to play on tv if they know the cameras aren’t on and nobody is watching.me and my now ex broke up for good. i was in shock and emotionally unavailable so she had enough. in the beginning i blamed everything on her also. i failed to look inwardly and see how i was at fault.  we also broke up originally over text on the golf course. i snapped two clubs that day in front of guys that don’t care what i shoot. i didn’t tell them what was going on in my phone. she did so many nice things for me i took for granted. i wrote evil things about her, and sure she did some bad stuff but a majority of it was in response to my emotional neglect. she didn’t deserve the words i wrote about her and i also didn’t expect her to read them but knew there was a chance she would. (i posted a response on r/bpdlovedones because i was so convinced that’s what i had went through) essentially i was being a man child. she blocked me on all forums, and moved on. a week after the break up she was already bringing another guy around her mom. she had had enough, after all she did hold out for nine months and i wasn’t working on myself.finally golf didn’t matter. i no longer had the drive to wake up and go to the course. i didn’t want to be confronted by anyone about my bad behavior. i isolated in my room which was a total mess for about a month. i didn’t tell anyone about the break up. there were times i really thought i was going to commit suicide. i felt so hurt and so unvalued. i worked so hard at the game and to not even have the opportunity to try is crushing. it’s something i hope i’ll get over. it hasn’t just been the work i put in after my dads passing it’s been a decade of work and commitment.now comes the point of all this. i started getting help. i reached out to my mom and loved ones. they’ve been supportive as fuck. i had to find my real friends, the ones who didn’t view me as a walking scorecard and they listen. i have a coworker that we do self care together. i’ve been going to therapy. i’m writing this as a vow not only to myself but to my dad. my dad wouldn’t be proud of me for doing what i’ve done. he’d be proud of me for building a happy life. i am no longer going to play golf to seek my fathers validation and i will only play because i want to. i’m no longer going to value people that judge me by my score and not the content of my character. i’m going to address problems in my relationships before they get out of hand. and this is going to be my reminder. and if you’re someone who is struggling as a caretaker for someone with dementia please don’t do what i did. get help, it’s ok to grieve, the sad reality is nothing you can do or imagine is going to bring them back, so count the good days when you have them and be easy on yourself during the bad ones.tldr: 3 years ago my dad passed away with dementia. he wanted me to be a pro golfer, i chased the dream not because i wanted it but because he did. a series of events brought me to the lowest point of my adult life. don’t be like me, get help.",1,[deleted by user]

"this is kind of a long rant but i just don't understand some of the actions my family members are taking in relation to the care of my grandparents. they have been both diagnosed with rapidly progressing dementia and alzheimers within the last 7 months. my grandfather is definitely worse. he's mood has changed, and he's joyful and happy all the time which is nice. he's never forgotten who i am and he knows what i'm talking about. he'll also ask me how things went two weeks after the fact, so he's still there. my dad took over his finances last summer and has severely restricted my grandma's spending. she has a credit card limit and her card gets declined when we go out for dinner. they did this because she was buying my aunt too much stuff (who's mentally unwell and lost her son).  they have over 10 million dollars so it's not really a problem for her to spend money, but i get it. i just found out my grandma was diagnosed 2 months ago with dementia and alzheimers as well. i didn't realize how bad she was, i just thought she was getting forgetful when she would tell me the same story after a few hours. they now have 24 hr care, which is great. but i am no longer allowed to sleepover and i'm so upset about it. i can now only visit from 1-8 pm to put them on a strict schedule. i only slept over because it made them happy and i liked having breakfast and reading the paper with them in the morning. i also worked as a home health aide for 14 years so i thought i could help them if they needed it. i'm graduating with my phd in may, and my dad told me they couldn't come to my graduation. i'm so sad about it, and i get that it messes with their schedule. but they really wanted to go. are these restrictions to make them have a set schedule normal? i just want what's best for them, but i don't understand why taking away things that seem harmless and make them happy is helpful. i don't have a good relationship with my dad and my stepmom, so i think it's also me feeling resentful towards him.",0,[deleted by user]
hello! i am my great uncles full time caregiver. as any caregiver knows we have our limits and need a break. i can usually give myself small breaks hiding in the bathroom or bedroom through out the day. i'm also trying to get what little family we have left involved in watching him at least for an hour once a week. unfortunately he's so attached to me and gets terribly confused and unreasonably upset if i shouldn't be around. has anyone gone through this struggle? all advice or experiences is very much welcomed! thank you!,0,Has anyone dealt with an overly attached loved one?
"so for starters, my dad is 79 and he was involved in a car wreck last month. he turned left in front of someone going through the yellow light. i was the passenger and sustained injuries from the airbags and he had similar injuries. the other party was not injured, but my dad's car was totaled. now he has no car to use and is housebound, but i come over everyday to help him out. it was determined by my siblings and i that it would be best for him not to drive again. while he's been housebound, he only asks for the same meal every day and would have it for dinner if i allowed him. all he wants is a nacho bellgrande from taco bell. while it is true, he did like it prior to the wreck, so that's not new. he cites that ""its the only thing i know i can eat."" he will eat some other things but they also prove to sometimes be foods that he used to like, but pick at and barely eats a lot of it. he has not be formally diagnosed with cognitive decline, but it seems like he's showing unsettling symptoms just as recent as this weekend. he has a doctors appointment tomorrow (the 20th) and has it marked on his calendar. well i needed to get him a few things at the store today and when i came back he was in bed and was mixed up about if it was time to leave for his appointment. i told him, no it was tomorrow. clearly he was sundowning since it was about 5:30pm, i thought he was just hungry so i made him something, which he ate. then after a few hours he said, ""okay when do we need to leave for the appointment tomorrow?"" i said, ""at 9:30, i will come and pick you up and we can go around 10."" he nodded and said, ""okay at 9:30."" then i left and about 1 1/2 hours later, he called me and asked when do you need to leave for the appointment, to which i said ""at about 10."" he replied, ""so in thirty minutes why aren't you here now then?"" he was mixing up am and pm. he said he had set his clock to get up, and was confused about if the appointment was 11 am or pm. i have never seen him act like this. the appointment tomorrow isn't with his doctor but the nurse practitioner to check on his meds and see if his diabetes is still in check. i'm not sure what i'm supposed to say to her if she asks. i find this behavior alarming and worrisome. could it happen this fast? or is it medication related? he was always good about taking his meds on time everyday. not sure what's going on.",1,My Dad's New Behaviors
"morning all - i'm looking for some advise and/or information in regards to what my family (and mother in law) are experiencing.   my mil has struggled with early onset for the past 13-15 years. over the last (now) 3 weeks, she was moved into a memory care facility, because my fil could no longer provide her care, while also providing himself care. we applauded his efforts, and were actually very excited for this transition.   my mil is 65, wheelchair bound, but at the time of entry to this facility, was able to stay awake and really ""communicate"" in her own way with us (word salad mostly). she did experience some issues with chewing/swallowing, but it was simply the beginning stages of that.   now, after about 2 weeks living in the facility, she is no longer ""awake"" - she simply sleeps 24 hours a day, and almost seems drugged in a sense. quite catatonic, and experiencing a lot of jittering/shaking, as well as not being able to clearly communicate (at all, mainly moans). she is no longer eating at all (they will puree all meals) and she is beginning to choke on small amounts of water.   we, as a family, were not expecting such a quick decline in a span of only 2 weeks - the facility has reassured us that her medication/routine is exactly the same (nothing has changed) - other than her living situation. they did mention that this can be common behavior in a new facility, with new/unfamiliar people, etc.   i'm just curious if any of you have seen this first hand, or experienced this - and if you have any possible advice (or knowledge) to bestow upon us. we're kind of all at a loss - because on one hand, we are concerned for her well being, but also, we aren't sure if a ""rally"" will take place - due to her age, condition.   more or less - i'm just reaching out to this community for some insight! any response is appreciated.",0,Has Anyone Experienced This?
"i don't usually make posts anywhere except r /rollercoasters but i just found this group and figured i would share my recent unfortunate experience.  we just lost my mom last night after a painful 6 year battle with alzheimer's, i had to say my final goodbyes a few hours ago when they came to take her body. her brain and spinal cord will be donated to ucsf for alzheimer's research and the rest of her will be cremated. i'm 26 and never thought i would lose a parent this young, i'm sure there are those who lost their parents or other family members at a younger age but the fact that it was alzheimer's makes it harder. on top of that she was only 64my mom went from a very healthy person who loved teaching and riding her bike, had an amazing sense of humor and the ability to make anyone smile, to someone who could no longer walk or speak, she passed away in her sleep which honestly is the best way to go but it doesn't make it any easier for us and won't for quite some time. she made me who i am today and i will be forever grateful i had the opportunity to know her for as long as i did. i'm hoping within a year or two it will be slightly easier to talk about but for the time being i can't help but get choked up about it. i'll see you on the other side someday mom, love you. my thoughts and prayers go out to families in a similar situation, it's a disgusting disease and i don't wish it upon anyone who hasn't experienced it, it's torturous from the beginning to the end",0,Mom just died
"i spent six days at my folks' last week to watch my dad (73, alzheimer's), so my mom (73)  could go to the beach with friends from thursday-sunday. i live several states away. i would guess dad is still in the middle stage. his short term memory gets worse and worse, his long-term memory is pretty good, he is high-anxiety/obsessive (cleaning) and paranoid (about money, his house), and he has angry outbursts, mainly when he's extremely stressed.mom and dad went across the country to spend two weeks with my siblings and their families (children from 8-17). it went poorly. dad was confused and rattled, had a number of angry episodes (yelling, ranting, etc.) he was confused about where they were, when he could go home, etc.while i was alone with my dad, he did okay. he had three outbursts, mainly about my mother -- where was she? when was she coming back? why did she get to go have fun, and we're running errands for her? i am an american! nobody is going to come into my house and take care of me, because i am a man. i can still do things! a lot of that makes sense. some of it got to be pretty rambling. i found that if i responded calmly, asked what i could do to help, say that i could tell he felt angry, i'm sorry things are tough dad, he would calm down. we watched tv, made food, listened to music, told each other jokes, had a mostly good time together.mom came home, and within an hour, things were bad. she has always been high-anxiety, bossy, and honestly pretty selfish. she rolls her eyes at him, would whisper in front of him, ""you get to go home. i have to live with this."" she corrects his stories, tells him he's wrong, tells him to do things for her without ""please"" and ""thank you."" she's a tough person to spend time with, and he's catered to her for 50 years. unfortunately now, his filters are gone (not that they were great to begin with). it's not like i have never seen them have an argument, which usually resulted in a five-day ""i'm not talking to you,"" but monday was devastating -- swearing (from both -- including f-bombs and ""jesus christ,"" which i have never heard from them). he was mad that she came home and made him a breakfast date to make him go away, so she could have me to herself. he wanted to stay home, and she said that ""he won, because he threw a tantrum, so he's being rewarded for bad behavior."" she literally boo-hooed around the house, i sat with him at the table and held his hand while tears ran down his face, and he said he wished he had a gun and one bullet.so, things are bad. mom kept trying to get me to agree with her that he was difficult, and does he just get to win all of the time. i said it was not a game, that he was sick, and that she needed to find her center and not be so reactive. she cried again, i said this is hard stuff, we support you, he needs more help with his anxiety/anger. she said he's taking medication for those things, and i said they are not working. when i got home, i wrote her a letter that priority #1 is to call his doctor and not wait for the next quarterly appointment (he sees a dementia team, including a psychiatrist). his anxiety/anger/paranoia could be better controlled, and she can do xyz to make things less stressful at home (this was all done as gently as possible, except when i said that she needs to stop mocking him to his face.) i've been home now for four days, she keeps making excuses as to why she can't call the doctor (your dad is just always around...i don't want to talk about him on the phone in front of him). this is the same person who will leave for three hours to go play bridge, or an afternoon to play mahjong, or golf, or out to lunch, or whatever. i don't know why she doesn't just tell him she's going to grab milk, drive around the corner and call, except that she never does anything she doesn't want to do. against my advice, she is now planning a 16-day vacation in arizona to spend four days each with four different families. this will go poorly, but she wants to do it, so too bad, i guess?ok, so, my question is: i have his doctors' names and phone numbers. she e-mailed all of that information to us kids some months ago. i realize that his doctors may not be able to talk to us about my dad or his treatment, but can i relay information to them to try to get him some help? i don't need to tattle on my mom, per se, but his anxiety is very bad, even when she is not around (i had to be careful how i poured water down the sink, because if any sloshed around the sink at all, he'd run over to wipe it all up. he licks his finger and picks poppy seed-sized specks off of the floor. he arranges things neatly (like taking all of the tooth brushes out and putting them in an evenly-spaced row on the counter. plus, he did have terrible outbursts with me, even though he kept also saying: i'm not mad at you. i love you. you're trying to help.) i guess i'm just feeling pretty fried. i do understand that my mom has to live with him every day, and that she also is declining. i am just seriously concerned about his care, and what else could be done to help him. bringing in outside help is of course an option, except my mom is cheap and doesn't want to spend money on that, and honestly, it will make my dad really angry to have a stranger in the house taking care of him. he's still with it enough to figure these things out, but not with it enough that he can care at all for himself (he is not able to manage meds, food, can't drive, etc.) thank you for reading. god bless all of you warriors out there!tl,dr: dad with alzheimer's is having major problems with anxiety, paranoia, ocd, anger; caregiver wife does not want to call to get more help.",1,Can I communicate with Dad's doctor?

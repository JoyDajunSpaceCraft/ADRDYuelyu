"hey guys, so i grandmother lost her smartphone and now she won't keep bothering everyone about where it is. although, i know that if we give her a new phone she will not like it. how should i handle this? this being alzheimer's, you'll have to repeat that answer often because she'll likely ask it repeatedly. a smart phone is too smart for an alzheimer's sufferer; hell, mine is even too smart for me, and i'm the caregiver. not willing to shell out another $800 for another smartphone doomed to be lost soon, i got dh a low-end model for about $150. so i got him a flip phone (about $30) - same story. now if he wants to make a call, i dial my phone and hand it to him. then she could use it in the wi-fi, but have the calling turned off. we've decided we'll only be getting dad mid/low range samsungs due to his familiarity and their phone finding abilities are a bit more advanced than the usual. several years ago i went to a cell phone store with my children. they gave my kids some of the old former display phones as toys. i don’t know if they still have this or will do this but it might be an option (although obviously the phone wouldn’t work, but that is probably not a bad thing). i agree with all the posts. however i want to add my experience. my lo used her phone for a long time. it made her feel connected to the family and friends she knew around the country. i think she knows what it is... or something. all this to say - balancing quality of life for your lo, yourself, and your pocketbook is tough. best of luck. the best way to handle useless questions (my mom has a lot of them) is to distract. for example:   where is dad? “i don’t know, oh say would you like a cold drink?” stick to the here and now. i don't think she'll notice if it doesn't have service",0,This is
i stumbled on this 1-hour documentary this weekend and wanted to  share with you all. it's a former cnn reporter who is now in her 80s and  has the apoe-e4 gene and wanted to know how likely she is to get  the disease.,0,This is
"but for the past year or so like clockwork around 8pm he wants to go home and it takes around an hour or more to make him ""stop"" and be content and stay. man it's so taxing. i mean he has incontinence bowel and urinary so i take care of that, and all the other stuff that comes with the territory no problem but this constant ""goin home"" gets me.. we have several different techniques that work with my dad:  the obvious one i take him home, we are lucky that we can leave town drive a short distance and reenter town on a different road. when he says home he means bed (especially at night) so mum takes him up to their room and he settles. a dog walk around the block, again exiting their estate on one road and reentering on a different road to break the cycle. obviously some of these won't fit your situation but please ask any questions and i will try my best to help. sometimes it means they want to go back to when they weren't sick. i'd grab his hand or hug him (to reassure him) and say something like ""ok, we'll head home after we x (insert activity here)"". my grandmother always wants to start the i don’t know why they brought me here conversation. usually she veers back off topic with the questions i’m asking her and forgets the original complaint. it doesn’t make it any less irritating, but it calms her down when i give her the options. my mom does the same thing, but she is already bedridden. i will just say ""we're here,"" and mention the name of community we live in, but in our case it's the same house for 50 years, but sometimes she still mentions europe where she grew up and asks for her mom who also passed 45 years ago. you might have to say something and reference the name of community he is talking about if it's not the home you are at now. it's like a switch in atmosphere, and most patients with alzheimer's respond pleasurably to music; it's an area of the brain that remains functional longer than others. it helps distract them and change their focus from ""home"" to the music. i like u/kitkatinkerbell's suggestions and have used some of the same techniques when helping my sil care for my brother, especially ""taking him home"" by getting in the car, riding several miles and returning, saying ""we're home!"" i admire you so much for caring for your dad! that's such a loving, caring way to honor your father. ...in the day- to-day struggle, i know how much of a strain it can be, how much stress and fatigue you must be feeling. i hope you're finding support with other caregivers who understand your challenges, and i hope you have family or others who can offer relief for you so you can get the rest you need. bless you! cheers to all the hard work you have done to take care of him! since it is always happening at the same time, it may be from a long forgotten routine from years back. try to engage and ask if there is someone they want to see at home, or is there something they need to do? or if they just want to be at home. it may be physical, sensory ,(is it too loud, too quiet? hth",1,This is
"fil is in al but not memory care, so he can come and go. i am worried that he’ll over do it and not be able to make it back home and get stranded. he wears a medical alert necklace 24/7 but it doesn’t have a gps locate so i was thinking about adding an air tag with the kind of water resistant cover you use for dog tags. thoughts? now is the time to start prevention measures so that he does not get lost. often seniors that go missing are in early stages. this is when they are most ambulatory and can easily get confused. just last week a lady where i live was still driving and went missing. she was in the early stages and her family was still letting her drive. my mom thought it was ok to let my dad drive shortly after he was diagnosed and he went the wrong way down a street. i put my foot down and said no more driving. my mother's assisted living facility had a system just for this phase of dementia. she wore a bracelet that triggered an alarm if she attempted to through any of the exterior doors. of course, it was an added option that i begrudgingly paid, but it worked quite well. my mother could do anything she liked within the facility (including interior courtyards) but had to have an escort if she left the building. i'm actually surprised your facility is allowing someone with alzheimer's (albeit in the early phases) to be in assisted living without some sort of safeguard. i tried airtags with my kids. it's ok but doesn't give you minute-by-minute updates. it works great if they go to a friend's house after school, but near useless at an amusement park as it doesn't update frequently enough. if your fil got lost, the airtag may tell you where he was 1 minute ago or 30 minutes ago. i am in a similar situation. i use find my friends on my mom’s phone to track her. you can add alerts for when they leave certain places, are not at certain places etc. of course only works if they have their phone on them. i also track her vehicle’s gps. we considered the air tag but being an apple user myself, id have to swap between her apple id and mine to see it which would get difficult. tile is another one you can use, but it does emit a sound when trying to track which could be startling. there’s a lot of ways to track and drawbacks to each. as long as you find one that’s reliable and works for you, all the better. keeping them safe is top priority. i guess he doesn't take a mobile phone around with him? if so there are apps like life360 that will give you tracking at all times. i haven't used apple air tags but have heard stories about how they helped people retrieve their stolen bikes pretty well so its worth investigating. how could you guarantee he always had it with him? &nbsp;   check out these little spark nano gps trackers. they are super inexpensive. my sis got them for her teen's car a while back and really liked it. we'll most likely be getting one for mom soon-ish. i have an airtag for my hubby. (about stage 5-6) i have an iphone as does our three children. the airtag  is assigned to my iphone and shows up on the apple find my ap under the “items” tab. i have activated the “share my location” option on my phone with each of my kids. they can see where my hubby and i are. this is a safety support for both of us. i put the airtag inside hubs wallet as he always puts his wallet in his pants and i secured in place with double sided tape. this has worked well for us.",0,This is
"he'll take money out, then forget that he took money out and then take more out. (you shouldn't even be driving himself to the bank where the atm. we do the best weekend to stop him but it's not easy to keep track of him 24/7)  he gets a state issue disability check every month. and our mortgage payments are set to automatically withdraw from his account. always has been. takes out 400 to 600 a month to buy pot. in the comments section of a different post someone suggested contacting social services about having his check split between him and someone else. something about how his bank has an overdraft thing. which means social services can't give him a certain amount of money knowing that it's only going to pay off the negative balance and then he won't have any left. i hope i'm explaining this right. i hope i'm making sense. we were trying to ask them to put $400 into his account as an allowance. and then put the rest of it into my mother's account. but because his account's always in the negative, they wouldn't do it. could we ask the bank to cancel the overdraft service? i know typically no one else can make changes to a bank account without the account holder there. but if we explain the medical situation, and we're not asking to take any money from him. or if we had some kind of doctor's note explaining he's incompetent, could we then take that to the bank and put my mom's name on his account as well? sorry if this is long and rambling. the various things you want to do would require him giving you durable poa (legal, business things). i take it you haven't had that discussion yet? what is your mom's role here? if your dad has been diagnosed with alzheimer's, he shouldn't be driving. it would be good if somehow the topic of diminishing capacity could be broached, or you have many large fights ahead of you. cut up his cards with scissors, take his tires off and roll them to a friend's house. seriously, he could kill someone driving. get serious. my dad used to do something similar. he was taking out cash every week because he only understood cash as really money any more. at one point the bank wouldn't even let him take out as much as he wanted. not sure if they were really allowed to do that... but they were aware of his issues. his car got taken away soon after that so i would have to take him to the bank. does he have a poa or anything in place? if not do it now while he's still somewhat with it. i used to have to drag my dad to the bank because he has a trust which makes everything a pain. he would just sit there and smile while i did everything for him. the bank was aware of the situation and was pretty nice about it. i think they're used to elderly customers having issues and in the end if it's a good bank they want to do what is best for their customer. you need power of attorney and to prevent him from getting to the assets in the first place. absolutely file for that asap. explain the situations to his doctors - they may not realize he’s as far gone as he is. you may also need to switch doctors and see someone who can properly evaluate him, because that is exactly why power of attorney was invented. to address situations like this. absence an incompetence hearing, and judgment, you need his signature for poa. you get it set up first, and then take him to the lawyer or whoever can do it for you, in our case, it was the bank. i don't know where you live, but cannabis is one of the most beneficial treatments for alzheimer's patients. far better and safer than anti-psychotic drugs. unfortunately, when it comes time for a care facility, that will not be available to him. that's my opinion and my experience. here's a good article :   move up the day that the money is taken out of the bank so it doesn’t sit there. speak to the branch manager about removing the overdraft protection.",0,This is
"short version (i can add info if needed), my fil is stage 4 dementia. roommate almost died and is still recovering. family member who was helping lost her husband. i am the legal guardian and i made arrangements for fil to go into assisted living. he can’t afford in home care and he doesn’t own his house (it’s in a trust, so he can use it until he dies but he doesn’t own it). he initially agreed with the move but now he’s changed his mind. the problem is that his house is rented to help pay for his care and the help he needed to live alone is no longer available. the reasons he gives for wanting to leave al are not grounded in reality. he’s not progressed enough for memory care, but al is optional and so they won’t keep him there against his will. i keep seeing advice not to try to correct someone with dementia, but if he walks out of there i don’t know what to do with him. see if you can visit the place a few times and tell him he lives there and you will be back to move his things there. maybe you and the al social worker could sit down with him and go over all his concerns. additionally, you need to remind him it's not as simple as going back to his old house, because it's rented out to someone else, and the roommate/caregiver is no longer available to help him with day-to-day affairs. explore options - maybe he would prefer a different al placement? you and the social worker can also go over some of his deluded beliefs (don't call them that in front of him!). show him where the eye drops are, and ask if he'd like someone to administer them to him. my dh who i am trying to put into memory care at present, has had similar delusions. and when he has lost a wallet by leaving it somewhere, he states that someone ""stole"" it. he can't locate most of the things he needs (constantly losing toothbrushes). good of you to look out for this man. my dad is in memory care and went through a similarly tough patch where he was paranoid, angry, argumentative, and distrustful. he worried about people taking his car and money (this included my mom, who he said his lawyer would be contacted, because she needed to get out of his house.) this passed after time, but it was a tough roughly 2 years. keep your fil a little more comfortable by finding lies that will calm him down. i'm constantly saying this to my mother during every conversation i have with her and she's been in memory care for almost a year. now that she is settled (she still isn't happy about it), she fears change and when i bring up finding a new facility for her, the thought of changing her routine scares her and she stops complaining (for a little while)  i was staunchly against medicating my mother for behavioral reasons because i didn't want to lose what little was left of her inside. move him, medicate him one thing i did with my dad is tell him we found him “an apartment with help” that was just a home base for him. i drove back there with him in my car, and when he saw the building, he said, “that’s a bad place.” i parked and he asked, “what are we doing here?” i said, “i need to speak to the lady at the front desk.” “should i stay in the car?” “no, come with me, i said.” he came with me, i checked us both in, walked him to his room, and we said goodbye like everything was fine. also, if he’s paranoid he may not want to take additional medications, but if he’s already taking medications, you could speak to his doctor about adding something for his mood (assuming you have medical poa?). that has helped my dad. good luck! my husband and sil try to logic her out of these delusions with evidence. she refuses to discuss assisted living and lives in the same town as sil. they check on her a few times a week, and my husband will stay with her 2-4 weeks at a time. (we are in another state) the other 2 siblings are no help. (she was also not the nicest person in younger years so they see her 1-2 times a year out of duty.) if he is a danger to himself, you can gain power of attorney and guardianship. my grandmother had moved al twice and both times she has gone through a phase of this when she first moved in. it went on months the first time, but she had progressed by the second move and it lasted a few weeks.",1,This is
"is there any want to stop/help a grandparent from leaving the house especially at night? i think they’ve tried locks but she figures it out. we bought some of those toddler door handle safety covers and that really did the trick. we also put those cheap slide locks at the base of the door and dad never noticed it to open the door. we had those cheap alarms on the doors but the rest of us would always forget about them and scare the crap out of ourselves when we went out the door. dad wasnt too bad about wandering at night but there was a short time he would get up. double keyed deadbolt. depending how far along your grandparent is, you may try one of those door decals that makes it look like a bookcase or something. also, an alarm on the door is wise. my fil installed double-keyed deadbolt locks and always keeps the keys hidden. door alarms - not terribly expensive and they wake you or an overnight attendant who can then intervene;",0,This is
"my grandfather has alzheimer’s (or possibly dementia) and is in full care by my grandmother (who admittedly is not the best with pushing for better medical care or testing from doctors). this morning he had an episode where he was laying down in bed, seemingly awake (eyes open and moving) but unresponsive to her calling him, touching him, etc. they took vitals and said that he was all good in that are and my grandfather refused to go to the hospital so they didn’t push it and left. my grandmother took him to his regular doctor today and said that it was just another stage of his decline. i am still concerned that it could be something else because i have never heard of it. i am the first point of contact for them but i am living out of state and trying to do my best from afar. does anyone have any experience with this? or can provide any more insight on what i should be doing next time i am there? my mom had a few episodes like this before we knew she had actual alzheimer’s. i actually think they co tributes to quicker cognitive decline, but the doctors always tested for stroke and other things and said they couldn’t find anything. i do believe it is a form of stroke, maybe medicine just hasn’t caught up with it yet.",0,This is
"my dad has been in memory care for a couple of months now. recently he had backpain and wouldn't leave his chair. so they sent him to the hospital to be checked on. they didn't find a source of the backpain (which seemed to go away on its own) but they did find blood clots in the lungs (blood thinners prescribed) and he was dehydrated so they pumped him with liquid. he was in bed for 3 or so days. when i came to pick him up from the hospital he couldn't walk. i was really annoyed that the hospital wasn't helpful in that regard, but i chalked it up to his feet being swollen from the fluids. with a lot of effort we finally managed to get him in the car, and back to the home. so i called today to see how he's doing and they said not great and that he's not walking on his own. apparently they can get him upright with assistance but he can't walk. the memory care doctor will be seeing him tomorrow so i know i just need to sit tight and not karen until then, but i'm just so frustrated. dr. google is telling me older people lose that function a lot faster after bed rest, but it just blows my mind. it’s not uncommon for this to happen after a hospital visit, but it’s dependent on a lot of factors. previous conditions obviously contribute but it could just be the new phase he is entering. or could it pass in the following week, as this happens too. the doctor should be able to determine what’s going on. i know edema causes a lot of issues with this population’s mobility, but exercise and compression socks can help fix that; a pt or ot could be suggested as well. i’d say wait to hear what the doctors says. keep us posted. look into massage. it helps my husband with his arthritic spine. medicare covers it under certain conditions, which includes chronic back pain. also, if your patient has been hospitalized for three days, medicare covers 100% of a nursing home stay as long as discharged directly from hospital to nursing home. (check your insurance but we recently did this.) if you can't swing that, maybe physical therapy. good luck. i had a similar experience with my mom. within a few days of moving into memory care she had several falls and then could no longer walk. that was right around new years and she has not walked since. sorry to say this was the beginning of the end for my grandmother. the muscles deteriorate fast and ingrained muscle memory that is not exercised for a couple days evaporates. remember that alzheimer’s attacks the brain’s ability to make conscious choices first. the decision of lifting your foot to step; planting it firmly, feeling confident enough on the first foot’s ability to bear weight 100% for a moment, that you lift the other… this is where she got frustrated and yelled. we tried asking her sweetly to let us help and she yelled and refused for hours.",0,This is
"hey guys. my father-in-law is under 60 years old and was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer’s about 10 years ago. my mother-in-law had always said that she would like to put him in a secure safe assisted-living facility if/when he starts to get violent or too difficult to deal with. well, now it is “well he didn’t mean to hit me, he thought i was the dog” or “he isn’t going to hit me. he’s just making those motions with his fists.”  let me preface this by saying she has “read all the books“ and she even leads an alzheimer’s support group. i know she knows what she’s doing but i think her judgment is clouded because it is her husband. she is not admitting to her kids the full extent of what she has to deal with on a daily basis. she’s not in denial about the fact of the disease is progressive, and that eventually he will be beyond her capacity to help, but i don’t think she is ready to admit that he is far beyond that point. she wants to have kids and grandkids over but also does not want her husband to be upset and stressed and angry. her kids legitimately had to have a meeting with her to convince her to get help just two times a week with an outside service that can come and give her a break. the hardest part is that she has told me that she doesn’t want to put him in a home because it will make her feel guilty. i know it is hard for me to understand because it is not my husband, but it is so hard to watch her lose control of him and have to take care of him or take him for drives when she really wants to spend time with her children and grandchildren. are we being insensitive in thinking that he is more than ready to be in a secure facility? how do we navigate the conversation that she no longer has the capabilities as one woman to care for a 6 foot 200 pound relatively healthy otherwise man with early onset alzheimer’s? side note: the facility has an excellent reputation and we have family that works there. any guidance or suggestions would be appreciated. there's a saying that by the time a family is ready to consider placing someone in assisted living what they need is memory care. for many people with dementia getting medication right can help a lot with agitation and violence, too, and it doesn't sound like there's a geriatric psychiatrist in the mix. it's definitely worth consulting one. and on a practical note, is it clear that there's money for this facility? that may be a part of your mil's reluctance that she's not voicing. a visit to a certified elder law attorney (even though he's under 65) would also be really important in figuring out how to preserve what she has if medicaid is going to be involved, as it is for most people. in my state also facilities have to have a special license for people under 65, and those who have that license and also accept medicaid patients are few in number. (though those facilities may accept private-pay patients who will switch over to medicaid when the money runs out--that's something that needs to be explicitly asked, and it's also worth asking whether there's a difference in services when they move to medicaid (shared rooms are likely, for instance). has your mil seen the facility you are considering? does the facility have a social worker with whom she can speak and voice her concerns? not a sales counselor but a real social worker. has she discussed her situation with her support group? i have a friend who was hospitalized after her husband with dementia assaulted her. once the person with dementia becomes violent it is past time to make a change. it is my husband who has alzheimer's, and i expect to have him enter a memory care facility in the next ten days. i feel no guilt! he always told me ""i want to stay home, i don't want to go to an institution"" and i always answered ""i will keep you at home as long as i can, but the time may come when i can't do it any more."" that time is now. actually an admissions coordinator asked when i would want him to move in and i said meekly, ""yesterday?"" having to make that call to move a loved one to a memory care or other secured facility is incredibly difficult even knowing it's the best thing for everyone when you get to that point. my mom struggled with it the most and wanted to talk to my dad about it. i discouraged it as it would only make my dad angry (he was too far long at this point) and wouldn't remember. what finally helped my mom realize was when i told her my concern was if something happened to her, his primary caregiver, we'd be forced to put him somewhere and rushed. if we decided as a family, we could research places and coordinate his move for it to go as smoothly as possible. we moved my dad in to memory care february 2021 and he passed in november. my mom broke her arm and needed surgery three weeks after we moved my dad in to memory care. i had to move in with my mom for the first few days as she could not do much on her own then her sister had to come stay with her after surgery. so, had we not made the decision, the decision would have been made for us when my mom broke her arm. mom and dad are on the short end. both were rns for 25-30 years. dad, the one with alzheimer’s, has amazingly reduced mobility. (he had polio in his teens, so he got off with a limp.) mom is his caregiver until she makes up her mind. personal pride still reigns. you know, until dad falls again…  i’ve volunteered to help out, but it is up to her to accept help of any kind. so... he hits the dog? i would say gently that i would like to take over care decisions. if not, i would have a social worker come for an evaluation of both parties.",0,This is
"hi all,  sorry in advance for this rant but it’s half two in the morning and i realized i just need to get things off my chest in order to sleep. i’ve been caring for a 92 year old family friend with alzheimer’s for the past couple years. i (m22) live in the upstairs of her socal home and have been doing so for just over 10 years. my dad had to move here for work, but socal is very expensive. thankfully she allowed us to rent her upstairs at an incredible price. my dad passed away in 2017 so i’ve been here alone with her for almost 5 years. her alzheimer’s is getting to be quite advanced e.g. i keep getting this awful feeling like i’m catching alzheimer’s just by caring for her, being around her, or touching things she’s touched. i know you can’t catch alzheimer’s and i know those suffering from alzheimer’s need just as much love and attention as we all do, but it’s like a horrible phobia that i can’t shake! i’ve been distant with her, and her daughter only comes to visit for a week or so every couple months. all she really has is me and a few friends who visit for an hour here and there once or twice a week. i just want to do what is right for her and care properly, but it’s impossible with whatever this is i’m experiencing. thanks for reading and any advice would be much appreciated. you definitely can’t “catch,” alzheimer’s, but stress and depression can certainly cause you to be forgetful or have “brain fog” temporarily. i would have a real talk with her daughter about plans to keep her mom safe by bringing in a caregiver or moving her to a facility. i'm 67 and caring for my 81 year old husband who has alzheimer's. since the early days of his diagnosis, i've wondered ""is this contagious? my support group reassures me that it's due to picking up all the cognitive load that is cast off by the patient in this picture. my latest stressor is my husband likes to wander around the house picking things up and putting them elsewhere. he is teetering right at the border between middle stage and late stage, so he takes a lot of structuring, prodding, reminding, etc. i am hoping he can go to memory care within the month. and i could use a little more of an empty nest. good luck to you. one day your selfhood will return! stress, less sleep than usual, all things that can cause what you're feeling. for your sake and hers, i hope you have an idea of your future plans because if something happens, you may be homeless real quick. try to make sure to get some time to yourself where you can rest, relax, etc. best of luck op! and from such young age caring for an elderly alzhms person on your own, wow super very tough, i don't know how you manage - what a legend!. seems you're developing a stress-induced issue? actually, most if not all sole carers do. depression, anxieties, insomnia, eds, ocds, other & all sorts of mental health issues carers develop. so sorry eh, i feel for you, it's great you are aware & reaching out! i guess, your memory issues are result of stress, and the worry about that, is tripping another stress reaction. (some similar things have happened to me a few times too, over the past years i've been caring for my mum, lost my whole life & all my friends & job to move countries back here to care for her. not even trained well paid professionals can do this sort of thing alone for indeterminate years on and on, it's intense. and unless the family are paying you an adequately substantial amount of money to help out, you need to have time to  be living your own life, right? ok you're getting a great deal on rent - but how much of your time and emotional & mental health are you losing? like i get the strong bond you have with kind old lady, and you want to be a good human, but you can't run yourself into the ground for other people and cheap rent. i think for a start you need respite time-off, for sure. some counselling, would also probably be helpful. a proper talking with the daughter to get some other solutions organised. and are you connected with carer support orgs? so often, in the caring for someone else, the carer themselves are left by the wayside. they endure & suffer being the main pillars of support, they also need aid & assistance to remain healthy happy & strong! alzheimers .org or dementia .org can assist you with finding options & details for all those things. they are experts in all aspects of memory-loss diseases & conditions, have tons of free resources, information, counselling, telephone helplines, etc etc. contact & speak with or visit yr area alzhms / dementia org asap! they were life-savers for me, & my mum. of course it's the daughters responsibility to actually organise & arrange services / respite / in-home care / going residential / whatever for her mother, but who knows sometimes family members who live at a distance haven't really got around to finding out all that information - it might be helpful if you can at least get some printed literature / pamphlets / booklets whatever for her, to get things at least productively starting moving along somewhat. and she needs to start organising some more help sooner, not later, not in 3 months 6 months time. it's great you're persevering with college, good on you! i hope alzhms org can help you out with lot of options & info. hang in there, best of luck to you! give an update some time, i'll be thinking of you! \* hugs \* i lived in a house with a very old woman that had dementia. i provided the evening meal and did some laundry until she had to go into a home. i was desperate for help and nobody understood. even the health nurse didn't bother pressing her to see how far gone she really was. i found out how woeful the system is for coping with things like this, even the professionals other than in the hospital. because an ambulance came to pick her up one day when it got too much. only a week before i told her gp that her mental deterioration need urgent attention and i stressed the urgent part. i feel for what you're going through, it's bitterly tough. i found a new level of misery living there. i'm also sorry you lost your dad, i lost mine in 2016.",0,This is
"hey all. new member here. i guess i’ll give a quick background story; my maternal grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimer’s back when i was in late grade school/early middle school. i was relied upon heavily as her caregiver (assisting my mom and a daytime aid we had most weekdays) and it was traumatic, to say the least. my mom was diagnosed officially last month, but i knew it had been coming for at least two years. the pandemic and some bad doctors really prolonged the diagnosis finally being on paper. i guess i y need to talk to other people who get it. my boyfriend, whom i live with, isn’t as supportive as i need. i do not speak about her like she’s dead, but i can’t call my mom for advice. or to gossip. or to joke about our weird family anymore. we can’t go shopping and try on clothes together anymore. it’s simple things. i feel that (he is a bit abusive but i’m looking for a way out of this, i wish we hadn’t moved in together, it’s so complicated right now for various reasons…) he almost tries to minimize my issues because my mom “is still here”. some days he’s very loving and consoling but most he’s cold and is very critical of her doctors. he’s never met them, but he always makes sure to tell me every negative assumption he’s made. i finally have her with an excellent geriatric neuropsych, and he’s insisting that more could be done medication wise. i feel diminished. like, you don’t think i’ve discussed these things to death with medical professionals?! i’m the only child and my dad is no spring chicken and i worry about how this will take a toll on him. but more than anything… i miss my mom. and my partner is not comforting about it. he has a slew of his own family issues which he expects me to always help with, and i do, but him insisting i’m wrong because i use past tense for certain things regarding my mother is irritating. i’ll never be able to go to a broadway show with her again or bake together at christmas like we did every single year. i’m just so deeply  drained physically mentally and emotionally and all i don’t know how much more of his crap i can take while i handle my mom’s needs. i hate alzheimer’s and i hate the lack of empathy among people. thanks for reading, love and strength to you all 💜 i’m so sorry you’re dealing with such a double whammy of losing your mom and an unsupportive partner. i’ve tried to explain to my partner how many seemingly intangible things i’ve lost with my mother over the last few years (advice, consoling, shopping), and he doesn’t get it either. all i can say is get support where you can, from therapy and a caregiving/alzheimer’s community. i believe men don’t understand the connection between a mom and daughter. my husband (75) has ad and although i was able to see my daughter , we haven’t been able do do any of the fun things we use to do together . it must be harder on you not having those mother / daughter talks and joking around. my best advice is to enjoy the time you do have and  maybe get some videos of her while you can . also a book that gets recommended that may help you. it’s called the 36 hour day your dad may find it helpful as well. best wishes to you and a big hug from a mom. i am sorry you have to go through this and not get the support you need. you said so much of what i felt when my mom went through the progression of alzheimers. i grieved the loss of the mom i knew for 72 years. i missed calling her when i just needed my mom to comfort me and sympathize. i missed so much. then i thought i was so prepared when she did pass away last month. i grieved for her when she was alive,but then when she was actually gone, i couldn't even hug her or kiss her cheek or stroke her hair. i know for myself i had to find some acceptance that i couldn't get the old mom back, so i did my best to find ways to be with her. honestly, some times i really struggled to visit her,but i did usually feel better afterward, knowing i spent time with her.",0,This is
"growing up i didn’t get to see my dads side grandmother a lot. she lived a state over, and so i only got to see her maybe once a summer and over a holiday, unless she drove to see us, and those weeks always went by way too fast. she sold that house and moved to florida when i was in middle school. over my time in high school she developed alzheimer’s, and we only ever talk when i call her, and it’s dependent on her being at the phone or not having lost her phone. and i loved the talks we had. it took her a minute to realize it was me,but when she reconnected those dots she cheered up, unlike any conversation she has had with my dad, mom, or sister the past year, and she started asking all kinds of questions about things i didn’t think she’d know about or remember. after we hung up the phone, i cried, it’s been two hours, and i’m unable to do anything else but think about the conversation we just had. 😭 with alzheimer's, you grieve the loss of your loved one long before they breathe their last breath. i'm sorry you are experiencing this. a lot of elderly people really value cards and letters. you could make a nice difference in your grandmother's life if you would send her one card or letter every week. it probably doesn't come naturally to you because of your generation, but i think it would have a big impact. firstly, i want to say i’m so sorry this is affecting your grandmother and now by extension you so badly. my grandmother developed alzheimer’s when i was in middle school and i spent a good chunk of my teen years being a caregiver. i wouldn’t change my circumstances as i, like you, just wanted to see her. i’m sad reading this because i have been in your shoes (in it again with my own mom atm but this ain’t about me) so i fully understand and feel your pain. as the commenter above me said, alzheimer’s is hell because we are grieving the loss of someone who isn’t physically “gone” yet for a long time. i’d also agree with them that cards and letters would be a nice thing to consider. if this isn’t too personal to ask, can she still read ok? only asking because my mom is at a stage where she’s losing that ability, but i’ve discovered that if i can make her a small painting or piece of art, she really cherishes it and it’s something they can always look at and find new meaning in, and even subconsciously make a connection to you in it in their minds. you can dm me if you ever want to talk to someone, i’m sadly no stranger to this evil illness. i wish i could give you a big hug right now (if you’re into hugs, that is lol) but i hope at least me letting you know that you’re understood and not alone can provide some comfort. sending tons of love to you and your grandma and family 💜",0,This is
"if anyone can understand, it’s you guys. i (33f) am my dads only caregiver. he doesn’t need full time care necessarily at this point but it’s coming. i teach 75 minutes away from my home so my dad can stay in the home he’s lived in for nearly 30 years and i fully financially take care of my dad except for his small ssi check. my sister was going to visit from the other coast and take my dad for a few days while i was on spring break so i could live a few days of my adult life in my own home, getting things done around the house that i can’t get done otherwise. woke up to a text that she’s been covid exposed and is waiting on a test but most likely won’t be able to come out and visit. i’d be lying if i said i didn’t lay in bed sobbing at 6am because i’d gotten my hopes up at having a few days of freedom. tonight, went to check the mail and got the notice that the doctors office didn’t get the form in to ihss for our initial assessment and so he’s been denied. there’s no end in sight and once again i’m laying in bed sobbing. i have no help, i can’t get help, and i don’t have hope. i’m beyond burnt out and i’m doing this alone. my friends can’t understand because they don’t live this life. i can’t get to a support group and so my entire therapy sessions are just me desperately crying to my therapist. i don’t need advice. i just need someone to understand what this is. for what it's worth, as caregivers, we do relate to what you're going through. it feels like you're using yourself up taking care of your loved one, missing out on your best years. i wish i could offer more than to say hang in there, it's not forever, even though it might feel like it. take the small moments to yourself when you can, and take some solace in knowing you're doing the right thing. the role of a primary caregiver is usually a lonely one. family members may have good intentions, but are not involved on a daily basis, and soon tire of the intrusion into their lives. what's more, they tend to offer advice when they are not familiar with the real circumstances. because of that they have not been able to develop coping mechanisms to stay in the game. in ten years, i had about a total of two weeks away, and most of that time was spent in the hospital for surgeries and other things, and the family, frustrated by my mother's behavior brought her back to me, the same day i was released from the hospital. in the beginning, i had a knee replacement and because i couldn't get around, elected to take ten days in rehab, so i could partially recover, but my family could not handle my mom, so they brought her back home and dropped her off, and left her with no way for her to get around or anyone to help, so i got two days of rehab before i had to go home. you will be criticized for your decision making by family members who feel guilt for their own inabilities. in my case, they've talked behind my back about how she should have been in a nursing home long ago, even though they were not willing to take on that process themselves. bringing professional caregivers into a home where you also live is usually not practical, and as the patient advances they may become hostile to strangers in their home. in my case, two of my sisters are nurses, and when the time finally came, i threw up my hands and forced them to make the arrangements for the care facility. caregiving for a parent is a noble undertaking that is full of surprises and changes along the way, and only the exceptionally strong are fit for the job, so know that. i am sorry for your difficulties, but steel yourself, because you have only begun on this journey that's full of twists and turns. my wife and i worked hard all our lives and had such grand plans for retirement and this damn disease changed all that. i get up really early so i can have a little me time. see if you qualify for some in home help. is there anything you can do to give yourself a treat or reward? some method of self-soothing or relaxation? my mom died four months ago now and i'm still getting myself together. i'm so used to taking her from one appointment to the next and eventually her needing nursing home care where the phone rang multiple times a week regarding her rage, i still can't hear the phone ring without panic kicking in. i feel your pain 😞  i've been taking care of my parents for 3 years now as an only child with not much help from my own family. both have dimentia and i was just told two days ago my mom won't be able to ever come back home unless she has 24-7 care at home. that's going to be impossible for me to do so it's a crap shoot getting the help from dss. i also just had my first kid and he's only 6 months old so dealing with it all has me literally burnt the fuck out. praying for you in these tough times sister. my mom always said what you put in into life you'll be rewarded in other things that surround you. love your dad. your doing a great job thus far and god will repay you in many other ways. there's no playbook or guide for what we're doing but it's the least we can do for the people that raised us to be great people in life. goodluck. patience is a virtue 🙏 .hugs. i also understand the just crying at the therapist. mine had hearing aids and discreetly turned them down during our sessions. hah! i understand. teaching is also high stress and requires a lot of giving as well. will sister reschedule her visit? even though you won’t be on break-you could get some relief/normalcy? do you have summer off? can she come then? the form—can you re-start the process? the paperwork and appointments can be so overwhelming and they seem to come in waves. one step at a time. write things down and cross them off when done(helps me so i can see progress). find small things you can do for yourself. sometimes it may be having a good cry in the shower. or a quiet cup of coffee. wishing you well. i’ve cried my eyes out more times than i can remember. and for sure, siblings can’t really understand what we go through - they can say they appreciate all you do, and you can tell them all the stressful things you’re dealing with, but they truly don’t get it. i hope soon your sister will be able to come give you those few days off, and then not only do you get time to yourself, but she can also see firsthand what it’s been like for you. take care  eta: i know you said you don’t want advice, but i noticed you said you can’t get to a support group - the alzheimer’s association has free zoom caretaker support groups - it’s helped me to talk to people that get what’s going on, but also have been dealing with it all for a long time and have wonderful advice 🤍 i very much understand! i’m 30 f dealing with sharing responsibility with my sister for my mom (70 f) and her care. my dad died about 6 months ago and my mom is still living at home but unable to do instrumental tasks (cooking, cleaning, filling her own meds). it’s been a massive struggle especially since i’m expecting my first baby in about 6 weeks. i get burnt out very easily and it’s so hard to not get frustrated. it’s hard, just starting out in your life, and having to take care of a parent. denied for what? big hugs. and if health insurance, etc. the disease i could almost cope with, but the shit system of us laissez-faire capitalist mangled hell care is the thing that's really messing me up. i understand.",0,This is
"hello so trigger warning i guess is in order but a week ago we had to put our dog down as she was in pain from a tumor and that night my grandma stopped eating and the morning after she stopped drinking so it was obvious she was starting to decline and looking to be entering the death process on  wednesday she seemed to get worse and worse by the day and by that morning her 02 sats were ""low 90s high 80s"" friday she calmed down enough to have her go to a nursing home because her care was overwhelming mom and she required almost 24/7 care so we had her transported there and we came to visit that night and they had a o2 tube in her nose which confused us so we asked and they told us her 02 during transport was 71 so they put a tube in and then they just kept it going at the home i get them doing it during a transport but not at the home they say its for her comfort and wont prolong death but i dont buy it to be honest it seems like a part of death and i feel some people with alzheimers die this way so it seems like eliminating a way of death which to me is prolonging death at a certain point her body just wont function on that low of a oxygen level so giving her oxygen seems like prolonging i get that it might be for comfort but to me death is uncomfortable the body doesnt like dying i can understand the morphine and haldol because those dont do anything other than help with pain and restlessness it doesnt help life but the oxygen seems like it would help her live longer she needs to pass soon and quickly she wouldve hated living like this and she would want it to be as quick as could happen also this nursing home is questionable i went to check on her today and the door was wide open which would be fine if i didnt walk in on her completely naked on the bottom edge of her bed just sprawled out and she had a few visitors earlier shes supposed to get morphine every hour an haldol every two hours both people said in the few hours they were there they never had a nurse come in and they had to get them to go give her her medicine which irritates me so im kinda questionable on their opinion so id like an outside opinion  tl;dr: my grandma is dying shes at a nursing home and they have her on o2 which confuses me since it seems like it would prolong life the home says its just for comfort but it seems as if it would prolong life im all for comfort but death is uncomfortable and it seems like they are preventing that way of death so does o2 prolong life not an expert. my understanding is that oxygen just makes it easier to breathe, it doesn’t heal infection or damage to the lungs it just makes it so your lungs don’t have to work as hard for basic breathing. it’s not the same as intubation. my grandma died at home in march. she will just need a doctor referral, i'm pretty sure. also do you guys have a medical directive? we have one for my dad that covers all types of care and we made a decision as a family what we would allow and not allow. takes the pressure off last minute decisions. i am an rn on a dementia unit. i see this a lot. current belief is that supplemental oxygen is for comfort. in addition, we administer ativan liquid and morphine at scheduled intervals. most of my residents pass quietly and (i assume) comfortably. i assume your parents or other relatives are your grandmother's medical poa, and have already had end-of-life discussions to know what she would want. you don't need to understand the reasons for the interventions. if she is not being medicated on schedule, call it to the home's attention and ask for an explanation. also inform the medical poa, usually a relative.",0,This is
"hi there, my dad lives in a memory care unit. he has become aggressive with staff which is so opposite his personality. i know it’s just the dementia progression. he got admitted to psych this evening and they called me to tell me they had to restrain him to his bed because he assaulted a nurse. i am the only one responsible for his decision making/care and i just want to know what to expect. this is so painful; i can’t even believe this is a real illness. without having any information on your father's case: what other care options have been tried? we frequently have aggressive patients who only get combative during personal care. the kind choice can be to deal with a smelly resident, and reduce the amount of showers given etc. sometimes hygiene care really can't be avoided, but often the frequently can be turned down by a lot. same goes for 'having to sit at the table' or being woken up/ sent to bed/ interrupted from wandering etc. often the nurses are trying what they think is best, but it's not always what's right for the patient. your permission to adapt his care can go a long way. so sorry you're dealing with this aspect of the disease. is he on any mood stabilizers? i know what you mean about not being able to believe it’s a real disease. i am a nurse and we get situations like your dad very frequently. physical restraints are used temporarily until chemical restraints (mood stabilizer and such) are adjusted to a new level required to keep the patient calm. this stage of the disease lasts for a wide variety of time from person to person, but it doesn’t last forever. some it’s just a short time, they respond to medication quickly, some needs multiple readjustments of medication. allow the doctors to medicate your dad as much as necessary. in my experience, some doctors are too conservative with medication and the patient ends up in physical restraints for days. but finding that balance is hard, because you also don’t want the patient “snowed” or asleep for days due to medications. still, being asleep is better than being awake and restrained. it may trigger him more to have you visit so sometimes it’s a good idea to hold off, but you can check with his nurses about what his mood is prior to and after your visits to see how it affects him. when you do see your dad, try to think of him not as your dad but as someone who is afraid. it may help you to disassociate, at least during the visit. i would sign him up for the cassava sciences pre-screening for their drug in trial. every patient has shown improvement from as little as 27 days. it is on their website. please take a look. link for pre-screening ^^   above is a youtube link of testimonies from patient’s family members that are currently on the drug “simufilam”",0,This is
"my mother is a resident in a really nice memory care facility. last week she had another resident (a male who is a wanderer) come into her room in the middle of the night and crawl into bed with her. we got her calmed down and got her out for lunch so they could clean her bedding and make everything ""clean"". mom is usually really focused on keeping her door locked to keep anyone from getting in her ""apartment"" (there are a few residents who wander in if the door is open during the day so she keeps it closed and locked whether she's in there or  not), but she must have not locked it. we talked to the staff (they're great) and they said that they'd check her door every half hour at night and also if they happened to be walking by. so all seemed to be under control. however - my mother needs to feel secure in her room. i am looking for ideas or thoughts on how to handle this so mom feels safe - without making a big deal and getting this man in hot water, if possible. tia. my husband who gets into my personal stuff at home, is now doing the same thing at adult day care. staff informed me yesterday he has been going through other people's purses or backpacks and taking items out. i asked him about this and he denied doing it, but i trust staff's memory of events better than i trust his! i know it's not the same as wandering, but kind of similar. no advice, just wanted you to know this is definitely a feature of the disease. good luck to your poor mom. could the facility alarm her door during sleep hours? i'm sorry, i find it totally unacceptable that patients are allowed to wander at night. there is all kinds of alarms/technology to prevent this. i saw one little old lady that would just up and slap other residents. it's on the facility to make sure residents are safe. you must stay on management, most are profit driven, but you are a vital link in oversight. raise hell if necessary, i'm sure your paying$$$_. your mom’s right to feel safe trumps this man’s freedom to wander at night. i have no doubt he has no clue as to what he is doing; nonetheless, the facility needs to control this behavior or he needs a new level of care. if this were happening to my mother i would be most unhappy. they need to handle it. you need to raise hell with the facility. that it happened once, you were understanding, they told you the solution they would implement, you accepted that, and then it happened a second time and that’s entirely unacceptable. it sucks for the family of the man, but you have your own loved one to worry about so i would say that if the staff isn’t capable of protecting your mother from another patient, either those staff members or that patient needs to be removed. and you want monetary reparation on top of that since you’re paying $$$ for the safety and security of the room and its occupant and you’re not getting that, twice now. say you’re considering leaving a couple of reviews online about the negligence of the staff there, and how unsafe your mom feels because they apparently have no alarms, locks, safety measures or competent staff in place to prevent people from wandering at night. that’ll get their attention. don’t *expect* them to give you any compensation (and dont threaten to remove her, i’m sure they have a waitlist a mile long and will gladly take you up on that threat), but reminding them that you’re financially invested and have the power of google reviews might put a fire under their ass to do better. honestly though, get her on a waitlist for another facility. it seems as though you can’t trust the staff at this one to do their jobs. if the night staff get fired over this, and i say this as a professional caregiver myself, they absolutely deserve to lose their jobs for this level of negligence. it is not hard to prevent this situation with 24 hour awake staff plus modern technology...i’d worry about where they are dropping the ball in other places. or that despite the crazy amount of money each resident pays to stay there they are purposely understaffing to make more money. i know moving someone with dementia is hard and expensive but this is so unacceptable to me and would raise so many concerns about the quality of the staff and the safety measures they have in place. that man should never even be able to leave his room after bed time. ridiculous. i hope you get this sorted promptly, they give you a discount for her disrupted month, and they hire new night staff. oh my god.. i’m sorry but your poor mother, i can’t even imagine how terrified she must have been. this is unacceptable my dad was the wanderer but i sort of think he was doing it on purpose because the only part of his mind that worked was the, ""where da ladies at?"" i sure hope he didn't scare anyone. bed alarm for him. maybe one of those child safety locks for her door.... so she can get out but it takes a non-dementia person to figure out how to open it what facility?

"my grandma got diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia something like that  please tell me how bad it is im shaking she’s only 60   is it true she will only live about 6-7 more years? im 13 she won’t even live to have my first drink with me  is it really one step down from full alzheimer’s??? it's different for each person. i've heard of people who were diagnosed with alzheimer's and still living 20 years later! not the most common outcome, but i think i made my point. if a drink with your grandma was something you were looking forward to, you can do it now. one drink won't hurt anyone, even if you are just 13. i recommend reading the book “somebody i used to know” by wendy mitchell. she was also diagnosed with early-onset dementia around the same age. one possible benefit to an early diagnosis is that decline can be slower. my mother was diagnosed four years ago at 64 and while she has lost some cognitive abilities, her progression so far has been slow. guessing someone with dementia’s longevity is hard, but i would say enjoy the time you have with her now. having a loved one with dementia forces you to really live in the present moment with them. i believe you are asking about frontotemporal dementia (ftd)  with my wife it has been a vicious and fast progressing disease. i know at 13 you are ready to start talking about adult things, but the details and the way this disease changes a person is something everyone should avoid learning about. watching what this disease has done to my wife has been the toughest thing i have had to deal with in my life. my advice to you, is make memories with your grandma now, knowing that very soon this disease will change her into a different and very unpleasant person. all cases are different in terms of speed of progression. know this....your grandma will eventually act out in ways she can't control. remember it's not her, but her diseased brain. cherish the good times.",0,This is
"how does everyone handle things with their siblings when it's a parent who needs care? i don't know how to get conversations and plans going about my dad's care without starting a fight. hello,  i had a very similar situation with my sister. i was the live-in caretaker for my mom and step dad and she was in the same city. i was drowning in caring for them, having some mental health issues because of the toll of caregiver fatigue. we sat down with a social worker and talked about how i needed her support. progress was slow, but 4 years later she is my best friend and we depend on eachother a lot. our mom is now in the late stage and in a memory care unit. please give your sibling the offer of support before they reach that point. literally same scenario, my wife and i are the caretakers to my mother in law with mid stages alzheimers. her son who lives 10 mins away visits once or maybe twice a month. hasn't done much for her care and i believe doesn't like seeing his mother in her condition. unfortunately you cannot change them to make them care more, either they are willing or not. it's a bad situation and i would wish all parties put the same effort in. it's like every bad sibling interaction from childhood on is happening again with my sisters. it's tearing us apart and i'm thinking it'll not be repaired. my brain is tired tonight but it's like family roles, our roles as siblings and roles with parents have created patterns that got worse with ailing parents. if i could redo the last few years i'd ensure that my step up sister didn't take on so much. i'd also care less about worrying that i'd step on toes or hurt feelings and care more about stuff just getting done. the sibling who is good with your dad:  support her every way possible. bring meals, do chores, drive dad places, give her money and ask if there's anything else you can do. hint:  most caregivers could you use a respite caregiver so they can get to the dentist or have their hair cut. mention if he's losing weight, is he sleeping well, what goofy thing has he done lately (my dh recently peed in a wastebasket in the night, but didn't remember doing it). don't ask her for help, but at least she's in the loop when possibly bigger decisions need to be made. first we had to identify who our parents had put in charge if any. hunted for papers to find out who was the power of attorney. you could have a social worker come to your parents house with or without a nurse and evaluate your parents needs. once the social worker knows what is needed, a seperate meeting could occur with all family members present to hear what mom and dad need. responsibilities can be assigned to each in the sw presence to avoid conflict. remember though, you need to consider the life of each person. for example, i had a brother who was currently taking care of his inlaws. three of us really worked to help our parents out and we were successful. & tears. where there strengths were with our parents. if you don't have a poa then ask the social worker what can be done to do this. it might take a day in court to be established but will give you legal access to handling their affairs. i hope this helps.",0,This is
"my mom has been seeing a neurologist and a few months ago she took some kind of written test to see whether she has alzheimer's or not. i'm not entirely sure what the test results were as my mom can be rather private about her health and down play things, but the doctor ordered a brain mri for her. my mom sat me down yesterday and told me that the mri does show alzheimer's. she has not been back in to see the neurologist yet as the doctor is booked out pretty far, but my mom is on the wait list for an appointment so hopefully she gets in soon. i'm not sure how far along the alzheimer's is or if they can tell that from the mri, but my mom seems to think she only has 4-5 years left. i have suspected for a few months now that she may have alzheimer's as she has been having memory problems for a while (started when i was in high school) but have noticeably gotten worse recently. also, alzheimer's does run in her family. she did have a brain mri done 2-3 years ago (i'm not sure if it was related to her memory issues or not) and they said that everything was normal; i'm not sure if maybe they missed something or if there really were no signs on the mri yet. she forgets things we have recently spoken about, sometimes as close as ten minutes ago. she forgets what she was doing. she doesn't clean things up around the house (i.e her dog pooped indoors and she just left it there). she forgets to bathe. however, i do think things are worse than that. she wasn't even going to tell me the results of the mri and was going to pretend that everything was normal but my dad convinced her otherwise. she has not told my younger brother yet. i feel very lost. i'm about to be 24, so i know that i'm an adult, but i'm still finding my footing in the adult world and trying to figure out my place. i don't want to lose my mom. i know i have to step up and help her, though i have no doubt that she will try to leave me out of everything and handle it herself, as she doesn't want to feel like a burden though i have assured her that she is not one. i'm sure my dad will help her with things but, while they are still friends, they have been divorced for over a decade and he works long, demanding hours. i wouldn't mind moving in with her to help her but she will not let me. she says that she will stay in her house for now, and hire someone to come during the days to help her. and when that no longer works/helps, she will move into a care home. i just wanted to confide in y'all and hopefully get some advice. my mom has told me not to tell any of my friends, which i understand and respect, but it means that i have no one outside my family to talk to about this. for those who have a parent that has been affected by alzheimer's, what was it like? what should i prepare myself for? what is something that you wish you had been told? how do i help someone who feels bad about asking for help? any and all advice is helpful. going forward, you will find that unless someone has a parent with dementia, especially early onset, they just will not truly get what you are going through. having a grandparent with dementia is not the same thing. you will find that the best support and understanding you receive is from others in the same boat as you. hiring caregivers and then going into a facility and not looking to young-adult children to take on caregiving is 100% what's best for her and you. her words right now are very important - don't forget them. she wants you to remain her daughter, not become her caregiver. many adult caregivers of parents with dementia are totally breaking down under the stress of caregiving, and wondering what our parent would want if they were in their right mind, or if our parent would understand if we need a break and have to hire professionals or place them in a facility. you already have all that information right from your mom's own mouth. dementia varies a lot from one person to another so keep in mind that your mom's symptoms and experience may be different from what other people tell you about. also, unless your mom has vascular dementia and a history of strokes, i think her 4-5 year life expectancy prediction will probably be wrong. i'd like to go back to times that i previously was complaining about - because i didn't realize at the time how good things still were. i’m 20 years old, my grandma had dementia from around 70 i would say. she’s 80 now, however i haven’t had to take care of since 2 years ago. i wish i could give lots of great advice, but i’m still learning myself. also, it gets easier, you learn what works and doesn’t i was a few years older than you when my dad diagnosed. i’m so sorry you have to go through this. being young makes it even more unfair. i highly recommend getting an elder law attorney as soon as you can. they can help you get durable power of attorney, health care power of attorney, etc. they can also help you navigate your mom’s assets. its important to do this while your mom is still mentally capable. one thing that’s not fun to think about, but important, is to talk to your mom about her final wishes. you can plan and prepay for her funeral. you can ask the funeral home to store the funds in a way that makes it so medicaid can’t take them. it’s also important to make sure there’s nothing left unsaid between you and your mom. the alzheimer’s association helpline (800-272-3900) has helped me a few times when i had questions and i wasn’t sure where to turn to. they are extremely caring and helpful. i also recommend starting therapy and making sure you take care of yourself. it’s also important to make sure you still live your life, you only get one. i dont have much advice but ill share my story in hopes something resonates with you. i was 29 when my dad was originally diagnosed with ad in 2019 (since then was diagnosed with cbd/cbs). every day for a month straight after diagnosis, i cried. all day. i felt so lost too. i went to work at cried at my desk. but every time i saw my dad, i was okay. i didnt cry. things have progressed (or regressed) and its now hard to see him but i can cherish every second im with him. having him keep talking about childhood memories and music makes him light up he is so happy when he remembers the life hes lived. its such bs though that we have to go through this. i get so jealous when i see my friends with their parents, enjoying retirement. sometimes its oddly comforting to know that others your age are also dealing with this. my mom is much older than yours and she was diagnosed a year ago. i'm not sure how you can prepare yourself, but there are a lot of resources out there. [  i found the attached to be helpful. best to you and your family. my dad was diagnosed in 2015 when i was 19 and he was 62. he had been showing symptoms for many years. my dad is now in a full time care facility and he has lost all his abilities. i want you to know that it will be hard. you will be grieving and you will be frustrated with your mother. please be patient with her. i wish i knew how little time we actually had. sorry if my comments doesn't make sense. i dont really know what to mention as there's so many things. ask me anything if you want. in 2019, my mom, 61 years old, was diagnosed with early onset ad -- which, like your mom, ran in her family. unfortunately it's impossible to know exactly how much longer someone with eoad has, but generally, in the case of eoad, the long-term prognosis is not great. you're going to be taking things one day at a time. and then later it'll become one hour at a time. it's very likely she'll lose any social filter and start saying mean, hurtful things. prepare yourself now for these things so you don't end up taking them personally when they happen. my mom has just fairly recently lost track of her grandkids' names (there's only 3 of them) and about a year ago lost track of who's kids are who's and who's wife is who's, but she still seems to very clearly know my brothers and i.  it's the disease that's doing this to your mom and mine, and it's a fucking awful, no good, bag of shit disease. help out subtly when and where you can. if the dog pooped in the house and she's skipped over cleaning it, then just clean it and keep life moving on. keep tabs on her rx and daily intakes to make sure everything's happening as it should -- and nothing's happening that shouldn't be happening. do what you can to be as present and patient as possible. it's very, very hard on the family, but also it's our moms that are the ones constantly confused, disoriented, and trying to figure out day-to-day life when nothing makes sense anymore. another thing... be kind and patient with yourself too. take breaks when you need them. my dad was not diagnosed until 2018 with alzheimer's and we suspect he'd had it since 2009 or so. he had a severe decline over 2020 and we ended up needing to move him to memory care early 2021 as my mom could no longer care for him. my dad passed away at 71 in november of 2021 and the last few years of his life were some of the most challenging. if you have personal friends/family who have experience, reach out to them. i found this subreddit to be particularly helpful in my darkest moments. ask all the questions and get all the history and life stories while you can. good luck and god bless. i’m only 19, but my mother was diagnosed about a year ago (the date should pass any day now) through her spinal fluid. at the time she was a registered nurse, but just before the diagnosis she lost her job at trader joe’s. at that point, my father was giving her a lift to work and home every day. when i was 18, she destroyed her car in a wreck because she somehow completely missed seeing someone right in front of her. we managed to hide it from the insurance company but she no longer drives, which i think was the best decision. **if this hasn’t happened a lot yet, expect it to start. 🤍 the whole process is brutal. she had already stopped driving 3 years earlier. 2 years later she was already getting lost in her own neighborhood, wandering in parking lots when told to wait, and telling outlandish stories that made no sense and her memories were already bad at that point. by late 2016 (literally 10 years later), she was clearly already in late stage dementia and had no idea what was going on anymore. prior to that i was fortunate that i had older tenants that rented rooms in her house that kind of looked after her. my father who was divorced since i was a child also came around so that helped too. i finally had to move back with mom along with my family when she got to the late late stages of the disease in 2018. she got to the point where she would just wander mindlessly in circles around the house, talking to her delusions, and go to bathroom in trash cans, or on the floor at times. later that year she had no idea who i was anymore and i am her only child. in late 2020 she lost the ability to stand and has been bedridden ever since. she is currently 87 and is completely motionless for over 17 months stuck in a hospital bed and just mumbles to herself all day long. to say her existence is downright horrible is an understatement and we all suffer right along with her because we really can't go anywhere now and haven't done much of anything for about 4 years and i have to do literally everything for her. i truly believe my mom's case is an outlier case as most patients don't last this long from what i hear from others (even her own doctor put her on hospice 2 years ago and didn't think she would make it far along into 2021), yet here we are still. nothing about this disease is predictable or easy. some days are better than others, the worst years for me were 2018-2020 when she was basically an out of control angry zombie like personality and would try to cause damage with any items or furniture that she passed by. now she can't do anything so it's a more controlled environment with lots of downtime, but very hard to watch none the less. the hardest part for me now is juggling her care while trying to offer a normal childhood for my two kids, but fortunately my wife helps me alot with the things i just can't do right now. hope this helps, good luck! my best advice is a second opinion with a memory specialist neurologist. misdiagnosis is common in the 50s age group and a brain mri cannot show alzheimer's. they are not very diagnostic and at most you can try to appreciate patterns of atrophy typically seen in alzheimer's but it's not too absolute. a spinal tap looking for ad markers or an amyloid pet scan would be much much more useful than an mri. everything that you described is also seen in pseudo dementia as well so it is important to make sure a miss diagnosis has not occurred. my father is now mid to late stages and while i’m older than you this might help. try to spend plenty of quality time with your mom now and take pictures. eg go to parks, zoos, beach, hikes. make some nice memories for yourself. try to get your mom on a good diet now. decent nutrition will help keep her mind healthy longer, whether it’s meal delivery service or whatever. do those legal things, even though it will likely be awful. also find the care home she likes now so there are fewer questions later. best wishes i appreciate you sharing your story. 30 years old here with my mom getting diagnosed with eo a few months ago at age 59. it has rocked our world as it has not run in her family up until this point. i had joined a support group for a meeting but all the caregivers are also older and just felt like i couldn’t connect with them. if you or anyone else would like to connect just to talk and vent about being a young adult who has to deal with this shit situation, i’d love to find a way for us to find a forum to do so.",0,This is
"personally i'd rather see the alz association focus on getting long term care covered by medicare, using the same force and energy they're using for this drug. or they could do a better job of creating more local support groups. or publishing more useful guides - it's interesting to me that many of the great guides or books like teepa snow never seem to be recommended by them. rather than bankrupting medicare for a drug that doesn't work, money would be better spent on research into preventing dementia and providing care for people with this god awful disease and others that require long term care. heck, money would be better spent on covering dental care.",0,This is

"tl;dr: mom's sick and hostile towards me. how best can i help her, and keep us both safe, until the doctor sees her? my mom gets incredibly agitated when she's sick and with a fever. i do my best to remain calm and try to tell her reassuring words but it seems like it falls on deaf ears. i can't redirect her or distract her like the resources i've been find online say as she only gets more worked up and tells me things like i'm faking being nice to her. i've also tried being in a different room than she is so she can calm down on her own, but she meanders and eventually finds me again and gets worked up. i've tried looking around for other tips but it's not for anything as drastic as her pushing me. she's sick again and we're working on getting an appointment set up with her pcp asap. i don't mind so much that she's taking her frustrations out on me, granted i do get shaken up by it, but i just want her to be feeling better. generally she's been very sweet since she got diagnosed with early onset three years ago so the sudden mood changes are quick to be noticed and the four of us, my dad, two sisters, and myself, work as fast as we can to give her care. does your county/city have palliative care?palliative care has helped so much more with my dads mood issues that his primary care doctor. it might be worth it to see if they can help with your mom. her psychologist prescribed three basic antipsychotics that really helped, for my wife zoloft worked the best. but i started giving her more and more pills chasing good behavior. the psychiatrist adjusted her program and it has worked fairly well up to this point. she is taking eight pills a day and she does everything she can to avoid taking them.",0,This is
"this question was posed in 2017 and 2018 in this sub, but now that a bit more time has passed, i'm wondering if more people have read the book and tried the recommendations? i'm especially confused about how ""extreme"" of a diet do we need to follow? and since  damage starts occurring in the brain starting in 30's / 40's, my partner and i want to make sure we follow a brain healthy lifestyle, given his family history. thank you!!! it’s not grounded in repeatable science. in other words, you can’t prove a causal relationship between the proposed diet and alzheimer’s progression. it’s unfortunate, but anything that claims to solve or cure alzheimer’s is unlikely to be real unless it’s brand new, and coming from a major medical institution or medical journal. sadly it is as horrible as bredesen, perlmutter, or oz. if you want a diet to help alzheimer's, cut out as much processed oils (canola oil etc) and with it, fried foods as possible. the genetic link between alz and dementia is explicitly tied to the oxidative byproducts of fats (all kinds). the last group is 5% of the population, and account for ~1% of cases (protective variant). the differences are related to the protein's ability to detoxify the lipid oxidation byproducts. exercise, sleep well, heart healthy diet while knowing that it might not work. saved you many pages.",0,This is
"i have a parent who tells me they've been diagnosed with alzheimer's. my relationship with the parent has been trying for my entire life due to their mental illness and, i believe, extreme narcissism. the issue i have is that i'm on my own and they're in one of the poorest states of the country, so, i'd be looking at some pretty limited options in terms of work and life, to say nothing of the fact that they've never really willingly been there since i graduated in terms of safety net or helping me in my career. the parent has a partner but they're in their 80s so... honestly, and i may get tons of shit for this. i would suggest avoiding completely uprooting your life, career and future for a parent you are not close with, and harbor any amount of resentment towards. i honestly don't believe just bc you birthed a kid or two, that you're entitled to their time/effort and anguish..... especially if you were  a shit parent. and taking care of a much loved relative w/ alzheimer's is hard on the good days. i would see about taking family leave for as long as you can, in order to try and get a sense of what they have going on now/what she needs & how to set things up for management from afar. get medical poa at minimum, switch all physician contact info to you, also look into financial poa if possible. (may be much harder w/ a spouse or partner involved) if she is still fairly self sufficient, i would try and find a facility that starts with assisted living, and has steps for future memory care. (we wish we could have gotten my grandma into her facility sooner, when she was more ""with it"" she's always been very social, and if she had more time to adjust prior to decline, we think she would be more comfortable now) if you can get her set up where she's comfortable, and manage her care from afar i would, in your situation. that or find a facility close to where you are now, and move her there for you. if career prospects and everything is as bad as you say, i think avoiding it would be overall better. they moved closer to me, a nearby city where 2 siblings live so i don't get the brunt of it. it's a lot of work, tons of paperwork and research as they decline. from my own experience, a rocky relationship gets worse. i have a really hard time fighting my own feelings and being kind when i just want to walk away. maybe it'd be different if my mother liked me but who knows. if it's affordable this is the time to look into transitional living, independent to memory care. it can be complex, so much to factor in. oh jeez i'm sorry to sound so negative! it's just a struggle i'm currently dealing with. i have the opposite situation as you, my dad is the kindest, sweetest man i’ve ever known. he’s in an “apartment with help” (memory care) 10 minutes away which is centrally located between my siblings and i. and it can still be really stressful. my mother died suddenly in november 2020. i believe it was due to the stress of caregiving. add to that the narcissism of your parent and other mental health issues you’ve mentioned, and uprooting your life and moving to a place with limited career options sounds like a dream come true for a narcissistic parent and a nightmare for the child of a narcissist. unless they’re willing to give you poa or move to “an apartment with help” i personally wouldn’t move there. if they expect you to move there and be their whipping boy/girl for the rest of their life i would make it clear it’s not happening. and then i would expect them to say what an awful son/daughter you are because that’s what narcissists do. i’m so sorry you have to go through this. please keep us updated! i found a local support group for adult children of alzheimer’s patients through alz.org. if you have to be the primary caretaker, move them to you, or both of you move somewhere with max. options and support. my family and i did exactly this about 1.5 years ago. don't give up your job and social network to become a caretaker to an aging narcissist. nope, you'll simply get verbally abused.. we moved my mil from florida to nc to live with us instead.",0,This is
"my dad is 50. i’m his primary caregiver, he has early onset alzheimer’s and every day i see him get worse. every day when i wake up i feel this gaping hole in my chest, and by the time i go to bed at night it’s so bad i can barely breathe from it. had to get therapy for it still working on this. end of last year my wife started asking me things that made it clear that at certain times, she didn't know who i am. ""where do you live? but every day is a little worse: more uncertainty, more people and places gone. (it is right next to the bed). so coping is really, so far, just a matter of keeping perspective. i fear that one day, probably very soon, reality will hit. i think coping is a matter of letting go of how you want it to be and instead, knowing  what to expect.

"my father (m, 70) has been confined to a wheelchair for about 15 years, and is reliant on help for even getting out of bed and going out and about. my mother (f, 61) is there to assist him, and we are lucky to be able to afford carers who tend to him. recently, over the last few years, he has become noticably forgetful - from both small things, such as what day it is, what he had for lunch, or what time someone is supposed to come over, to other more things such as my brother's birthday, his cousin's name, whether people are dead or alive, etc. sometimes he will ask the same question 2 or 3 times during lunch or dinner, not realising that we have spoken about it already barely 5-10 minutes earlier. it has reached the stage where it is noticable even to people who don't live with him, but are meeting him socially. the problem is - he is refusing to acknowledge these things happening. in one instance, even when on text message he mentioned something unfathomable, and we tried to show it to him as 'proof', asking him what he was trying to say, he just shuts up and shuts everyone else out. looking at early symptoms of alzheimer's, he is displaying a number of them: forgeting about recent conversations or events; forgeting the names of places and objects; asking questions repetitively; becoming less flexible and more hesitant to try new things. but he refuses to see a doctor. i really am not sure how i even proceed with this - i do not live in the same city as my parents, and i know that my mother is quite anxious about what the future holds. in her opinion, even if we just know what is happening, either way, at least it makes it easier to deal with - if a diagnosis can be confirmed, wouldn't it be better to start treating with medicines as early as possible? and if he is being this stubborn now, and he does indeed have alzheimer's, what is it going to be like as it progressively gets worse? in the last month itself i have felt it get worse. any advice is appreciated, both on how to approach my father and try to make him see a doctor, as well as how i can help my mother cope better with this. thanks in advance! you can't really treat it very effectively, so i wouldn't stress about getting a diagnosis, unless you expect you'll need it to get subsidized care or some other form of government help. does your father visit the doctor at all? my grandma got a mental ability test during a routine checkup at her usual general practice doctor. you do just a couple of things, doesn't take long and it's enough to get the papers. have your mother talk to the doctor beforehand about what's been happening. i would request that the doctor tells him what kind of test is being done, my grandma felt entrapped a bit, because it wasn't explained clearly to her. does he take pills as is now? it's more important to start figuring out how you'll deal with more and more advanced care your father will most likely need. can you mother handle it alone or should you start looking for help? do you have to enroll him in a home sooner rather than later because of waiting lines? best to be prepared. start educating yourself and your mom about the disease (and i mean dementia here as a broad umbrella term, i don't think a specific diagnosis is very useful in patients with gradual onset over a couple of years), it's more about coping with it for carers. you have to stop caring about repeating things and getting asked the same questions, takes a little practice to get used to it. for example, my grandma always has this one story about someone stealing her bed sheets (partly true story, partly i removed some when i moved in with her). i stopped convincing her that it didn't happen, i just listen to her, confirm that stealing is horrible and that a bad thing did indeed happen to her, but that she is safe now. that way we both remain calm and move on with our day. the patients usually don't really know what's going on anyway (my grandma doesn't really remember, that she doesn't remember, if that makes sense). you gain nothing (i'd argue that you often end up achieving the opposite, just causing stress to both parties) by making your father admit he has memory issues, because he'll forget about it anyways and you'll be doing it all over again the next day. i'm sorry you're going through this. i've been going through this too, and it is probably the hardest part of the condition... the fact that they can no longer be reasoned with because reason doesn't get through. there's an account that i follow on instagram (i am in no way affiliated with them, it's just been a really helpful account) that posted something recently. when my dad was at a stage that it sounds like your dad was at, he was already out of it enough that we could lie or just not tell him we were taking him to a doc. i think we booked the appointment (you could explain to the docs office what was going on so they'd be ready for complications or resistance) and we might have told him but he forgot. then on the 30 minute trip there, im pretty sure we told him we were going to the bank, or for a doctor appointment for me, or going shopping. he sure wasn't comprehending the appointment was a neurologist for him. when in the docs office he was annoyed with the doc, and offended at being asked the ""stupid questions"" that ""of course he knew"" but couldn't answer. and thats how we got him his preliminary diagnosis and how we got him to all the other follow up appointments. this really works depending on how long they can retain a convo for tho. if your dad remembers a convo from yesterday, it might not work. if he cant retain for an hour, maybe? you could try taking him on an actual nice short day out and see how long he retains things from point to point. alternatively maybe you could luck out and find a doc who makes house calls? i do encourage you to try tho, mainly because of the chance that its *not* alzheimer's and is something treatable or even reversible. a lot of things can cause dementia and they need to be ruled out. sometimes, the earlier you catch a cause, the better the outcome too. one thing, has you or your mom looked into long-term memory care insurance? we just learned about this, but you can only get it before the insured person has been diagnosed with anything (with a broad definition of ‘diagnosed’). it might cost a bit now, but might really help you and your family in the long run. my husband does not  like to go to the doctor either. it’s probably best to make the appointment and not tell him until the day of. its not worth arguing with someone who has dementia , if he does have it. you could tell the doc about your concerns before hand and then tell your dad its just a routine check up . the doctor will just ask a few questions and judge his response. you can lie  to your dad about the reason for the appointment, if he asks . good luck . i  think i  know what you are going through. that was me for the last 2 years with my dad. two weeks later he had a referral for a senior eval. i accompanied him to the appt. and he scored a 22/30 on their exam recommended additional follow up, therapy etc. wouldn’t even commit to scheduling a re-exam in 12 months. so.. baby steps, i guess. now i work on follow up and recommended action (is his house safe to age in place, etc).",0,This is

"nan it’s important to not remind her of the dog’s death if she asks where the dog is. when this happened to my dad, we always made up some excuse like the dog was at the vet or getting groomed. after a while, he forgot about the dog. sometimes it is best to fib for her comfort. you can say she went to the groomers. the excuse doesn’t even need to be a good one since she won’t remember it anyway. say the dog is out for a walk, or the vet, or at the dog park. my first suggestion is: give it time because sad to say, she may forget about her dog or forget how important it was to her. when my mom’s beloved cat passed away she kept forgetting too and would get sad every time. now she barely remembers the cat at all. she has pictures of him and sometimes she says what a great cat he was, but most of the time i don’t think she is clear on how much she loved it so it doesn’t bother her anymore. also, i have a cat now and she focuses on him now. so my 2nd suggestion would be to get her a new dog to help her focus on that, but only if there is someone living with her that can make sure the dog gets fed and walked in case she forgets to. when my mom would ask where he was, i'd choke up and she'd see my reaction and question me even more.",1,This is
"my dad received his diagnosis during covid. he had a virtual 2-session “interview” with a neuro-psychologist from the neurologist’s office. granted, the mri/ct did show some atrophy as well, but the actual diagnosis came after this virtual meeting. my dad is 70, isn’t the most social person, and isn’t used to virtual appointments. the whole thing didn’t go well. nonetheless, we toughed through. her findings were that he presents with alzheimer’s and general anxiety. just curious how else someone gets formally diagnosed. i'm a psychologist who diagnoses people with dementia. the gp refers them to us. we test their cognitive abilities (2h assignment) and talk to the family+client (1h). the testscores then get compared to people in their age and education bracket. the dementia diagnosis is usually quite clear from that. this may sound like it's too vague, but you can look up the mmse to get a sense of these types of tests. keep in mind that a score below 25 means something is definitely wrong, as the test is so easy that regular, healthy people should make it flawlessly. being unable to do simple math, remember 3 words, or know what season we're in says a lot about their minds already. this gets combined with the information from the family: can't remember appointments, unlearned how to work the tv, needs help with finances these days, confabulating stories, etc. all of these are outside the norms for normal ageing. i'm not sure i made a comprehensive or coherent response, feel free to ask for clarification. my dad was diagnosed with probable alzheimers, i believe in 2019, after an in person visit with a neurologist who specializes in cognitive decline. i know it involved an mri and i'm pretty sure it involved blood work. imo atrophy on an mri/ct is how the neurologist made the diagnosis. the facetime meetings were just to confirm he had the symptoms. i am not an expert, i just have my wife’s situation to base my opinion on. i started trying to get my wife diagnosed when she was 55. the neurologist said it was not likely she had dementia based on her age. in addition to the ungodly number of tests and appointments with specialists, she had three or four mri/ct scans. i have been told it is very difficult to detect early stage dementia with an mri/ct scan. finally the results from a radiated glucose pet/ct scan was interpreted for lewy bodies. a couple years later based upon her behavior the neurologist changed her diagnosis to ftd. my mother was diagnosed last year (the 1-year mark should pass any day now), about a month before i turned 19. i think they used spinal fluid. i’d had my suspicions of it since i was around 15-16, but getting the diagnosis and having my fears confirmed was like having a brick thrown at me. ♡ my mom was diagnosed after about 2 years of no pricing some mild symptoms (being forgetful, having trouble keeping up with conversations). it was june of 2020 when she got her initial mci diagnosis. we get her reevaluated this year and got mild alzheimer’s diagnosis which is what we were expecting. she currently cannot complete instrumental tasks without assistance (cooking, cleaning, filling pills, some driving) if progressed enough, alzheimer's can be fairly easy to diagnose and would not require more than an initial meeting. that said, i don't put much stock into telehealth/virtual neuropsych evaluations when it comes very early stage symptoms; especially in those of an age that are completely unfamiliar with the concept of virtual doctor visits and videocalls. late last spring my father had a uti. while they were treating the uti he just shut down. was stiff as a board for about a month in the hospital until they brought out other neurologists. in the process of trying to figure out what was going on (turns out parkinson's), they discovered that he does have alzheimers. prior his doctor just kept saying ""he's getting old that's all"".",0,This is

"nan early onset alzheimer’s runs in my family…i’m 35 and have been taking unisom for the past 2 years…i’ve noticed not being able to remember if i fed my dog or not lately as well as cannot recall certain words (more than feels “normal.”) doing research and unisom is an anticholinergic which is linked to dementia risk…i want to go talk to a neurologist. has anyone gotten tested for the genes that cause early onset alzheimer’s? trying to do all the research i can and of course very worried if i myself will get this terrible disease. wtf. i'm pregnant and the one thing they recommend to sleep at night is unisom. why are people pushing these drugs if they have dementia risks? i was taking kirkland sleep aid (doxylamine succinate, same ingredient as unisom i think) which is considered to increase dementia risk. i stopped taking it and now i sleep like shit again, which is also linked to alzheimer's risk. and yes, i have a copy of the late-onset gene. not sure what to do over here. i exercise like mad to try to make myself sleep, including cardio and weights, but i wake at 2 am every fucking morning. look into the dian network they have great resources. it’s for dominantly inherited alzheimer’s and they have great resources for family members that are concerned they might have inherited it as well as studies and genetic counseling and forums on it. might not be helpful for your specific case but it was for me and my brother as early onset alzheimer’s has been in my family for a few generations. i think you should definitely talk to a neurologist. honestly, low chance but, might have a legal case against unisom if you suffered real harm from their product. medications like unisom( anticholinergic antihistamines) do worsen cognition in the elderly/dementia patients but it is unlikely that it actually contributes to or causes the disease itself. the data suggesting there is a causal link also included anti-depressants, anti-parkinsons drugs, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, and so on and ranged from 55-year-olds to 100-year-olds. the 50+% dementia risk claimed is really talking about those other very powerful drugs and their anticholinergic properties are minimal, tbh. the other aspects of those drugs are likely what is damaging. the 12% difference in these numbers seems in line with the average % of dementia onsets within the age group studied and may just be circumstantial with the aging population. the study showed that antipsychotics have a 70% increased risk of dementia (interestingly 109% increase at lower dose) but this is misleading because the anticholinergic properties of anti-psychotics are minimal and likely unrelated. edit:   here is the study if you would like to check it out. table 5 is most useful. ""a total standardized daily dose (tsdd) was calculated for each patient with a validated assessment based on strength, daily dose, and length of use for each of 56 drugs with anticholinergic properties."" i just went through cognitive testing at my neurologist’s recommendation and they discovered i have eoa. i have other issues that led to the testing but the word searching/aphasia has been going on for over a year or so. the testing is long, a full day’s worth, it’s exhausting, but it was worth it to know where i stood. good luck!",0,This is
"any ideas appreciated! this month i (clinical researcher and prior mri training) have been helping my friend desperately look for help for his clearly demented (74 year old) mother (he has no other family). it began over the summer when she had a dizzy episode, syncope, and bad lasting headache (undiagnosed tia?). since then, she’s been declining rapidly and now constantly perseverates and forgets after 5 min. pcp told her to follow up in a year! i told my friend to request scans/neuro tests, and then i read through all the reports: mri shows significant atrophy, no tau, spinal tap shows cognitive recovery in following few hours and then return to dementia, neuropsych scores are severe in learning/memory/visual, and neurology eval says “alzheimer’s”. but she was ultimately diagnosed as “mild neurological disorder” and won’t get meds until she becomes severe. my friend said he was told there’s nothing else they can do (which is disgusting of our health care system), so i’ve been compiling lists of top neurologists and clinical trials. what else can be done for her that i’m missing?? thank you!! i’m in uk so it’s probably different but even now my dad is diagnosed with alzheimer’s rather than mci which is all they’d say initially, it hasn’t unlocked anything. the only thing he is prescribed is anti depressants. afaik there are meds which may slow decline but certainly won’t reverse it, and it’s unfortunately a disease with an inevitable decline. i’d suggest as an initial port of call too to start looking in to practical things like power of attorney, sorting financial affairs, looking at what support there will be for carers in home and out of home when the time comes the current approach to alzheimer’s (imo) is shameful. bureaucracy will close the door to alternative approaches and then make you feel stupid for asking. whoa, i thought alzheimer's drugs including memantine and donepezil are most effective in early stages! behavioral interventions are probably more important: adequate nutrition, social contact, fall prevention, things like that. if she's living at home, she's probably endangered. you don't mention where you are or what kind of funding. that is helpful in giving advice. if they are in the us and paying health insurance may as well use that mofo to the fullest.",0,This is
"need help please. my daughter is visiting for a long period with her dog. my mother keeps saying it’s ‘her’ dog and gets mad when my daughter takes her dog for a walk or feeds her. mom keeping getting upset and telling everyone to leave ‘her’ dog along. thanks so much. have you considered getting your mother a stuffed animal dog? maybe one that’s the same color as your daughters dog, if you can. that’s what worked with my mom, we got her the joy for all robotic cat that purrs and meows and everything and she’s as happy as a clam. is it possible to have something to distract her when your daughter goes out for walks and move the dogs food bowls somewhere that mom doesn't go often? this disease is frustrating because so often there are no solutions outside of redirection or changing our own behavior we're starting to have this issue with my sister's cat. we live at home with our dad to take care of our mom and lately mom has been claiming the cat is hers and gets authoritative over it whenever we take actual care of it. mom misreads its body language frequently so it's difficult to address her behavior and the cat's at the same time. she has her own stuffed dog and absolutely loves it but chooses the live cat whenever both are in the same room. i usually end up hovering nearby to supervise that their interactions are safe for both but that tends to agitate mom and gets more protective of the cat. how is your mom's balance? if she's able to walk much and the dog's properly leashed trained, maybe see if going out on walks together with your daughter might help? if that's not an option, perhaps keeping the dog and mom separate and out of eye sight during feeding and walking time might work. or ask your daughter to have someone else watch the dog. try not to tell your mom that it's not her dog as that will only make her more defensive. if she starts to get super possessive, maybe the dog should be kept somewhere else close while your daughter visits and can take care of her pet without your mom being upset. i know some patients do well with baby dolls too.",1,This is
"so, it’s a bit of a mess of a story, but my paternal grandfather was recently admitted to a facility because of dementia, and his kidneys have begun to fail so he doesn’t have much time left. i am currently 22, and i haven’t seen or heard from him since around 2010 due to my dad making the decision to cut contact with him due to other mental health problems of his to keep both of us safe. i have mental health problems myself, and they of course have gotten a lot worse since these developments. i feel selfish because i know how much being visited means to him right now, but all i do is freeze and lose the ability to speak when in the room with him, and then begin drinking heavily for the rest of the day after that. i’m hoping anyone out there has any suggestions or insight on the best course of action. should i try harder to suck it up and be there for him, both so he’s less alone, and so that i won’t feel like i didn’t do enough after he’s gone? or maybe i should stay away since it’s so high stress on my end and for the people around me worrying about my addiction problems coming back, and i’ll just have the pleasant memories of all the things we used to do together when i was really little. i don’t know him very well anymore but from how i used to know him, i believe he would want me to only remember him as he was when i was little. thank you for reading, i know how awful dementia is, and i’ve handled it before, but its completely different when it’s family. i’m very worried about your stress levels. it’s not worth it if your sobriety is at risk. could you honor your grandfather in some other way, that would not risk your sobriety? if there is a funeral, they will need memory boards. get black tri-fold poster boards at a craft store, and put pictures of your grandfather in better days on it? you could read to him, or bring some lotion and put rub some into his hands and onto his feet. that is very soothing. you could hum a song while doing it. this would be as much for him as it is for you. if you can picture doing these things for him, without your stress levels going up, then maybe you can do it. if picturing this makes you anxious, i feel that it is not safe for you to do it. your grandfather would not want you to risk your sobriety for this. good luck, and please keep us posted. could you try going with your dad? might help take some of the pressure off. also, maybe try not having high expectations when you go. just sitting there with him is more than enough. turn the tv on, read a book. maybe build up to the small talk once you’ve sat there for a little while. you also don’t have to stay long. whatever you can endure is fine. if you are coping after a visit with him by drinking heavily for the rest of the day, you are damaging yourself. you have a responsibility to yourself and the people around you to keep yourself physically and mentally healthy. if your grandfather can still read or has someone who can read to him, you might consider sending a note or card instead of some visits. you want to let him know that he is loved, and you can do it this way. it’s probably better - for him and for you - than physically being present but not being mentally or emotionally present when visiting him. as someone who lives with liver disease, i want you prioritize your own health during this difficult time. i understand it’s hard; my step mother is dealing with dementia herself. the problem is that, there are no warning signs. you won’t feel any symptoms until it’s already too late. the liver is a miraculous organ that helps to regulate hundreds of functions in the body. many don’t realize that the damaged liver itself isn’t always the problem, but instead causes all kinds of other health issues in the body as a result of being diseased. if the disease progresses far enough to cause scarring (cirrhosis), there’s no undoing the damage. it will shorten your life, and you’ll spend that time with significant health issues. so please take care of yourself during this difficult time. if you absolutely have to see your grandfather and risk your sobriety over it, consider having a buddy that doesn't drink and who you trust to stay with you before, during, and for some time after your visit. you could maybe also ask the people who tend to him if there's anything he'd like/need that you could send them? not sure how applicable that would be, but it might be worth it if you could help him and not risk your well-being simultaneously.",0,This is

"for those of you interested in the science of treating alzheimer's, there was a multi-day conference over the past few days where a lot of companies laid out how they've been approaching these different neurodegenerative diseases. [  so far, biogen has a product that passed fda trials for treatment of alzheimer's called aduhelm. it was initially listed at $56,000 for a year's worth of medication which was a staggering amount of money. this was a obviously a real downer because i was initially excited to hear biogen get the nod from the fda until i heard about the price. if anyone has experience with it, i'd be interested to hear about it. what's great though is that time is running out on them being the only treatment. it turns out that there are actually a lot of other companies that want a chance to perform trials and get something to market which will likely reduce the price and the possibility that one of these companies will knock it out of the park and for a reasonable price. two other hopefuls:  promis: [  alzheon: [  merck had one get to phase 3 trials, but wasn't able to pass. i believe they're still working on it. i think there are other big pharma projects as well. the cruddy thing about the biogen drug is it did not actually show cognitive improvement in the participants, rather it showed that it can clear amyloid which they think can slow progression. while we wait for a drug that is a cure, there are great programs to help people with the symptoms they have. this is a great one sponsored by nia  not trying to imply support for or against, but if you wanted to get involved in trying to lower the cost of aduhelm, the alzheimer's association has been trying to get it accessible to all for a while:   you could see if there is an alzheimer's association near you, especially their local advocacy activity. in my state they have us talking to lawmakers to push local and, if you want, national issues like aduhelm pricing, and using social media or whatever you're comfortable with. science moves slow...its the nature of science. ..and legislation can be slow too, but advocacy is one way us ordinary folks can speed some types of help along.",0,This is

""just a bit longer when you get more strength back"" sounds like a fine answer in the meantime. when it comes time for him to move, some people frame the move to memory care as ""your doctor wants you to be in a special rehab until you improve more,"" but that's a case by case thing. we told my dad the house needed construction work and it was dangerous so he had to stay at the home. we never used the words memory care or nursing home and acted like it was a hotel or apartment. he's been there about a month and has stopped asking to go home. quick decline sometimes means uti. some doctors can remember stuff but aren't critical thinkers. did they check? morally, i think keeping the present pleasant and positive is the way to go. i'm caring for my father who has alzheimer's and as much as my brain has conflict with white lies my priority is his immediate comfort. his ability to grasp concepts are declining so keeping things simple is important. best of luck to you, it's a journey that's for sure. don't know what your folks money situation is like, cause every option is costly. is there any possibility of getting your mom some assistance and keeping him at home. wish there were good options, but there really are not. my mom has been in memory care for years and while it is necessary, it's horrible. if you dad is still somewhat functional he will probably be very unhappy. good luck, and prayers for you and your family. no chance of any younger relatives to move in with them? alzheimer's disease does not advance remotely that quickly. has he had a proper work up from a neurologist? i would assume they checked for uti? uti's are notorious for causing complete delirium in elderly patients and can mimic a fast progressing dementia, however most of the time the patient returns to baseline after some time has passed and it has been fully treated. other possibilities would include nmda encephalitis and other autoimmune encephalitis diseases which can progress rapidly. the most common finding though is that the patient has been declining for years but it just went unnoticed because people are so used to covering for them until they're unable to do more simple things. if he hasn't had a proper neurological workup that's what i would recommend. as far as the nursing home, i can't imagine it will go well if he just shows up at a nursing home and no one told him he was going there. it really depends on how well he would probably tolerate that news. but i have seen families just bring their loved one to a nursing home that they never knew they were going to and he became so combative that he was kicked out of the nursing home fairly quickly. i also recommend a very deep research into the nursing homes available as most of them have pretty shady reputations. by any chance did he experience a stroke? my grandmother on my dad’s side (both my grandmothers had alzheimer’s) had a stroke which led to her rapid decline. i would tell him what is going on and get his doctor’s recommendation as to what the next steps should be. if you can and if you have the support for it, i would suggest bringing him home to be cared by family. we did that with my maternal grandmother for 7 years.",0,This is

"has anyone dealt with moderate to severe incontinence in a parent with alzheimer's? we've taken my dad to the urologist and he's on 3 different medications to tackle the incontinence from every direction but it doesn't seem to be working as well as we hoped. at this point, the incontinence issue is probably worse than the alz, since he is in fairly early stages of it. any advice would be greatly appreciated! routine helps a lot. after a meal, have him go to the bathroom. every two or three hours, have him go to the bathroom as well. my dad has a lot of accidents at night, so his caregivers get him up after three or four hours of sleep as well. my dad will grumble and be mad about it, but it helps to prevent accidents. we got depends for my mom. she does remember to go to the toilet sometimes - but sometimes it just comes out. and the depends are a lot easier than cleaning up the mess, especially because she doesn't always realize she's made one. she's also tried to wash them in the sink and in the washing machine (they get really big!) and sometimes she will put regular underwear underneath them. but it's still better than no diaper at all. one thing that seems to help my mid-stage partner: reminders. sometimes the sound of my using the bathroom is also a prompt. it sounds ridiculous, but just askng ""do you have to use the toilet"" may be able to break into the zone-out and get action started. of course, then it's on you not to be absent-minded. i increased the nightlight level in the bathrooms. that helped my partner's ability to use the bathroom at night. my advice is to talk about this straightforwardly and buy him some disposable briefs. unfortunately it'll slowly get worse, at some point it'll need diapers for both #1 and #2. constant reminders and a schedule help so you catch it before it happens. at some point they'll start missing the toilet even if they try to go, soil their clothes and not notice and walk around your house sitting on everything my mother in law developed double incontinence at the mid-ad stage - the part of her brain that tells her she needs to go to the toilet has been affected (common in ad). we tried taking her to the toilet more often but she was v reluctant and resistant. it got to the point where we had to get adult pull-ups. in the uk you can get them for free if your gp refers you to the continence clinic. i don't know where in the world you are, but perhaps there's a similar scheme you could utilise? as an aside, elderly people are more prone to utis, and they have a huge effect on dementia patients (my mil would become more aggressive/violent, paranoid, even forgot how to walk) - it's worth testing weekly (i bought the uti strips from amazon). wishing you the best of luck on this journey. yep. my mom would go in her pants while she was walking around. she’s had a couple of minor tias since then and seizures that robbed her of her speech and mobility. got the call today that she had another stroke and prob won’t last much longer. disease sucks father has the same issue, but his incontinence is due to the meds he's on. i live in a different country to my parents, so the only solution we've found is diapers ... dad is on the more affected end of the alzheimer’s spectrum and has a prostate issue. continence garments are a must at this point. routine is key until it doesn’t make an impact. if he is taking any anticholinergic medications for his incontinence it would exacerbate his dementia. typical ones are oxybutynin, detral, and toviaz  myrbetriq is the only incontinence medication recommended for dementia patients since it is not anticholinergic. a condom catheter is another option and of course depends. incontinence is usually pretty tough to treat in dementia. also be on the look out for doctors trying to label him with normal pressure hydrocephalus with his incontinence  it is commonly misdiagnosed in the alzheimer's population. routine can help. diapers too, but call it briefs so they feel less demoralized. a foley may be another option but that increase the risks of an uti. mum is incontinent and it started off slowly. she had some sort of episode the day before she went into hospital (never found out what - we thought it was a stroke, but wasn't) and from that day onwards she was urine incontinent 24/7. adult diapers are now the norm for my mum. it is very distressing for her as she is still aware enough to realise, but not understanding enough to know that it can't be fixed. very sad. forty years of dealing with alzheimer's, yes. i see my comment has been down voted. but, the fact is that out of control infections are the result negligence on the part of so-called ""caregivers."" i understand that it is hard to continually take your parent to the the hospital, but there is no answer on reddit that solves that. chronic infection is a sign of negligence. incontinence is usually due to infection in alzheimer's patients.",0,This is
"mom (91) passed last night. it came on quick. i live out of state and wasn’t able to see her the last three years. she had vascular dementia and had gotten to the stage where i couldn’t talk on the phone with her. i  prayed she would pass easily one day. i didn’t know she was taken to the hospital until she was gone. i was hoping i would get to see her one more time . . and what really sucks , is my husband has alzheimer’s and i can’t travel with him. last time i drove  long distance with him he tried to  find something to cut the seatbelt and he opened the car door while i was driving on the interstate. so going to moms funeral is out of the question. i don’t dare fly with him . i would love to have some closure. just putting it out there because ad sucks. so i’ve been  talking to mom and letting her know how much she has meant to me and all the things i wish i could have talked to her about the last 8 years. i hope she can hear me. i love you mom . and fuck you dementia. my sympathies go out  for those who have also lost someone. we are all dealing with this everyday and i hope you all have bright moments and find your own little space of calm and peace . i’m so sorry for your loss, i hope that peace and closure find you in other ways ♥️ i lost mom last tuesday morning to ad. she had stopped eating and drinking for weeks + she slept almost 24 hours a day. i wanted to hear mom say “i love you son” one more time. i wanted her to say it but i wanted her to mean it too. so sorry for you. a mom couldn’t do anything less. fuck dementia, my mom is 61 and has early onset alzheimer's. i'm afraid to lose it the day she will leave. sorry about your husband too, i'm dealing with that myself right now and wouldn't even consider traveling with him. wishing you gentle moments.",0,This is
"my dad has dementia and is going to need full-time help soon enough. (driving, shopping, etc.) my mother is a half-functioning alcoholic (half the time sober and amazing, half the time binge drinking/in bed.) i wouldn't say they are in denial but they are 100% wanting to kick the decision down the road and don't seem motivated to face it. how would you deal with this situation? i live several hours away. plan a visit with them. prepare for a very difficult but necessary conversation about both of their end-of-life care. tell your mom in advance you plan to discuss this during your visit and ask if she can dig up a copy of her will if she has one, and if she would be willing to “get some things squared away” with you “just in case”. or if you dont think she’d take it well, dont mention it but it may make it easier if she is prepared as well for the discussion. ask her when she would like help caring for your father. at what point will she not want to be his only caretaker? discuss finances available for that care. maybe there is a neighbor or a friend that can stop in for a couple hours a day to watch your dad and do a couple of chores for her, and care could ramp up from there as he progresses. discuss medical proxy, and possibly be prepared to draw up forms to make you the primary person to make decisions on your mother’s behalf in an emergency, rather than your father. discuss what your mother would like the later years of her life to look like. this may also soften her up to the idea of caregivers if she is against them...thinking about her future as a full time caregiver 5+ years down the road. while you’re there, check their house for hazards. people with alzheimers do better in bright light, especially in the winter when the sun sets so early; ensure they have a lot of good light in their house. it also helps prevent falls and injuries since depth perception can go with alzheimers as well. discourage the use of thick area rugs that have edges that can be tripped over, as well as any other trip hazards. offer to install a bar or a chair in their shower if they need that. just do some general things so you know theyre a *little* bit safer on their own. i’m sorry you’re going through this, and it might be hard to have those conversations with your mom but its the only way you can sleep soundly knowing you tried your best to get them to be safe short of uprooting your whole life and moving in with them. i'm in a very similar situation.... my step mother's drinking causes me massive anxiety as well knowing that she's my father's caretaker. i wish i had helpful advice. unfortunately i'm looking for some advice as well as this situation is a train wreck coming. i feel your pain. that’s a double whammy. i don’t know how to approach the drinking because people get super defensive when approached about that. but maybe if you get your mom into some support groups (even informal support groups) for people living with family with dementia she may start accepting his diagnosis and decline and perhaps get motivated to get herself together so she can be a better support for her hubby. the alzheimer’s association is a good resource for formal support groups. for something more informal you could try an online program- this is an nia funded movement program that includes some group interactions",0,This is
"i've never met anyone with alzheimer's before, but am visiting my aunt who was diagnosed in 2014 next week. i haven't seen her since 2011. although i will be with her daughter, whom she lives with, i am still nervous-- i know she won't know who i am, but what questions do i ask? how do i introduce myself? thanks in advance for the answers. this may sound crazy, but let her lead the discussion. don't ask questions, and i probably wouldn't even introduce myself -- just be friendly and warm. but let her lead the discussion and just be warm and friendly. follow-up thought: be prepared for her to say things that are uncomfortable, perhaps even to the point of being mean or rude. they both also get/got agitated very easily. also depends on the level but my dad likes to just make really random jokey chat. it’s his way to cover that he doesn’t really know what’s going on. so avoid referential conversations that need them to remember something you said a moment ago, like talking about your job, asking what she did yesterday etc. my advice is to just act like you normally would. they will probably ask you some of the same questions repeatedly, but each time just act like it's the first time they have asked. it's just really sad, my mom is in a memory care facility and all in all, it really sucks. looking after and care for family is necessary, even if it breaks your heart, everytime. you'll have to play it by ear, because you don't know at what stage in her illness she is. people with alzheimer's tend to be different person to person and even day to day. if you have time, a good youtube playlist is teepa snow's [making visits count. ]( (it's like an hour talk in total, it's just broken up into smaller chunks.) he's not great with questions, so we just take turns remarking on things that he takes pleasure in, like the view or the cats or his beloved wife. the conversation doesn't go deep, and we cover the same ground frequently, but that's fine--the point is the togetherness, not some intellectually probing discourse. if you can get tips from the family on things she currently enjoys or appreciates, that's a great place to go, and if not, just note what seems to draw her attention and go on with that. the best thing you can do for the both of you, is to play along. her time is more limited than yours is. just go with the flow. like someone previously said, if they start talking about something that isn’t true just go along with it. my dad and others at his facility really enjoy listening to music so sometimes when he gets frustrated i distract him with music on my phone. i’ve noticed many people at his facility enjoy the little things. i was amazed to see that although my dad doesn’t communicate much, he loves hitting a balloon back and forth. there’s no one way to approach someone with alzheimer’s, i wish there was.",0,This is
"i found out that to ""manage"" someone's social security benefits/payments, a power of attorney is not enough - you need to be the individual's representative payee. but i don't know what the ssa means by ""managing"" benefits. does anyone have any experience in needing to ""manage"" the benefits, so that becoming a rep payee makes sense? i don't understand the need, and why a poa wouldn't be enough for most cases? tia! i need to establish rep payee to sign my dad up for medicare in the next month (his diagnosis was poorly timed there). also pisses me off that poa isn't good enough for some financial institutions. i had to get notarized letters of incapacitation and shit to gain access to his assets to pay for care. this took over a month in some cases! just over this crap. for those who have poa, don't assume it won't be a circus to actually be able to use it. i'm rep payee for my parent. it's super annoying, and as you say poa isn't enough. neither is guardianship. you have to specifically go through a process with the social security administration that in my case resulted in the need for a recent statement from a doctor that my parent is incapacitated because the guardianship documentation was not recent enough. you also have to answer questions demonstrating that you're the best person to do it and you have to provide documentation. you also have to sign stuff that says you'll follow all their rules about how you can use the funds on the person's behalf (the managing part). you probably need a new bank account for the person to accept the funds, which you are required to set up direct deposit for, and you have to do a yearly accounting for what you did with the funds. we just added my wife and i to my mom's bank account. so between our poa and being on her account with our own cards, we've been able to handle everything. we are going through this now. my grandmother was the rep payee for my uncle for years. she just had his ssdi sent to his checking account, never filed reports or anything. now ssa just sent a letter saying that since she died, they won't send him money until a new one is identified. yes i have been rep.payee 15 yrs no issues",0,This is
"my dad has become increasingly forgetful. he frequently forgets how to get home, or he forgets a conversation that we just had 15 minutes ago. once i remind him, then he remembers. for example, he needs surgery on his carotid artery. i'm arranging it for him. i hung up, called and spoke to his doctor to set a pre surgery appointment. i called my dad back, literally 10 minutes or less later. i said ok dad we have to meet with the surgeon before they will schedule your surgery. your carotid is 80% blocked. stuff like this happens a lot. how do you tell the difference between normal aging, vascular dementia and alzheimers? you leave that to the professionals. get an appointment with a neurologist who specializes in dementia, or go for geriatric assessment at a department of geriatrics. you father's primary care doctor can refer him. it's a good idea to communicate either by mail/email or telephone ahead of time with some of your observations, to clue the doc in that a real assessment is needed. also it's best if you accompany your dad (or someone does), or he's likely to hear what he wants to hear and report back to you, ""doc says to just enjoy myself."" (that's not what doc said!!) alzheimers is a form of dementia. the only way to diagnose alzheimers is post death via autopsy. vascular dementia and alzheimers typically go hand in hand. my mom was dxed with both. my dad got in a pretty serious accident, lucky no one was hurt but two cars were totalled. he was just going to the grocery store about 1/2 mile from his house, his accident was about 3 miles from the store, he forgot where it was. basically alzheimers is the advanced progression of physical impairment of the brain via shrinking and other damage. the current state of the art for diagnosing alz is an amyvid pet scan, which looks for amyloid plaque. it was quite the task getting insurance to pay for it though. my dad was diagnosed w early stage alzheimer’s via a blood test and spinal tap. there are specific markers the dr looks for in those tests. he had several other cognitive & motor tests along the way as well.",1,This is

"hi everyone,  i know both being stubborn and having trouble making decisions are symptoms of alzheimer's but i wanted to know why this is, if anyone knows. as time goes on my grandma has been getting increasingly disinterested (?) the other problem recently is stubbornness. for example she saw something in our neighbor's yard and asked my mom if it was in neighbor #1s yard or neighbor #2s yard. another example is taking showers. my mom asked her why not and she eventually said it was difficult...to open the shower door. we are lucky to get her to take a shower once a week at this point. does anyone know anything about these? why this shows up in alzheimer's, how it's a part of it and what we can do to address it? thanks for any suggestions. i really recommend teepa snow for understanding more; she's a very respected name in alzheimer's caregiving, and she's practical and funny and smart as a whip. i got into her via [this playlist]( but there are lots of other videos. for me it could be college-level calculus (or any calculus at all, really). imagine being in a family where everybody does this breezily and then being asked to solve a calculus problem--that's likely to be how your grandmother feels when asked to make a decision. not only can't she do it, it's stressful to be asked. the shower thing could be any number of things, and i wouldn't overfocus on what she *says* is the reason. the same could be said for drilling a cavity without novocaine, but not many people sign up for that either. so maybe it hurts her hand, or she's not sure if she's opening the door correctly and that's why it's not opening, or the bathroom lighting is confusing or the floor is slippery or it's cold, or she's struggling to get clothes on and off, or she forgets why she was in the bathroon, or she doesn't give a damn about taking a shower now because she can't smell anything bad and she doesn't enjoy them, so why bother? addressing it often means letting it go. good spotting."" for the shower, it might be time for assistance in the process, not just the direction to take the shower. the decision issue is because thought is much harder when you have dead brain cells. i try to be sympathetic about it, or sometimes order for my husband and he seems relieved. i don't agree that alzheimer's people are necessarily stubborn. two other things to know about dealing with dementia. it's okay to lie, as long as it's something not likely to be found out; and redirecting is much better than direct confrontation. good luck! never argue with a dementia patient, even over something as simple and clear to you as the property lines of your neighbours. as their brain changes due to the dementia so does their perception, understanding and ability to communicate effectively about the situation. as for making decisions, lets say the question is steak or chicken for dinner? does she remember what the choices are? has she forgotten how to eat a steak dinner? does she think she needs to help cook, but can't remember how? many dementia patients hate taking showers as the disease progresses: one of the big reasons is due to not liking the water hitting their head and the other is not remembering what to do. things that can help: don't give her a choice, make sure the bathroom is warm, have warmed towels or robe ready for after she is out, you may need to get in with her so be ready for that, treat it as very routine. stubbornness and the other problems are going to seem minor when she can't feed herself or walk anymore. the most difficult thing to accept is that alzheimer's is progressive, and there is no rationale that changes that. the way to handle this is to say “would you like chicken or steak for dinner?” rather than “what would you like for dinner?”. simply stop asking open ended questions! either-or, or yes-or-no will be relieving for both of you. for the stubbornness: similar reason, its because they can tell they’re missing information and it makes them angry/frustrated more often than not, no one likes to feel like they’re forgetting or they’re wrong about something they *think* they’re sure about. try reaching out to your local alzheimer's chapter. they even have support groups for you to share your experiences and ask questions. first you get scared. then you go to fight or flight mode. just keep it simple. my mom has had cognitive decline since before the pandemic but was able to hide it pretty well, no socializing probably accelerated it. april ‘21 i visited after being vaccinated (she in sc, me in nyc) i knew she needed someone to come in to help but she still refused so i let it go. fast forward to january 22… she had a heart attack in the shower and was down for about a day before i sensed something was wrong (spoke with her on a saturday, she was very disoriented, didn’t return my calls a few days later) & asked a neighbor to check on her. i’ve been here at her house caregiving since; she is and has always been stubborn and hard headed as hell. i’ve learn to deflect and redirect just like when i hang out with a drunken friend. dementia is brain damage… it won’t get better. good luck 🙂",0,This is
"hi guys,  i hope this post is fine. basically today my mum has been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease, most likely alzheimers but we will find out more on a second round of tests in 3 months. it's heartbreaking for her because she has worked in the nhs in the uk on dementia wards for the last 15 or more years and has said it's her biggest fear to forget who her kids are. i'm out drinking at the moment (just a disclaimer against typos) but i wanted to ask some advice. of course part of that will be emotional support but another part is practicality. i want to start a conversation about doing things to make her life easier because she is okay at the moment but things will be different in ten years time. for example, she had recently talked about selling her house and mortgaging two to rent out to make passive income. i don't think this will be sustainable with everything in mind so i wanted to advise her to buy something outright that she can own and not have having over her if that makes sense? similarly i would advise her to live close to myself and my brother so if she needs us we are close by. this isn't at all intended to be patronising or anything i'm honestly just trying to start a conversation around ways to make her life easier for the years that are ahead. with all that preamble i wanted to ask if you had advice of things we could think about or start talking about in terms of preparing for the future to make sure she is comfortable, happy and independent for as long as she can be. i'm sorry if i am wrong or stupid with anything that i am saying; she is an amazing woman and my hero and has been a mum and a dad to me and i am just searching for anything i can that will make life better and give her less stress if that makes sense? if you were in the us, i would tell you to get a durable power of attorney and living will. i don't know if you need that in the uk. there are a bunch of resources pinned to the top of the dementia subredit. i would recommend you have an honest conversation about what she wants for her future while she is still able. i'm so sorry you were just hit with the probable diagnosis. between my grandmother and my mom, i've been dealing with alzheimer's for forty years, and when i read these sad stories, i want to be in support, but i still never know what to say. this is going to be a tough time, and keep it simple as possible, but if your mom is still lucid, take care of the financial matters as soon as possible, with an eye towards the very real possibility that living in her own home will not be permanent. the more you can prepare for in advance, the better. having other family members to help, is very important, as well, if you have them. 🥂 don't rush her talking about extended decisions. one thing that has worked well for me is to involve a social worker in some difficult discussions. you might also want to get in therapy yourself to help you cope with the stresses and sadness. it doesn't have to be weekly, maybe monthly or quarterly would feel right to you. i see a psychologist monthly and find it very helpful. i second the top comment. get a power of attorney and a will. im in the uk and helping my nana with it now. it covers both finances and health. i know it sounds controlling and patronising right now - but down the line there will be a point when shes no longer in capacity to make decisions and that is where you as a family will need to step in. this is as a safeguard for her wellbeing and assets knowing its someone she trusts managing this when she cant in her best interest. it doesn't have to come into effect until she's without capacity if thats a concern right now too! there are loads of options. i'm in scotland so if youre in another nation im not sure of the protocols, but speak to the memory clinic about all of this (they usually have handy info packs for both patient and family/carers). most importantly, look after yourself as well as mum! its so exhausting doing all of this at times, as much as you love them. reach out to carer and family support services for advice on how to proceed. theyre the experts at the end of the day. but ill also add that your own mum is an expert in herself; having a frank, open and empathetic conversation (while acknowledging there may be conflicts of opinions or difficulty in accepting diagnosis) is the best way forward to ensuring things are done the way your mum sees fit for herself. its still her and her life, youre just helping making things a bit easier. other little helpful things, you may or may not use them yet depending on how troublesome her memory can get at present:  -leave notes for all important stuff like brushing teeth twice a day next to mirror in toilet, how long and what temp to cook food in micro or oven. keep a notepad by the phone for her to write things as soon as the call ends. - buy a big digital clock that says the time and full date and the time of day it is in full display in common area (nana loves this!) - have a weekly wall planner that has reminders to do things like go food shop or do a bit of dusting  - speak to occupational therapy through social work to get adjustments to the home that make appliances and things more user friendly and safer to ensure shes independent at home as long as possible  - continue with stable routines/habits e.g. leaving keys by table at the front door, going to see you for coffee at the same day and time  - if she takes medications, get the gp to change them to blister packs that portion it into the day of week and time of day which js delivered to her home weekly. call to remind and wait until shes taken it, if this is a point of issue. good luck and stay well all of you xx",0,This is
"firstly i want to apologise in case i use any terms or anything incorrectly, i don’t know a lot about alzheimer’s so i’m going with what i’ve read. i (18) have noticed my dad’s changing behaviour since around 2020. at the start of the pandemic specifically he became irritable and argumentative, we assumed it was just him being bored and angry about covid so he was taking it out by saying outrageous things and fighting with me and my siblings about them. in fairness, a lot of his behaviours sound like symptoms of dementia although he has never really gotten “worse”, is always just the same eg he gets very stressed about things like making dinner, giving lifts or going on trips. recently he forgets things like what i’m doing, eg a couple days ago i had to travel to a different city and told him i needed a lift to the bus, and on the day of he forgot and i had to jog his memory quite a bit before he remembered. basically, i can’t tell if this is just him getting old or if it’s signs of early-onset alzheimer’s. or if the term “getting old” actually stems from a misunderstanding of what alzheimer’s is? the thought of it affecting my dad petrifies me and it weighs on my mind a lot. i’m scared to “lose” my dad since i am so close to him and my siblings and i are still pretty young. i don’t want to bring it up with my younger siblings or my mother who works 40+ hrs and is also pretty much full time studying, as i don’t want to scare any of them especially if i’m just overthinking. thank you for taking your time to read :) some of these things could be indicative of dementia, but honestly, what you are describing does not sound like dementia to me. only a doctor can say. forgetting to pay bills, paying them twice because she forgot she paid them already, ordering things she already had, then not knowing where her money would go. issues with short term memory. forgetting what day/year it was, what state she was in, whether she had eaten or not, forgetting recent conversations or events. asking the same questions or telling the same story over and over. hygiene issues. things like not bathing or brushing her teeth for days. when we would bring it up she would insist she had just taken a shower or brushed her teeth. forgetting what to do or how to operate during normal daily activities like using a computer, her phone, using the tv remote, the microwave, etc. she hid it well at first, but over time it became more and more obvious she was struggling. again, i am no doctor, but what you are describing sounds more like age-related forgetfulness, but it's hard to say without getting him to the doctor to be checked. alzheimer’s is really difficult to diagnose just by symptoms so there’s no real way for you specifically know he has it, there’s so many things that have to be ruled out before a neurologist considers it alzheimer’s (coming from someone whose dad was diagnosed with it at 61/62). the symptoms he’s showing could be caused from other things that maybe should be looked at by a primary care doctor first (i’m not sure exactly what but there’s plenty of possibilities)   if he shows more serious signs of forgetfulness you can and should encourage him to go to his primary care doctor and/or neurologist. he will probably fight against going or roll his eyes but if he is experiencing dementia there is help out there to slow things down so getting to the root of it sooner rather than later is a great move. i wouldn’t jump to conclusions but i very much empathize with your situation, hope all is okay with your dad ♥️ i am not an expert but if you are noticing those things at his fairly young age, it is worth looking in to. try talking with your mom about it; this is a lot for you to carry alone. your mom could be noticing things but she’s afraid to worry you about it. ideally you or mom could talk to dad about it. if he is willing to talk w his dr about seeing a neurologist that would be best to sort things out and get treatment if needed. you are an intuitive person and your dad is lucky to have someone like you in his corner.",0,This is
"my mom's neighbour is getting worse and her half sister and friend are doing next to nothing to help her, instead, just leaving it all to my 81 year old mom to worry about. the neighbour, who i'll refer to as f, does not look after herself, wears the same clothes for days, repeatedly goes to the bank to withdraw money, which she then secretes somewhere, forgets where it is, then goes back for more, and is often lost, dazed and confused in the street, a mile or so down the road. meanwhile, despite my mom relaying all this back to her half sister and friend, all they say is that, because f is adamant she doesn't want strangers (carers) in the house, their hands are tied. they also just say 'she has safeguarding in place'. uh, ok.  so, it's all on my mom. you can call adult protective service and have someone check on her. when my mom had memory issues and was living by herself, she fell. when the doctor checked her she was ok but  he had a social worker visit the house w  they were actually very helpful with us getting the care she needed and some physical therapy. we had talked to mom before her fall and she insisted on living by herself. well, if it's too much for your mom, she can always step back - she isn't family, after all. but maybe your mom likes to feel needed? if you call the local social service agency, and describe the above, they most likely can have a social worker make a friendly visit. they won't drag the neighbor off in chains, it's more social. they can perhaps offer that there are free rides to lunch at the senior center, or something like that to get her involved. nice of you to care!",0,This is
"there are a lot of you on here that ask for resources to help you as a caregiver. i just wanted to plug that the alzheimer’s association has a free 24/7 helpline that can be translated into over 100 languages. the people answering the helpline calls are all social workers with a masters degree and can help with any question you have - ranging from “what is alzheimer’s” all the way to you being in a crisis and need guidance on how to handle the situation. they can also help connect you to local support, like support groups, care consultants, education, etc. it’s an amazing resource that i highly recommend. thank you so very much this hotline saved me when i was navigating my mom’s first steps into her alzheimer’s. they are so kind and so helpful. if they don’t have the answer, they are great at directing you where to go to get one. 10/10 give them a call if you need help!",0,This is

"i ended up having a talk the week before last with my mom’s (64 f) daycare about her general decline, they agree she has declined, and said they didn’t think it would be any trouble for her to be evaluated and qualify. we had the hospice referral appointment with her pcp last tuesday, and it hit me harder than i was anticipating. so much so, i ended up calling out sick for work the next day, and took a me day while mom was at daycare. the first hospice agency referred to us by the pcp was not a first choice of the woman who runs the support group that i’m in, and i trust her opinion. my mom really qualified without any second thought. they’ll provide a shower chair, a wheelchair and a hospital bed as soon as i have room for them to. i got her a rollator last week that has been helping at daycare. other supplies will be provided as well. of course i just did a pretty recent big restock of diapers and wipes…  i’m a little nervous that i’m not actually going to get the extra help and relief i need. a nurse will come out twice a week, and an aid can come out 5, but only for an hour to get her ready for the day. she can still go to daycare and be on hospice as long as she does not become completely hard to care for in their facility. she will be assigned a social worker who may be able to help me figure out more in home health services or short term respite care. i know i need to see how this even plays out to start. they can arrange a 5-7 day skilled nursing facility stay for respite otherwise. my mom doesn’t understand much anymore. what do i tell her about this? do i keep it simple and just say they’re new friends coming to help, or do i tell her that she’s on hospice? i have a feeling it’s the former, but want to get some input. is this a sign she knows it could be happening, or is it just the insecurities of the disease? i mean, she’ll say it at the most random times sometimes. i could be putting her socks on or getting her out of bed, and she’d say it. i probably need to have a physical scheduled as soon as possible. hey there. i am in a very similar situation, my mom (67) was diagnosed with alzheimer's 7 years ago. she has been on hospice for the last 3 months and they have been wonderful. accept the extra help, yeah you can shower your mom but it's great to be able to hand off some care. caregiver fatigue is a real issue, please make sure you're taking care of yourself. i am deep in this too, message me if you want to chat. it's great for you both that you'll be receiving additional hours & help, well done! i'm in australia so our system is different, idk. probably a 5-day break would be really good for you, give some time to catch up with yourself. best of luck with everything! just put your mom in hospice. tough go. u did wonderfully!!! my dad passed from dementia. mom elected to keep him at home, for familiarity. before mom passed, she & my brother arranged for 24/7 care. i kept praying for our lord to take him home. on day he was brought to hospital, he even complimented an employee of his tie. i applaud your efforts getting your mom into hospice. best of luck.",0,This is
"i don’t know if ptsd is the right word i’m sorry if it’s not. in 2020 i lost my grandmother to alzheimer’s and that was hard but just last month i lost my second grandmother to alzheimer’s i was much closer with her and saw her decline first hand since then i’ve been having panic attacks and freak out when my mom or other family members forget things. i’m laying in bed crying worried about having to go through that ever again does anyone else have this problem? this is apparently an evolutionary adaptation to help us see potentially dangerous situations ahead of time, and take appropriate action to avoid the same danger in the future. that's ptsd in a nutshell. (i'm not a doctor or psychologist). another direction might be reaching out to a grief therapist. my sincere condolences on your losses; and big, warm internet hugs to you. other commenter is right, i definitely had diagnosed ptsd when my dad had it and after he died it changed but it was still there. i would also suggest you consider joining a support group. they are free, and they used to be in person, but since covid there are many online:  . the anxiety you describe is similar to what many folks experience.. you may find comfort that its not just you. maybe you can find a good fit for you. . good luck.",0,This is
"my grandmother was diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago, but we knew long before she finally agreed to see the neurologist. since the diagnosis it just feels like everything has now progressed so rapidly. just last week things were bad, but after going away for the weekend i returned to the news from my mother that she had gotten substantially worse in the few days i had been gone. a couple days ago my grandmother was barely capable of holding a conversation, but now she isn’t even able to string together a couple of words coherently. the scariest part is i’m sitting in the er right now, and i can swear i hear the death rattle. she has also been mumbling what sounds like my grandfather’s name. so far we have ruled out a stroke, and they don’t seem to think she has any sort of infection. i just can’t wrap my head around how quickly this is all happening. i just sort of needed an outlet for my feelings with some people that understand. alzheimer's is a fucking awful disease. my first thought was a uti. my mother has alzheimer's and she would get very, very bad when she had an uti. she made sandwiches for my dad who died in 2011. she couldn't read a clock, understand the time, or why it was dark outside. i sincerely hope your grandmother is just going through a bad spell. so sorry for you! my mother is also rapidly getting worse in the last few weeks. stay strong for both of you. every timing is different, my mom has been calling for her mom for a few years now and she died 45 years ago. my mom has been bedridden and immobile for almost 17 months now and her limbs have been ""frozen"" for well over 6 months now. it really does seem like she is near the end now but we said that throughout all of 2021. she is 87 and has been at stage 7 for well over 5 years and with obvious moderate stage dementia for over 15 years. my mom definitely has the prolonged version of the disease and it's been terrible for several years now. memories usually go back to where they remember people from their past, that’s maybe why she’s saying your grandfather’s name. definitely check out the uti connection tho!",0,This is

nan i hate to be skeptical but.... this person was reportedly diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's in 2014 and this book was published in 2022.  early onset alzheimer's is a more rapid disease. truthfully the vast majority of people diagnosed in 2014 with early onset alzheimer's would likely be deceased by now or completely debilitated. even her first book in 2018 (4 years after diagnosis) is far too along in an early onset alzheimer's disease course to be able to write a book even with assistance.,0,This is
"my grandmother is fiercely independent but lately has not been able to function the way she used to. i'm in a worrisome debate if it's regular aging or signs of something more serious. forgetting conversations we’d had the day before and misplacing car keys and stuff all the time 2011, my mom was complaining about the fancy new name that they gave the “tidal wave” that hit japan. there were a few things for me:   - his driving got worse. an excellent driver, he started to get into car accidents. drove a lot slower than usual and would  ignore usual traffic ""politeness"". - he wasn't able to grasp new games, even with my guidance. - we would call each other over skype to play our weekly games. did this for years. as soon as i started to see changes to those key abilities of his, i knew something was off. not being able to pay bills or follow recipes, she would just get too overwhelmed. all the while, refusal to see a professional. hiding and denying changes. and, of course the frequent accidents that weren’t her fault. it took a year but the state finally took her driving privileges away. “he” was always “she,” and “she” was always “he.” that started cropping up in 2017 when she didn’t even register as having mci on the moca (scoring 29/30). that was also the year my 23&me came back showing i had a copy of the apoe4 gene and i knew then, in my gut, my mom was on that path. then, slowly over the next few years, more and more words began to be replaced, if a store closed, it had “died,” if a tire was flat, it was “dead.” now, on her worst days, every other noun is just a “thing.” she’s still early stage and can live independently with very little assistance, but she’s right at the tipping point to middle dementia. praying before eating dinner - he would always do (lead?",1,This is
"my dad had a fall and his caregiver couldn’t pick him up. she called for a lift assist from the fire department and they wanted to take him in to the er just in case. when i got there, i asked them if they did a uti screen. the doctor said it’s not protocol. i knew a uti had to be the problem with his balance and increased confusion. fell on the carpet) i called his regular doctor and asked him to order a urine test. of course it came back as a major bladder infection. what would have happened if i hadn’t followed up and just let the infection rage?!? what could the hospital possible be thinking by not running such a simple test?!? ugh, so frustrating!! so, insist on a urine test! that’s insane. you can buy uti test strips even on amazon. i kept them in the house so i could check as my husband was prone to them. prior to that his primary care doctor just had me drop off urine to test. i combined these so i only had to get the doctor involved when i was sure it wasn’t just a odd turn. it’s not always a uti but it’s nice to rule one out before it becomes severe. my dad has had 3 bad accidents/falls on account of having a bad uti. first was a car accident (still early on in his diagnosis), another was a horrible face plant onto pavement, and lastly a tumble down the stairs. what is it about ad patients and uti? it’s crazy how much damage they can do to people with alzheimer’s.",0,This is
"i’m 21 and my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer’s when i was 17/18. i lived with only him from ages 14-18 and feel i missed out on many of those years and potential experiences due to worrying about/caring for my father. i had decided not to go away to college because he would say things like “you’re the only reason i’m here” all the time and ask if i was going to stay with him. i’m having a really hard time knowing what to do right now because i want to go back to a new school across the country next spring. i feel like i’ve made so many decisions based on everyone else’s happiness instead of my own, it feels like it’s been such a battle to survive most of my life, and i’ve finally been figuring things out for myself and feeling better. some things are going on right now with his potential guardianship which has been extremely difficult and is taking me back to those years when i was 14-18, feeling so stuck and helpless. it makes me feel terrible because obviously i want to do everything i can for my father, but i need to think about me. i want to have him in my life and have a good relationship, i want to be able to know what’s going on with him and help to make decisions. i guess i’m wondering people’s thoughts on that, whether you’re my age or someone older. am i being a bad person for wanting to go to school somewhere else? also if anyone has advice about experiencing a parent having alzheimer’s at a young age, or any life advice for someone in their 20s, i would greatly appreciate it. i think if my dad wasn’t sick he would be proud of me and excited for me. he always wanted to make sure i had the ability to do what i wanted with school and careers and express my talents. thinking about that makes me smile but it hurts. - my parents are divorced, my mother greatly cares for my father and they have lunch once a week imo, go. alzheimer's is already stealing what is left of his life. that being said, i'm a 45 year old man, missing out on many things, including things with my own child, to continue caring for my mom who is on hospice and could remain so for god knows how long. it sounds like you have already put your father before yourself. i think you should focus on yourself for a bit. ended up not going to go stay with my mom and try to care for her (no official diagnosis at this point but she was not able to hold a job and had very clear signs. we knew it was alzheimer’s)  you should go to school. my dad has it too. my mom thinks that he's had it for a while, but his symptoms started getting worse when i was 14ish. i'm in my 20s now and i'm in a similar situation to you. do what's best for you. i am glad i lived my life and if i had stayed 24-7 to care for my parent, i would be bitter considering it's a likely possibility for me. i echo every one else here - go and live your life to the fullest you can. i'm hopeful it will be what your father would wish for you. i'm 39 and cared for my dad for about 10 years - we tried to keep him at home for as long as we could but it came to the point that it was no longer safe or dignified for him to remain there. the respite provided to me since he has been in a care home has been significant - i feel like i can live my life again and do things i've been unable to for the past 10 or so years - and it feels good. you deserve to live your life now! you only get one life, you don't owe it to anyone but yourself. please let your parents make their own decisions for their own lives. alzheimer’s destroys everything. but alzheimer’s destroys everything and that will still be true even if you stay. good luck with your decision. live your life. sometimes the kinds of sacrifices that you would need to make can leave you feeling bitter and resentful for many years to come. i don't think your dad would want that for you. don’t do what i did and be afraid to live your life. that being said, you aren't just losing your father to this disease. and what ever you end up choosing, do right by yourself first. you can't 'do right by him' if you are burned out. your health, mental and physical, comes first. don't break your back.",0,This is
"would like to hear about everyone's experiences good or bad with small residential assisted living or adult foster care based in a private house. better or worst than long term facilities? do smaller homes have better staff to resident ratio? if you have worked in or own one i would love to hear from you. would love details about your facility and why it's better in your opinion. i have not used either of these, but there was a period where i was looking into them as an option (mom decided to keep dad at home in the end). im not sure but i *think* a major deciding factor would be more about what kind of care the facility is qualified to give, and what kind you need. like some facilities have staff that are allowed to administer medicine, and some may not have staff thats allowed to (patient has to give medicine to themselves). some facilities aren't allowed to keep someone from wandering out, and some have a special status where they can. you might want to see if your state and county have a dept on aging or elderly or dementia. they may have guides describing rules that may be specific for your state or maybe even a handy list of facilities identified by type of care. depending on the level of care, you could eliminate your options quickly.",0,This is
"my father (68) has alzheimers and up until recently was being cared for exclusively by my grandmother (87). over the past year, my father's condition has progressively gotten worse and he's started showing signs of anger, anxiety, and aggression. anti-anxiety meds helped some, but it still got to a point where it was no longer safe for either of them to be in that house together and we made the decision to move him into memory care. unfortunately, the transition to memory care did not go well. within 4 days of moving him in he had assaulted another resident, cornered and threatened a staff member, and refused to eat or take his medications, until the facility finally asked for him to be transferred to a hospital because they couldn't handle him. fast forward 6 weeks and in that time, he's been in 3 different hospitals and 2 different geriatric psychiatric facilities. he was transferred back to memory care after the first psychiatric stay when they thought they had figured out his medication, but after 4 days he had assaulted another resident, was tearing pictures off the wall and throwing them, and had defecated on the floor of another resident's room. he's currently on his second geriatric psychiatric stay as they once again try to tweak his meds but i' m not hopeful. we are one week into what is supposed to be a 1-2 week stay so he's going to be discharged soon. the memory care facility he was originally in won't take him back and so far we haven't found any others that will take him. i don't see how he could come home, even with in-home nursing help. i just can't see how it would be safe for anyone. i've checked into some nursing homes but supposedly they are going to cost between 10-15k per month and that's not something we can afford. i don't believe he will qualify for medicaid as he has a pension that would put him over the eligibility requirements. making all this worse is i live on the west coast and am having to manage all of this remotely. this last 2 months have been so draining and we seem to be out of options. what are we supposed to do? i'm posting in hopes that someone maybe has a solution or something i haven't thought of but it all seems so hopeless. with my mom, we had to private pay until she was bankrupt. in her case, the only med that worked to ease her rage (she broke her own and other people's bones in attacks) was injections of haldol. because they had to be injections, we had to have 24-hour skilled nursing, and the doctors reported that it was a must to keep her from being a danger to herself and others. once she was bankrupt, the way medicaid worked was they took her pension and ss and returned it was i think $70 per month for her to have personal spending money. if you haven't talked to someone in medicaid locally, it helps to at least have the conversation with them to see what happens next. i'm really sorry you're going through this, op. i was in the same hopeless boat back in october of last year. my dad has increasingly gotten aggressive. because of covid, no geriatric psych places would even consider taking him in. his doctor at memory care was having no luck tweaking his medications. his facility was kicking him out and we couldn't find a single place within the state that would consider taking a man with ""behaviors"". we began looking out of state. i also asked about hospice and they agreed to have him evaluated. hospice believed my dad was probably suffering from terminal agitation and we signed him on to hospice. they gave him dilaudid but it didn't slow him down one bit. one of my nurse friends (seeing how hopeless the situation was) recommended i ask hospice about contacting aps. they did and got some social workers involved to help us out in finding a new facility. in the meantime, we had to hire 24/7 caregivers to live with him in memory care. somehow we found a facility nearby that would give him a chance as they typically handle people with ""behaviors"". we moved my dad to the new place (having hospice on-board was nice because they provided  a hospital bed). i'm just sharing my experience. reaching out to aps can be scary but we got desperate. nobody would take my dad and i knew if he got discharged anywhere, that his current memory care would not allow him back in. i feel like i truly tried everything. sadly there just aren't many resources for when your loved one gets aggressive/violent. and no, you cannot take him back in to the home with your grandmother. i'm so so sorry. i was in your position only 5 months ago. i'll be thinking about you. what i did was enlisted my friends' help in asking them to make calls to facilities for me. having someone else make those calls and keep a shared spreadsheet was probably the most helpful. i hope you have friends you can call on. such a heartbreaking disease.. so sorry.. you should try posting this question on the forum at agingcare.com the people over there tend to give better advice about these kinds of situations and are more realistic. this is a long shot, but i was just getting a massage today and in the waiting room, i read something in a ""massage therapy"" magazine about alzheimer's and massage. as little as 5 or 10 minutes of gentle massage, head, shoulders, neck, back or hands, reduced agitation and aggression in alzheimer's patients. it can be done by a cna, it doesn't have to be a licensed massage therapist. see if you can get his carers in the hospital to try that every day for a week. i'd also want to know if it happens only in the latter half of the day (sundowning) or if he has a uti. music might be useful. i was able to take care of my spouse who got alzheimer's in 2012. when the violence started the doctor perscribed risperidone .25 mg 3x a day. it was an amazing transformation and helped me be able to do everything at home until passing in 2020.   i got hospice involved in the last year and a half or so, which set us up with a hoyer lift, hospital bed,  and nursing care 3x a week all covered thru insurance and medicare, when walking no longer was an option. when covid started i voluntered to do bedbaths and the nursing was reduced to 1x a week to avoid unneeded traffic and risk of covid. this was during the time when it was so horrible in the nursing homes, before vaccines. i am grateful for the extra time i had, grateful that i didn't need to rely on any of the kids who all had jobs and families, grateful that i didn't need to bankrupt us or move out of this house we have lived together in for 35 years, grateful we never got covid. i miss my spouse so very much. hope this helps and god bless. i'm sorry i don't have a good or cheap suggestion, as we went through it with my mil when she was fist admitted to a mental care facility. we were finally able to get he placed into a facility which was able to manage her, both through medication, and through having ""large"" skilled nurses and aides who could control her outbursts. once a lifetime of savings, the home, everything was gone, medicare stepped in and took over. facility received every dime, social security, navy (spouse retirement) pension, everything except a few hundred bucks a month we were able to use for upgrades in food, cable tv, and a room with a view of the plants/garden outside. what breaks my hear more than anything is i'm on the front edge of this journey with my wife, who was diagnosed with early onset, and is now 67.  i'm not emotionally ready to have to watch the love of my life disappear from me in slow motion while i remain helpless and heartbroken and incapable of making anything better for her. please speak with the hospital social worker (or have his poa do so). the reality is that dad is likely going to need further adjustments of his medications & an onslaught of behavioural approaches to try & find the balance whereby he's not a danger to himself or others. what i know to be true in my province is that a hospital cannot discharge someone who needs constant care if a sufficient solution is not available. is the hospital the right place for him, long term? probably not but until his situation stabilizes, and a home is found, then i would not be accepting responsibility for him to come home. it's an impossible position to be put in, & the system is so very broken & i'm so sorry that your family is having to wade through this walking nightmare. talk to the social worker & reach out to the local alzheimer's society/ society for the aged & ask them for advice as well. sending you such support over the interwebs. xo there’s an anti-psychotic medication that my fil takes that really helped his aggression. if you want to know the name, dm me, i would have to ask the wife. regarding ~~medicare~~ medicaid you should talk to an elder care lawyer. typically, if a person qualifies for  ~~medicare~~ medicaid funded care they pay all their assets first, minus a very small amount, and ~~medicare~~ medicaid covers the rest. this varies from state to state so be sure to find a lawyer in their area. good luck",0,This is

"i’m worried about my mother. she can’t remember the most basic things. she asks me the middle names of my children, names of family members, birthdays, etc. this seems like the early stages of alzheimer’s. what is more alarming to me, though, is her obsession with things. i’m not sure if it’s related to alzheimer’s and i want your opinions. she doesn’t take it at the same time each day and often skips some to “save money”. for example, if an app she has resets and she loses her ability to login using face id, rather than a password, she will spend hours trying to fix it. when she asks me a question and i’m speaking with someone else, if i don’t immediately answer she will say “say” or “hello?”  she needs immediate answers to text messages or she will send 8-10 at a time. are these all signs of alzheimer’s or something else? thank you for your help. yes, these could all be signs of alzheimers or another form of dementia. get her to a doctor to check it all out. good luck. many of those i experience with my grandmother, who's been diagnosed with alzheimer's. her orientation of time is really off & i've had to learn how to not get annoyed ... and i've heard it is common from dementia educators. your mother likely can't assess the amount if time between texts, questions, etc. anxiety & hyper fixation also seems to be happening, but that could be a variety of diagnosis. have her checked out, good luck! longtime use of klonopin (clonazepam) can cause reversible confusion and cognitive impairment. does she need that for seizures? i took it for years for restless legs syndrome affecting my sleep. after i got off it, my brain slowly became better able to handle my daily affairs.",1,This is
"my mom is well into the later stages of alzheimer's and can no longer do  any self care. her restlessness and excitability is really  tiring, so we requested a medication to ease her anxiety. to my surprise  an anti-psychotic ( aripiprazole ) was prescribed, and while she does  tell imaginary stories i do not see how this drug will address her fear  and anxiety. anyone got any experience with the effect of this meds with  alz patients, and any relevant advice? i thought something like  lorazepam would be prescribed. i do not have any experience with aripropazol in dementia patients. i will say that after my grandmother (probable alzheimer’s) started taking seroquel, her mood improved dramatically. i have a family member who is a neurologist who has also seen seroquel help quite many dementia patients. i bet many other people here can attest to seroquel’s impact as well. my understanding is that if the dementia is alzheimer’s it will have the intended mellowing effect, however if it is a different type (ftd or lb, don’t remember) it will immediately make the mood worse. my grandmother was also prescribed lorazepam while she was in hospice, but she was one of those minority of people for whom it did not have the intended effect. although it made her sleepy, she became extremely paranoid with the delusion that we had kidnapped her and were holding her hostage. my mil (moderate stages) takes hydroxyzine twice a day and it works well. she takes 10 mg in the day time, and 25 at night. it has certainly worked well  to keep her anxiety and temper tantrums at bay. since she has high blood pressure and takes meds for that, i doubt she'd ever be on seroquel.",0,This is

"okay, so my dad was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. because i gave birth to a child and didn't live super close to my parents i was never able to attend many of his doctor appointments. now i have moved closer and my child is older, so i'm paying closer attention to his health and helping out my mom. one thing that was never made clear to me is what type of dementia he had. so at his last appointment with his neurologist, i asked her what type of dementia is he diagnosed with. and she said, based on his scans it's either alzheimer's or vascular dementia. so is that a thing? i guess i was looking for something definitive. not: maybe this, maybe that. i guess from her perspective it's all under the same umbrella, but from my prospective i'm just confused. yes, it's a thing. my mom also has vascular dementia and alzheimers. remember, alzheimers is a form of dementia so you're right, it's all under the same umbrella. i wish you all the best! eta: there is no definitive way to diagnose alzheimers while the patient is alive, it's only when they die that they can say (via autopsy) that it was alzheimers. another common cause is vascular dementia. a person can also have both. as others have said, alzheimer's can't be diagnosed with 100% certainty until an autopsy. i've read that alzheimer's presents as a slow progression whereas vascular dementia will process periodically with sudden changes. a uti will also appear as a sudden change, but treating the uti will help improve the sudden problem. my grandmother has vascular dementia and dementia. although i did assume they are the same and it's not? interestingly enough, not diagnosed with alzheimers. we went to different doctors and honestly, none were much help. my grandmother is on medication, it's really not improving her symptoms. i think going to get a second opinion will help in the sense of getting the right mix of medications if you don't think the dr. is doing what he can. my so has a dementia, undefined diagnosis at this point. but without an effective treatments or accurate tests, i am not pushing for further diagnostic testing. we are four years into the dementia, i am focused on positive support, seeing that she gets good food, plenty of rest and limit her over stimulation. i give her opportunity to be functional, but step in when she get confused. had a similar chat with my mom’s doc when she was diagnosed. he told me that the only true way to tell if it’s alzheimer’s is to do an autopsy after she passes away. until then, they use standardized testing. i read somewhere that mri scans show shrinking of the brain with alzheimer’s, more so than regular senile degeneration. while i’m assuming vascular dementia shows less blood flow>>>less circulation from kidney disease or diabetes>>>cognitive functional decline",0,This is

"my dad has been really struggling with being my moms primary caregiver. he never had to do much of the child raising and i can tell he’s cracking but am not sure how to help him emotionally. has anyone had success finding a counselor for their parent? he looked for support groups once and then never followed up so i think i’ll need to find someone and give him the push. why kind of counselor has training in this kind of thing. would it be a grief counselor or family counselor? any advice is appreciated my biggest help has been a local alzheimer's group, unless people have experienced it themselves they just don't get it. even just sitting and listening to other people has helped me have some perspective on my own situation. i’m the primary for my mom. i have things covered, but from the outside it might look like i’m holding up way better than i am. you know what i’d absolutely melt for? if i came home from work one day and someone had arranged for my mom to be looked after so that they could take me out to dinner as a thanks for everything. i know there’s no medals for this, and i don’t really expect it, but making time to really acknowledge your dad’s dedication might really mean the world to him. go together with him to a support group or 2, whatever you can find, and folk there likely will know of counsellors / therapists specialising in carer support / grief processing. folk often research for support but then not follow through - if you find when & where & tell him you're going together with him, then that breaks the ice & starts him off. or ask your area alzheimers .org &/ dementia .org, they know for sure. good luck! get his blessings before you take the next step—but my 2¢, select the counsellor, set up an appointment, make sure his ""shift"" with mom is covered for the time he'll need, and gently push him out the door with enough time to get there. how to select: if there is a nurse who comes in, then there is some kind of institutional apparatus behind the nurse: hospice, hospital, medi-care/caid… reach out to them for referrals, best kind of counsellor to seek. if not, contact his pcp for a referral. why you need to set wheels in motion: dementia is contagious. caregivers need to remember, sequence, execute millions of adl tasks for self *and* for loved one. lack of self care leads to lack of care for loved one, leads to lack of self-care… vicious cycle. god bless you for caring for the caregiver. my dad was similar, caring for wife & emotionally reserved & struggling with his own issues, and he was a total mess. my dad found a class that he was able to take virtually through the local adult day care center. the class was perfect. the class included video examples, a handout binder broken into sections like ""eating"", and a live instructor that was able to answer questions and also curtail some of the winding stories from other classmates. pm me if you want and i can share the local day care details - there may be something similar in your area. i find it almost impossible to be able to join and attend a specific group, but have gotten a lot of great information from this youtube channel, which i can watch anytime it's convenient for me. [www.alz.org](   this will help you find your local alzheimer's chapter. they have group meetings. he needs to attend. set it up for him. get him there. if he's financially stable, then hire an assistant to help out a few days/nights a week. nobody can be a care taker 24/7 and stay sane. ask the nurse for a list of recommended care takers. the nurse or the social worker can provide this. take care. it's a tough job to take care of the dying but even harder when we love them.",0,This is
"do any of you in the pre-diagnosis stage worry that getting a diagnosis will cause your loved one to deteriorate faster? that’s what i’m struggling with. my family and i can tell something is wrong with my dad (and has been for sometime) but he’s already so sad i worry he will give up all hope if he finds out for sure something is wrong. we’ve already had a neuropsych consult and they want him to come in for further testing. i am pushing to get it done but the more adamant i am about it, the more i wonder if it’s even the right choice. i have been insistent that we need to know what we’re dealing with but honestly i don’t know what to think anymore. thanks in advance for any advice. no; a diagnosis will not affect the disease. what i've had happen, though, is my loved one stopped trying to fake being neurotypical. in a word, she appears like someone with more pronounced dementia than previously. that's while she's around me. we talk about dementia—openly, gently, with respect. having a diagnosis helps me know better how to help her maintain her dignity. helps me learn strategies which would violate norms for neurotypical people, but that have now become helpful—completing her sentences, tying her shoes, asking ""do you understand,"" cutting her slack when she can't remember or do something. i've set down my experiences; ymmv. i get you’re worried your dad will feel sadder with a diagnosis, but in my case - my mom knew something was wrong with her, and it upset her not knowing why or what was going on. now that we have a diagnosis, i think it helps her to have an explanation. now when she gets upset because she can’t remember something, i tell her “well mom, it’s because you have alzheimer’s. the alzheimer’s makes you forget.”  it weirdly calms her, i guess because there’s a reason for what’s happening, and knowing what it is in that moment might be helping her confusion. i can tell you from my family’s experience, getting the diagnosis is the right choice. once you have it, you can move forward and get information and help on what to do next. odds are, though, they'll agree it's probably alzheimers. one side note worth mentioning: my mom was also called back for extra testing. at the advice of my bil, an md, my dad asked a lot of questions around what they were looking for specifically, and found out that particular neurologist wanted to enroll my mom in a very expensive drug trial. the extra testing (which my parents would have paid for) only would have shown whether she was a candidate for that trial. so... ask questions. what sort of further testing do they want? neuropsych testing is pretty comprehensive. if his neuropsych testing did not diagnose dementia then he may not have it. severe depression can mimic dementia as well. i experienced something similar to what you describe - i would just say treat it like it’s in your head … at the end of the day, your doing the best you can and make sound judgments while accounting for all evidence. my moms second round of tests showed major decline, enough for the neuro-psych to say “most likely dementia”, and then no follow ups or anything (after a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and small vessel ischemic)  there are times when it seems like a diagnosis makes it worse, mom is relatively lucid and any diagnosis would be perceived by her as straight up gaslighting (hence she refused to see the neuro psych again anyway). but a couple hours later she may think she is in her childhood home and wondering where her parents are …   in sum, i think the diagnosis is critical to get help in the system (i just changed her doctors so she will be more comfortable) - but it may also lead to a lot of crazy fighting (especially if they think they are fine, or constantly forget about the diagnosis). with my one data point, i say no. i have tried changing things up numerous ways to try to manage and try to stay ahead of my wife’s decline. her decline has been a constant steady progression. it seems like every week i noticed a subtle little thing she can’t now do. when she can’t feed herself or use the restroom properly it seems significant, but i see the constant steady decline. staying on a constant schedule of sleep and meds seems to make for much better next days.",0,This is

"in december, my father p (m 78) who has stage 6 alzheimers got engaged to be married to his girlfriend of 18 months (f 72) n, who had managed to isolate p from his friends and family and gain control over his finances. in early january, we learned that p & n were meeting p’s longtime accountant and another lawyer to rewrite his will to remove his children and grandchild and give everything he had to n. p had the original will written in 2019 shortly after receiving his diagnosis. although p had failed a capacity test in december and could no longer legally sign his new will or sign his trust fund over to her, he could still get married as the bar is very, very low. despite his severe dementia, p still had many lucid moments and could seem totally fine for short periods. if p signed a marriage certificate, n would have legal control over his health decisions. it would also give her the cover she needed to drain away his financial resources in secrecy, a process she began even before the big day by redirecting the pension payments he received into a bank account she controlled. all n had to do is move him somewhere away from his meddling kids and take away his phone and he would be effectively incommunicado. something had to be done. scammers preying on the elderly in their community was nothing new to them. p’s friends and fam began to plan an intervention over zoom. the idea was that his younger son j (m 51) &  daughter in law s (f 52) would go over to p's house, surprise p with a meeting with all of his friends who would then confront him about their concerns about n and her diabolical plan. after that, j would show p the evidence that they had learned from the background check that n was a lonely hearts romance scammer who had already been convicted of fraud years ago and had lied to him about her own financial situation, telling him she was “loaded” and did not need his money, despite having a huge tax lien on her house. they would also show p a [checklist ]( abusive behaviors to try to get him to see how terribly she was treating him. once he was convinced, they would call the locksmith to have the locks changed, help him pack up his stuff, and drive off to a prearranged airbnb out of state. we also worried she may become physically abusive if he resisted her. early on we had learned that n had quite a temper which worsened when she drank. what would she do if she learned her golden goose was going to break their engagement? timing was everything here. thankfully, p's caregivers gave us a heads up that n was out of town that weekend and that she would not see him until she returned on tuesday. j set the intervention for monday. he said he had no plans to marry n (n wanted this kept secret!) about an hour later i received a text from my sister-in-law reading: on our way to arizona with p!! it would be a difficult situation for any person to realize they wanted to break up with a partner and take the necessary actions to do this, but for someone with dementia they may well be helpless. the other thing we found was that p’s dementia was much much worse than we had known or suspected, despite the increasingly dire caregiver reports. since our contact with him was increasingly limited to short visits and conversations after n arrived on the scene, we had not been able to grasp the severe decline in his memory and communication skills. n took advantage of p’s confusion over his own condition to convince him that he only had mci (moderate cognitive impairment - his initial diagnosis), which was vital in constructing a reality where she was simply marrying a man she loved and who loved her, instead of financially abusing someone dying of a neurodegenerative disorder. on the drive to the airbnb, j reported p had become incoherent after nightfall and kept asking them who they were and where they were going. they learned they needed to keep him out of the kitchen as he would wander around and touch all the knives and even play with the oven burners. it became clear they needed to get him into a care facility as soon as possible before p could endanger himself. thankfully, even at his worst behavior, he continued to be a very sweet and loving person towards j & s.   it would take about a month to get p examined by his doc and admitted into care. until then, they had to keep a very active senior safe and happy in a relatively small space, arrange for a high quality yet affordable memory care, reconstruct p’s finances after n put them under her control and then trashed them, clean out p’s condo and arrange for sale, and do a ft wfh job. first, a man claiming to be a local police officer called asking if p was with j and could they speak to him? j: how could we trust you with p? the sheriffs were standing in front of j's door (they not home) and wanted entrance and to speak with p to verify his condition. we appreciate the supportive comments. wow, what a saga, and terrifying to realize there are people out there who will do this sort of thing. thank you for sharing, and so glad your father is in a better place! so sorry this happened but elated that you were able to rescue p!",0,This is

"it's been a rough couple of weeks with my mom (64 f). the week before last, she was stuck at home with me because she developed a skin infection on her butt from her nighttime fecal incontinence, and couldn't go to daycare because they wouldn't administer the medication she needed to treat it. on thursday this past week, daycare called me to let me know that my mom was having a really difficult time and complaining of pain in her legs, crying more than usual and just not herself. ""okay,"" i thought, i'll take her to urgent care when i pick her up. well, when i picked her up that day, they came out with three bags of clothes saying that she peed through her clothes i sent her in, her spare clothes, and walked out wearing pants that were loaners. the problem there was, she had not been exhibiting any uti symptoms at home. urgent care ended up not being an option because they all need appointments, and the only clinic that takes walk ins is closed now for the foreseeable future after an electrical fire that happened the week we were there for her skin infection. they got her triaged and we waited in the waiting room for a couple of hours before she started sundowning and just would not stop crying over every little thing. the sundowning actually ended up saving us, because we were able to get her into a bed faster, and who knows how long we would have continued to wait if i didn't bring it up. so we get her into the room, they cath her and say she has the cleanest sample they've seen in awhile, no uti. the pain is so difficult to help her with, because in the previous occasions i've had her seen for pain, it's really hard to pinpoint what's real and what's phantom, and then usually she's fine, but something does seem to be off. she screams as if i'm going to kill her when i try to swing her legs out to get her out of bed, or when i need to try and get her to sit up straight in bed, rather than hunched over to her right, or straining her neck, which will actually end up hurting her. anyway, the er doctor was really sweet and talking to me about life with her as it is now, and suggested looking into getting a hospice referral from her pcp. hospice had been suggested to me by a family friend, and that my mom doesn't actually have to be knocking on death's door, that we may be able to get the extra help just for comfort care. after the past two weeks, i feel like maybe these smaller conditions have just progressed her alzheimer's further, and it might just be the disease pushing her into a new stage (she's already progressed so fast this past year, and has been settled in moderate to severe over mild since after she moved in with me last february). i kept mom home with me on friday just because we were up way later than she's used to while at the er for hours, and i wanted to make sure she got some rest. well, friday morning after she woke up, she was really unsteady and unbalanced when trying to get her into the bathroom to change her, and she fell. i could not get her to understand how i needed her to help me help her get up. when she was a caregiver for a man with alzheimer's before she developed her own symptoms, the man she cared for fell all the time (not hard falls, usually he'd slip out of his recliner), and my mom could never get him up. the man's daughter told my mom she just had to call 911 each time he fell to have ems come pick him back up. it got to the point that ems told my mom that if she called one more time, she'd be reported for elder abuse and negligence. so imagine my immense dilemma when trying to decide if i needed to do the same. i did though, the guys who came were all great, and they were in and out in less than 10 minutes. but now i completely understand why my mom needed the extra help with the man she cared for. i'm thinking hospice might definitely be something i want to look into, but i was hoping to get any perspective from those of you who may have had similar experiences with hospice. any input, general information i might not know, suggestions or advice you may be able to offer would be really helpful! i'm also looking now into either a rollator or a wheelchair for her at this point, because the last thing i need is her falling at home, but also when we're not at home or she's at daycare. that's also kind of difficult to reconcile, because if she is at the point where she's not going to walk anymore, it's just going to make caring for her until i can get her into memory care, 10x more difficult, and it means that she is becoming further and further from who she used to be. i'm just going to share my experience with my dad, alzheimer's and hospice. we had moved my dad in to memory care february 2021. in september, my dad started having some aggression issues and violent outbursts. we tried really hard to get a geriatric psych eval but nobody was open due to covid. by late october, his facility told us we needed to find him a new place. unfortunately nowhere in the entire state would consider taking a man with ""behaviors"". we began looking out of state. i had been asking about hospice for a couple months and they finally agreed he should be evaluated for it. they told me in order to qualify for hospice, they have to have a life expectancy of 6 months or less. hospice came the following day to evaluate my dad and decided he qualified. they started him on dilaudid. we finally found him a new facility that would take him and very fortunately it was just a few miles down the road. we moved him in and the new place seemed great and much better equipped to handle my dad. i visited him a few times and they had a family thanksgiving gathering. my dad passed the day after thanksgiving and caught even hospice off-guard. i got a call that they thought he was transitioning to actively dying but i didn't need to rush down. 20 minutes later i got a call back to say that he'd passed. my dad was on hospice just under a month before he passed. it's worth an ask. their job is to help your mom feel better and be comfortable. i'll be thinking about you, op. geriatric social worker here. if your mom qualifies for hospice, go for it. get the care. get the nurse visits. get the social worker visits. get the chaplain and the art therapy and the volunteers and the pet therapy. welcome them to your home. in 6 months, if she qualifies again, awesome. if she doesn’t, you’ll have all these people from that hospice who know you and your mom who will be able to make recommendations on what to do next. i work in a nursing home and one of the biggest misconceptions about hospice is that the patient needs to be “knocking on deaths door.”  they don’t! instead of getting help and care and support, the family puts it off until the person is literally dying, and then they have all these hospice strangers trampling in to help, which is weird and awkward when the family just wants to be with their mom. emt here. if you can’t pick her up without help, we will happily help you. we understand that the disease puts her more at risk for falls. you are one person, you can only do so much. if it does get to the point where we are being called too often, we won’t threaten you. we will have a conversation to make sure you can find the appropriate resources for your mom. thanks for sharing, sorry i don't really have anything concrete to add. i've read plenty of people's stories where they put their loved ones into a facility that specializes with memory care. do you have something like that in your vicinity? essentially, if you aren't capable of taking care of her yourself, you should think about it to lighten your load. where i'm from, we pretty much only have one hospice in the whole country (less than 2 mil pop though), but it's very much for actually dying people, mostly cancer. most elderly homes offer extra care for people with dementia (basically the more help you need, the more it costs). your story made me realize i need to take care of some holding bars around the bathroom for grandma asap. listen when it comes to dementia, there is no real downside to hospice. you get more support, and there aren't any medications you really cut, not the same way as cancer meds. my grandmother was in a similar way after she broke her hip. we got her signed onto hospice in mid-jan. she was still up and walking around, with a lot of help (lifting up onto feet with gait belt, one person in front and behind, and a walker). even as we got her out of bed and worked harder at the heavy lifting trying to ""exercise"", she eventually was not able to take a step from standing, then could put her feet flat on the floor. we absolutely would not have been able to handle these fast drastic changes without the support of hospice. everyone says, they wish they started it sooner. i recently found out that people with dementia are eligible for hospice at a certain point, because it is a terminal illness-it does not necessarily mean they are close to death. they are another pair of hands (and heart) to care for your loved one and take a little pressure off of you. they have a lot of experience, give great advice, and are not only there to care for the physical/emotional needs of your loved one with dementia, they are also there to care for the needs of family members. it’s a great program, i can’t recommend it enough. best of luck. from what i understand a doc has to be the one to sign off on her being eligible for hospice care. they do it based on a reasonable expectation that the person has 6 months or less to live. my dad ended being on it for many years. when he got hospice care it was very helpful. he got a medical bed to help him sit up, wheelchair and other medical equip to help keep him clean. also nice to have access to home nursing. just because mom is eligible doesn't mean you have to use hospice. you can also pull her out at any time, and to put her back on it, the doc just has to approve, which im told is easy to get. i would 100% look into this. leave it up to doc to decide, and tell them everything. if she is eligible, id definitely look into all the options for starting up.",0,This is
"my grandmother is in her final stage of alzheimer’s disease. she hardly moves and is bedridden. her nurse sent a picture of her legs with mottling creeping up from her feet - said she would probably be with us for another two days. my mom, my husband, and i went to go see her. my mom sees her frequently, but this is the first time i’ve seen her since january. after my husband and i got home, my mom calls saying she checked grandma’s legs and the colors has gone away. has anyone experienced this with their loved one? yes, and unfortunately it may last much longer than 2 days....try 2 years unless of course the nursing home is planning on ""helping along the transition process."" my mom is 87 and has had dementia since at least early 2006 and is now at stage 7 for over 5 years. she started to develop bedsores last summer until we got a hospital bed, and the in home care nurse helped treat and heal her wounds.",0,This is
"my dad has been in assisted living for a short while now, and that is going great. the problem is everything else that remains. my sister and i need to prepare his house and its contents for auction/sale. of course, there are some things we both want in the house, and there are the feelings i have to wrangle with of “should i keep this or not?” it’s like dealing with someone’s house after they have died. i’m overwhelmed. i just want to get this task over with and move on, but it feels like there’s so much to do. i live three hours away and have my own family, so it feels like an impossible task. i suppose i’m just venting. did the same with my mothers house. if it has no real sentimental value and i mean “no real” do not keep it. set up 3 areas of a room. make a keep pile, a sell pile (estate sale, let go, etc), and a donate pile. the donation pile helped a lot with making decisions on things because i knew at least someone else could use it and it would do some good. once you start going you will be surprised how little you will keep and how fast the process moves. it helps. i still have boxes of my mom's things even though we emptied her house years ago and she passed away in december. i'm stuck with things that i don't want, but i know she cherished them. i'm in the same boat and totally feel you. we just put my dad in memory care a couple weeks ago and i'm so stressed about his house and all the crap he (and my mom) accumulated over the years. there are so many and i don't want all of them but i feel so guilty throwing them away. there are people who, for a fee, will go through all that stuff and hold an estate sale. that might not be the avenue you choose, but be aware that it exists. a senior center or local realtor could probably put you in touch with one. others have commented on the keep/toss/donate strategy. i've done that too, it's just that there's so much! my approach to big chores is break it down into manageable increments and keep going back to it when possible. since you live 3 hours away, you might put a couple cartons in your car with every trip and work on decisions from your home base. right where i am, too. my dad went into a facility two weeks ago. the kicker is we got a practice run. my dad had been keeping his dad's house for 15+ years his death. was 'cleaning it out' on his monthly and then twice-yearly trips across a couple states. last april, i saw my dad's condition and knew we had to get this house sold, so i got my brother and my dad on board (my dad was a bit resistant but knew deep down he couldn't hold onto the house forever) and planned a four-day trip to 'finish cleaning the house out.' had a realtor all set up. when i arrived it looked exactly the same as i remembered last time i visited like 10 years ago. some items cleaned, but mostly still a fully-crammed house full of stuff. we spent those four days frantically tossing, donating, and packing what we wanted to keep to take back home. packed a 40-yard dumpster to its gills. did a lot of emotional work with my dad trying to get rid of some stuff or get him to realize he has to take things back to his house. now it almost feels easier this time around because i'm practiced and he is not there to have to guide through things. it certainly helps me to read about how other families deal with this. my sister overpaid a cleaning/estate sale service to go thru our parents' house for us. we walked through together (i brought my best friend for moral support) and removed things we wanted. it's easy for us because i live in a different country, that limited what i could take home. i did have to sacrifice some small items to her crazy, and ultimately my friend just started putting some of my mom's knickknacks straight into her purse (my mom is still alive and now in assisted living) so my sister wouldn't keep them. my mom just put those things in a drawer so who knows if it was worth the subterfuge. be thankful you have a someone to help, i had to do this alone. although, i did not have the added “i want that” headache with a sibling. i started by doing many many runs to goodwill but just ended up getting a dumpster. i felt bad about trashing useful items, but it would have taken weeks and no charity would pick up. an estate sale would have ended up costing more than the dumpster since i, of course, kept anything of value. but, i don’t want to freak you out or anything, the house clearing was the easiest part of my alzheimer’s caregiving experience. that is something that could be done and accomplished. i'm in the same, same, same situation ahhh  i'm in front of his new home now, texting my sister, about to check in, thinking about how in a week ill be on the floor of his house hours away going through boxes. and my sister is no help 😤 (her having a new baby and also being in another part of the country is a pretty good excuse though)  you and i and all of us will get through this, because our parents would have if they were in our position i hired a junk removal service and moved the sentimental/valuables to a storage unit. hired a relator and got that baby sold. you’ll feel so much better when it’s done and you’ll hopefully have some profit from the sale to be able to to help fund assisted living facility costs. to me it feels like a violation of their property, since my mother is still living in nursing care. it took me a while to even go there and have a look at what needed doing. if it wasn't for my daughters i would still be stuck. i opened a shed door yesterday and just stood there crying. why did they keep so much junk? we have one room to put all the household items in for sale as we go through each room, cupboard drawer methodically. we will hold a garage sale to get rid of what we can, use fb marketplace for any items left and then call a charity to bring their truck. my biggest problem is getting rid of the clothes. all the donation bins are still full most of the time thanks to the great ovid cleanout everyone seems to have had, and the charity shops no longer want things. if worse comes to worse it will have to go to landfill but i would rather not have to do that. when my grandpa died (of cancer), i did most of the cleaning. keep some clothes you can wear, that's my favourite memento, because i actually use it often (kept a couple of shirts). i have a garage full of stuff i can't part with. maybe we should switch houses and clean each other's parents' stuff. i think i just created a new reality show. my brothers and i will likely be having to do this too in the near future and i dread it, i can see how you would be overwhelmed.",0,This is
"my great grandmother, recently diagnosed with alzheimer’s, was very fond of her two dogs, a pug and a corgi, however she couldn’t take care of them after the dead of my great grandfather, and has been living alone ever since. i was looking for robotic pets she doesn’t need to take care of, and saw two nice brands. perfect petzzz and joy for all. anyone know if there’s some hybrid with realistic breathing and sleeeping and the same functions as joy for that’s a pug or a corgi? set aside 180 pounds for this, hoping i can give the dog to her before her birthday of april 28. i would think just a nice cuddly stuffed dog would be great. i am going to visit my mom in memory care and was thinking of getting her a stuffed cat toy as she always loved cats. your live, time and caring is your greatest gift. i have seen some folks in memory care with stuffed animals that they hold and love on. i know its a recent diagnosis and you want to do something nice, but id be a little cautious with a pricey niche gift like this. its possible the other commenter is right, your time (or maybe your assistance to her primary caregiver) would *probably* be the better gift now, unless you 100% know shes going to love it, or itll have a great return policy. i got my alz grandma a stuffed dog that looked *realistic* and like a dog she used to have, around the same time i got her a baby doll that looked like a life-size toy.. she thought the *doll was real* and coddled it like a real baby, but was angry and offended that i would give her a toy dog doll. i had to return it. on top of that she did love the baby but it gave her a little bit of anxiety because she was afraid of waking it all the time. in any case good luck, its nice you want to be nice. my mum has a sleeping breathing dog toy. she prefers the more ordinary but lifelike soft toy dogs. she cuddles and talks to them..and it doesn't matter if they fall on the floor or get a bit messy.. the best gift you can give her is time. do things like take her on long walks (if she is capable of doing so). i feel like my grandma would be offended, if i brought her a toy dog (although she doesn't like animals as it is), because she'd still know it's a toy dog. i did encounter articles about pets helping a bunch and i am interested in having a dog myself, although grandma is resistant at this point. i'll keep these robotic pets in mind, thanks for bringing it up!",0,This is
"none of the major risk genes for alzheimer's are in the sex chromosomes, so females can pass those genes to male offspring just as well as they can to female offspring. that said, alzheimer's is approximately twice as common in females than males. how old were they when they became ill? elderly alzheimer's is not hereditary. young-onset alzheimer's is/can be genetic. most alzheimer's patients are elderly. also, women live longer than men on average. men are likely to die younger of other causes before elderly alzheimer's starts to happen.",0,This is
"how do you handle this? my dad (alz, mid-way-ish through disease process) has diseased toenails that are difficult to manage. should i have a medical professional assist in trimming every 2 weeks? it’s painful for him, but i’m always worried about possible infection. additionally, best shoes for alz. he has these no-tie sketchers but they’re getting harder for him to push on. maybe crocs? think he’d be up for a pedicure? i take my mom in when i visit every few weeks. it’s a huge help and the team at her local salon is amazing. it has become a nice socialization thing for her. or if you think they’re really diseased maybe a podiatrist could clean things up first, and then they’d be easier to manage? following for shoe recommendations. podiatrist/chiropodist home visits - they can treat and cut his nails. crocs for outdoors, rubber soled velcro slippers for indoors. get a podiatry home visit every few weeks. gran is less squeamish when they do it. also has the added bonus that she perks up a bit with someone else to talk too. she wears sandals round the house that are easy to wear but can get cold. there are travel nurses at home specific for foot care. my grandmother is doing very well with birkenstocks made from eva foam, try the arizona model. very comfy, clean very easily (i wear them myself as well). we don't do her nails every two weeks, they grow way slower than mine do. she doesn't want to go to a salon, but she enjoys when i do her feet. i first soak her feet in hot water with salt (very salty, probably around twice the amount as i would use for pasta), squeeze of lemon juice (you can use any other acid on hand) and a pump of soap. 30 minutes is a nice time, but the water is gonna get cold, so check in-between. i got the recipe from a friend that does old lady's nails and feet professionally. after the soak, i first scrub her feet with that black sandpaper thing (i don't even know what's it called in my own language :d) and remove any harder stuff with a rougher stone. sometimes she gets these little blister like things on the tips of her toes. then i clip what i can, her big toes probably have fungal infections because they are very thick and crumbly, but that was before i started taking care of her, so it's probably too far gone to really do anything about it. i'd recommend good clippers, the big ones that kinda look like pliers are a lifesaver with the thick nails. for the end, i use a good foot cream and that's that. i used to do it every couple of days, because her soles were shot (really dry, flaking all over, she also has light diabetes, so that was a worry, etc. we had the same problem! took him to the podiatrist, and they cut his toenails, recommended some fungal cream, and gave us a list of people who can do monthly maintenance for him, including people who could go to where he lives (in memory care). get him the meds if his doctor says it’s ok.  in 3 months his nails will be better. my mum goes to a podiatrist and my dad goes to. my mum is the one with alzheimer's but dad goes with mum and they both have their apps so mum is more comfortable. before that i was cutting her nails and doing fungal nail treatment for her. we just did a foot bath this week, then i trimmed her nails. we used to do it monthly, but hadn't for several months recently. i could tell a difference, as she didn't want to leave her feet in the water for 20 minutes and kept taking one out, so i started after 10 minutes. when she was more lucid, she asked to go to a podiatrist to get her nails trimmed. i had never heard of that and thought it was weird, to but her sister told me that is a normal thing. i too use the pliers type clippers. i had seen them at pedicures before, but my grandmother bought them at walmart. those are the ones i have the best luck with. i don't know about shoes. when she goes out, a rare thing, she usually wears a pair of my easy spirits that zip up. they were too tight on me, to do i had given them to my grandmother who wore a size smaller. i bought some men's memory form slippers that are warm and big enough, but turns out they slide off the hardwood floors something awful. i guess she'll need a larger size or different style in the future. i just go to the nail salon and leave a big tip (like $10-20), which is double or more than what they charge for a trim.... just so they don't hate us going in.",0,This is

"my mom has been diagnosed and lived with alzheimer for 4 years. her condition now is really bad and she doesnt have any common sense and manner at all, she can hardly be concious at things and even if i call her mutiple times she wont reply. but lately my brothers turned some sort of buddhism audio for her at night while she slept, i'm an atheist so i dont care about much but then he had to stop because my dad didn't want to involve in religious stuffs (yeah that's audio was kinda spooky for real). after  a few days, one night, it was like 1 am or something, i heard she was mumbling, normally when my mom sleeps, she has somniloquy so i just think that she is sleep talking but then i came closer i realised that she woke up and looked just like the first stage of alzheimer. she remembered me, remembered normal manners, remembered how to calculate and i asked her to sign her name-which she normally can't do, she did, of course sometimes she still mistook things but i surprised that she was concious and looked normal. but when she be able to read the clock and tell the time, she had to sleep and i was kinda afraid that if she sleep, things would be back to normal, and they sure were. have anyone met this situation before?????? yes have had a relatively similar experience. one night i was stepping in for my brother and his partner so they could go out. this was way past the time of her realizing she was sick - it was really shocking. looking back in it i’m glad it happened, it was a nice interaction and i haven’t had a good one since really. it's pretty common, i think. wow! music certainly is a great therapy, especially classical music like beethoven, so it’s worth while to explore different musical genres. i’ve seen these “moments of clarity” over my several years of being a caregiver, and it’s quite spectacular to witness. but people should tame their hopes and expectations that these moments can be repeated and/or extended. continued socialization, music, dietary changes, etc, can all contribute to reducing or slowly down the effects of the disease. how amazing! that must have been nice to have your mom back for a bit. here’s a buddhist rhythm to try. my grandma with alzheimer’s would always respond when i played guitar or chanted this mantra  reminiscing is vital.",0,This is
"this last year my father's mental condition has been deteriorating. those who've been in my place for longer, how do you cope during the progression? get power of attorney sorted out now, and i mean now. if your dad gets declared as lacking capacity, he can no longer sign to appoint one. then you have a lengthy, complicated and expensive legal procedure to get it done. trust me, that is what i am going through right now. had to call sheriffs a few times and had a few hospital visits. my dad was quite stubborn and insisted nothing was wrong, but i managed to get durable poa set up to help him with this big transaction he was confused on. he probably didn't understand he was signing a durable poa. i don't think i did anything wrong because it really needed to happen. i second and then immediately third the notion to get durable poa right away. it saved the bacon of everybody involved when he finally ended up in the hospital and they wouldn't release him except to a memory care facility. i then would say if he lets you, use the poa to get his affairs in order when you can still ask him questions. emotionally, well, it sucks the big one. my dad just passed away from alzheimer’s, he lived with it for almost a decade. as another commenter said, get power of attorney as that will allow for you or your mom to make important decisions for him. care is extremely expensive especially down the road, so i would try to get financials in order if at all possible. the way to get medicaid to pay for care is to spend down your assets to the point where it appears you have less money than you do, i.e. buying a house or car. down the line you’ll want to get in touch with an elder care attorney as they specialize in this stuff. spend time with him and get him moving and seeing old friends as those things just get harder as time goes by, but don’t feel guilty if it’s hard for you to be around him a lot because it’s simply depressing. i wish you the best of luck. being a caretaker for your parents is one of the most difficult and also rewarding things you can do. fill your mind and soul with patience, compassion and love. take lots of pictures and videos of good times and bad ones too. they become great tools for reflection and learning. she was 52 when she was diagnosed. get your power of attorney in order and before he is too far gone make sure that he has nothing in his name: homes, cars, access to accounts. we hired a lawyer for this. we were able to get my mom on medicare and no one went after my dad for money for medical stuff. my mom is now 57, and she lived in a nursing home, she couldn’t be left alone while my dad went to work anymore, it’s hard but eventually it becomes the normal. feel free to reach out of you have questions. i've dealt with alzheimer's most of my life. first with my grandmother, who declined quite rapidly throughout my high school years, and then my father, whose stroke got the ball rolling in the same year my grandmother passed. the number one thing i can tell you is to have patience, and when he gets combative or starts not recognizing you, keep in mind that those moments are not him, it's the disease. second, power of attorney is exceptionally important. all the upcoming doctors visits and legal struggles will be made ten times easier if you have poa. my mom had poa over my dad, and it was like pulling teeth to try and get her to do anything because she didn't want to admit he was declining either. when he passed in 2016, she absolutely shut down and i had to make all the decisions anyway, but had to string her along to sign paperwork. third, show him old videos if you have any, but also take new ones. cherish those memories. 💜 you or another family member should go to a doctor's appointment with your dad to ""discuss the incident of finding himself in another town."" something like that happened with my dh and the doctor promptly said ""you need to give up driving."" this is huge - most men don't like giving that up (women too, but it seems a bigger deal to men) and having the doctor say it may be the thing that makes it happen. a person with dementia not only endangers himself but others. as for you coping - are you his primary caregiver? if you are, or are going to be transitioning into that role - i strongly suggest you find a dementia caregiver support group. it helps you cope with your feelings as well as learn a lot of necessary tips for helping your dad. get an elder law attorney. get durable poa, **now**. you need the attorney to arrange his assets so that he will be eligible for a medicaid waiver home care and nursing home eventually, without draining the inheritance entirely. does he have a diagnosis yet? if he does not, you may be able to purchase a long-term care insurance plan. he is quite young and if he is also physically healthy, he may live with this for 15 or 20 years. * [ * [   **if you modify your base assumptions and expectations to set up a good environment for him, he can have a normal-feeling life for a long time. ** and reach out for help when problems arise instead of trying to diy until a crisis lands him in the hospital. because every injury and hospitalization (especially if surgery, bed rest healing time, and residential pt rehab is required) will make basic tasks require more help, which accelerates dementia. also, test him for hearing loss. for example, he needs to be living in a disability-accessible, walkable community asap. he must not be living in a home that requires him to drive if he wants to leave the house and do anything. he must have a roll-in shower, a bathroom that can take a shower bench. no stairs, non-slip floors. all these will make it easier for him to live without heavy assistance, longer. later on, it becomes extremely hard to disrupt their living habits because they cannot form new habits. but the home has to be safe. if he can walk to shops without driving, he will be able to socialize, run low-risk errands, and feel normal for a very long time. thank you all for the advice. the poa situation will definitely be a priority once it's all official. i should clarify there are a couple tests they need to do first, but yes, his doctors are fairly sure that this is what we're dealing with. i really liked everyones suggestions of memory documentation, since there's already so much for him that isn't the same and it feels like every month its a little worse. i find comfort just in knowing that others understand how this all feels and how confusing it is, for the family, but also the one diagnosed. like others said get both poas. find the insurance policies, car titles, passwords and any other important documents. i wish i had taken some of my wife when she was better.",0,This is
"Hey all. To make a long story short, after a string of traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of Alzheimer's. My great grand-mother was also affected by Alzheimer's; however, she was older than my nana is now.
My nana has been divorced and my papaw is remarried to my mamaw (all these familial terms, lol). She has never hated my mamaw, maybe not liked, but never hated, though she now is certain that my mamaw and papaw got married immediately after my nana and papaw got a divorce and it burns her up. She genuinely believes it with her whole heart. To make matters worse, my nana was the one cheating on my papaw! So there's that.
I would argue that my nana is still in touch with our reality to whatever extent, but our timelines and belief of how events played out is so different. How the hell do you deal with something like this? Do you play into it, knowing it's not the truth? Just ignore it? Arguing only upsets her.",1,This is
"My 71 year old mother has been dealing with Alzheimer's for many years. I've been bathing her about a year now. Dad turns off gas and locks doors ( supplying details to give a frame of reference ).She often talks about going home to check on her parents (gone for 20 years) or kids (I'm her youngest at 34 years old) or whatever. She yells at my dad to take her home all the while saying their current home  is actually her house her dad got for her (it isn't).We are managing, but what's best to say to her? When she pleads to me to pick her up and take her home? Most if the time, I can change the topic and she forgets eventually, but sometimes she gets fixated. Do I go pick her up and drive around? Do I gently remind her she is home? Do I just listen? What's best in your experiences?",1,This is
Needing Help convince reality of identities. Needing help with my wife(69) who was diagnose last January with AD. Since the end of October she has had difficulty recognizing me as her husband and confusing me with someone with the same name and very similar (in her mind). It does seem to come and go but often when she doesn't recognize me she wonders where I am and where I've been. Yesterday it kind of came to a head when she confronted me (she knew who I was) with where I've been. She also thinks she's not living in her home where we've lived for almost 35 years. How have some of you handled this type of thing? Is it possible to ask her to identify something on she and I would know for her to understand who I am? Very frustrating and any help or advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.,1,This is
"backstory: my grandpa is 83. he had a stroke over 30 years ago that left him disabled. since the late 80s he‘s chosen to be home bound. he hates shopping, crowds, getting in the car etc. he will only go to doctor or dentist but nowhere else. he is very out of touch with...everything lol. so this morning he’s frustrated with his cable. he wants to watch a specific show but he wants the option to pause it for bathroom breaks and fast forward through commercials. i explain his cable package doesn’t provide that. he doesn‚Äôt have or want to pay for the dvr function.i spent an entire hour going over his tv functions. showing him every possible way he could watch a specific movie or show. he either has to pay to rent, pay for the dvr function, or wait days in order to get it for free. so that brought us to the topic of streaming services. he wants what my husband and i watch (netflix/hulu/sling) but it wants it on his cable üòÖ ?? he was so confused. he doesn’t understand the internet period. has never even had an email address or cell phone. it’s like explaining these things to a 2 year old. he just has no grasp on how the world works anymore. so now he‚Äôs frustrated. he thinks i‚Äôm pulling the wool over his eyes. he wants me to preform a miracle but it‚Äôs just not possible unless he forks up the money to his cable company. he does this with a lot of things actually. he still thinks the world runs as it did before he had a stroke, when things were a little more simple/cheap. sigh. it‚Äôs just hard. the generational gap in our home is so large. he thinks we lie but things are much more complex then he can understand anymore :/",1,This is
"but for the past year or so like clockwork around 8pm he wants to go home and it takes around an hour or more to make him ""stop"" and be content and stay. man it's so taxing. i mean he has incontinence bowel and urinary so i take care of that, and all the other stuff that comes with the territory no problem but this constant ""goin home"" gets me.. we have several different techniques that work with my dad:  the obvious one i take him home, we are lucky that we can leave town drive a short distance and reenter town on a different road. when he says home he means bed (especially at night) so mum takes him up to their room and he settles. a dog walk around the block, again exiting their estate on one road and reentering on a different road to break the cycle. obviously some of these won't fit your situation but please ask any questions and i will try my best to help. sometimes it means they want to go back to when they weren't sick. i'd grab his hand or hug him (to reassure him) and say something like ""ok, we'll head home after we x (insert activity here)"". my grandmother always wants to start the i don’t know why they brought me here conversation. usually she veers back off topic with the questions i’m asking her and forgets the original complaint. it doesn’t make it any less irritating, but it calms her down when i give her the options. my mom does the same thing, but she is already bedridden. i will just say ""we're here,"" and mention the name of community we live in, but in our case it's the same house for 50 years, but sometimes she still mentions europe where she grew up and asks for her mom who also passed 45 years ago. you might have to say something and reference the name of community he is talking about if it's not the home you are at now. it's like a switch in atmosphere, and most patients with alzheimer's respond pleasurably to music; it's an area of the brain that remains functional longer than others. it helps distract them and change their focus from ""home"" to the music. i like u/kitkatinkerbell's suggestions and have used some of the same techniques when helping my sil care for my brother, especially ""taking him home"" by getting in the car, riding several miles and returning, saying ""we're home!"" i admire you so much for caring for your dad! that's such a loving, caring way to honor your father. ...in the day- to-day struggle, i know how much of a strain it can be, how much stress and fatigue you must be feeling. i hope you're finding support with other caregivers who understand your challenges, and i hope you have family or others who can offer relief for you so you can get the rest you need. bless you! cheers to all the hard work you have done to take care of him! since it is always happening at the same time, it may be from a long forgotten routine from years back. try to engage and ask if there is someone they want to see at home, or is there something they need to do? or if they just want to be at home. it may be physical, sensory ,(is it too loud, too quiet? hth",1,This is
"short version (i can add info if needed), my fil is stage 4 dementia. roommate almost died and is still recovering. family member who was helping lost her husband. i am the legal guardian and i made arrangements for fil to go into assisted living. he can’t afford in home care and he doesn’t own his house (it’s in a trust, so he can use it until he dies but he doesn’t own it). he initially agreed with the move but now he’s changed his mind. the problem is that his house is rented to help pay for his care and the help he needed to live alone is no longer available. the reasons he gives for wanting to leave al are not grounded in reality. he’s not progressed enough for memory care, but al is optional and so they won’t keep him there against his will. i keep seeing advice not to try to correct someone with dementia, but if he walks out of there i don’t know what to do with him. see if you can visit the place a few times and tell him he lives there and you will be back to move his things there. maybe you and the al social worker could sit down with him and go over all his concerns. additionally, you need to remind him it's not as simple as going back to his old house, because it's rented out to someone else, and the roommate/caregiver is no longer available to help him with day to day affairs. explore options - maybe he would prefer a different al placement? you and the social worker can also go over some of his deluded beliefs (don't call them that in front of him!). show him where the eye drops are, and ask if he'd like someone to administer them to him. my dh who i am trying to put into memory care at present, has had similar delusions. and when he has lost a wallet by leaving it somewhere, he states that someone ""stole"" it. he can't locate most of the things he needs (constantly losing toothbrushes). good of you to look out for this man. my dad is in memory care and went through a similarly tough patch where he was paranoid, angry, argumentative, and distrustful. he worried about people taking his car and money (this included my mom, who he said his lawyer would be contacted, because she needed to get out of his house.) this passed after time, but it was a tough roughly 2 years. keep your fil a little more comfortable by finding lies that will calm him down. i'm constantly saying this to my mother during every conversation i have with her and she's been in memory care for almost a year. now that she is settled (she still isn't happy about it), she fears change and when i bring up finding a new facility for her, the thought of changing her routine scares her and she stops complaining (for a little while)  i was staunchly against medicating my mother for behavioral reasons because i didn't want to lose what little was left of her inside. move him, medicate him one thing i did with my dad is tell him we found him “an apartment with help” that was just a home base for him. i drove back there with him in my car, and when he saw the building, he said, “that’s a bad place.” i parked and he asked, “what are we doing here?” i said, “i need to speak to the lady at the front desk.” “should i stay in the car?” “no, come with me, i said.” he came with me, i checked us both in, walked him to his room, and we said goodbye like everything was fine. also, if he’s paranoid he may not want to take additional medications, but if he’s already taking medications, you could speak to his doctor about adding something for his mood (assuming you have medical poa?). that has helped my dad. good luck! my husband and sil try to logic her out of these delusions with evidence. she refuses to discuss assisted living and lives in the same town as sil. they check on her a few times a week, and my husband will stay with her 2-4 weeks at a time. (we are in another state) the other 2 siblings are no help. (she was also not the nicest person in younger years so they see her 1-2 times a year out of duty.) if he is a danger to himself, you can gain power of attorney and guardianship. my grandmother had moved al twice and both times she has gone through a phase of this when she first moved in. it went on months the first time, but she had progressed by the second move and it lasted a few weeks.",1,This is
"nan it’s important to not remind her of the dog’s death if she asks where the dog is. when this happened to my dad, we always made up some excuse like the dog was at the vet or getting groomed. after a while, he forgot about the dog. sometimes it is best to fib for her comfort. you can say she went to the groomers. the excuse doesn’t even need to be a good one since she won’t remember it anyway. say the dog is out for a walk, or the vet, or at the dog park. my first suggestion is: give it time because sad to say, she may forget about her dog or forget how important it was to her. when my mom’s beloved cat passed away she kept forgetting too and would get sad every time. now she barely remembers the cat at all. she has pictures of him and sometimes she says what a great cat he was, but most of the time i don’t think she is clear on how much she loved it so it doesn’t bother her anymore. also, i have a cat now and she focuses on him now. so my 2nd suggestion would be to get her a new dog to help her focus on that, but only if there is someone living with her that can make sure the dog gets fed and walked in case she forgets to. when my mom would ask where he was, i'd choke up and she'd see my reaction and question me even more.",1,This is
"need help please. my daughter is visiting for a long period with her dog. my mother keeps saying it’s ‘her’ dog and gets mad when my daughter takes her dog for a walk or feeds her. mom keeping getting upset and telling everyone to leave ‘her’ dog along. thanks so much. have you considered getting your mother a stuffed animal dog? maybe one that’s the same color as your daughters dog, if you can. that’s what worked with my mom, we got her the joy for all robotic cat that purrs and meows and everything and she’s as happy as a clam. is it possible to have something to distract her when your daughter goes out for walks and move the dogs food bowls somewhere that mom doesn't go often? this disease is frustrating because so often there are no solutions outside of redirection or changing our own behavior we're starting to have this issue with my sister's cat. we live at home with our dad to take care of our mom and lately mom has been claiming the cat is hers and gets authoritative over it whenever we take actual care of it. mom misreads its body language frequently so it's difficult to address her behavior and the cat's at the same time. she has her own stuffed dog and absolutely loves it but chooses the live cat whenever both are in the same room. i usually end up hovering nearby to supervise that their interactions are safe for both but that tends to agitate mom and gets more protective of the cat. how is your mom's balance? if she's able to walk much and the dog's properly leashed trained, maybe see if going out on walks together with your daughter might help? if that's not an option, perhaps keeping the dog and mom separate and out of eye sight during feeding and walking time might work. or ask your daughter to have someone else watch the dog. try not to tell your mom that it's not her dog as that will only make her more defensive. if she starts to get super possessive, maybe the dog should be kept somewhere else close while your daughter visits and can take care of her pet without your mom being upset. i know some patients do well with baby dolls too.",1,This is
"my dad has become increasingly forgetful. he frequently forgets how to get home, or he forgets a conversation that we just had 15 minutes ago. once i remind him, then he remembers. for example, he needs surgery on his carotid artery. i'm arranging it for him. i hung up, called and spoke to his doctor to set a pre surgery appointment. i called my dad back, literally 10 minutes or less later. i said ok dad we have to meet with the surgeon before they will schedule your surgery. your carotid is 80% blocked. stuff like this happens a lot. how do you tell the difference between normal aging, vascular dementia and alzheimers? you leave that to the professionals. get an appointment with a neurologist who specializes in dementia, or go for geriatric assessment at a department of geriatrics. you father's primary care doctor can refer him. it's a good idea to communicate either by mail/email or telephone ahead of time with some of your observations, to clue the doc in that a real assessment is needed. also it's best if you accompany your dad (or someone does), or he's likely to hear what he wants to hear and report back to you, ""doc says to just enjoy myself."" (that's not what doc said!!) alzheimers is a form of dementia. the only way to diagnose alzheimers is post death via autopsy. vascular dementia and alzheimers typically go hand in hand. my mom was dxed with both. my dad got in a pretty serious accident, lucky no one was hurt but two cars were totalled. he was just going to the grocery store about 1/2 mile from his house, his accident was about 3 miles from the store, he forgot where it was. basically alzheimers is the advanced progression of physical impairment of the brain via shrinking and other damage. the current state of the art for diagnosing alz is an amyvid pet scan, which looks for amyloid plaque. it was quite the task getting insurance to pay for it though. my dad was diagnosed w early stage alzheimer’s via a blood test and spinal tap. there are specific markers the dr looks for in those tests. he had several other cognitive & motor tests along the way as well.",1,This is
"i’m worried about my mother. she can’t remember the most basic things. she asks me the middle names of my children, names of family members, birthdays, etc. this seems like the early stages of alzheimer’s. what is more alarming to me, though, is her obsession with things. i’m not sure if it’s related to alzheimer’s and i want your opinions. she doesn’t take it at the same time each day and often skips some to “save money”. for example, if an app she has resets and she loses her ability to login using face id, rather than a password, she will spend hours trying to fix it. when she asks me a question and i’m speaking with someone else, if i don’t immediately answer she will say “say” or “hello?”  she needs immediate answers to text messages or she will send 8-10 at a time. are these all signs of alzheimer’s or something else? thank you for your help. yes, these could all be signs of alzheimers or another form of dementia. get her to a doctor to check it all out. good luck. many of those i experience with my grandmother, who's been diagnosed with alzheimer's. her orientation of time is really off & i've had to learn how to not get annoyed ... and i've heard it is common from dementia educators. your mother likely can't assess the amount if time between texts, questions, etc. anxiety & hyper fixation also seems to be happening, but that could be a variety of diagnosis. have her checked out, good luck! longtime use of klonopin (clonazepam) can cause reversible confusion and cognitive impairment. does she need that for seizures? i took it for years for restless legs syndrome affecting my sleep. after i got off it, my brain slowly became better able to handle my daily affairs.",1,This is

"so here's the summary of the situation:* dad (80s) has late stage dementia. he is able to walk and eat by himself but that will end likely in the next few months. he has no other major health issues.* my mom (70s) is his primary caretaker, but she has back and other physical problems and can't really lift anything more than a few lbs.* life savings were destroyed before we discovered what was going on.* on paper, they make good incomes. however because of bad management for the past 10-15 years and some ill-conceived purchases/debts, about half of it has to go into fixing problems, so the amount left for spending is ok, but not great. they make well above what the medicaid limits are in our state.* the income sources and assets are all mixed together with both their names on most of it. so any kind of asset sale would be enormously complicated and the leftover situation would be bad for my mom after he's gone.* he does not do well outside of the home. he gets extremely stressed out and basically stops eating. i have no doubt placing him outside his home would kill him.ideally we'd like to keep him at home but my mom is not capable of lifting him or doing the physical work that we know is to come. i found out that medicare will not cover home bound care unless they need a skilled professional or therapy (which he doesn't. he will just needs help moving around, bathing, feeding, etc). medicaid is out of the picture because they just make too much.right now we have a part-time home health aide for a few hours a week but the amount of hours that will be needed will quickly overwhelm the finances and deplete the savings in a few months. i've talked to local resources but overall it comes to the same problems: he's too healthy physically, they make too much money for aid, but out of pocket expenses are too much. making him a ward of the state also seems like a bad idea due to the mixed assets and the loss of control.i've gone through old posts but didn't see anything that pertained directly to this situation. am i missing something? has anyone else gotten benefits for this kind of situation? we simply need home health aides for several hours a day. we don't need anything else.",0,Assistance available in this case?

"i'm about to write to the va, but need advice, especially from people familiar with the va. main question: for ftd patients mobile and mostly physically healthy, how can you get more home aide care hours of watching them, if your local va clinic says your at the max? (obviously cheaper for va to pay for than alf's!)* i'm thinking of trying to do that and get 4 full days a week of home aide help (is now 8 hours), and maybe adding locks to the doors so my dad can't sneak out when we're in the bathroom. my mom is so stressed from caregiving that she said to research alf's, but i think this plan would relieve us enough to keep him home. my intuition tells me the alf would be bad, and trying adult day cares was awful, they upset him and he refused to do anything but try to escape and run home.* background: my sweet dad is 100% disabled veteran, 62, supposedly all his health care should be taken care of for free now. the va reasoning my mom cited is that he can do most ""normal activities of living"", he just needs to be supervised because he likes to go out of the house walking, 3x a day and obsessively say prayers at different neighbors lawn statues, crossing a main road often too. i try to always jump up when he heads to the door and walk with him so i know he's safe. (no issues getting lost, always goes the same route, knows how to get everywhere/home, careful around cars) he has to be cooked for, and cannot say many sentences anymore, or express himself well.* so he has to basically be monitored all day. my mom's taken great care of him the last 3 years, but the stress of this is destroying us health wise, we both developed high cortisol, auto-immune diseases, failing thyroids, anxiety disorders, went from healthy weights to obesity (despite working out and eating very healthy!). and he treats her like a piece of furniture mostly while hugging me every day, so extra heartbreak for her.the other day she developed a scary sounding cough, and i decided she can't do this anymore (even with me giving her time off 3 days/wk) i cannot lose her too and be alone in the world with no family (kind of selfish, yea).* [fyi: if everyone thinks ""va just won't give you more hours, only a nursing home"", i will simply visit my senator to change it. i am an activist thanks to my dad's influence and will not accept va status quo anymore]any advice welcomed!!",0,"Dad with Semantic FTD, how to get more weekly home aide care hours using VA insurance?"

"a lot can change in a day. doctors believe my 69 year old father has ftd with als. over the past 10 or so years my father has had difficulty walking and taking care of himself that has gotten progressively worse. it started with just walking issues and discomfort but has evolved into his fine motor skills being almost completely gone now. his personality has changed a little over this time, too, but it’s been so gradual you almost don’t notice it. although, one noticeable thing is that he has become exceptionally sexually preoccupied and obsessed with right wing politics. what a combo, right? we were always pretty close and opted to live together about 2 years ago before i had any idea that there was a serious illness at play. in these 2 years, my father has declined to the point of losing any interest in showering or doing anything but watching tv and ordering doordash. he’s fallen multiple times, but it got worse about 5 days ago. i knew i could no longer have him at home — it was unsafe. the hospital admitted him and seemed annoyed that i brought him in since he was oriented and had normal lab values. eventually the doctor spoke to me and gathered more information about what had happened. i was feeling good that answers would be coming and my dad could be somewhere where he was looked after. it had been about 36 hours since i last visited him when i arrived this morning. what i saw was shocking. my father had lost the ability to answer most questions due to his inattention and distractibility. he had a flat affect and blank look in his eyes. after talking with a neurologist and psychiatrist, the diagnosis points to ftd and als. this acceleratingly rapid decline has me shaken. i’m still processing everything, and i just hope my father finds peace soon.",1,Frontotemporal Dementia and ALS

"i'm sitting down to write this because this journey is nearly ending and i had a breakdown discussing things in our imminent future: obituaries, funerals, blessing of the sick, last rites, etc. my grandmother is basically in the active phases of dying. it's been a little less (or about) 4 years since she was originally diagnosed but i truly think she might have had signs since 2012-2013 and was able to hide them. i remember her casually mentioning to my dad that she had once driven by the house 4 times because she couldn't recognize the house. this was far before we had a diagnosis. just my thoughts: i think one of the biggest things that didn't happen that i always heard happened was forgetting loved ones. she did forget the names of loved ones she hadn't seen in years or that weren't around much, but she never forgot my mom, sister, i or her sister that lives up here's name. she had blips where she would stumble over her sister's name but that's about it.declining wasn't linear....some things happened at a faster pace than others. for example, her ability to coherently put together sentences dropped very quickly whereas her motor skills were okayish for a long while. however, it seems when something fell off, it just went down to damn near bottom before leveling out for a while. dementia seems to be a long, slow mourning process. knowing that my grandmother's days are numbered, knowing she may not make it to next week hurts. i don't want to do anything at all but i can't stand seeing her like this. her breathing is irregular, she can't eat/drink/etc. she's sleep most of the time. unable to speak well. this is the opposite of what she used to be, who she used to be. however, while it hurts, i've mourned what will never be and what has been lost since her diagnosis. i knew the outcome but am far from prepared. i feel numb and scared but that's death i suppose. feelings, sicknesses, etc are more pronounced in dementia patients. utis can completely change a dementia patient until it has cleared. same with dehydration, or mental, physical, emotional stressors. when my mom got sick, my grandmother became a bit more withdrawn, concerned about my mom even if she couldn't properly verbalize it. finally (for now): while the person i once knew has long been gone, pieces of that personality came out every now and again and made me smile. those times where she showed that strong maternal instinct she always had make me feel a bit warm and at home. i don't have anyone to talk to so i put this here. i wish i could wake up and this be a bad dream. wake up to my grandmother cooking breakfast and drinking some coffee. go back pre-diagnosis, pre-dementia. hell, right now, i'd go back to a few months ago to her just calling someone in the house just to say she didn't need anything. i was blessed with this grandmother and man is it going to hurt knowing she's no longer here. i pray a cure is found so no more people have to suffer through this shit. never in my wildest dreams could i imagine this happening to our family.",1,Our journey through dementia....
"for no reason at all. my grandmother has had dementia for several years now but we’ve been lucky for the most part. it’s been shitty of course but in comparison to other accounts i have read or heard, i know it could be so much worse. in the last few weeks my grandmother has been telling my mom she’s depressed and sad. we’ve always had our off days or couple of days here and there. but in the last week, everything sets her off and makes her angry.  any simple thing you say to her will be responded to as though you have been whining about it incessantly and pestering her to the point of bursting. i have always been the one that said getting upset doesn’t help anything and to just try and be patient. silly little fool i was, that was before she was being downright mean and it’s like a switch has flipped. mom and i attended a caregiver support group yesterday because of how much this switch flip has gotten to us. there i learned that dementia can change on a dime. so this might just be the way it is now. i suppose i’ll get the hang of dealing with that, but god fucking damn it i’ve just been so hurt and angry at how she has been that i was the one to lash out just now and get her upset when it might have been fine otherwise. i’m so fucking angry at myself. i’m ashamed of the way i’m short tempered and miserable at home and then i go to work and chit chat and be charming with customers both nice and difficult, and i can’t maintain the same facade at home. my grandmother used to be my best friend. i constantly tell myself it’s a monster controlling her brain like some sci-fi movie. all medical science and logic and common sense obviously tells you it isn’t her acting that way and saying these things, and it isn’t what she wants but she can’t help it. but my monster visualization has not stopped me from letting my feelings get hurt and fighting back, which as we all know, there’s no point. it gets to all of us in the house so much. it would be in everybody in this household’s best interest if i could just be patient and be the one to brush everything off and be positive, even in the face of the most difficult challenges dementia may present us with. i could be the one to pull us all up by our bootstraps and diffuse things. people say that’s not realistic to be always patient and positive but to those people i want to say “you don’t know, it has to be done”. but i haven’t done it, and i’m feeling pretty selfish.  so now i’m just sitting here wallowing in self loathing, and all i could think of was to just write it out to whoever is listening here. just needing to vent. trolls, please leave me alone.",0,I just lashed out.

"my mother-in-law has this dreaded disease and she opted to go to assisted living in a rage, some years ago. she got tired of us asking her if she was alright because of how much she was struggling with everything. before that she had been living with us and getting progressively worse, not eating on her own, just laying about and very fixated on things she wanted us to do or get for her. my wife mentioned how needy she was to her mom one day and her mom flipped and started calling assisted living places on her own.now, she's been there for several years, in a very good place and they are great with her. she gets her diet needs seen to, gets her meds (this was a big issue when with us, she would forget and double up or just not take them) and they have all kinds of stuff for her to do, even in the pandemic.all the time, still, she calls and says that she thinks that she can go live in the houses on the property, where older folks live without assistance. she misses cooking, being free to do what she wants, etc.she keeps saying that she's in prison and that my wife put her there. these outbursts are happening more and more.this time, she wants a new chair, so my brother-in-law opted to buy her one. he's been researching it but apparently taking too long. so she (mil) calls my wife and asks what's taking so long. then she goes into her routine about how she can be living in unassisted housing and that the doctor said she's fine to do that.aside: when she was diagnosed, and then rediagnosed there were about 10 years in between. when we got the official diagnosis, it was recommended that we move her, because it would get harder and harder for her. she thinks every time she goes to get a physical that she's being reevaluated and rediagnosed and if she gets some answers right on her test it means that she doesn't need to be in assisted living, anymore.back to our regular story:so she calls my wife and blasts her because she doesn't know or care about how bad she's been getting and my wife takes it personally. basically neither of her siblings answer when she calls or do much to help. mil takes it out on us and lately, she's been brutal. she called one day while we were driving back from helping move one of our kids and since we were almost having fun, she belted out one of her classics about how we could have fun and she was stuck in prison.once in a while, her being upset, especially in this new and dreaded pandemic, i get it. you feel cooped up, and we do too. but turning her rage on the one daughter that does everything, and being so brutal and making it as though we've had her incarcerated is awful. my wife feels the guilt. she knows her mom needs to be in there. she can't do her own meds, she can't remember anything. she gets fixated on certain things (chair) she can remember and then harps on it to anyone who will listen. but my wife just feels so bad and so, she takes it personally. she knows her mom has to be there, but she can't just let it bounce off and ignore it or hang up.i feel helpless to help her, because for me, it would be different. i won't put up with that shit. i will tell it like it is and that's maybe mean or cruel. when she was with us and would harp on something, i would keep a tally and show her: ""you've asked me about this 7 times, today."" she'd get abashed and stop for a while. it wasn't to be mean, but it helped both of us.i suggested printing out the doctor's ruling that says she  needs to be there (assisted living) and having it framed and when her mom freaks out, show it to her, like some dick version of the notebook.i just get so tired of her being treated this way when she's done so much.",0,Brutal treatment of my wife

"hi everyone, i'm new to this subreddit, so i apologize if this topic has come up already. but i'm in desperate need for help. my mom, who is 71, almost 72, has shown signs of dementia i'd say as early as 60 years old. it was very minor back then, but i'd say in the last 2-4 years, it's gotten significantly worse. my mom is in complete denial about it and/or is just completely scared. she watched her own mom succumb to the disease 27 years ago. it was never diagnosed as alzheimer, although i've had my doubts that she might have be misdiagnosed. either way, she watched her own mother go through it and i can tell she is terrified of it happening to her. but that's the problem. it is happening to her. she is somewhat aware of it and admits that it's a problem, but only ""when she's stressed"". otherwise, she thinks she's totally fine. one of my sisters, my dad and myself had a gentle ""intervention"" with her 2 years ago which got her to go to a neurologist. she did have a mri to rule out any kind of strokes or any signs of possible alzheimer's. according to her, everything came back normal. however, we can't fully trust that she told us everything truthfully because part of the appointment she was alone and it wasn't until later that my dad finally joined. my sister (the one at the intervention) brought it up to her again last night and said that my mom was on the defensive almost immediately and got really mad/upset and kicked her out of her room. do any of you have any suggestions to help us convince her to go back to the doctor's? are there any treatments such as medications, therapies, etc she could try that might help? i know there is no cure and most alzheimer medications only help in prolonging the onset of more symptoms, but don't stop them completely. are medications out of the question since it hasn't been diagnosed as alzheimer? *i should describe her symptoms: she has excellent long term memory. like scary good. but her short term memory seems so minimal. she's gotten to the point where she asks us the same questions multiple times in one day. sometimes within minutes of each other. she has to leave notes around the house to remind her of things constantly. she will completely forget conversations and will adamantly deny things, despite me having evidence (example, she left a voicemail on my phone and when i played it for her, she claimed that wasn't her and someone was impersonating her). and don't get me started on the repeated stories. she hasn't lost the ability to do activities of daily living, and she's still able to drive, however, she's too uncomfortable to drive anywhere outside of her own town. her personality has changed too. she's almost reclusive and her once social life as dwindled down to 1 solid friend/neighbor and maybe a handful of other people she occasionally interacts with. she's become very judgmental and kind of angry with everyone but especially to her kids. i understand that everyone can suffer from the repeated story syndrome. i'm super guilty of it too, especially with mommy brain. but this is so much different from that. please help!!",0,i need help convincing my mom to seek help
hi. i’m not even sure what to say. my mom was “officially” diagnosed a year ago but it was getting noticeable about 2 ish years ago. it was scary for all of us and we knew it’d get bad. we talked to her drs and knew basically what to expect but i don’t know what to do anymore. it’s progressed slowly but we are now at the mean stage. but only to me (only girl) and she leaves me in tears with what she says and does. i know it’s not her and i try not to react but sometimes i just want to cry. my brothers are amazing and they always tell me to take a break for a few days which is great. but if i’m at my home (30 miles away) and don’t see her for a day she starts crying and will sneak away to call and ask me why i don’t love her anymore. i don’t know what to do. she’s been an amazing mom and i hate that on the phone she’s so sad but if she sees me then within an hour i’m a dirty little slut who’s never done anything good in my life. actual statement she said to me. none of that’s true but no one can stop her yelling these things at me. i don’t understand why she doesn’t say these things to my brothers and i know it isn’t her fault or their fault but i just feel emotionally raw. i don’t know how to handle this anymore and that makes it worseany advice is welcome but mostly just needed to get it out.,0,Mom is getting mean

"i don’t post often, but today was a really hard day and i feel lonely. today we spent the afternoon with my husband’s mom so his dad could get a round of golf in after his support group. it's been a long time coming, but we are elated because dad is feeling more comfortable asking for help with mom. this is my husband's second week helping with respite care. he said the morning went really well. they had breakfast and then drove to our house with mom’s dog, p, so that she could play with our two dogs, t and k. when i got home, i immediately noticed that mom was quite focused on our older dog, k. it seemed harmless, my husband lived at home with k for a few years after college so i was honestly quite touched that she having a connection. she hasn’t been able to remember our pups in a long, long time. mom and dad’s dog is a fuzzy little doodle-something puppy with limitless energy. t is a 9-year-old pug that still acts like a doodle-something puppy. when they get together, there’s lots of barking and playing and wrestling. it warms my heart… but drives mom insane. i don’t think she likes the loud barks and how unpredictably they move, so she gets *really* irritated when they romp. we tried our best to limit the fun (actual torture for any dog lover ;-) ) with the hopes of making the afternoon as pleasant for mom as possible. things seemed to be going well.and then it was time to go home.at some point, *without my husband or me realizing it*, mom had concluded that p was no longer hers and that she was taking k home. and boy, she was adamant. when we put p in the car and shut the door, mom said **fine** she would just walk home with k, then. if we tried to put our foot down, there were tears and desperate pleading. my heart was breaking over and over, both seeing mom so sad and upset and seeing my husband watch his mom struggle so much. he’s only recently started helping dad out with respite, and it couldn’t have been easy for him. it was a long afternoon. we brought all three dogs to mom's hoping that if we just had more time we could somehow maneuver a smoother transition... but we eventually had to rip off the bandaid anyway. i keep telling myself we did the very best that we could. my husband was rattled, and will likely have more feelings after he processes it… in about a month. i’m just lonely and tired, wishing that i had more answers, wishing that i could have done something to make her day better, and wondering how in the hell we got here so quickly. has anyone found the pause button yet??phew. i feel better after writing this, so i really appreciate the audience &lt;3 thank you",1,Today was hard.

"hello.to begin - whoever you are, if you are within this virtual community, i truly send you my love. this is a vile disease to navigate for all involved. i come seeking advice. here is some information that, while i apologize for ranting, hope helps give you the best idea possible of my family's situation...my mother (72 years old) was diagnosed several months ago with a yet-to-be-finalized type of dementia, still in its earlier stages. my father died without warning this past june due to pe after major surgery so it's been a hectic and difficult year. i am the youngest (30) of my siblings and while they have been doing a lot, i have taken lead with her mental health and overall well-being. her main symptoms are mild memory issues, trouble focusing at times and she has difficulty with speech, especially when she is anxious or feels the need to ""perform"". she does not slur words nor does she ever simply stop talking - her issue is getting the words out (she expresses that it feels like the words are trapped in her mind). once prompted or guided, she can complete her thought. this gives her a lot of anxiety. she has no issues with balance or movement nor has she had any hallucinations or severe ""episodes"", yet. she is still pretty active (does laundry, cooks her own meals, for the most part, does work in the garden, washes her own dishes, etc) and stays relatively social. she has been taking donepezil and began speech/cognition therapy about 12 weeks ago. i am not sure if the speech therapy is doing a great deal but she enjoys going/likes her speech therapist. if nothing else, it's additional socialization and gives her a bit of independence that she likes (she does not drive anymore but rather a county-sponsored service picks her up and brings her home, door to door). said van service can also take her to other appointments if need be or even grocery shopping. we have a raz cell phone for her that both tracks her and gives her security of calling pre-programmed numbers (me, my siblings, close friends, etc) if there was an issue while outside her house. my brother lives with her (he has his own health issues so they benefit from having each other) but she can handle herself without issue if left on her own for days at a time if need be (we would never allow that, but i state this to stress she is not a danger to herself or others at this stage). **with that info done...here is my question:** while we have things under control now and could handle this for years and years i know it will, someday, get worse. i am simply seeing if anyone out there has any advice for me and my family at this stage.is there anything you wish you had done to better prepare your loved one / the family? are there any more progressive or unique types of therapy that you have seen help? anything you wish to offer in terms of practical advice?",0,What you wish you knew...

"my dad was moved from a short term to long term care place early last month. visits have not been allowed in either place. at the last facility, he had a phone in his room. when i would speak to him, he displayed the expected lack of memory and confabulation from his illness but he was alert. in fact, he was moved partially because he was often agitated and trying to escape.the new place has a shared phone screened by the nurse. whenever i talk to him, he sounds half awake. he barely says anything. i know that they've adjusted his meds but i'm concerned that they are just doping him up so he's not a bother. i don't know if there's anything i can do. it's really frustrating not being able to see for myself how he's doing. there are no open cases of covid-19 at the place and almost everyone there is vaccinated. it doesn't make sense.",0,Long term care facility is just sedating him
"i’m taking care of my step dads mom and she cries all the time. i’m pretty sure it’s fake crying most of the time. she just yells “help me” nonstop. i haven’t seen anyone talk about using the “cry it out” method they use for babies. is that not something we should do? because if not, how the hell do you get anything done ever? some days she cries every half hour. and some nights, like tonight, it’s every ten minutes. i told her to “shut up” for the first time. i got so overwhelmed, i’m sick, and tired and i just told her to shut up. i feel a little bad but also i really do want her to just shut up. she can’t get into any trouble seeing as she can’t get out of bed on her own and can’t walk without her walker. so would it be so bad if i just ignored her for a while? closed my bedroom door, turned off the baby monitor, and just ignored her for half an hour? my first half an hour of peace at home since last year when she started getting progressively worse at an accelerated pace? she is on 100mg quetiapine. she started at 25 and it worked for two nights, same with 50mg, and now same with 100. but it only works for those two nights. then it’s back to normal. my step dad never comes to see her. only once or twice a month. we almost put her in a memory care facility but then my mom talked him out of it because it might “disturb her routine.” so now my boyfriend and i are stuck with her for god knows how long with no help. her insurance doesn’t even cover a night nurse. i don’t know how much longer i can do this.",0,nonstop crying and no sleep. kind of a rant
so my mom is 55. she is diabetic.she had a mri of her neck before having neck surgery and they saw white matter in her brain. she asked her neurologist about it and told him she is having some memory issues. he said he thinks it could be vascular dementia caused by her diabetes. he said she could reverse it if she got her sugar better controlled. i've noticed her having some memory issues and saying the wrong or name only a few times. i'm mentally disabled and live with her and my stepdad. my grandma moved in and has dementia so it's been stressful. i'm very worried about my mom. so is what the doctor said true? does white matter always mean dementia?,0,Possible beginnings of vascular dementia?
"hi guys. my grandma is 86 years old, has dementia and is bedridden. we make her wear diapers and change it thrice daily. however, she would often rip the diapers off and pee on the bed instead. we kept telling her to just pee in the diapers to which she agrees but she still rips it off anyway. we tried putting trousers but she would figure out how to untie the knot so she can reach it. its incredibly frustrating especially with washing the mattress, the trousers, the clothes, cleaning the torn diapers, etc. anyone had any similar experiences or know a way to make her pee in the diapers? thanks guys",0,Help with grandma

"if i had to guess, going by the ""seven stages"" my grandmother is probably around 4, but moving into 5.  although, it's hard to tell because the deviations in her memory have become so drastic the past few months.  i see her seven days a week, so i'm familiar with how she is on a day to day basis.  on monday she might be completely out of it.  you would think she's end stage.  she doesn't know how i am, she doesn't know who my grandfather is.  she's just laying on the couch, speaking weakly and saying she can barely move.  she will ask where she is, and then insist this isn't her home, despite living there for 50 years.  and this won't be just a small episode, i usually stop by three times a day, morning, afternoon, and evening.  on days like this it will last 24 hours.  then, i could stop by the next morning on tuesday.  i'll get there at 8am and she's coming up the basement stairs with a load of laundry, she's got breakfast cooking, a pot of tea on, she knows exactly who i am, who my grandfather is.  she'll be talking about something she saw on the morning news.  later in the day she will ask my grandfather to take her out grocery shopping, or to go out for dinner.  it's suddenly like she's perfect.  then on wednesday she might be just as good, or back to monday, or somewhere in the middle.  thursday could be awful, friday could be amazing again as if she doesn't even have dementia.  she's seen multiple doctors, she doesn't have a uti (i know that will be brought up), she's just had a typical ""age related dementia"" diagnosis.  if anyone else here had a family member like this, how did you deal with it?  it's taking a toll on my grandfather.  he has the money for a home nurse/caregiver, but the issue is that right now it's impossible to schedule one.  he said he struggles a lot on her bad days, and i see it.  but at the same time, there's 2-4 days a week when having one there would be a total waste of money (and would piss off my grandmother when she's having a good day cognitively).  how do you handle this stage?",1,[deleted by user]

"hello. i care for my mom (72, pd, mid level dementia) she lives with my family of 3 in our house, she has her own one bedroom basement apartment with a kitchen/bathroom. she has struggled with her clothing for a few years, things on inside out, things on backwards, wearing a shirt as a skirt, 2 socks on one foot, mismatched shoes etc. i tried buying her matching shirts and pant sets, hanging them in day order, nothing really worked so i help her get dressed and undressed daily, but we then started to have a different problem: she was changing her clothes, multiple times a day and often in the middle of the night. honestly i wouldn’t care, it makes more laundry for me but whatever, but now she’s starting to get tangled in her shirts, can’t get them over her head, and comes upstairs for help, sometimes in various states of undress (completely topless twice) which is very uncomfortable for my husband and son. i know it’s not intentional but it feels like she’s bored and wants attention and has found this works to get it. she does do workout classes 5 days a week, we grocery shop one, and my brother takes her to lunch on the final day, so she has activities daily.i’m becoming frustrated with having to help her out of a clothing fiasco multiple times a day. today i helped her get dressed, and an hour later she came up with the same shirt on but inside out and backwards. then 30 mins later she couldn’t find the shorts she had just been wearing, which were on her bed. then later she suddenly was in a different shirt, but it’s too tight! i have begged her: “just stay in today’s outfit” but she claims she doesn’t know what happens to her clothes or why she is doing this behavior. i visit her literally 10 times a day for food or meds, so i’m usually around hourly when she’s awake.does anyone have any tips? i’ve considered buying shirts that only open in the back. i hate to feel like i’m putting my mom in a straight jacket, but jeeze, i work fulltime and have so much to do in the evenings and weekends, dealing with the same problem over and over is so frustrating.thanks for reading.",0,Clothing struggles

"my mother was officially diagnosed with alzheimer's just over 2 years ago. my dad passed away in 2014 and my mom lived alone in an appartment within walking distance from myself and my sister. while we noticed a gradual decline my mom still had a great quality of life. she spent 4 days a week at daycare in a nursing home, which she loved. they went on daytrips, shopping, to a garden center or the market and even to the christmas circus in 2019. my mom no longer cooked but still managed to prepare microwave meals. she couldn't do a weekly grocery shop so i did that for her. she forgot to clean but she got a cleaning help 3 hours a week. and while we mourned the mother we were slowly losing, we still had her around and were still able to visit and have a chat.two weeks ago wednesday the nursing home called to tell me my mother was short of breath and was running a mild fever and i had to come get her. my sister was able to get her tested that evening and the next day we got the result that she tested positive for corona.we have no clue where she got it. could be anywhere, since my mom never remembered to wash her hands regularly.from wednesday to monday my sister and i visited her several times a day each to care for her. we were given a huge box with protective gear to use on ourself but it wasn't enough since last week my sister got sick and tested positive, and in turn infected her husband and youngest teen son, oldest son still pending. i've been tested 3 times now, all negative.anyway, my mom had high fevers for days and eventually breathing got even more difficult and on monday our family doctor decided to send her to the hospital for oxygen and fluids. it was decided by a doctor there that my mom wouldn't be sent to the icu should her condition worsen, because she wouldn't be able to go through the rehabilitation process following intubation because of her alzheimer's. we agreed with that. she was allowed 1 visitor once a day and since my sister was sick i was in and out of the hospital all week. at first she was very ill, and we realized there was a very large chance covid might kill her. my mom is 77, has survived cancer and is a smoker. but what do you know, fysically she recovered somewhat. she still was weak and needed some oxygen but the fever passed and she seemed to do better.on monday i got some videochats going with some of her cousins whom she's always been close with. and while she was convinced she wasn't sick and she didn't have a clue where she was, she was still able to have a chat and she was lively. untill she wasn't. over the past week her alzheimer's seems to have progressed a year's worth or even more. she no longer understands where she is or why, she didn't recognize her own brother when he visited, she had a huge problem talking and forming coherent sentences, and worst of all, she was no longer able to swallow food or water.this afternoon we had a talk with the doctor there (my sister via video chat since she is still too sick to travel, no matter how much she wanted to be there), and we all concluded that my mom's quality of life was no longer there and that there was no hope of that improving in any significant way.the only solution was giving her food through a tube up her nose but she keeps pulling out her oxygen so we doubt she would accept such a thing, not to mention that it would only prolong her suffering at this point. so we have decided, with the agreement of the doctor, to seize all attempts at feeding her.this afternoon, right before the meeting with the doctor, her condition had worsened so much i was genuinely convinced for a second that i had entered the wrong room, because i didn't recognize her. she did still recognize me for a moment, mask and all, and whispered my name but that is the only coherent thing she said.i am still in shock how fast this virus has turned my mom into an advanced stage alzheimer's patient. how she went from still living on her own to no longer being able to speak and swallow in the span of two weeks. since the start of this pandemic my sister and i have been very worried about my mom catching the corona virus because she's such a high risk case, but we never could have imagined how this horrible virus could end things for my mom.i'm still mostly in shock. tomorrow we're talking with the hospital to get her out of there, maybe to a hospice or even back to her home since she is now officially corona free, so we can make her final days more comfortabele, since that is all we can do now, aside from waiting for the end.",0,Fast mental decline due to covid-19 in mother with Alzheimer's

"i [19ftm] feel for the families and the residents i meet at the nursing facility i work for. i've been getting to know the residents more and more (the ones that talk to me when i clean their rooms) and it's hard to watch them go through this. they tell me about their hobbies, families, what they did, what they want, etc. even if they don't remember their lives as well as they used to and they don't always make sense, they're just so sweet and interesting. i just like to learn from their experiences and their lives.there is one women, i will keep her name private so i can respect her family.. i will call her d. d and i talk all the time when i see in the halls on my way to another room. or just when i clean her room. she has been depressed lately. the residents all have their days, but it always gets me... i love these people and it hurts to see them like this, let alone the families. i found out recently that d loves puzzles. i thought about bringing her some puzzle booklets. she says she loves doing those and she used to do them a lot. i am just super happy to get to work and see these lovely people. i like to try to make their days brighter and i love to see them even in their worst moments because they all are going through something i cannot imagine. d even loves candy. her favorite is milkyways. another woman, i will call k, has been super, super sweet. she always makes me smile and i love talking to her despite her not making any sense. she is funny and very loving. i will say hi, ask how she is, even talk about our day. even though it's mostly me talking, she loves it. she even bothers the nurses just to speak to me when they are trying to do therapy with her.i always speak with the residents and always smile at them. i always interact with them all and give them my attention. they love it. i hope that it makes their days a little bit better. it's worth it. i just wanted to write about this because i feel for all of you guys dealing with this.. it's so hard to watch other people's family members dealing with that. i had a grandpa (mom's side) who battled with dementia and now his wife is following closely behind. i got this job to hopefully be around her more when we eventually cannot take care of her ourselves. she is doing okay as she can be right now, but not really herself. i just want to let you all know that everything you deal with and everything you feel is your strength. i hope all of you know that what you're doing is awesome. ❤️",0,Just Some Support
"some background. my dad has had parkinson disease for around 9 years, he was only 60 and in the last two was diagnosed with parkinson related dementia. he is in the late stages, lives in a nursing home and he struggles to know who we are. now and again he references family/friends names and things that have happened in the past.  he knows my face as 'margaret' we presume it is his cousin margaret he is remembering.  i visit my dad once a week and sometimes will bring my children along. they have never known papa before illness. so have grew up visiting him with no expectation of him doing papa stuff and always know papa as unwell. i feel personally i have dealt with my dads illness pretty well.  i've worked in a gp practice for 15 years and over the years have dealt with numerous wee patients that have become demented and as heart breaking as it is i've always felt toughened with regards to illness. i recently got married with no frills. i only told my mum and my husband told his patents, no one else knew. out of respect and the fact he is my dad my husband wanted to tell him and i guess in a way get his permission. he was having a good day when we told him although he still didn't remember i was his daughter. but he asked about honeymoons etc.  fast forward to our first visit after we got married,  me my husband and our six year old went to visit. he was sitting on his usual chair in the tv room and as i walked in did my usual greeting.  i had a can of juice in my hand for him and his first reaction was to grab it off me. i told him to hang on till i opened it and as i began opening it he was still grabbing it and angrily saying give me it. so that was a little upsetting but not  anything i hadn't dealt with before. we pulled our chairs in. my son's birthday had been the day before we got married so i say to my son tell papa it was your birthday.  so he tells him and my dad just looks right through him and draws his eyes off him.  i don't know if it was the incident with the stupid can that added to my emotions but for the first time i cried while in his company. i got up from the chair and went to look out the window. my husband continued to chat to him but my six year old came up beside me and asked if i was ok. i smiled and said yes i was just a bit upset. he then continued to say you know papa isn't well mummy, his brain is all confused, it's not his fault. i hugged my wee boy that seemed too wise for his years. here was me crying like a baby and having my child comfort me by mimicking the words i say to them after every visit.  my husband mentioned we got married but he wasn't for chatting. he seemed frustrated and angry so we cut the visit shorter than normal.the reason for posting this is can any one offer advice? should i call him by his name instead of dad? he  seems to respond to his name every time. should i keep taking my children to visit? he has never shown any kind of relation to them and the kids normally end up wandering around the home chatting to the other residents. i just feel this is not my dad now and each time i visit i'm left a little more disheartened.  i wouldn't wish dementia on my worst enemy.",0,A recent visit to my dad left me upset (advice appreciated)

"its been 3 years since my father's diagnose. he is 65 only. i am so sorry he never had the chance to live his 60's he went from 60 to 80 years old.its been downhill since then, he is on some medications to chill him a bit and get better sleep. i have been noticing he is beginning to have some kind of mild hallucinations. last night he woke up in the middle of the night asking my mom why there was a person there and why they were in the kitchen while such person is just a frame above the bed of leaves and they have been sleeping in my room as they are staying this week in my place and i will return with them to their home for some weeks.he is quiet most of the time, interactions have decreased significantly in the past months. i mean, he is not able to make a coherent phrase anymore. he stutters some words and its difficult to understand what he is saying, when he does sometimes comes from a weird observation, like trying to relate the tv controller with a little monkey there. nonsense.its clear he is losing his consciousness day by day. at least here he is not wandering that much anymore, he sits or lays in the couch and stays there. his eyes...his eyes are lost in space. he doesn't hear or understand clearly when someone is addressing to him and he needs help to conduct him where he needs to go. he is totally dependent in everything, even baths he can't do it properly in his own. this wasn't happening when i last saw him in january. sometimes i wonder if he is becoming blind because he cant see the most obvious things. my apartment is small, like 570 sq feet, two rooms and a bathroom between, he always misses the bathroom. he goes all the way to the laundry area or one of the rooms to pee. obviously the bathroom is damn small, and he is still not sure where to pee and even aimed with his hands to be sure pointing it to the side of the toilette. how is that possible...its depressing...very depressing. i feel some guilty for choosing to stay in the city while my parents and my brother (27, i am 28) lives 1 hour drive (i don't own vehicles so i cant visit them that often, i intend to do so soon  as long as i find some way or even save to buy a motorbike). i mean, wfh since the pandemic hit and living by myself for 5 years now, i have choose this life before his disease so i could gain some independence and find my own way and to be not a burden for them, i have a girlfriend i want to marry soon so i need to build my life and not worry my mom, i guess its the right thing? if she needed my help she might ask, and  i am glad my brother lives there to help them out. as i see them every 2 months, this means i only see frames of my fathers illness and its always getting  worse. my mom and brother are not that shocked as i am because they are there. my mom has been dealing better now, she has accepted that correcting him will not help, just comply and chill him when asking about going home or seeing his wife or dead relatives.he is not able to recognize any of us. i wonder what goes through his head...i needed to offmychest this because as much as i try to accept this as life the way it is and this is just one way to die, when i stop to think about it i just want to cry and i do sometimes, a little, because we need to keep going. i feel bad because we werent really close all of our lives. i mean, he was always there and provided us all, he did a wonderful job as father, we just didnt click when we grew up so our relation were just ok enough, i wish we had way more father-son moments as i see others doing. now its too late. however, i am glad i see a lot of in me from him, i am a fraction of the men he was and i am glad for that.as if the disease is not enough to burden us all we need to mind and deal with the judicial matters and battle for the right to not pay irs anymore. so sorry...we are no that religious but i know he had faith in god as i do, and i am glad i once asked him if he believed in god ans jesus christ as his savior and he does. so i know he is going to be saved and go to heaven peacefully. i don't pray a lot...once in a while but when i do i always ask him to relief my father's pain and give peace in his heart, the same for us and strength to deal with all that, i feel better afterwards and thats the way he have been living.i wish you all the best dealing with this. you are not alone",1,Hallucinations and venting
this is a definitely a very sensitive subject and i don't mean to bring up things that will upset anyone. i just had some questions about alzheimer's and the stages and when did your loved one pass.i have a very large family my grandmother has a lot of kids and a million grandkids. so there is definitely a lot of hands in the cookie jar. i am the who lives with my grandma as her primary caretaker. according to the fast alzheimer's scale my grandma is at 6c. she has been progressing fast since my grandfather has passed away. there is definitely a disagreement in my grandma time left and how it should be handled. some people think she only has weeks to months. she has recently fallen and broke ribs and now has pneumonia. so she is definitely struggling now and i know with anyone she could pass at anytime. but i believe she will beat this and recover. things i read and see saying people can live a long time in the 6 category and even awhile in 7 on scale. sensitive part could you tell me on what part of stage did your loved one past and was it complications or other medical factors or dementia related. thank you,0,Sensitive subject (sorry)

"okay, i am really fighting hard to cope with my dad's early stage of alzheimer's. it isn't that bad compared to others. but, my dad keeps forgetting minor things, to a point where now it's costing me and my family money (more on that later). and on top of that, my dad is a really stubborn guy. i can say both those two don't make a good mix from my experience.due to his condition, he can't exactly maintain a steady job. so its pretty much my mom and me being the primary provider for now. my dad who works in it still gets jobs here and there, but its more contract-based, and mostly lasts 3 months.now, let me get to the part where it's costing our family money.but, let me first say this.. like i said before, my dad's condition isn't that bad, and i feel really bad for him. but,  its coming to a point of just pure frustration for me at least on my part.coming to a point where our house kitchen was almost fully burned down twice. once was our stove being totaled, 2nd time half the kitchen was burned down, and my dad was told by my mom multiple times to not use the stovetop, but did it anyways.now when it comes to whatever is left in our family savings just about a month ago my dad lost 1grand due to some miss placement of his certain investments that he can't remember. my dad didn't give me enough details because of his stubbornness. i could easily come up with couple of pages to what else my dad lost money-wise, and important items like a passport to his driver license due to this condition, but what happened in the last week or two kinda made me lost my anger.and today.... well... i almost lost it today where i had to walk out the house cause of how angry i got. today my mom left about 80dollars in front of my door to do some grocery shopping. i was sick all day, and was in my room just resting.as of right now, my parents is in the process of selling our house, so my dad can sorta retire and not worry about any debts, and of course, it will help his medical situation. that being said, we kinda hired these handymans to repair certain parts of our house in order to put it in the market so it can sell for a better price.so long story short, my mom left money for me to which my dad kept the money in front of my door and of course my dad not walking with these handymen, and forgetting that my dad left cash in front my door, like 100% for sure these crooks/handyman took the money, who i didn't know was going to show up today.i mean... i know it's only $80dollars, but just something triggered in me that got me really frustrated at my dad, when you also add all the incidents he did in the past. i had to walk outside just to vent my frustration cause of what my dad did. it was just one too many incidents that caused me to kinda lose my anger.another reason why i lost my anger today, cause just last week my dad gave someone $100 something dollars to replace our mid size fridge at our basement, to which my dad gave it to this one handyman who ofcourse didn't show up with our replacement fridge. this didn't have to do with his mental condition (or maybe it kinda does), but just adds up when my dad makes all these decisions combine with his alzheimers.my mom keeps telling my dad to be more careful with our financial situation, but he keeps forgetting minor and simple things, which causes our family to lose money. like i feel bad for my dad, but same time really frustrated cause he just won't listen most of the time.not sure what else to do, cause i know alzheimers is nothing you can solve in one day, but not sure if there are some sorta routines or medication. i know my dad takes some sorta medication, but ofcourse he won't give me the details.but, as of right now, i am kinda losing it. cause mom does make more money than me, and she works in the child daycare field. her, health isn't doing any better due to her age catching up. but, seeing money being lost by my dad, that's being hard-earned by mom is really hard to see. my dad didn't lose like all our savings or anything like that. but, just these incidents kinda adds up and doesn't make our already financial situation any easier.i thank you for reading this lengthy help i guess you can say. not sure if there is some sorta help group of sort that can help my dad's routine on not forgetting things and i guess not being stubborn is another source of method to fix i guess. but, just really hard to cope with, especially when my parents are in a tough financial situation.",1,"I AM NOT sure what to do with my dad's what seems early stage of Alzheimers, leading me to great frustration!"

"i was talking with a friend the other day who is an unpaid caregiver to her mother who is in the late stages of alzheimer's. she commented that she wished that there were tax credits available to people like her who are dealing with this financial burden. i work in the accounting department of a publicly traded american company, so i am mildly familiar with our federal tax system, but because tax is not my primary focus, i couldn't give her as good of an answer as i wish i could have. off the top of my head, i suggested the $500 tax credit for a dependent other than a qualifying child, but frankly i'm not sure that her mother would qualify for this either. i'm now looking into this topic closer to see if i can find something more helpful for her. is anyone familiar with deductions/credits that unpaid family caregivers may be able to benefit from? i'm more interested in federal income tax, but my friend is a resident of california if anyone is aware of anything she could take advantage of at the state level as well.",0,Tax Deductions/Credits for Family Caregivers

(when the person in question hadn't even been in the picture for a year and the dog was 13...)we were keeping a journal on her quietly with the recommendation of her doctor. he said we would know when it's time to break the news.anyway, my godfather and i woke up one morning and she was gone. she took our older dog and drove all the way ""home"" to pennsylvania (9 hour drive) to break up with him and start a new life. they had been together 20 years.there was absolutely no warning to this and she didn't even appear to be upset in the days prior, but she had been planning this for two weeks because we discovered some emails.unfortunately, she is trying to hit my godfather pretty hard with only giving him a very small compensation for the split, leaving him with a brand new puppy and 3 year old beach house. it seems that this is all very strange....we believe that her family has a big part in this...(we're not sure if they were putting this in her head to leave him or what) but it seems to be very $$ oriented.the odd thing is that she is still texting him goodnight and sharing pictures of our puppy on facebook as if nothing is wrong..though the legal notice says differently as if she was angry at him and left him like he was beating her.my question is; has anybody ever seen anything similar to this? a sudden divorce or personality change? would love to hear thoughts and experiences.thank you.",1,Not Yet Diagnosed Alzheimer's Godmother--Unusual Personality Change?

"hi all,to make a long story short without giving to many details, we received a call on xmas eve that my mom had managed to break into the kitchen off hours and proceeded to pour milk on a tech, who then proceeded to hit her. being in the health industry, this struck me especially hard and immediately enraged me. however, when approaching the managers today (who seem like honest, loving people) they said there was a mix up in translation. my mom did indeed break into the kitchen, however a fellow new patient who my mom doesn't get along with followed her. mom apparently threw milk on her and the fellow patient decided to hit her. does any of this seem odd? i'm positive cameras have to be installed everywhere to protect patients and the owner in cases like this. should i respectfully demand to see the footage or let it go? mom had no bruising as far as we know and doesn't recall it even happening. the home she is at we like, this has been the only concern so far that startled us. advice much appreciated!",0,Problem at my mother's home

"basically, i'm currently living with my mother and brother at 28 due to my old roommate moving away. my uncle had a stroke about two years ago, and a couple months ago we moved him in with us to take care of him (this is the second family member we've done this with, the last was my grandfather with the same issue). they said he's had multiple ""silent"" strokes in addition to the major one, and he has trouble forming new memories or remembering anything from the last 5-6 years (for example, he doesn't remember that my granddad, his dad, passed away). as such, he needs constant care as if he wanders out, after 45 minutes to an hour or so he'll have forgotten what's going on entirely.&amp;#x200b;we can't afford to keep taking care of him, i'm trying to get my own life on track and i'm giving up about a quarter of my paycheck each month towards his care, as he has to go to adult care while we're not home. the doctors are refusing to diagnose him with dementia and keep trying to send him to mental health therapists, which is causing problems applying for ssd. his daughter is 22, and basically doesn't want to do anything on her own, so she's living out of his house and was burning through about 2500 of his savings a month until my mother moved the money. if we even try to breach the subject of selling the house so that we can move him towards medicaid she starts texting him telling him we're trying to throw her out and he gets distressed and upset because she keeps pushing the narrative that there's nothing significantly wrong with him.  i really don't know what we can do. he barely had 10k in his savings after his daughter was done with it and that's not even going to last a year. we don't have anyone else to turn to as he's the last surviving member of my mom's side of the family, and he's 58 so barring another major stroke we're likely to be caring for him for the foreseeable future. outside of governmental, do you guys know of any charities or organizations that can help?",0,Caring for uncle with stroke-related dementia

"i've been dating a girl who lives with and cares for her mother, who has the early signs of alzheimer's. we've been dating for about year, and i'm absolutely in love with this girl.some background on the mom: she is definitely forgetful, but not as much as i would have thought when i first heard that she has alzheimer's. she may ask the same question more than once in a short period of time, but she can definitely cary a conversation. in fact, she is extremely personable and we get along very well. i guess the biggest struggle with the mom is that she doesn't ever want to do _anything_. we try encouraging her to get out of the house and enjoy life and keep exercising her mind, but it is always like twisting her arm to get her to do anything. she is unaware of her condition.what can i do to help make my girlfriend's life easier? how can i help? what should i try to keep in mind when she vents about her mom? things to say/not to say?have any of you tried to maintain a relationship while simultaneously being a caregiver for a parent? what do you wish your so would have done different? or, conversely, what did you so do that made you really happy?",0,Dating someone caring for her elderly mother

"i genuinely don't know what on earth to do anymore. before i get into everything, let me give you a little background on myself. i'm 18 years old living in a household with my mother, my father, four cats, and recently my grandmother. i'm in my last year of highschool so i've been super busy with school and basically getting ready for college. but besides that, i'm having a problem that i literally have no clue how to fix. my grandmother has been diagnosed alzheimer's for a little over 5 years now, and she's only been living with us for about 9 months. she hasn't been too bad or anything, she actually has been doing amazing lately, but my dad sees her as this burden. he always makes it seem like my mother and i never help him out with her (even though he leaves me for a day or two while he's hanging out with a friend at a brewery or something) and he constantly says how he is frustrated with life. the worst part is that it is now influencing my grandmother, having her say ""i want to die"" and ""no one wants me around"". what am i supposed to do in this situation? i know i'll be leaving for college soon, but i don't want to leave my mother in a toxic environment like that. how do i make him see that he is effecting the whole house with his attitude?",0,My Dad is making everything worse.
"sorry if this is the wrong place, everywhere else seemed empty and not active, figured this was my best shot. so, as the title says, i was just offered a job as a caretaker. i helped my mother take care of her parents (grandfather had alzheimer's and parkinson's and grandmother had dementia), but other than that i don't have much experience, and my possible employers know this.i'm just concerned about one thing, and it is quite silly really, but that's bathroom stuff. i never really helped out with bathroom stuff, that was all my mom, so i'm not sure how i'd handle it on the job, let alone with potential strangers. does anyone have experience in this area, taking care of their ageing parents?  does it get easier/less awkward with time? is it easy to ignore certain things while trying to help them out and maintain their dignity? just looking for some advice i guess. thanks!",0,"I was offered a job as a Caretaker, for elderly people in their own homes.

"hello everyone. i have done caregiving jobs in the past, but they were much less demanding and mostly housework and errands. now, i work with one client who has alzheimer's whose wife could no longer care for him. there are 3 other caregivers, so he has assistance 24 hours a day.when i started, it was very passive. i would walk behind him to make sure he didn't fall, prepare meals, assist with showers, etc. however, he has been deteriorating fast over the last 2 months and had a major downturn this week. he can no longer walk, or even stand on his own.i am 5'2"" and not very strong. when i started, i did not think i would have to be fully lifting a 6' tall 200 lb man by myself. i haven't received formal training for the proper methods.i am afraid i will hurt him, myself, or simply not be able to do it. what do i do?",0,New to Caregiving
"hello! i've recently taken on the care of my 86yo grandfather (with slight alzheimers and dementia) and i would need some advice on a couple points. 1. since he came to live with my wife and i he has had some intontinence issues. sometimes whenever i deviate his diet away from cereal with bannanas, turkey or chicken sandwiches with whole wheat bread, and roasted chicken with brocolli, he gets heavy diarrhea. within the last month or so his diet has been stable, but he has been going through his disposable underwear more frequently. 2. sometimes when he sits back in his chair, his breathing is more raspy like he has been running around the house and is exhausted. he doesn't seem to have trouble breathing, but it seems unusually audible.now, being part of the golden generation, his attitude has always been ""rub some dirt in it and move on."" he never seems like he is disturbed by these problems, or otherwise uncomfortable or in pain, but i feel like something is wrong and he doesn't want to tell me about it. i have him booked for a doctors appointment later this month but i'm afraid that i won't say the right thing to get proper help for my grandfather and the doctor will just wave a potential problem off by saying, ""its just what happens at his age... heres some generic pills.""is there something i should look for to find the truth of what is happening? should i say something specific to his doctor when we meet? or am i just over reacting?&amp;#x200b;thank you for your time.",0,Trying to Decode the Needs of the Elderly
"first off this is in maryland.  my father is dying of cancer which has progressed very quickly.  i have some questions concerning what i should do.  unfortunately he never made a will.i understand that the best option is to obtain a lawyer, and i plan to consult one but had some questions.there isn't much to leave, i'd say everything together comes in below $10,000, which is why i'm asking here for ideas before consulting a lawyer.currently my father has dementia, which will make it extremely problematic to obtain power of attorney, or so i have read.  i'm worried about a savings account he opened with my little brother.  my brother cosigned on it but he is only 15.  i don't know how that would be accessible after he passes.  anyone?is there any way to obtain power of attorney when someone is no longer able to make their own decisions?if someone dies with debt how is that applied or where does it go?  is it written off as bad debt or passed on to the beneficiaries?",0,"My father is dying and never made a will, some questions..."
"x-postso this is a really long story, but the short version is i moved into an apartment in january and the situation with the landlord went south real quick. turns out she's senile and/or in the developing stages of dementia/alzheimer's and she's literally impossible to deal with. so after a few months of living in constant fear of being seen coming and going (she lives next door...) and sparking a confrontation that inevitably led to police coming and the entire neighborhood coming out to watch the fireworks, shit hit the fan in a big way this past monday and we bailed.so i leave work early and get to the apartment and the situation escalated from an 8 to about 100 as soon as her and her (equally out-of-her-mind) daughter see me. they call the police, say that nobody gets to take any of their stuff unless i leave (the reason why they hate me is the long part of the story) so out of deference to my friends i bail. i was told to come back and get my stuff when everybody else was done, so i enlisted a few friends and we did just that. when we were about to leave the situation went sour, police were called, i was bit twice, punched probably 20+ times by this little old lady. it was ugly. the police, obviously tired of having to deal with this crazy old woman and her bullshit, picked that exact moment to become ambivalent towards the whole situation. i was forced to take all of my property, put it back in the house, and was told that if i wanted it i'd ""just have to take her to court."" i've since been back to the police office twice and am met with at best indifference, but more commonly outright hostility at the nerve i have coming in there and thinking that i have a right to my own property. so obviously the police have no interest in helping me, and if i actually have to take my landlord to court to get my stuff back it's going to end up in a landfill before i ever see any of it again. most of it i couldn't care less about, all of my clothes have been at my girlfriend's for a while but there is some stuff with a lot of sentimental value attached to it that i'll never be able to replace and that's the stuff i really care about.reddit, what do i do?",0,"Landlord is holding my property hostage, police couldn't care less.

"right now i'm terrified for my father, sister, and mother (they all live together) because of covid-19 and my father's stubborn refusal to exercise basic hygiene. this has been a problem long before the corona virus reared it's ugly head. but it's especially bad now because my sister has to yell at him and endure a huge fight simply to get him to wash his hands before eating dinner (he'll argue that he already washed them just an hour ago). and he complains about being ""ordered around"" when my mom and sister insist on him washing up when he returns from an outing to the doctor (thankfully, that is the only time he leaves the house because his physical condition makes going out difficult). so now i'm afraid to even go to their house because i'm pregnant and scared of catching the virus.&amp;#x200b;i had been mulling over finding a way to see if he needs to be committed due to his issues long before the covid-19 risk (i suspect that some of his behavior might be the early signs of dementia and/or other mental decline). but i wonder if i should try to get it done asap because his childish refusal to wash up regularly is putting himself and others at risk (my mother has a lung condition and is cleaning like a madwoman with ocd to compensate for my father's carelessness). and, if i did seek out resources from somewhere like adult protective services, will they be too overburdened by the covid-19 crisis to help?&amp;#x200b;i honestly don't expect anyone to have a clear answer. i just wanted to vent and see if anyone else here was struggling with an elderly relative who is refusing to adhere to basic hygiene/safety protocols in order to protect themselves and their family from this virus",0,Struggling with Father's hygiene issues

"hey everyone, this post is about my dad he’s currently 68 years old and this week has been a rollercoaster. my dad has always been normal and has never had any issues as far as memory loss but as of lately he’s been forgetting things. now he hasn’t been  diagnosed yet but i’m taking him to a doctor  asap. i’m 25 years old and i lost my mother to cancer already and i can’t fathom the idea of my dad not recognizing me anymore! this week he has gotten into two car accidents(fender benders)  in the same day(my dad lives in ny with his wife and i  live in nj) and that was very odd and then another issue is that he’s forgetting where my aunt lives and he owns two homes in ny and nj. another issue that i noticed is that he’s splurging on things and forgetting that spent bought them; my dad has already spent over 12k and paid 6k for the accidents that he caused. i’m just very scared of the idea of my dad not being well, i lost one parent already and i can’t imagine losing my dad to this!!! please i’m just looking for answers. is there a way to prevent dementia from getting worse?! how do i cope with this!",1,1,Guys I’m literally freaking out and don’t know what to do!

"so here's the summary of the situation:* dad (80s) has late stage dementia. he is able to walk and eat by himself but that will end likely in the next few months. he has no other major health issues.* my mom (70s) is his primary caretaker, but she has back and other physical problems and can't really lift anything more than a few lbs.* life savings were destroyed before we discovered what was going on.* on paper, they make good incomes. however because of bad management for the past 10-15 years and some ill-conceived purchases/debts, about half of it has to go into fixing problems, so the amount left for spending is ok, but not great. they make well above what the medicaid limits are in our state.* the income sources and assets are all mixed together with both their names on most of it. so any kind of asset sale would be enormously complicated and the leftover situation would be bad for my mom after he's gone.* he does not do well outside of the home. he gets extremely stressed out and basically stops eating. i have no doubt placing him outside his home would kill him.ideally we'd like to keep him at home but my mom is not capable of lifting him or doing the physical work that we know is to come. i found out that medicare will not cover home bound care unless they need a skilled professional or therapy (which he doesn't. he will just needs help moving around, bathing, feeding, etc). medicaid is out of the picture because they just make too much.right now we have a part-time home health aide for a few hours a week but the amount of hours that will be needed will quickly overwhelm the finances and deplete the savings in a few months. i've talked to local resources but overall it comes to the same problems: he's too healthy physically, they make too much money for aid, but out of pocket expenses are too much. making him a ward of the state also seems like a bad idea due to the mixed assets and the loss of control.i've gone through old posts but didn't see anything that pertained directly to this situation. am i missing something? has anyone else gotten benefits for this kind of situation? we simply need home health aides for several hours a day. we don't need anything else.",1,0,Assistance available in this case?
"hi, my dad is 76 and was diagnosed a couple of years ago with dementia. i believe it was in the early stages at the time. he has recently begun to be somewhat delusional, telling me that someone was stalking his wife and that the police were called. he also believes the stalker is lurking around the house. none of this is true. the situation is very complicated because his wife is much younger and their marriage is also on the rocks. she would clearly prefer it if he were in a home of some sort. his finances are a mess and i'm not sure what he will be able to afford. i live in a foreign country and i am not in a position to help him financially. i don't have a clear question for you... basically i'm just really worried for him and dealing with a lot of complicated emotions around this. i do have one question no one will be able to answer, which is how long he likely has left. i am not actually asking this of you people... it's just the question on my mind. my dad has made some serious mistakes in his life with the way he has treated people and other really bad decisions, so i am feeling a lot of resentment as well, but i can't direct that at him (couldn't talk to him about this stuff even when he was healthy). sorry for venting... i'm just feeling really sad and scared for him. thanks for being here.",1,1,New to this whole thing and really freaked out

"hey, all  my mom was diagnosed with dementia a year ago, i am her caretaker. as you can imagine it's been very difficult.  mom has her annual follow-up with her neurologist tomorrow, and it's been really trying for the both of us. she doesn't remember having the mri that lead to her diagnosis, and some days she accepts and knows she has dementia, and others she denies that anything is wrong.  she doesn't understand why she must see a neurologist, nor does she like him.  she sees him as ""the man who took away her driver's license"" and feels everyone is against her. it's heartbreaking.   i do my best to explain in simple terms what lead to her getting an mri, that she did, in fact,  have one done, and why her license was taken from her (i don't blame anyone, i blame the 'system' since then no one person is the bad guy). if i let it, it could turn into a circular argument, but i switch to empathy and letting her know that it must be very hard for her to go through.   the only thing that has been a relief is that it's a phone appointment and not in-person because of covid, and though she doesn't love the idea, she's glad she doesn't have to go in person. she's really agitated about the whole neurologist situation.   does anyone have any pointers for this? god, i hate this disease. :(",1,1,Tomorrow is Mom's Neurologist Appointment

"i'm about to write to the va, but need advice, especially from people familiar with the va. main question: for ftd patients mobile and mostly physically healthy, how can you get more home aide care hours of watching them, if your local va clinic says your at the max? (obviously cheaper for va to pay for than alf's!)* i'm thinking of trying to do that and get 4 full days a week of home aide help (is now 8 hours), and maybe adding locks to the doors so my dad can't sneak out when we're in the bathroom. my mom is so stressed from caregiving that she said to research alf's, but i think this plan would relieve us enough to keep him home. my intuition tells me the alf would be bad, and trying adult day cares was awful, they upset him and he refused to do anything but try to escape and run home.* background: my sweet dad is 100% disabled veteran, 62, supposedly all his health care should be taken care of for free now. the va reasoning my mom cited is that he can do most ""normal activities of living"", he just needs to be supervised because he likes to go out of the house walking, 3x a day and obsessively say prayers at different neighbors lawn statues, crossing a main road often too. i try to always jump up when he heads to the door and walk with him so i know he's safe. (no issues getting lost, always goes the same route, knows how to get everywhere/home, careful around cars) he has to be cooked for, and cannot say many sentences anymore, or express himself well.* so he has to basically be monitored all day. my mom's taken great care of him the last 3 years, but the stress of this is destroying us health wise, we both developed high cortisol, auto-immune diseases, failing thyroids, anxiety disorders, went from healthy weights to obesity (despite working out and eating very healthy!). and he treats her like a piece of furniture mostly while hugging me every day, so extra heartbreak for her.the other day she developed a scary sounding cough, and i decided she can't do this anymore (even with me giving her time off 3 days/wk) i cannot lose her too and be alone in the world with no family (kind of selfish, yea).* [fyi: if everyone thinks ""va just won't give you more hours, only a nursing home"", i will simply visit my senator to change it. i am an activist thanks to my dad's influence and will not accept va status quo anymore]any advice welcomed!!",1,0,"Dad with Semantic FTD, how to get more weekly home aide care hours using VA insurance?"

"hey folks. not sure if this topic has ever been discussed on this sub but i'd like to share our experience. i'm 57, caregiver to my wife. she's 58 yoad diagnosed in 2008. we have 2 caregivers with her while i work a 40-hour work week. one quit a few months ago - lately my wife has fits of mania, totally uncooperative, aggressive, etc. the intensity of this has increased over the past few months and it cost us a caregiver. through it all i've been trying various meds prescribed by her neurologist. seroquel, lexapro, xanax, etc. nothing worked - seroquel makes her damn-near homicidal. neurologist say to up her dose. total idiot. so medical marijuana was legalized in massachusetts awhile back. i recall my daughter mentioning ""we should try that on mom"". i laughed it off. with all the recent turmoil though, my daughters devised a plan to conduct an experiment with some cannabis candy. long story short:  game changer. wife is calmer but not whacked-out stoned. her cognitive ability has improved - i shit you not. just little things but it's improved. easier to manage, pleasant and, most importantly, she's reasonably happy most of the time. yeah, we're all making the obvious jokes (grateful dead, tie dye shirts, yada, yada, yada) but the fact it this has eased both our burden and her burden. i've always rolled my eyes at the mention of ""medical"" marijuana - condemning it as just another way for stoners to legally get high. drastically revised that thinking as of late. this is not a commercial for marijuana law reform - i'm just sharing my experience with the hope that it might help someone else. also, please don't think i'm advocating some kind of fish-oil-like cure here. this is all about managing her care, nothing more. i would be very interested in hearing other folks experience with this. thanks for listening.",1,0,Medical Marijuana

"a lot can change in a day. doctors believe my 69 year old father has ftd with als. over the past 10 or so years my father has had difficulty walking and taking care of himself that has gotten progressively worse. it started with just walking issues and discomfort but has evolved into his fine motor skills being almost completely gone now. his personality has changed a little over this time, too, but it’s been so gradual you almost don’t notice it. although, one noticeable thing is that he has become exceptionally sexually preoccupied and obsessed with right wing politics. what a combo, right? we were always pretty close and opted to live together about 2 years ago before i had any idea that there was a serious illness at play. in these 2 years, my father has declined to the point of losing any interest in showering or doing anything but watching tv and ordering doordash. he’s fallen multiple times, but it got worse about 5 days ago. i knew i could no longer have him at home — it was unsafe. the hospital admitted him and seemed annoyed that i brought him in since he was oriented and had normal lab values. eventually the doctor spoke to me and gathered more information about what had happened. i was feeling good that answers would be coming and my dad could be somewhere where he was looked after. it had been about 36 hours since i last visited him when i arrived this morning. what i saw was shocking. my father had lost the ability to answer most questions due to his inattention and distractibility. he had a flat affect and blank look in his eyes. after talking with a neurologist and psychiatrist, the diagnosis points to ftd and als. this acceleratingly rapid decline has me shaken. i’m still processing everything, and i just hope my father finds peace soon.",1,1,Frontotemporal Dementia and ALS

"i'm sitting down to write this because this journey is nearly ending and i had a breakdown discussing things in our imminent future: obituaries, funerals, blessing of the sick, last rites, etc. my grandmother is basically in the active phases of dying. it's been a little less (or about) 4 years since she was originally diagnosed but i truly think she might have had signs since 2012-2013 and was able to hide them. i remember her casually mentioning to my dad that she had once driven by the house 4 times because she couldn't recognize the house. this was far before we had a diagnosis. just my thoughts: i think one of the biggest things that didn't happen that i always heard happened was forgetting loved ones. she did forget the names of loved ones she hadn't seen in years or that weren't around much, but she never forgot my mom, sister, i or her sister that lives up here's name. she had blips where she would stumble over her sister's name but that's about it.declining wasn't linear....some things happened at a faster pace than others. for example, her ability to coherently put together sentences dropped very quickly whereas her motor skills were okayish for a long while. however, it seems when something fell off, it just went down to damn near bottom before leveling out for a while. dementia seems to be a long, slow mourning process. knowing that my grandmother's days are numbered, knowing she may not make it to next week hurts. i don't want to do anything at all but i can't stand seeing her like this. her breathing is irregular, she can't eat/drink/etc. she's sleep most of the time. unable to speak well. this is the opposite of what she used to be, who she used to be. however, while it hurts, i've mourned what will never be and what has been lost since her diagnosis. i knew the outcome but am far from prepared. i feel numb and scared but that's death i suppose. feelings, sicknesses, etc are more pronounced in dementia patients. utis can completely change a dementia patient until it has cleared. same with dehydration, or mental, physical, emotional stressors. when my mom got sick, my grandmother became a bit more withdrawn, concerned about my mom even if she couldn't properly verbalize it. finally (for now): while the person i once knew has long been gone, pieces of that personality came out every now and again and made me smile. those times where she showed that strong maternal instinct she always had make me feel a bit warm and at home. i don't have anyone to talk to so i put this here. i wish i could wake up and this be a bad dream. wake up to my grandmother cooking breakfast and drinking some coffee. go back pre-diagnosis, pre-dementia. hell, right now, i'd go back to a few months ago to her just calling someone in the house just to say she didn't need anything. i was blessed with this grandmother and man is it going to hurt knowing she's no longer here. i pray a cure is found so no more people have to suffer through this shit. never in my wildest dreams could i imagine this happening to our family.",1,1,Our journey through dementia....
"for no reason at all. my grandmother has had dementia for several years now but we’ve been lucky for the most part. it’s been shitty of course but in comparison to other accounts i have read or heard, i know it could be so much worse. in the last few weeks my grandmother has been telling my mom she’s depressed and sad. we’ve always had our off days or couple of days here and there. but in the last week, everything sets her off and makes her angry.  any simple thing you say to her will be responded to as though you have been whining about it incessantly and pestering her to the point of bursting. i have always been the one that said getting upset doesn’t help anything and to just try and be patient. silly little fool i was, that was before she was being downright mean and it’s like a switch has flipped. mom and i attended a caregiver support group yesterday because of how much this switch flip has gotten to us. there i learned that dementia can change on a dime. so this might just be the way it is now. i suppose i’ll get the hang of dealing with that, but god fucking damn it i’ve just been so hurt and angry at how she has been that i was the one to lash out just now and get her upset when it might have been fine otherwise. i’m so fucking angry at myself. i’m ashamed of the way i’m short tempered and miserable at home and then i go to work and chit chat and be charming with customers both nice and difficult, and i can’t maintain the same facade at home. my grandmother used to be my best friend. i constantly tell myself it’s a monster controlling her brain like some sci-fi movie. all medical science and logic and common sense obviously tells you it isn’t her acting that way and saying these things, and it isn’t what she wants but she can’t help it. but my monster visualization has not stopped me from letting my feelings get hurt and fighting back, which as we all know, there’s no point. it gets to all of us in the house so much. it would be in everybody in this household’s best interest if i could just be patient and be the one to brush everything off and be positive, even in the face of the most difficult challenges dementia may present us with. i could be the one to pull us all up by our bootstraps and diffuse things. people say that’s not realistic to be always patient and positive but to those people i want to say “you don’t know, it has to be done”. but i haven’t done it, and i’m feeling pretty selfish.  so now i’m just sitting here wallowing in self loathing, and all i could think of was to just write it out to whoever is listening here. just needing to vent. trolls, please leave me alone.",1,0,I just lashed out.

"my mother-in-law has this dreaded disease and she opted to go to assisted living in a rage, some years ago. she got tired of us asking her if she was alright because of how much she was struggling with everything. before that she had been living with us and getting progressively worse, not eating on her own, just laying about and very fixated on things she wanted us to do or get for her. my wife mentioned how needy she was to her mom one day and her mom flipped and started calling assisted living places on her own.now, she's been there for several years, in a very good place and they are great with her. she gets her diet needs seen to, gets her meds (this was a big issue when with us, she would forget and double up or just not take them) and they have all kinds of stuff for her to do, even in the pandemic.all the time, still, she calls and says that she thinks that she can go live in the houses on the property, where older folks live without assistance. she misses cooking, being free to do what she wants, etc.she keeps saying that she's in prison and that my wife put her there. these outbursts are happening more and more.this time, she wants a new chair, so my brother-in-law opted to buy her one. he's been researching it but apparently taking too long. so she (mil) calls my wife and asks what's taking so long. then she goes into her routine about how she can be living in unassisted housing and that the doctor said she's fine to do that.aside: when she was diagnosed, and then rediagnosed there were about 10 years in between. when we got the official diagnosis, it was recommended that we move her, because it would get harder and harder for her. she thinks every time she goes to get a physical that she's being reevaluated and rediagnosed and if she gets some answers right on her test it means that she doesn't need to be in assisted living, anymore.back to our regular story:so she calls my wife and blasts her because she doesn't know or care about how bad she's been getting and my wife takes it personally. basically neither of her siblings answer when she calls or do much to help. mil takes it out on us and lately, she's been brutal. she called one day while we were driving back from helping move one of our kids and since we were almost having fun, she belted out one of her classics about how we could have fun and she was stuck in prison.once in a while, her being upset, especially in this new and dreaded pandemic, i get it. you feel cooped up, and we do too. but turning her rage on the one daughter that does everything, and being so brutal and making it as though we've had her incarcerated is awful. my wife feels the guilt. she knows her mom needs to be in there. she can't do her own meds, she can't remember anything. she gets fixated on certain things (chair) she can remember and then harps on it to anyone who will listen. but my wife just feels so bad and so, she takes it personally. she knows her mom has to be there, but she can't just let it bounce off and ignore it or hang up.i feel helpless to help her, because for me, it would be different. i won't put up with that shit. i will tell it like it is and that's maybe mean or cruel. when she was with us and would harp on something, i would keep a tally and show her: ""you've asked me about this 7 times, today."" she'd get abashed and stop for a while. it wasn't to be mean, but it helped both of us.i suggested printing out the doctor's ruling that says she  needs to be there (assisted living) and having it framed and when her mom freaks out, show it to her, like some dick version of the notebook.i just get so tired of her being treated this way when she's done so much.",1,0,Brutal treatment of my wife

"hello.to begin - whoever you are, if you are within this virtual community, i truly send you my love. this is a vile disease to navigate for all involved. i come seeking advice. here is some information that, while i apologize for ranting, hope helps give you the best idea possible of my family's situation...my mother (72 years old) was diagnosed several months ago with a yet-to-be-finalized type of dementia, still in its earlier stages. my father died without warning this past june due to pe after major surgery so it's been a hectic and difficult year. i am the youngest (30) of my siblings and while they have been doing a lot, i have taken lead with her mental health and overall well-being. her main symptoms are mild memory issues, trouble focusing at times and she has difficulty with speech, especially when she is anxious or feels the need to ""perform"". she does not slur words nor does she ever simply stop talking - her issue is getting the words out (she expresses that it feels like the words are trapped in her mind). once prompted or guided, she can complete her thought. this gives her a lot of anxiety. she has no issues with balance or movement nor has she had any hallucinations or severe ""episodes"", yet. she is still pretty active (does laundry, cooks her own meals, for the most part, does work in the garden, washes her own dishes, etc) and stays relatively social. she has been taking donepezil and began speech/cognition therapy about 12 weeks ago. i am not sure if the speech therapy is doing a great deal but she enjoys going/likes her speech therapist. if nothing else, it's additional socialization and gives her a bit of independence that she likes (she does not drive anymore but rather a county-sponsored service picks her up and brings her home, door to door). said van service can also take her to other appointments if need be or even grocery shopping. we have a raz cell phone for her that both tracks her and gives her security of calling pre-programmed numbers (me, my siblings, close friends, etc) if there was an issue while outside her house. my brother lives with her (he has his own health issues so they benefit from having each other) but she can handle herself without issue if left on her own for days at a time if need be (we would never allow that, but i state this to stress she is not a danger to herself or others at this stage). **with that info done...here is my question:** while we have things under control now and could handle this for years and years i know it will, someday, get worse. i am simply seeing if anyone out there has any advice for me and my family at this stage.is there anything you wish you had done to better prepare your loved one / the family? are there any more progressive or unique types of therapy that you have seen help? anything you wish to offer in terms of practical advice?",1,0,What you wish you knew...

"my mother was officially diagnosed with alzheimer's just over 2 years ago. my dad passed away in 2014 and my mom lived alone in an appartment within walking distance from myself and my sister. while we noticed a gradual decline my mom still had a great quality of life. she spent 4 days a week at daycare in a nursing home, which she loved. they went on daytrips, shopping, to a garden center or the market and even to the christmas circus in 2019. my mom no longer cooked but still managed to prepare microwave meals. she couldn't do a weekly grocery shop so i did that for her. she forgot to clean but she got a cleaning help 3 hours a week. and while we mourned the mother we were slowly losing, we still had her around and were still able to visit and have a chat.two weeks ago wednesday the nursing home called to tell me my mother was short of breath and was running a mild fever and i had to come get her. my sister was able to get her tested that evening and the next day we got the result that she tested positive for corona.we have no clue where she got it. could be anywhere, since my mom never remembered to wash her hands regularly.from wednesday to monday my sister and i visited her several times a day each to care for her. we were given a huge box with protective gear to use on ourself but it wasn't enough since last week my sister got sick and tested positive, and in turn infected her husband and youngest teen son, oldest son still pending. i've been tested 3 times now, all negative.anyway, my mom had high fevers for days and eventually breathing got even more difficult and on monday our family doctor decided to send her to the hospital for oxygen and fluids. it was decided by a doctor there that my mom wouldn't be sent to the icu should her condition worsen, because she wouldn't be able to go through the rehabilitation process following intubation because of her alzheimer's. we agreed with that. she was allowed 1 visitor once a day and since my sister was sick i was in and out of the hospital all week. at first she was very ill, and we realized there was a very large chance covid might kill her. my mom is 77, has survived cancer and is a smoker. but what do you know, fysically she recovered somewhat. she still was weak and needed some oxygen but the fever passed and she seemed to do better.on monday i got some videochats going with some of her cousins whom she's always been close with. and while she was convinced she wasn't sick and she didn't have a clue where she was, she was still able to have a chat and she was lively. untill she wasn't. over the past week her alzheimer's seems to have progressed a year's worth or even more. she no longer understands where she is or why, she didn't recognize her own brother when he visited, she had a huge problem talking and forming coherent sentences, and worst of all, she was no longer able to swallow food or water.this afternoon we had a talk with the doctor there (my sister via video chat since she is still too sick to travel, no matter how much she wanted to be there), and we all concluded that my mom's quality of life was no longer there and that there was no hope of that improving in any significant way.the only solution was giving her food through a tube up her nose but she keeps pulling out her oxygen so we doubt she would accept such a thing, not to mention that it would only prolong her suffering at this point. so we have decided, with the agreement of the doctor, to seize all attempts at feeding her.this afternoon, right before the meeting with the doctor, her condition had worsened so much i was genuinely convinced for a second that i had entered the wrong room, because i didn't recognize her. she did still recognize me for a moment, mask and all, and whispered my name but that is the only coherent thing she said.i am still in shock how fast this virus has turned my mom into an advanced stage alzheimer's patient. how she went from still living on her own to no longer being able to speak and swallow in the span of two weeks. since the start of this pandemic my sister and i have been very worried about my mom catching the corona virus because she's such a high risk case, but we never could have imagined how this horrible virus could end things for my mom.i'm still mostly in shock. tomorrow we're talking with the hospital to get her out of there, maybe to a hospice or even back to her home since she is now officially corona free, so we can make her final days more comfortabele, since that is all we can do now, aside from waiting for the end.",1,0,Fast mental decline due to covid-19 in mother with Alzheimer's

"i had been trying to figure out a way to get her into assisted living as 40 hrs/week with a caregiver wasn't enough. then, three weeks ago my alzheimer's mother fell and was taken to the hospital (she's ok). i used this opportunity to get her into assisted living. the place is basically a studio apartment, with her own bed/furniture and private bath.the move was quick, and i packed as much of her stuff as possible. i'm in the house a few times a week trying to clean it out for it's eventual sale. her clothes that didn't make the move are still there. the transition has been tough, and she's been threatening to run-away (which will be impossible). and she's refusing to leave her room to socialize.she says that she has a list of things she absolutely needs, but won't show me the list. and that she must go into her closet to see what clothes she needs. i've offered to grab *anything* she asks for, but she's becoming heated about it. she wants to go into \*her\* home and grab \*her\* things.

"some background. my dad has had parkinson disease for around 9 years, he was only 60 and in the last two was diagnosed with parkinson related dementia. he is in the late stages, lives in a nursing home and he struggles to know who we are. now and again he references family/friends names and things that have happened in the past.  he knows my face as 'margaret' we presume it is his cousin margaret he is remembering.  i visit my dad once a week and sometimes will bring my children along. they have never known papa before illness. so have grew up visiting him with no expectation of him doing papa stuff and always know papa as unwell. i feel personally i have dealt with my dads illness pretty well.  i've worked in a gp practice for 15 years and over the years have dealt with numerous wee patients that have become demented and as heart breaking as it is i've always felt toughened with regards to illness. i recently got married with no frills. i only told my mum and my husband told his patents, no one else knew. out of respect and the fact he is my dad my husband wanted to tell him and i guess in a way get his permission. he was having a good day when we told him although he still didn't remember i was his daughter. but he asked about honeymoons etc.  fast forward to our first visit after we got married,  me my husband and our six year old went to visit. he was sitting on his usual chair in the tv room and as i walked in did my usual greeting.  i had a can of juice in my hand for him and his first reaction was to grab it off me. i told him to hang on till i opened it and as i began opening it he was still grabbing it and angrily saying give me it. so that was a little upsetting but not  anything i hadn't dealt with before. we pulled our chairs in. my son's birthday had been the day before we got married so i say to my son tell papa it was your birthday.  so he tells him and my dad just looks right through him and draws his eyes off him.  i don't know if it was the incident with the stupid can that added to my emotions but for the first time i cried while in his company. i got up from the chair and went to look out the window. my husband continued to chat to him but my six year old came up beside me and asked if i was ok. i smiled and said yes i was just a bit upset. he then continued to say you know papa isn't well mummy, his brain is all confused, it's not his fault. i hugged my wee boy that seemed too wise for his years. here was me crying like a baby and having my child comfort me by mimicking the words i say to them after every visit.  my husband mentioned we got married but he wasn't for chatting. he seemed frustrated and angry so we cut the visit shorter than normal.the reason for posting this is can any one offer advice? should i call him by his name instead of dad? he  seems to respond to his name every time. should i keep taking my children to visit? he has never shown any kind of relation to them and the kids normally end up wandering around the home chatting to the other residents. i just feel this is not my dad now and each time i visit i'm left a little more disheartened.  i wouldn't wish dementia on my worst enemy.",1,0,A recent visit to my dad left me upset (advice appreciated)

"its been 3 years since my father's diagnose. he is 65 only. i am so sorry he never had the chance to live his 60's he went from 60 to 80 years old.its been downhill since then, he is on some medications to chill him a bit and get better sleep. i have been noticing he is beginning to have some kind of mild hallucinations. last night he woke up in the middle of the night asking my mom why there was a person there and why they were in the kitchen while such person is just a frame above the bed of leaves and they have been sleeping in my room as they are staying this week in my place and i will return with them to their home for some weeks.he is quiet most of the time, interactions have decreased significantly in the past months. i mean, he is not able to make a coherent phrase anymore. he stutters some words and its difficult to understand what he is saying, when he does sometimes comes from a weird observation, like trying to relate the tv controller with a little monkey there. nonsense.its clear he is losing his consciousness day by day. at least here he is not wandering that much anymore, he sits or lays in the couch and stays there. his eyes...his eyes are lost in space. he doesn't hear or understand clearly when someone is addressing to him and he needs help to conduct him where he needs to go. he is totally dependent in everything, even baths he can't do it properly in his own. this wasn't happening when i last saw him in january. sometimes i wonder if he is becoming blind because he cant see the most obvious things. my apartment is small, like 570 sq feet, two rooms and a bathroom between, he always misses the bathroom. he goes all the way to the laundry area or one of the rooms to pee. obviously the bathroom is damn small, and he is still not sure where to pee and even aimed with his hands to be sure pointing it to the side of the toilette. how is that possible...its depressing...very depressing. i feel some guilty for choosing to stay in the city while my parents and my brother (27, i am 28) lives 1 hour drive (i don't own vehicles so i cant visit them that often, i intend to do so soon  as long as i find some way or even save to buy a motorbike). i mean, wfh since the pandemic hit and living by myself for 5 years now, i have choose this life before his disease so i could gain some independence and find my own way and to be not a burden for them, i have a girlfriend i want to marry soon so i need to build my life and not worry my mom, i guess its the right thing? if she needed my help she might ask, and  i am glad my brother lives there to help them out. as i see them every 2 months, this means i only see frames of my fathers illness and its always getting  worse. my mom and brother are not that shocked as i am because they are there. my mom has been dealing better now, she has accepted that correcting him will not help, just comply and chill him when asking about going home or seeing his wife or dead relatives.he is not able to recognize any of us. i wonder what goes through his head...i needed to offmychest this because as much as i try to accept this as life the way it is and this is just one way to die, when i stop to think about it i just want to cry and i do sometimes, a little, because we need to keep going. i feel bad because we werent really close all of our lives. i mean, he was always there and provided us all, he did a wonderful job as father, we just didnt click when we grew up so our relation were just ok enough, i wish we had way more father-son moments as i see others doing. now its too late. however, i am glad i see a lot of in me from him, i am a fraction of the men he was and i am glad for that.as if the disease is not enough to burden us all we need to mind and deal with the judicial matters and battle for the right to not pay irs anymore. so sorry...we are no that religious but i know he had faith in god as i do, and i am glad i once asked him if he believed in god ans jesus christ as his savior and he does. so i know he is going to be saved and go to heaven peacefully. i don't pray a lot...once in a while but when i do i always ask him to relief my father's pain and give peace in his heart, the same for us and strength to deal with all that, i feel better afterwards and thats the way he have been living.i wish you all the best dealing with this. you are not alone",1,1,Hallucinations and venting
this is a definitely a very sensitive subject and i don't mean to bring up things that will upset anyone. i just had some questions about alzheimer's and the stages and when did your loved one pass.i have a very large family my grandmother has a lot of kids and a million grandkids. so there is definitely a lot of hands in the cookie jar. i am the who lives with my grandma as her primary caretaker. according to the fast alzheimer's scale my grandma is at 6c. she has been progressing fast since my grandfather has passed away. there is definitely a disagreement in my grandma time left and how it should be handled. some people think she only has weeks to months. she has recently fallen and broke ribs and now has pneumonia. so she is definitely struggling now and i know with anyone she could pass at anytime. but i believe she will beat this and recover. things i read and see saying people can live a long time in the 6 category and even awhile in 7 on scale. sensitive part could you tell me on what part of stage did your loved one past and was it complications or other medical factors or dementia related. thank you,1,0,Sensitive subject (sorry)

"okay, i am really fighting hard to cope with my dad's early stage of alzheimer's. it isn't that bad compared to others. but, my dad keeps forgetting minor things, to a point where now it's costing me and my family money (more on that later). and on top of that, my dad is a really stubborn guy. i can say both those two don't make a good mix from my experience.due to his condition, he can't exactly maintain a steady job. so its pretty much my mom and me being the primary provider for now. my dad who works in it still gets jobs here and there, but its more contract-based, and mostly lasts 3 months.now, let me get to the part where it's costing our family money.but, let me first say this.. like i said before, my dad's condition isn't that bad, and i feel really bad for him. but,  its coming to a point of just pure frustration for me at least on my part.coming to a point where our house kitchen was almost fully burned down twice. once was our stove being totaled, 2nd time half the kitchen was burned down, and my dad was told by my mom multiple times to not use the stovetop, but did it anyways.now when it comes to whatever is left in our family savings just about a month ago my dad lost 1grand due to some miss placement of his certain investments that he can't remember. my dad didn't give me enough details because of his stubbornness. i could easily come up with couple of pages to what else my dad lost money-wise, and important items like a passport to his driver license due to this condition, but what happened in the last week or two kinda made me lost my anger.and today.... well... i almost lost it today where i had to walk out the house cause of how angry i got. today my mom left about 80dollars in front of my door to do some grocery shopping. i was sick all day, and was in my room just resting.as of right now, my parents is in the process of selling our house, so my dad can sorta retire and not worry about any debts, and of course, it will help his medical situation. that being said, we kinda hired these handymans to repair certain parts of our house in order to put it in the market so it can sell for a better price.so long story short, my mom left money for me to which my dad kept the money in front of my door and of course my dad not walking with these handymen, and forgetting that my dad left cash in front my door, like 100% for sure these crooks/handyman took the money, who i didn't know was going to show up today.i mean... i know it's only $80dollars, but just something triggered in me that got me really frustrated at my dad, when you also add all the incidents he did in the past. i had to walk outside just to vent my frustration cause of what my dad did. it was just one too many incidents that caused me to kinda lose my anger.another reason why i lost my anger today, cause just last week my dad gave someone $100 something dollars to replace our mid size fridge at our basement, to which my dad gave it to this one handyman who ofcourse didn't show up with our replacement fridge. this didn't have to do with his mental condition (or maybe it kinda does), but just adds up when my dad makes all these decisions combine with his alzheimers.my mom keeps telling my dad to be more careful with our financial situation, but he keeps forgetting minor and simple things, which causes our family to lose money. like i feel bad for my dad, but same time really frustrated cause he just won't listen most of the time.not sure what else to do, cause i know alzheimers is nothing you can solve in one day, but not sure if there are some sorta routines or medication. i know my dad takes some sorta medication, but ofcourse he won't give me the details.but, as of right now, i am kinda losing it. cause mom does make more money than me, and she works in the child daycare field. her, health isn't doing any better due to her age catching up. but, seeing money being lost by my dad, that's being hard-earned by mom is really hard to see. my dad didn't lose like all our savings or anything like that. but, just these incidents kinda adds up and doesn't make our already financial situation any easier.i thank you for reading this lengthy help i guess you can say. not sure if there is some sorta help group of sort that can help my dad's routine on not forgetting things and i guess not being stubborn is another source of method to fix i guess. but, just really hard to cope with, especially when my parents are in a tough financial situation.",1,1,"I AM NOT sure what to do with my dad's what seems early stage of Alzheimers, leading me to great frustration!"
"i (26f) am in the middle of moving my father (66m), fiancé, and i to our new house 3 hours away. using poa i sold our existing house. the past 1-2 weeks has been the absolute busiest ever; finishing up all the documents to close on the new house, setting up/shutting off utilities, running errands galore... and all that work has gone completely unappreciated by my father. i get that he has to move out of a home that’s been in the family since the ‘60s and how he could be attached to it in ways i don’t understand. that’s to be expected.what wasn’t expected was him screaming at me that he hates all the frozen food i make him and doesn’t want me to make it for him anymore. the thing is, he’s been eating it for months and liked it until now, usually he wouldn’t even know a meal was frozen unless i told him. i barely know how to cook; he’d be eating eggs and tofu stir fry over and over again if he had to rely on me making home cooked meals. he can cook, i’m ok with him cooking, it helps him maintain his independence and feel like himself, but he never makes/eats enough food and doesn’t seem to understand anymore when things go bad. i know a main reason why he’s acting like this is from not eating enough food/drinking enough water, i ask him multiple times a day “did you eat anything? are you drinking water?” - prior to the past week or two this worked well, but not so much now. thankfully starting next week i have in home help that will start coming to help with meal prep and keeping him engaged in appropriate activities. it can’t happen any sooner. i get that he (in theory) isn’t aware of what he’s doing. it’s really hard to believe that he’s not aware that saying things like “you don’t love me” several days in a row is hurtful. that and there’s been two times recently i had to leave him alone overnight, for essential trips up to the new house, and both times he went into our living area and moved things around. it has been very clearly communicated for almost, if not over a year that our living space is off-limits and he has no reason to need to be there. the first time he said he had to “feed our cat” - i left a note explaining i had friends already feeding her and he didn’t need to. that time he also helped himself to some of my rum. the second time our cat wasn’t even there so he had no excuse. he didn’t even take anything from what i can tell, but did throw two very nice sweaters and large print crosswords i got him in a pile in the middle of the floor. he obviously did that to try to make a point and get a rise out of me. through all of this, i’ve learned so much about staying calm and not indulging his anger or attempts to argue with me. if he tries to escalate, if possible, i’ll say something like “i don’t want to talk about that, is anything else on your mind?” - to which lately he says no or continues yelling at me. most recent days i’ve managed to not raise my voice at all. i’m really sick of every conversation lately ending with him saying “i’m going to talk to my lawyer” - for one, we are moving out on monday, there literally won’t be business hours before then, for two, he claims his lawyer is helping him for “free”... that’s not how ethical lawyers work. for three, without an id or access to his money (both of which i have) he isn’t going to get very far with any sort of legal proceeding. fourthly, even if he did miraculously talk to a lawyer and try to take me to court 1) wouldn’t they have to tell me? and 2) he can’t ever remember what day it is so it’s not like he’d show up to the right court date. this ended up being really long.. thank you to anyone still reading this. if anyone has also dealt with moving someone with dementia who’s easily agitated, it’d be helpful to hear your experience.",1,-1,Ah the joys of moving someone with dementia...
"tldr: too grabby to leave with nothing, don't want to have to resort to just empty plastic containers to ""play"" with.  whether we gave it to her *to* break or not-but-don't-mind-if-she-does, anything she gets her hands on that has any moving parts gets broken/ripped/shredded/written on/etc. we made her one of those ""busy boxes"" with stuff she liked in it (clothes catalogs, jewelry, a blanket, etc), and we had to choose to either replace 98% of it daily, or just give it up because when she was through with it, the magazines were written all over/pages all torn out, she fiddled with the jewelry til it broke, she either picked at the blanket or managed to find the one loose thread and it was coming unraveled. in the car she found where the seatbelt kinda doubles back on itself and makes a loop small enough to only fit one finger through and she got a fingerhold and started trying to rip the seatbelt apart. she kept pulling at the car door handle (the locks were engaged) like she was trying to just break it off. *she broke a stainless steel egg timer* (she treated it like those plastic easter eggs with candy inside and pried it apart, then complained when there was nothing inside). she's like a really destructive toddler that wants toys but when you give them to her she just breaks them and then throws a fit when you hesitate to give her anything else, because no one really has money to just throw away on stuff that's gonna get broken within it's first 10 minutes of ownership. and because of the dementia, anything you say to her about it goes in one ear and out the other (if it ever went in the one ear to begin with!), or she gets mad and cusses you out saying that everything is hers and she'll break it just because you told her not to.",1,0,"help my grandma's like a robot with only one setting: ""DESTROY"""
"my grandpa has early onset dementia and he is becoming very sexually aggressive and saying inappropriate things. for example, i don't think he realizes that it's me that he is dealing with because he grabs my butt and breasts on a daily basis. when i tell him to stop because it isn't appropriate he will say i'm not hurting you. like another words he's saying let it happen because i'm not hurting you.he also says inappropriate things and uses words that are considered racial slurs now and when i tried to tell him that you don't call people certain things anymore he got mad at me. like for example, i told him that we don't call asians oriental anymore because it's considered racist. he tried to argue with me to the point of googling it to see if he was wrong and the first thing that popped up with something saying that it wasn't racist so he went with that. i disagree.i don't know if this has to do with his military service but he is a control freak and tries to run everyone's lives. he also says things that are inappropriate, mostly about women. like for example, he will say out loud look at that woman, she's so fat. women aren't supposed to be fat. it's becoming really exhausting and frustrating and i just don't know what to do anymore.he also follows me everywhere, even to the point of trying to follow me to the bathroom. i've told him no, that it's inappropriate and he still tries to open the door. i've gotten to where i have to lock the bathroom door. i haven't had any alone time in the past month and i'm starting to go stir crazy especially with the world being on lockdown. please help. how aware is he that what he's doing is wrong? is he may be worse off than i thought or does he know what he's doing and is just using the dementia as an excuse? i'm at my wit's end.",1,0,How do I deal with my grandpa's sexually aggressive behavior?
"hello! i'm making my first visit to a new patient tomorrow, and could use some advice on how to connect with her. she is in her late 80s and has advanced dementia - she does not speak english, and even in her native tongue, her speech is nonsensical. she apparently can get quite agitated, but i've been told she responds well to having her hand held.should i try to look up some phrases in her language? or would that be confusing/unhelpful? i'm hoping that non-verbal communication (holding her hand, facial expressions) will convey the important stuff (mainly, that i'm glad to be her), but i'm willing to try anything to get on the same page with her.thank you in advance for any advice :)",1,0,Hospice volunteer with question about non-English speaking patient with dementia (x-posted to r/hospice)

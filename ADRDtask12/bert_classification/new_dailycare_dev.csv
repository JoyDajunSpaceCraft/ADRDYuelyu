"my dad has vascular dementia, and has always been very active. he no longer can work or drive but loves to walk around the small country town my parents live in- this part isn't the issue. he goes to the supermarket several times a day, i think because he feels useful if he can go for his walk and do something like bring home some milk. usually these are things the family doesn't actually need, but that's a whole other issue.  right now, it isn't safe for him to be doing this. he is very bad at keeping up his hygiene, and gets very upset and angry when we try and enforce things like this for his own good. we have tried now telling him the shops are all shut because of the virus, but obviously on his walk he forgot this and ended up at the shops anyway. so i told my mum she will just need to enforce that any items be cleaned thoroughly, she supervises him washing hands etc. but he really becomes very angry when we do things like supervise or make sure he's doing something properly, because he wants his independence and he thinks he's doing things right and doesn't need somebody telling him what to do.he has other health issues too and we are really worried, but don't know what we can do. any suggestions?",Dad loves walking and goes to the shop many times a day,0
"so, i'm likely just ranting, but this is really frustrating. last week we had a conference call with most of the family and his doctor so that we could ask questions and get advice on how best to support him and my grandmother.i asked, ""what are the traits or methods or other features of families who successfully navigate this scenario?"" i didn't get a response other than, ""we'll send a video for our caregiver 101 class since corona has california on shelter in place.""this is what they sent:                  don't bother watching it. it's 98 minutes of just 3 things:    take care of yourself first.  make a plan b so that when you are ready to give up, it's already established.  you will give up.        i fully get the depth and scope of this, but really just wanted to know what works well for people. every individual is different, but we don't even really have a list of things to try out.    so, what makes your life easier or better and what has helped bring the spark back to your loved one's life?    thanks in advance.","Frustrated with ""Dementia Caregiver 101"" video my grandfather's physician sent us",0

"hey all,just joined this sub today because i am currently the chef of a care home specializing in individuals suffering from dementia. most of our residents are in their 80s/90s, a couple in their hundreds even!, and a couple in early stages who are still in their 50s. since starting work here i have unfortunately seen first hand what a horrible disease this is. one struggle we have is getting the residents to eat. i have researched and experimented at great lengths with different foods and techniques, and have seen some improvements. these changes include serving familiar meals that they grew up with, finger foods, small portions, courses served one by one, and lots of cueing and encouragement by the care staff. but there are still some residents who no longer recognize what food is, no longer receive hunger signals from their bodies, and basically live off of supplements (boost, etc). i have watched these residents take food out of their mouths and look at it as if it's something foreign to them, then set it on a table and wander away. meanwhile losing weight day after day. i have also seen residents who haven't eaten in days finally take a few bites of food, and how it lights up their faces and moods. seeing things like that make my day.i'm reaching in hopes that someone could offer me some new tips and tricks, are you a caregiver and have you found something that works for your loved one? being a chef and having all the credentials and experience is one thing, but when it comes to this disease the best experience comes from those who deal with this disease regularly and first-hand.thanks in advance for any suggestions you may have!",Chef of care home looking for advice,0

"my current job is taking care of an elderly couple in their home. both are 89. the wife has dementia (likely alzheimer's in my opinion, but not officially diagnosed as of yet) that has been steadily progressing in the year i've been with them. she's still pretty aware, but has moments of confusion, including a consistent belief that she is in the wrong place and wanting to go home. i have plenty of experience managing these symptoms, and if it's just me and her i'm easily able to placate or redirect her before she gets upset. the problem is her husband. he is very aware with only minor lapses in short term memory, and very headstrong, which leads to him constantly arguing with her. it's an incredibly draining cycle: wife mentions wanting to ""go home tonight,"" i overhear her and start trying to change the subject, husband interrupts me to insistently tell her that they are home, have lived here for decades, she can't drive to go anywhere anyway, etc., which greatly agitates and upsets her, and i am left to deal with the fallout as she goes to bed and cries. i enjoy caring for these two, but the worse her symptoms get the more this becomes a daily occurrence, and it's making me dread coming to work in the morning. i regularly have conversations with the husband explaining the right way to handle her, and he seems to understand at the time, but the next time she says something wrong he's right back to it. it's absolutely killing me. i know it can be hard to convince older people to change in their ways, but is there anything i can do to help this man react better to his wife's dementia?",I'm about to tear my hair out.

"we're facing the following problem.my mother is recovering from a thigh fracture right now, as she cannot reliably walk on her own.she ist sitting most of the time in a chair, she cannot get out of bed.as the pain lessened, she started to walk on her own again. she fell, nothing happened. in the last year she fell about six times, nothing happened, except for bruises. the fall before that she broke her pelvis.it's only a few meters, but enough to ruin everything. in the moment, sometimes the day or the following days she's aware that she cannot and shouldn't walk alone.

"hi,i'm looking for some advice on my grandfather / dad (there is two of us here, however the grandson is typing so i'll be typing from my point of view), this is a **big post so i'm sorry** but if anyone could have a read and provide me with some advice i would greatly appreciate it!--# noticeable onsetin 2015 we started to notice that my granddad had the start of dementia/alzheimer's and we spoke to his doctor (with his wife/my nan) to make them aware and see if they could do anything but for some reason they said that they are unable to do anything or say anything to him until he asks/mentions it...# 6 months laterabout 6 months later he had a tia (transient ischemic attack) and was taken to hospital, they released him the next morning but started him on some tablets.# 6 to 12 months laterwithin the next 6 months several people like his neighbors mentioned that he is forgetting things and repeats himself lots.# other attacks &amp; hospital visits.since then, he's had a few more smaller tia's and we notice his memory is getting worse and worse, he can't remember going to the hospital in the last 5 years (even though he's been 5 or so times, twice by ambulance).# confusionhe repeats himself a crazy amount of times, even sometimes in very quick succession. he misplaces things like his keys, phone, hat, chargers... etc and gets confused with even the simplest of things that 10 years ago he would have been able to do just fine, he's broken several things lately from trying to ""fix"" them himself because he would have normally been able to fix them but now he just does things wrong.we recently installed new taps in the kitchen and bathroom and within a month he had broken the taps in the bathroom because he tried to undo them because ""they felt broken"" which is just because they are different and could be turned easily where as his old taps had broken and were pretty fused up.he purchased a new door bell recently and he brought it over unable to get it to work so he wanted me to have a look at it, he had tried to open the doorbell to fix it and had damaged all of the plastic where he was trying to push a screwdriver into it to open it up when all he had to do was pull the plastic tab (it said ""pull me out"" on it) to get the battery to connect. i let him take it home and we said we'd come and put it up on the weekend (2 days away), when we turned up he had been trying to open it up again because it ""wasn't working"", he had forgotten that he had brought it over and the only thing required was to put it up on the wall.# violence/angerhe get's quite angry when he gets confused and he's also been a little violent towards my nan by punching her on the arm on multiple occasions, we've spoken to him about this and told him that he can not do this, we've also spoken to my nan and told her not to wind him up. it starts of by him forgetting something and then my nan goes on at him over whatever it was and he gets angry and ends up being aggressive. since we spoke to her about it he has been fine as she has been doing what we told her of not making a fuss over it, just let it go even if it's very annoying.# repeating himselfspeaking to him a few days ago, he repeated the same story to us about 5 times within the space of 10 minutes. we don't bother saying anything instead we listen to the same story 5 times. he however isn't aware that he's told us.# recent scansover the past month he's also been having a few mri scans and memory tests to check for any changes with his brain, however he still doesn't really tell any of the family (or his wife) the results and probably forgets the results by the time he gets home.my granddad was spoken to on a 1 to 1 basis with my dad in the car when they were coming back from his mri scan and my granddad said that he didn't think he had anything wrong with his memory, my dad thought this was the perfect opportunity to talk to him and he told him straight up that he did believe that he though there ""was something going on with his memory"" but that there isn't anything to worry about and that he should just get on with life and enjoy himself. after he got home and my dad had left, he apparently broke down in tears and got upset over it all. we actually went down the next morning and already he had forgotten most of the previous day and didn't mention dad thinking he has something going on. i could tell him the upcoming winning lottery numbers though (he asks all the time if i can get him the winning lottery numbers as i am always able to help fix things for him) and within an hour he would have more than likely forgotten them.# getting lost...the biggest worry with him for us is him getting lost, he goes out in the car (doesn't tell anyone where he's going) and goes off at hours at a time, we don't know if he gets lost or what is going on.what we really kind of need is to get a tracker on his car/on his keys but we don't want to appear or be invasive for his privacy, the main reason we want a tracker is to make sure he's safe and ok, there's been many occasions over the last two years where it's 11 at night and he's not home after going down to the pub, he's not told his wife where he is and she obviously gets very worried, upset and scared. we have to go out and try and find him. he just doesn't understand and laughs at it every time.we noticed a note in the kitchen about a ""loan"" and we're not sure what that is about, he says he doesn't know what it was about either and we're obviously a little worried that he might be in trouble with money and also a bit worried that he seeing someone on the side (i wouldn't be surprised, likewise our nan wouldn't be surprised) and maybe giving her money (even though the money he has is equally shared between him and his wife)# taking control...we've already kind of taken some form of control by speaking to the pharmacy (with him being there) and getting agreeing that no changes to his tablets or how they are delivered can be made by him without one of us being there because he gets confused and has changed delivery of his tablets several times causing himself lots of stress, the staff at the pharmacy stress and causing himself to have to wait a few days without any tablets.# forgetting to do things like eating, brushing his teeth, wearing a coat... etche forgets to eat and has to be reminded by his wife constantly, if she was to pass away he would quickly get into a state and either not eat enough and become unwell or just get dirty because he forgets to brush his teeth (his wife reminds him every day), he forgets to put underwear on (his wife reminds him every day) and he forgets to go out with a coat on even though it's supposed to rain later on.# what next?this is

appreciated.",Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.,0

"f)so my (36f) grandmother's  (84f)  dementia has progressed aggressively in the last year, to the point that her short-term memory is pretty much gone and her long-term memory is also fading. in the last few months, especially, we've seen a lot of behavioral changes, such as sundowning, paranoia, and general nastiness toward her friends and nurses at her assisted living facility.  i've known two other people with alzheimer's/dementia and was prepared to deal with these symptoms.but she's also demonstrating a symptom i haven't seen before- not memory *loss*, per se, but memory *shift,* regarding something pretty significant. her attitude about my grandfather has dramatically shifted in the last few months, from missing him terribly (he died in 2005) to outright resentment and sometimes hatred. she won't articulate exactly why she's changed her mind so quickly, although once she did say that she felt like he'd abandoned her when he died, which i get. and while she wouldn't tell me, she's apparently divulged some disturbing things about him to my mother that are completely out of character. this man waited on her hand and foot, and neither my mom nor i can ever remember seeing him angry, let alone violent. so, i'm wondering if she has somehow conflated something she saw on tv or read in the newspaper with her own memories and that's part of this shift? in the past, she's watched a lot of cop dramas like ncis and csi, and i suspect some of this has bled into her memories as a justification for her feelings. has anyone else seen this kind of thing happen? and if so, how did you deal with it?",Memory Changes in later Dementia,0

"hi all,so my mom's boyfriend of the past almost year fell this week, and he's not doing very well. at the very least, he'll be gone for a while for medical treatment. i'm not sure how to approach the issue with her. she often retains strong negative emotions, and last time she had a depression bender of sorts, she was miserable and suffering a lot. we've framed photos of them together in her room, and my mom would pretty much spend most of her free time with the guy. a bunch of her clothes and whatnot are in his room. but she can't ever remember his name, and a few days she'd call asking who the very nice man was that seemed to know so much about her. any tips on how to handle talking about it with her? or would just not mentioning it have benefits? would taking her to visit him and continue facilitating their relationship be worth it? any advice from others who might have been in a similar situation would be appreciated.

"so just around thanksgiving my grandmother seemed fine, she knew everyone's names and outside of being a little depressed, she was excited about my sister's new baby and spend time with us.flash forward to christmas day and she actually had begun to forget who was who. she didn't know the baby was my sister's, she though we were trying to make her take care of it. it was a big commotion. we had suspected she was beginning to develop alzheimer's or dementia just because she'd ask the same questions over and over again. but it all seemed very mild. on christmas day, it's like a flip was switched.i saw a thread here asking about what tv shows to watch, but my grandmother now seems to think the tv is real life and asks about the characters on tv as if we know them. she even talks about people being in the house, even though she's actually talking about what's on tv. this has all happened very suddenly, just last month she was fine and now right around christmas something has given way and today for the first time she asked me my name and who i was, it sort of broke my heart; though i think i'm in a little less denial about how far gone she is than some in my family. even when i told her she had no idea who i was. we currently have a care taker for her; she's not in assisted living quite yet.anyhow, have any of you had similar experiences of just sudden downhill moments? is there a recovery where she'll remember me sometimes, or will it always be like this now?",New to this,0

"hi,i have a question about potential dementia as it relates to remembering recent activities/events/conversations...a close family member has what we think is probably (relatively early) dementia of some kind - has a lot of the classic symptoms and often forgets things that just happened (forgot he was at the dentist later that same day for example). often forgets recent conversations, and will ask the same questions several times within the span of a few days. recently he was in the passenger seat of the car and we were driving in an area he had been to several times in the past (though not in the last few years) and he was sure he'd never been there in his life. had no idea where he was.  all this leads us to think he has dementia.on the other hand, he will occasionally remember recent conversations, even a few weeks later. totally random and out of the blue. this sometimes makes me question whether or not it would be dementia or something else. there's no way to know for sure unfortunately as he would never agree to get evaluated by a doctor (there are issues of narcissism that prevent him him acknowledging there's ever anything wrong with him).anyway, is it normal for someone with dementia to sometimes remember recent occurrences, seemingly randomly? thank you!",Question about remembrance of recent events/conversations/etc...,0

"hello all,in short my family and i have started to notice that my grandma (84 years old) may have become slightly congitavely impared to the point we are worried she may have dementia. she retells stories and shows me things that she has told me about 3 or possibly 4 times over a period of maybe two weeks. she now struggles to drive - something she used to do a lot - and she also has trouble learning how to do new things like answer the intercom in her new flat, use her tv to surf channels (although this maybe due to her servere arthritis). she lives by herself however and manages fine. she shops, cooks, cleans, washes clothes, remembers birthdays etc etc for herself which is promising. she also has reasonably good medium term recall talking about things shes done and places shes been in the last 5 years etc.the main reason why we are now concerned is that she was recently convinced that i had never met my aunt who died from cancer \~3 years ago and tried to show me a photo of her. she lived far away when she died but had previously lived in the same town as us and i had spent plenty of time together with her in the presence of my grandma and even in my grandma's house. it was quite gut wrenching to hear her say this and i am convinced she now needs clinical assesment.i would appreciate anyone else's input and experiences, does this sound like somone suffering from the early stages of dementia? or is this just a minor episode of temporary memory loss inkeeping with someone of her age?thank you",I'm worried my Nan has dementia,0

"my grandfather suffered from dementia during the last 10 years of his life. in the period where he was still able to live independently (at home and then in sheltered housing), there was constant worry that something might happen; and regularly something did. on numerous occasions the police showed up at our door at 4am having found him wandering in his pyjamas. another time he had left the oven on and almost caused a fire, or his windows wide open when he went to bed in the evening, and once just couldn't get out of the bath but was too embarrassed to pull his alarm to call his carer and couldn't reach the phone to call us directly.thinking back on this experience and interacting with others recently it’s clear that these aren't occurrences that are unique to my personal experience with dementia. essentially, for the past few months i've been developing some technology/sensors that could allow families of dementia sufferers to non-invasively remotely monitor their relative’s environment and activity. the devices completely wireless, small, and discreet. they allow families to check up on activity or receive remote alerts to their phones if something unexpected happens at their relative’s house. they will be able to monitor and receive alerts on things such as unusual door and window activity,  temperature, humidity, and light in individual rooms. with these measurements close family members are able to be alerted if their relative has gone wandering unexpectedly, left windows open, the oven on, lights on, the bath running, etc. the sensors can even be used as a direct-to-family panic alarm or automatic fall alert if the user is willing to keep it on their person.i'd really love to hear thoughts on this, and hear about your own experiences and difficulties in caring for relatives. what day to day problems do you face that you could envisage this sort of thing solving?having been through this myself, i am very passionate about using my engineering abilities to hopefully provide solutions that could really help ease the lives of both the sufferers of dementia and their families.",I'm trying to develop some technology to help those with dementia and their families.

""who is your favorite character?"" my grandpa always asks her questions too and as a result i feel that their relationship is stronger because they are communicating a lot more! 8$ a month is a small price to pay for being able to see my grandparents happier and being able to have a nice conversation with my grandma!",Helpful tip to keep your loved one pre-occupied!,0
"first off. i thank god i was working from home today. my mom is 84. and i've suspected she has dementia from other clues (she asks the same questions repeatedly, she's forgotten how to do things she's always done, she's ""slower"" in her gait and seems constantly unsure, etc). but she has more good days than bad on average. well today i was working from home and in my den. the den is around the corner from the kitchen. my mom had gone in to make herself lunch, nothing unusual about that. the only thing i've taken over has been her medication preparation and distribution since i suspected she's forgotten to take it one day.she'd gone back to her room and i started smelling gas. she'd turn off the taps but turned it back on without letting the auto ignition click on to light the flame. if i'd have been at the office there would have been a tragedy. she could have asphyxiated (???) or could have blown up the house.my house is pretty much wallpapered in notes to keep her on track, but i'm thinking i'll be ordering an electric stove today after this scare.",Gas Stove Scare,0
"my father has mid-stage vascular dementia. last week he let uninvited cold-callers into the house when we were out food shopping. i have racked my brain trying to figure out a way to prevent this happening again, before going to the next level of hiring a homecare worker or locking him inside the house (i really don't like that option).we have thought about building a wall with door in front of the pathway to the house front door. that is the only way people can get close to the house as it is surrounded by other houses. on that door we are thinking of installing a [doorbird]( a [ring video doorbell]( or a [skybell hd](does anyone have experience with any of these products? they look interesting because we can answer the doorbell remotely via our phones, see a video of the caller, and prevent them from getting close to the house and coming into contact with my father. i think one of them even allows you to remotely open the door if you want.do you think this is a good idea?",Smarthome video doorbells for a family member w/ dementia.

"my fil was diagnosed with alcohol-induced dementia after going sober since around march of this year. i suspect there may've been subtle signs of it in a previous (unsuccessful) attempt at sobriety a few years ago, but it was a fairly brief time period, so he received no diagnosis back then. we (my so and i) have been through a whirlwind of a few months- fil had a couple stays in a behavioral unit before alcohol-induced dementia was diagnosed and since then he's been back once because of suicidal ideation and has also been diagnosed with several other major health conditions that are related to his alcohol and nicotine use. most recently, fil had a seizure (after a few days where he would barely speak to us) and was in the hospital in a sort of catatonic state for a couple weeks. since, he's been better and was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for physical and speech therapy. the facility recently had a positive covid case so we aren't able to visit fil in person, but fil is now present enough to call so a couple/several times a day and sounds astoundingly present. fil was able to point out a tiny correction that needed to be made in some paperwork were working on for the medicaid application that we would've never caught otherwise.i guess my question is - is this normal for this kind of dementia? if we don't have the medicaid app complete by the time he's released he'll be staying back with us and i know this is so hard to predict. but has anyone seen re-introduction to living with family as a positive this recently from a diagnosis for this kind of dementia? my fear is that when he was staying with us before, things always went downhill because we still have to be working full time, we can't engage with him 24/7. i know my so is getting optimistic that he'll be back to his old self soon, but i can't shake the fear that his current clarity is because he's in a place that can help and we can't rely on him staying as great as he is right now if he's back with us - where he can't get the attention and type of care he may need.","Alcohol-induced dementia, seeking advice",0

"does anyone have experience with alcohol-related dementia? my fil has had a drinking problem for years, which due to the binging nature of it, i believe has led to him not being able to form new memories. he forgets what time/day it is, can't remember simple things and forgot his wife passed away 6 years ago. that last one he was sober for and it was really strange. a week ago he fell and knocked himself unconscious, ending up in the hospital with a brain hemorrhage. he's being discharged today and has now been sober for 7 days. they've given him pills to assist with cravings, and we hope this is the last time his drinking causes further issues. now, to my actual question, would alcohol-related dementia (if that is what is going on) improve with sobriety? he is a fall risk now, and we will be keeping a close eye, but we hope that this helps him to improve cognitively if he continues to abstain. we are having him tested for any abnormalities that may indicate brain degeneration, but we're waiting on results for that. the issue we struggle with is that so many of the indicators for dementia are present in alcohol addiction, and it's really difficult to differentiate between the two.",Alcohol Related Dementia,0

"so my bf's father has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (progressive nonfluent aphasia variety). i found a memory care that was supposedly great and offered higher levels of care. his father is not aware enough to be able to make the decision to go to a memory care or not. he is having problems with normal care for himself even at this facility (note that they are charging him extra for care to help with bathing/getting dressed but its not getting done). to be honest, his father has become a bit of a problem with threatening self harming behavior and having tantrums. his doctor has said that this is possibly because of the medicine his previous doctor put him on as there isn't really a medication treatment for his type of dementia. the problem has come from the memory care asking my bf to dedicate his weekends to caring for his father (when we are paying the memory care for this feature, and extra for med management/help with daily care. over 8k a month). i feel like they are doing subpar care and should not be asking this of him at all. has anyone else had this type of response from a care facility?",Memory care asking for high levels of interaction?,0

"hi all. i've got grandparents living in florida in their own house (ie not any kind of assisted living community) and i just found out today that my grandmother has been diagnosed with alzheimer's. i'll give some quick context to our situation and would love to hear the thoughts/advice of this community.even getting to this point has been difficult -- my grandmother is extremely stubborn and independent, so while we were aware she had been slowly losing her faculties for some time, it took a concerted effort to get to the point of a diagnosis because of a combination of her own stubbornness and her long-time doctor's complacency. my grandfather is still sharp as a tack but wheelchair bound, so he is not in a position to care for both of them.it's clear they need to have more around-the-clock care, but the problem is that my grandmother will never agree to that. she insists there is nothing wrong (i could get into all the examples of how that is not true, but just trust me when i say she needs better help). the problem is she still has some level of lucidity, so we can't force her to do things she doesn't want to do (keep appointments, etc). it is important to mention that most of the family lives in pa, so while we've been trying to help care for things, it's simply not going to be possible for us to give her the level of care she needs. one of my uncles lives close by there and visits often, but he is simply wholly unprepared to deal with how complex the situation has become. obviously i don't think the right thing to do is to wait until she has an accident or hurts my grandfather to take more decisive action. what should we do in this 'in-between' period where she is lucid enough to have her own agency, but will inevitably be in a potentially dangerous situation soon? are there resources we can work with?thanks for reading and appreciate any guidance in advance.",New to Alzheimer's and looking for guidance,0

hi so i’ve been caring for my father now for over 11 years since mum passed away and we have had our ups and downs and he is 85 but last year or so my father seems to have developed dementia and it’s progressing fast which is causing us to fall out a lot. i have to admit my patience is very thin with him especially when he acts weird or says silly things which seems to be the norm now i have tried ringing the local doctors surgery up a few months ago but they didn’t want to know just fobbed me off. i’m the only person caring for him nobody else helps or sees him i’m here 24/7 and it’s grinding me down as well im just struggling to cope with the situation. a lot of the time he needs prompting to do something like he doesn’t make many decisions for himself at all anymore and he often talks about his past and forgets where we even are he thinks he’s back at home where his mum and dad was. it’s very frustrating and when i try speaking to him it can get into a heated row which i hate i just can’t cope with the fact that i’m losing my father and it hurts. he sleeps a lot during the day and at night he will wake up during middle of the night and can wander around thinking other people are in the house it’s very hard to see him like this especially with me just feeling like i’m on my own and im having  to cope with how i’m feeling too seeing all this. has anybody got any ideas or advice on what i can do because i’m lost with the situation?,Father has Dementia struggling to cope.,0

"for the past few years, my family has been struggling quite a lot with my grandmother, who has alzheimer's. among all of the problems we have had to go through, there is just one for which i can't see the solution. whenever my grandmother goes outside, especially in the spring and summer months, she walks around the neighbourhood. this would be totally okay, if not for the fact that she would also pick the flowers out of our neighbours' yards. the worst part of it is the fact that the neighbours have come to us, telling us about the meaning that went into the flowers that she consistently picks and ruins. the flowers that she picks are being grown for a specific person who isn't doing well health-wise. not only that, but she also picks flowers that they're currently growing for a competition, and it just so happens that these flowers are quite hard to grow. so clearly, i understand that they have the right to be angry and frustrated with my family. however, i found myself in an ethical dilemma: where on one hand, someone's meaningful flowers are being taken, but on the other hand, the other choice is confining her inside, effectively putting her under house arrest.she is in the moderate stages of alzheimer's right now, still generally able-bodied, so she refuses to go to a nursing home, where she can be taken care of. whichever way i seem to look, there's no solution and it's putting an immense amount of stress on myself and my family. could anybody help offer a solution?",Help!

"i live with my grandparents &amp; aunt who came to help when my grandfather had a stroke, he’s since had a second stroke and is nearing some of the later stages of dementia soon but he still eats and walks with a walker and talks, he remembers mostly just important things but has bad short term memory. he cannot go to the bathroom or do any hygiene on his own so my aunt and grandma do it. he’s very combative and angry so when they clean him (maybe he feels uncomfortable?) he starts yelling and him and whoever is cleaning him start fighting if he hits them. he likes me a lot and attaches to me, he listens to me maybe 90% of the time maybe bc i don’t fight with him so therefore i beg to help as he’s much more calm with me but they won’t allow it. my grandma does not want to put him in a nursing home but my aunt has been coercing her and my grandma feels backed into a corner and has begun calling places. i understand it’s hard for everyone but i think it’s wrong as my grandpa has verbally expressed numerous times that he absolutely does not want to go to a nursing home. now my aunt just said if he gets violent and hits her one more time she’s going to call somebody to have him ‘picked up and taken away’ saying she will tell them he’s a danger to the family. is this even possible? i love my grandpa and i think that doing that to him would be honestly beyond cruel. i live in florida and i’m not sure if this could even happen, does anybody know?",aunt threatening to put my grandpa somewhere,0

"we, the team at visionsasyst want to create an artificial intelligence that can help guide people with dementia through their worst stages. the artificial intelligence will be based on a similar technology as gpt-3 and will use natural language to remind the dementia patients of things, philosophize with them, do thought training and most importantly, record their mood and detect seizures or relapses of severe dementia at an early stage. in the background, this artificial intelligence is supposed to record the most important things said by the person with dementia in written form, and thus adapt to the conversation with the person. caregivers or relatives of the person with dementia should then be able to access the summaries in order to always stay up-to-date and informed. this would help to understand the person better and would make it easier for the caregivers and relatives to deal with the person. in summary, it should become a kind of digital companion through dementia. the most important thing, however, should be the adaptability and tolerance towards the sick. there should be a voice-controlled version and a chat-controlled version in the app, between which one can choose and switch. in addition, the ai should calculate a value by which it recognizes the strength of the dementia in the long term and can send the caregivers early enough warnings before the situation worsens. does this sound interesting to you? then donate now, or join our team and help us realize the plan.

"my wife had a fender bender this summer. she was diagnosed with a mild concussion and kept out of work for a couple of days. i used the accident as an excuse to get her early dementia symptoms diagnosed (she was fighting it and her doctors were not taking it serious). after a few attempts i was finally able to get her in front of a neurologist. i even told the neurologist about my strategy. the neurologist blamed her problems on the concussion and referred us to the mild brain injury program at a local hospital.  when i setup the appointment (mid jan) the intake person really focused on her bad concussion (10+ years ago) and the one this past summer. it felt like concussions were the only tools in this program's tool box. as a layman, i feel that the concussion is at best only a contributing factor.when she was first diagnosed i was relived, and thought maybe this program can make her better. if not, hopefully they will quickly get her to the right department. is this a good/fair to her strategy?","55 yr F finally diagnosed by Neurologist for cognitive and short-term memory issues.

"i'm a child in a line of familial alzheimer's - it's claimed my grandfather and 2 uncles so far. my father is the youngest (by a substantial period) of his siblings, but is now entering the age range in which his father and brothers started to show symptoms. he has asked me to keep an eye on him, and is very worried about catching alzheimer's symptoms early. my father has never been a particularly ""on point"" person memory-wise - i had to pay loss fines on multiple library books as a child because he took them away (for reading after bedtime) and then forgot about them. this year i got 2 gifts that he specifically said were supposed to come years earlier but he forgot or couldn't find them (this is a pretty normal thing for him). given his pattern of forgetfullness i'm not sure what to watch for outside of full-blown paranoia. what else should i be aware of?",Watching for signs...,0

"there have been some interesting studies of reversing memory loss via osteocalcin- a hormone produced in the bones.osteocalcin is produced in the body via nutritional intake of **calcium + vitamin k.** *gamma-secretase cleaves amyloid precursor protein (app) to generate amyloid-beta (abeta) peptides, which aggregate in the brain in alzheimer's disease (ad). gamma-secretase also cleaves molecules that regulate osteoblast activity, such as notch and ephrinb2.....*basically, what that means is that amyloid beta plaques develop when there is a deficient supply of osteocalcin and ultimately leads to neuronal death involving an imbalance of intracellular calcium homeostasis via activation of calcium channels, intracellular calcium stores, and subsequent production of free radicals by calcium-sensitive enzymes. thoughts?",Osteocalcin - a hormone reverses memory loss,0

"my father and i take care of my mother with advanced ftd at home. she started having swallowing difficulties a over year ago, and up until very recently we were able to follow the advice her doctors gave us to make sure she was able to eat—eliminate distractions, make the environment familiar/comfortable/have mealtime cues, alternate small bites of food with sips of a drink with a straw, and staying upright after the meal ends. the past couple weeks, though, mom stopped feeding herself completely. luckily she still opens her mouth when i lift a spoon or fork up for her, but she doesn't chew or swallow until after taking a drink, and even then only does so about a third of the time and by chewing once or twice before stopping. i've largely switched to soft or liquid food like scrambled eggs and soup along with nutritional shakes, so the difficulty chewing isn't as troubling as the worsening dysphagia. i'd  still like to provide mom with solid food if there's a way for her to still enjoy it safely, so if anyone has an unlikely solution that would help my mom chew i'd appreciate hearing it.i've heard that massaging the throat can help assist swallowing, but i haven't found a resource that explains exactly how to do that and my attempts at figuring it out haven't been helpful. can anyone tell me how this works or point me in the direction of a place i can learn how to do it?thank you for taking the time to read this. i have a feeling that there's not much of anything i can do, but it would be nice to be proven wrong.",Hand feeding advice?,0
"hi all!i am just not sure if i am being overly worried or if there is some cause for concern please read below. my father is 57, turning 58 this year and in recent months my mother and i have noticed that he is more forgetful and angrier. he wont remember questions or conversations we had the night before, and often asks the same question again later after he already has. his aggression and agitation has skyrocketed and it seems the smallest disagreement or even a simple conversation can gaslight him so fast. he has always been somewhat temper-mental but it has blown up in recent months. he is very strong-willed/headed and is successful and intelligent but these changes in mood, memory and agitation have started too stress me out and i can see its taking a toll on my parents relationship as well. i am not sure if he has noticed it but is too pig headed to say anything we are both also too scared to bring it up because he will probably yell at us. i am not sure if there should be cause for concern? but if there is i am really not sure how to suggest he should see a doctor as i know he will just brush the idea aside even if he really might need help. any comments or similar experiences and what you did would be appreciated. thank you.","Does my Dad have signs of early, onset Dementia/Alzheimers or am I being paranoid?",0

"my grandfather has vascular dementia, which started probably around 2017. in early 2018, he had an accident which affected his spinal chord and he ended up pretty much paralysed. five months in hospital in a neck brace did not help the dementia and he declined pretty rapidly. he has been at home with carers for the past few years and knew who people were, but would not remember that he was in his house (for example, he thought he lived in the house he grew up in with his parents and siblings). he then started to hear things, like conversations and laughing my that were not happening. the past few months, he has been sleeping more and more and is not really speaking anymore. he is also quite abusive to his carers, which is not him at all (he really was the gentlest, kindest, introverted man). this week, carers found my grandfather had lost a lot of blood as it appeared somebody fitted his catheter incorrectly (not 100% sure in this but that is the likely cause). he also may have a chest infection and is just generally unwell (negative for covid). he is refusing food and drink and we have been told he is “in the next stage of dementia”. but i am not entirely clear what that really means. i have looked up the progression, but it is really hard to gauge things like loss of mobility because of his accident three years ago, so a lot of the criteria does not apply.i appreciate the answer may be “how long is a piece of string?” but, from your experiences, how long would you realistically say we have left with him? thank you in advance for any advice; it is much appreciated.",How long do we realistically have?,0

dad just barely survived his aspiration pneumonia after two weeks on antibiotics. but they say it will surely happen again no matter how careful they are as the dementia is progressive and starts to impact autonomic systems like the swallow reflex. so the doctors recommend he go into hospice altho he looks back to his pre-pneumonia self - dementia not withstanding. his advanced directive is no artificial mechanisms. so now we're left with the dilemma as to how much to treat him to his favorite foods and how much to preserve every last minute of life. what i understand is even people on feeding tubes often succumb to more aspiration pneumonia by just swallowing saliva down the trachea. has anyone come to this fork in the road? it's so hard because even before dementia he didn't even want old folks home food (which is actually quite good) let along hand fed mush. yet on the other hand i don't want to accidentally bump him off with a big juicy steak.,Aspiration Pneumonia Survivor Age - late 80s,0

"hi, i’m wondering if anyone has any ideas for leaving my grandmother when she is asking to go home. she is now in a care home and asking to go home is near constant the whole time you are with her, she’s so excited to go home and sleep in her own bed. -a lot of advice says to lie to the patient and “enter their world” so i’ve tried this but she just feels tricked by you when you actually leave without her and says “all afternoon you’ve been letting me think you’re taking me home”. -if you try to distract her, as other advice says, when you eventually have to leave she is very upset and says “you tried to change the subject thinking i’ll forget! you think i’m stupid”she can’t see so it’s impossible to distract her with something on television and she has dedicated her whole life to her home and family, so there’s no hobby or interest to involve her in before you leave. she has always lived with family in her own home right up until she went in to the care home so she’s never been alone. does anyone have any good ideas for leaving? it’s very traumatic each time and there’s not always free staff at the care home to distract her so we can slip out (although when we manage this she remembers and is upset we ran away and left her)any suggestions very welcome as it’s so difficult to leave her this way.",Grandmother asks to go home,0

"hi everyone, i'm a bit torn about this so i thought maybe someone here had some helpful advice.my grandma (92) lives in a nursing home, and has dementia. she hid it for a good while, but it became apparent just how bad it is when my grandpa died last year. she thinks she is temporarily in the hospital and wants to go home, but by home she means the family farm, where she hasn't lived since she was a teen. she sometimes recognizes my dad and aunt, but often she doesn't, since she thinks they are kids. other than them i don't think she recognizes a lot of people very often.and here is my dilemma: my dad recently mentioned to me that she might be getting close to death and if i would want to visit her a last time i should do so soon. my grandma was a lovely part of my childhood and it pained me so much that i didn't get to see my grandpa before he died. but on the other hand, she will most likely have no idea who i am, but she will fake it since she has gotten used to that after hiding it for so many years. so maybe a visit will just stress her out without doing anything good for her? right now my last moment with her was at my granddads funeral where she in a clear moment marched over to me, took my hand, looked deeply into my eyes and said ""he loved you very much you know?"" which is quite lovely.so yeah, i'm torn about if i should go see her or not, thoughts and advice is appreciated",Visiting grandma with dementia,0

"hello, i'd like to start with saying that i am new to the nursing field after quitting my college degree seeking in business and switching to pursue a degree in nursing. i currently work at an assisted living facility that also has its hospice licensing.working with patients with all types and severities of dementia and alzheimer's has been an eye opening experience- one that i've taken to heart to help the residents in the best way possible. that's certainly something i can't say some other cnas on staff care too much about.i have a particular patient that i'm unsure how to deal with and i was hoping someone here would have some advice for me on the best way to help her through her end of life.female, 96, severe dementia. constantly walking the halls of the facility entirely lost, constantly waiting for her sons or mother or husband. the issue is (and i'm sure some of you know what i mean) is that she can... switch personalities almost in seconds. one moment she will be sweet and sit and talk with you (despite it making no sense on your part). then it seems like she takes a deep breath and has a whole different look in her eye, she'll yell at you, spit at you, throw punches and kicks, call you horrible names, you name it.the question i have is that i know you should never tell a patient that so and so is dead and they won't see them again or that they are confused and that they're not going to go home and everything like that. but this resident will not allow you to change her, take her to the restroom (she is typically continent, but not always), put her to bed (i know that at least once she was up for close to 48 hours constantly roaming the halls). i know that her family wants the best care for her and i want to give that to her as well. i don't necessarily feel comfortable with what other cnas do where they force her to a wheelchair and bring her back to her room while she screams just to change her and shower her.does anyone have any advice? my manager has all but said do whatever you can, but make the facility look good. i'm just so new to this and am not sure what would be best.thank you in advance for any help!",CNA Asking For Help W/Dementia Patient,0

my dad has early onset accelerated alzheimer's.  it sucks and it's unfair. he has gone through so much in his life and this just seems like it's the icing on a cake made of shit. it started when he was 8 and his big brother died. then his 1st wife (my mum) cheat on him and left him for someone else. after this she died in a car accident. being a single parent is never easy. he then had to deal with his only child joining the navy and going off to war. not to mention getting bowel cancer 2 years before getting diagnosed with alzheimer's. why does it always seem as those people who have a lot happen to them get the short straw every time?,My Dad.,0

"hey all,my mom has started keeping spoiled food and she yells at me and has a fit when i tell her i'm throwing it out. she has been drinking milk that went sour on 5/9 according to the label (and smell, obviously)...i told her it was expired and she said no it isn't, i just opened it today (5/16) so i showed her the label as said ""yes it is, you're drinking spoiled milk"" and then dumped it out. clearly this wasn't the best tactic on my part and i feel guilty but i don't want her getting sick. she got mad and went back to the tv.would it cause her more distress if i threw things out without her knowledge? i want to keep her in the loop because she is semi-independent but i've been working nights and even though i pay a cna to come a couple times a week to just spend time with her, i'm worried she may eat something moldy eventually if i'm not there. the cna says in her experience elderly people tend to keep old food ""just in case"".another issue is that she will make a dish one day, forget she did, eat something else, then i'll find her cooking that and dish again the next day. i tell her ""you just made that yesterday, why are you making it again"" and she'll just say ""no i didn't"" so then i show her the container from the fridge and she gets frustrated and says ""i never made that"". again, poor tactics on my end but i don't know how else to show her. plus it's a massive waste of food.i know it's my responsibility to monitor this stuff but i need the extra money as a financial stop gap measure until i get back into my professional career. the food waste is one thing, but her getting food poisoning is worse. i know as her primary caretaker i should be on top of this better, and i have been but with this job it's harder. have any of you experienced this food issue?",Spoiled Food?,0
it took me 5 years of trying to convince my mom that she needs to see a doctor for her memory stuff. long story short i was finally able to take her to a neurologist 2 weeks ago and in the appointment she  was so insulted by the written 5 minute memory test that by the end she was angrily stating how absurd it was that the doctor was testing her on things that she isn't using in her daily life and that it was ridiculous (she wasn't able to complete the test). she expressed to me today how upset that test made her and at the appointment the doctor referred her to get neuropsychology testing which i've heard is around 4 hours long (which it seems like my mom will definitely not sit though). i don't know what to do now. i don't know what the next steps to take are. i think i will be able to get her to do the mri's maybe but a terrible geriatric provider earlier in the year told us she might only have a year left to live based off of no evidence or rigorous testing after the first visit. i really wanted a second opinion but it doesn't seem like i'm going to get it. if she refuses to take the tests then what should i focus on next besides ensuring that she is safe?,A New Major Setback :(,0

"this post pertains to my grandfather, who is in his late 90s. he hasn't been thoroughly examined on this, but he appears to have some sort of dementia. he has not had memory loss, hasn't forgotten anyone or any incident in his life, nor does he experience any issues with communication. he sometimes has lapses in working memory about whether he ate breakfast, etc, but other times he will remember these things correctly. he's sometimes confused about the day and year, but he's in the ball park (he doesn't keep a calendar or anything).but over the past few years, he has developed a host of fantastical delusions which are getting progressively more detailed and consuming. some stem from his religion; he believes that people in a religious realm tell him facts about his family. for instance, he'll say we need to go get his mother or uncle from outside - it's not that he has forgotten they ever died, he just believes that they're here again after being sent back from that afterlife realm. others are non-religious; he believes that foreign dignitaries greet him and converse with him, that family members have now become actors or sports stars.he spends much of the day alone in conversation with beings/people he perceives to be present. but he realizes we can't see them and thinks he has special access to seeing them. what conditions would be consistent with delusions without much memory loss? if dementia, which specific types match up with this?",Delusions without memory loss: is this dementia?

"how exactly does one go about getting a poa or health care proxy or any kind of help at all for someone who needs help but refuses to see it or even go to a doctor to be told as much?my grandma is 70 and has been showing pretty clear, and worsening, signs of dementia for years now. she had a stroke 2 years ago and has been a lot worse since. she was also diagnosed with diabetes at the same time and high blood pressure. they wanted her to do at minimum 6 month follow ups with her new pcp they set her up with and see neurology but she won’t do either. they gave her 6 medicines to take- for the blood sugars and blood pressures and stroke prevention, but she will frequently refuse to even fill them or she’ll pick them up and they’ll sit on her counter unopened.lately she’s been acting more hostile and aggressive, prone to nasty and violent outbursts and just generally unpredictable and irrational. she’s driving but is no longer safe to do so, she just had her electric shut off after assuring me 5x it was fine and paid. she can’t handle her finances at all but the only people she’ll let “help” are her son and grandson in law who both openly brag about just using the money for whatever they want and not particularly caring about her.she’s always been the nastiest to me and anyone i’m with- anyone who actually tries to help her but also holds her accountable for her behaviors. it’s getting to the point i can no longer stomach being in her life but i don’t want to leave her to the wolves entirely. how can i get her help if she will never think she needs it?",She’ll never acknowledge she needs help.,0

"my father has always been an extremely capable man; he has always done his own (major and minor) building work, plumbing, electrical work, car maintenance, you name it. a few years ago, he was diagnosed with dementia. in general, he's still pretty good, but it's starting to take a real toll on his concentration and reasoning abilities. unfortunately, he's still trying to do complex diy projects (think electrical wiring and heating), and i'm seriously worried that he's going to do something dangerous due to his lack of concentration or otherwise. my parents have been without electricity for days at a time, due to him wiring something up wrong. at the time it was clear to me that he'd got no idea what was wrong, and that he doesn't have the capacity to think through the problem logically.the impossible part with this is that my father won't accept that his reasoning ability is deteriorated; he thinks that he is still capable of doing the work, and that it just takes him longer than it used to; this is definitely not the case, if you try talking to him about it it's clear that it's all jumbled in his head.if i or my mother suggest getting professionals (e.g. electrician, heating engineers) in to help, he gets very angry (and is extremely stubborn; people have said that we just need to ""lay down the law"", there's an approximately 0% chance of that working). i can sometimes reason with him and get him to agree to some things, but it's equally likely that he'll change his mind later on and just refuse. unfortunately i think a lot of it comes down to personality; the same ""i can do anything i set my mind to, never give up"" attitude that made him so incredibly capable previously, have made it seem like getting outside help is ""giving up"", and he's totally set against it.we've tried diverting him away towards other jobs that don't require as much concentration (he was quite happy in the summer making a fruit cage to keep the birds off the raspberries). however, there are a few things at my parent's place that really need fixing, and we can't seem to get him to agree to accept outside help.does anyone else have any experience with something like this? we're going to try getting his doctor onside as a sort of appeal to authority, but she's been reluctant to tell him what he can and can't do.",How to deal with a parent who won't accept that their reasoning ability is impaired?,0

"apologies in advance for the length of this post.my mother has been diagnosed with cognitive impairment likely due to alzheimer's and is somewhere between stages 5 and 6. we are not yet experiencing incontinence but she is asking for her deceased mother, is incredibly unstable on her feet, has absolutely no short term memory and requires 24/7 supervision - which my father is providing for her. her cognitive abilities still test fairly high, but anxiety and no memory impede most productive conversations or processes.we are very fortunate that they own two houses in a high cost of living area, however they need to downsize out of the larger, 2 story house into the smaller 1 story house. originally, we had planned to move my mother to memory care at the same time we moved my father to the smaller house, however we have since discovered that we will need to sell the larger house before placing her in memory care due to financial reasons.her care team has let us know that she should not participate in the moving process in any way as it would be too overwhelming for her and she impedes us making any progress if we include her in any decision making. she will be confused and angry to not be involved in the move. she would also become enraged if she knew my husband and i were doing the actual coordination and work of moving them. she will be angry that “she did not know they had to move” and furious that “someone else will be moving things for them” because “she’s not an invalid and can handle her own affairs” - i’m sure you all are familiar with this.the plan is currently for my father and her to go stay in a hotel for a week while my husband and i move them from one house to the other and fully set their new home up for them. our big question marks are two fold:1) how should we tell her about all of this? our fear is that she will just simply refuse to pack and go along with it.2) how does my father handle her for the full week while she will be constantly confused and constantly wanting to go look at the houses during the moving process?my father is already worn out, we all are, and we’re concerned about adding more pressure to the already difficult situation. if there’s something i’m not thinking of here, or any tricks that others have learned by navigating something similar, i would be so very grateful for the advice.big thank you",Moving Households with an Alzheimer's Patient,0

"my grandmother has never been officially diagnosed with dementia, but it’s pretty obvious with all the memory problems she has. recently, my father (her son) went to her house, and she forgot he was married to my mother, his wife of 35 years. she thought my sister and i were my mother’s children, and my dad was her friend. this incident gave me the idea to make a scrapbook for her as a christmas gift, containing pictures of all her living relatives and text explaining how they were all related to each other and to her, as well as a little information about each person (occupation, hobbies, age, etc.). i also want to include a list of her hobbies, so she doesn’t get bored when she forgets what she likes to do with her free time. i’m thinking to also include some of her favorite bible verses, since she is a very religious person.i want to know what else i should add to the scrapbook. she lives alone with her cat (she 100% refuses to go to a nursing home), and her three children visit about once or twice a week ... i don’t know if that’s important, but take it into consideration if it is. should i add information about dead family members? is there anything i should know not to include in the scrapbook? any suggestions (including other subreddits where i could post this question) are very much appreciated!","I want to make a scrapbook for my grandmother, but I need ideas.",0

"hi everyone.first of all, excuse my english, i'm from belgium so english is not my native language.my grandmother is in the early stages of dementia and i don't really know what to do anymore. for a while now everyone in my family has noticed my grandmother forgetting small things. the address my girlfriend works at (she still knows the company though), the name of our cat,... small things like that.when things became worse we decided it was time to have her tested. at the hospital where she did some tests it became clear she couldn't interpret time anymore. when asked what year it was she said 2013 while it was 2016 at the time.the doctor suspected alzheimer's although further testing needed to be done so we booked her an appointment for the tests a few weeks later.when the appointment approached the hospital for some stupid reason decided to call my grandmother, asking if she still wanted to go through with her appointment. so of course she says no, because she forgot what it was about and she believes the doctors are trying to pull a scam on her by having her do as many appointments as possible so they get paid alot.this of course put us quite a few steps back, as she absolutely does not want to visit the hospital to get diagnosed now.in the meantime my grandfather, who also happened to be diagnosed with kahler's disease at the meantime (cancer of the bloodcells), has to cope with my grandmother who is becoming increasingly aggressive and forgetful.every week they do groceries together and every week they bring home the same things they already have 9 of because she believes they ran out.when my grandfather points this out she becomes angry and doesn't believe him and even throws a fit right in the middle of the store.anyway, i'm drifting. i would like to know if there are any possibilities of getting my grandmother to the hospital to get a diagnose, i already know what dementia eventually does to people but i would like for my grandfather to have it easier. perhaps if she can take some meds that calm her down it would be a huge help.also if she has to be admitted to a nursing home it would be easier if she has a diagnose.it's just so hard because everytime the word doctor is pronounced she just immediately refuses any cooperation and we can't really tie her down and drag her to the hospital for tests.does anyone have some tricks?thanks for letting me vent and providing advice everyone. stay strong.",Need advice,0

"my mom has wandered several times now, and my dad told me that today she even walked into someone else’s home. they live in a rural area with lots of room to get lost and/or hurt. i am of the opinion that they need in-home care to help keep tabs on her in general (i don’t live close enough to do it), but my suggestion has not been received well. my dad has now asked me about tracking devices, and so far i cannot find one that will work for them because:1) she never carries keys, a bag, or a phone and doesn’t ever wear a belt or lace-up shoes. that alone eliminates a lot of options.2) she habitually destroys or throws away the shoes she does wear. scratch sole inserts.3) she won’t wear a chunky smart watch. even if she did, it would quickly be lost or tossed and would likely never get properly charged. she wouldn’t know how to use it anyway, and my dad would struggle as well.what’s even left to pick from? have i missed anything?i’d like to get her a medical id bracelet, and i know they make some that look like jewelry (so she’ll maybe like to wear it) and have special non-removable clasps. that’s helpful for when other people find her. but it won’t help my dad find her himself.i hate this.",Tracking my mom seems impossible.

"i have a parent living in assisted living, with moderate dementia, and two siblings who live out of state. our parent speaks to two of us by phone several times every day, and we are sharing a significant mental load to keep her on course as her memory and logical processing ability decline. anyone know a good caregiver/family scheduling and planning tool, app, or approach, for us adult children to keep each other informed and encouraged?i want to stay in better contact with my sibs re. her schedule (upcoming medical appointments, appointment notes, recurring schedule items), documents, and possibly find a platform for collaborative planning of family events, holidays and visits.  longer-term planning suffers under the weight of detangling her everyday confusion.conversations with our parent are already challenging and disjointed, and often so repetitive. my siblings and i are wearing out mentally before we can communicate the important stuff to each other. after many months of trying to keep each other up to speed through phone calls, texts and group texts, it's just getting hard. and we may need to keep doing this and more for years to come.we are all iphone users; we have different work schedules and communication styles. all are analytical, so being able to analyze data to see trends would also be helpful. i tend to keep a paper journal where i jot notes longhand while on the phone.  anyone else had success keeping a log, or shared calendar, or open line of communication, so the work of sharing information about a family member with dementia doesn't sabotage the other positive aspects of the sibling relationship?thanks for reading. it's hard work, this.",iOS apps recommended for family communication re. parent with dementia?,0
"my grandfather had mild dementia for a long time. it was slowly getting worse, he was at the stage where he got lost in familiar places &amp; occasionally confused someone with a dead relative, but he was still more or less functioning and could hold a conversation and do everyday tasks. then he got diagnosed with late-stage pancreatic cancer, and in the space of about a week, went from that level of functioning to having moments where he didn't recognize his wife of 50+ years. it happened so quickly that i only got a chance to visit him once after the diagnosis, and i don't know how much of it was the cancer and how much of it was the dementia, but he was doing very, very bad. sleeping all the time, very weak, had a lot of trouble stringing sentences together although he answered a few basic questions. he passed two days later. we're all still a bit in shock about just how fast it happened. his diagnosis was less than two weeks ago, and i visited him about a month ago and he was, well, how i described at the start of the post.i'm just really struggling. how do you live with knowing that someone you loved may not have recognized you in the last chance you had to visit? i have no idea if he did or not, and i don't want him to have passed away afraid, thinking he was alone and that no one loved him enough to spend time with him. i know we had a lot more visits together, visits that i'm sure he'd rather i remember than this one, but it still hurts feeling like maybe i never got to say goodbye.",Advice on losing a loved one with dementia,0
"i am designing a stove/oven unit which would fit into the place of a normal kitchen range, for people living alone with early/moderate dementia, and/or vision or hearing issues.i want to bounce the idea off you guys.  the controls would be simple and visually self-explanatory.  buttons would be large so that they are easy to see and touch, even for someone with parkinson's.the stovetop would have two burners, not four (no one's cooking major meals here), button controls for each burner (h, m, l) and a timer (60 minute max) and off-button for each burner..the oven controls are on the front of the cooktop (well delineated from the cooktop itself by color or finish) above a side-opening oven with three well-labeled button options:  toast (max 10 minute timer), 350 and 375 degrees (max one hour timer).  there are prominent oven on and off buttons, and a visual (maybe mechanical) slider for timing the oven, up to 60 minutes.  the side-opening door would have a catch to hold it fully open so that it doesn't catch the user as they remove their meal, but is also easy to close.i am also considering a light bar and bell to notify when the oven cooking is complete.to go with it, a range hood that includes a smoke sensor and automatically triggering fire-suppression system.what do you think?  would you consider buying this product for your loved one?  i think it would also be useful for other situations, such as rec room/teen hangouts and offices.  any suggestions for improvement?",An oven/range for early dementia people who live alone,0

"hello everyone, this is going to be a bit of a write up so bear with me please.for the past year or so my grandmother has been exhibiting minor short term memory loss, it became noticeable because my mother and her were  marathoning a t.v show together, after they finished watching the entire series my grandmother wanted to watch it again, and treated it as if she had never seen it before.long story short, her and my mother wound up re-watching the show continuously for the past year, my mother was bored out of her mind but my grandmother always acted like it was the first time she was seeing it.this, compounded by other minor signs of memory loss led my mother and my grandmothers sister to try and talk to her about it. in most instances, my grandmother reacted with anger (kind of a how dare you attitude) but after a little deliberation they finally convinced her to see a doctor.this is where things get kind of weird, even though my grandmother had been showing signs of short-term memory loss she was still highly functional, and capable of living on her own and generally taking care of herself. she went to her doctors appointment, and in the interview process alone the doctor determined that she probably was suffering from the early onset of dementia. but for my grandmother, it was like she completely lost all cognitive ability after this doctors appointment, in a matter of days she went from being mostly self-sufficient with short-term memory loss to not even knowing  where she was, sometimes when she talks to me or my mother now, she’ll pause and ask us if we’re really there or if she is hallucinating.she gets these weird things in her head, and she’ll make really weird statements like she told my mom “when i die just leave me here to rot, you don’t need to go to the trouble of burying me” or she also once told my mom that her brother in law told her she was gonna die a long and painful death, because the drs would never give her pain medication, first of all this is completely imagined and fabricated within her mind, her brother-in-law would never tell her something like that, and when my mom explained to her that wouldn’t happen and hospitals have medication they give people in their final days and moments she just became argumentative with my mom.she refuses to eat unless somebody’s eating with her, and even then whoever’s eating with her has to basically gorge themselves with food to get her to eat just a normal serving as she watched you like a hawk and only takes bites when you’re cramming food down your throat.i don’t know the full extent of things yet, but i know that she’s become kind of aggressive and argumentative with my mom, this is very out of character for her as she has always been the sweetest person.i guess the thing that i’m struggling with most right now, is that she had such a drastic change so quickly after being told that this is probably what it was. can dementia progress in a matter of days? i’m not kidding when i say it went from being very minor memory loss, to full on confusion and hallucinations in a matter of days. today i’m meeting with my parents and we’re going to move my grandmother in with them so she can have mostly consistent monitoring and care.i’m just takin a back right now, i have not had time to process what is going on. everything i have read says that dementia generally progresses over the course of 8 to 10 years and some people have even lived upwards of 20 years with it, but that doesn’t seem to fit the case now with my grandmother, she has gone from fully functional to needing basically 24 hour care in a matter of a couple of days.have any of you had a similar experience with the progression process?thanks for any responses.",My grandmother (73) was recently diagnosed with early onset Dementia and I am looking for some answers about the progression of this disease.,0

"my dad who is 61 years old has dementia, he was diagnosed about 7-8 months ago after about a year of us noticing his severe memory loss and paranoia.he has this delusion that the bank stole money from him and last year (spring-summer 2017) dealing with that was hell because he was constantly angry and aggressive and going to the bank and causing a scene and threatening the tellers to give his money back. besides the paranoia and memory loss, he still was functional and seemingly normal. eventually (fall 2017) he was put on mild anti psychotic pills and the paranoid ceased.now this year (march-ish) he finally got diagnosed and everything has been good paranoia wise (though his memory and cognitive functions have declined) until now all of a sudden he’s talking about the bank again and how they stole money. it’s the same story as last time and now i know that it’s the disease, not him (last year he wasn’t diagnosed so i wasn’t sure). his license is suspended due to his decline in cognitive skills. he keeps demanding that i give him his keys or else he will walk (i work during the day so him walking all the way to the bank is not something i want)i managed to calm him down and told him i’ll call them tomorrow and make an appointment and that he doesn’t need to worry. it seemed to have worked but hopefully he remembers tomorrow and doesn’t go about his own plan.have any of you caregivers dealt with this kind of paranoia? last year he used to get very angry and aggressive and threaten violence against people and it was quite scary. i’m really afraid he’s going to go back to that and now that my older brother is moved out, i’m alone in the house with my dad and my brother isn’t here if something were to happen.if you have any experience or encouragement please feel free to comment.the only thing that keeps me sane these days is my hope and trust in god.",Father with dementia is very paranoid and angry,0

"a couple months ago, my 60 year-old father suddenly started experiencing short-term memory loss. he is relatively healthy, socially active, works in a cognitively engaging field, and has played live music in a few different bands almost every weekend since he was 16 years old.he first started to notice something was wrong a couple months ago when he would forget random notes/chords mid-song, sometimes on songs that he's been playing the same way for 5, 10, maybe 20 years. a few weeks later in mid-may, he brought to my mother's attention that, during a recent live performance, he looked down at one point and realized he had no recollection of changing into the clothes he was wearing before the show.since then, his condition seem to be getting slowly but progressively worse, but it also varies significantly from day to day. he is carrying around a notebook as a coping mechanism for a checklist/reminders/notes so he can get through his workday without accidentally scheduling a visit to the same client twice in the same week. some days he seems completely 100% normal, other days he repeats questions/comments occasionally and forgets details about things that happened &lt;30 minutes ago, and this past weekend he almost seemed ""blacked out"" and was operating ~30 seconds at a time after a long day of work followed by 2-3 hours playing live music. it seems like once routine but cognitively engaging tasks have become incredibly taxing for him, and once he runs out of fuel for the day (sometimes mid-day) there is just no avenue for him to recover aside from full night of sleep.so far, he has been referred to 2 different neurologists, had an mri with nothing remarkable noted, has taken a moca assessment where he missed one point (mid-june) and took a multi-hour long cognitive assessment (early last week) on which he scored above average in every area except short-term memory where there are significant deficits. he is seeing a cognitive neurologist this week and has been scheduled for a pet scan in a couple weeks.just curious if anyone has seen a sudden onset of symptoms and rapid decline like this within the span of ~2-3 months? my grandmothers both have dementia, but there were subtle yet obvious symptoms early on like forgetting to take medication, paranoia, etc. and i have not seen anything like that with my father over the last year up until a couple months ago.","Rapid onset, severe short term memory loss within 2-3 months of noticing symptoms?",0

does anyone else care for a family member with dementia who lies about being sick to get attention? we also have huge problems with her saying she doesn’t remember how to go to the bathroom when really she just wants to have a person waiting on her 24/7. it’s really sad because i don’t always know when she’s is faking or not but i also can’t be on call nonstop. what ways have you guys found to get your family to be more independent? i know she has a lot of depression with the disease that makes her more lethargic. physically she is actually pretty healthy. can anyone else relate or is this unique to my grandmother? i’m just worn out dude.,Lying about being sick,0
"hey everyone,i'm taking care of a family member with dementia. she's still aware of who everyone is, but she has trouble getting thoughts out, doesn't seem to understand most of what people say to her, and talks about stuff that either never happened or happened long ago as if it was yesterday. this has lead to her wandering around the house filled with fear because she can't find her husband (he's at work) and she doesn't understand the street noise outside (we're on the edge of a not-great neighborhood, so you get the occasional distressing sound).i'm worried she's going to go into the attic, leave the house, etc. and hurt herself when i'm not looking. obviously, it's also not great for her to be living with so much paranoia. i feel like if i could just get her to sit down and do a hobby, it would be so much better for everyone.any tips on getting someone with dementia to sit down and focus on something for an hour or more?",Hobbies for my family member,0

"dear friends, recently - over the past two years or so - my mom and i started noticing some changes in my father's behavior. he sometimes forgets recent things - not obvious things like names or addresses, but more like details in a recent conversation, what he had for breakfast, who he was on phone with, etc. he also has a tendency to repeat things in the same conversation. mom and i were always worried that he would develop dementia (because his father and one older brother had it), so we got him to see a doctor as soon as these symptoms started showing. however, the doctor thinks his mri report was fine, and he made him take some informal memory and math tests which he passed easily. what's more, my father has always been a pretty forgetful (and repetitive) person, so we're not sure if this spike in forgetfulness is indicative of dementia, or just a quarantine side-effect.one thing i also notice is, his forgetfulness is kind of context-specific - like he would only forget details related to certain things, and only when he's dealing with certain people (e.g. he tends to forget more when he's communicating with my mom, compared to anyone else). i don't know what to make of it, but i've heard the first symptoms of dementia are only apparent to the primary caregiver (my mom in this case, i live abroad).i guess my primary question is, assuming the worst (early dementia) - what can we do to make his situation better (or at least, prevent it from getting worse)? i've browsed some of the material posted on the resources section of this subreddit, but they largely seem to cater to later stages in dementia, while our confusion is about the diagnosis itself.thanks in advance for any and all help! feel free to direct me to other resources/forums/experts to e-mail.",I'm not sure if my dad has dementia,0

"hello everyone, ftp and on mobile and my thoughts are a bit everywhere so i apologise for any mistakes or if things are unclear. i just need some advice.my grandmother who i love dearly (the woman practically raised me and my 2 siblings as my parents were negligent and absent for a variety of reasons) has vascular dementia and has been diagnosed with it for about 10 years now.  although she doesn't walk anymore (she broke an ankle a few years ago and can't remember which one so she told us that since she can't remember they both hurt) she's still quite lively and has no issues recognising us or our voices when when speak to her on the phone.the thing is my grandfather, her husband of 50 odd years passed in his sleep earlier this week.  they were in staying in separate rooms which i didn't agree with but my aunt and father were the ones in charge of their care especially as my siblings and i live in another country 10 hours away so although we suggest things it goes ignored.  anyways, he passes and she asks my parents if he is gone and they refuse to answer her and do not want to tell her at all.  they also do not want her at the funeral because it will be too much work to get her ready and they 'do not want another death to happen'.my siblings and i highly disagree with this. although hard and heart breaking, she loves that man with all her might and i know she would at least want to know and have the choice to decide whether or not she wanted to attend.i've done some reading on people who were faced with the same issue and so far the consensus is that they deserve to know and grieve at least once. she will notice he's not they as they always ate their meals together and spent the day time together watching tv.  hell, i've not lived back home for almost 10 years and she always asks when i'm next going to visit because she hasn't seen me in ages.my mind is all over the place because i'm grieving and trying to get through the day and plan all the things i have to do when i arrive for the funeral as i am the oldest grandchild so there is a lot of societal expectations on me.  i can't trust my family because over the years they've never been trustworthy and as i've gotten older i've seen how spiteful they can be (stealing things from the house, refusing to fix my grandfather's hearing aids, practically starving him at one point, not getting my grandmother physical therapy after her injury).has anyone ever been in this situation or even have advice? i appreciate anything you guys can give.",Grandmother has dementia and her husband has passed away.

"hello. new here and still trying to figure out what i need to do. my 65 yo wife was diagnosed with ftdementia two years ago. originally thought to be alzheimers and had various scans including the expensive new pet scan that definitively ruled out alzheimers. she also has diabetes and thyroid issues and takes a statin for high cholesterol.while she she presents somewhat normally if you don't spend a lot of time with her it is becoming more apparent her short term memory is almost gone. repeating things and asking questions constantly, playing solitaire on an ipad all day it allowed. she used to cook but can't really do that any longer as ingredients get left out or the stove gets left on... pretty typical behavior.i use the usps service that alerts you to what mail is expected each day, have moved all bills to online payment so she can't interfere and have our home phone line forward to my cell. i had it ringing at home and my cell but disabled the ability to receive calls at home since the other day she answered a call from a scammer and gave out her medical information. fortunately the doctors office alerted me when the scammer called there trying to elicit information.when i asked my wife about the call she didn't remember what she told the scammer.on one hand i hate to block the phone completely (i also screen all her email) but i don't want what happened the other day to happen again. our utility has a device that can be installed on the electrical panel that allows you to monitor the electrical system and see what devices are being turn on and off. designed as a tool for monitoring expenses but i'm using it as a safety tool to make sure the stove/oven gets turned off if i'm not around.any suggestions or should i just let things be as they are with calls all coming to me? thank you.",Safety issues,0

"so to preface this there needs to be some back story. my family has been slowly dwindling since 2019 when my dad died then in 2020 my uncle (dads brother) died the reason, i bring this up is because these were the people who when my grandparents got bad were gonna be taking care of them the rest of the family is out of state and cant feasibly be expected to come all the way to take care of them, so that leaves me the most immediate next of kin. just a couple months ago my grandpa who i dont think has dementia (he doesnt have any diagnosis and isnt near as bad as my grandma) hit a motorcyclist while driving to the store and screwed his leg pretty badly, long story short theyre more than likely being sued by them and now it has fallen on me solely to take care of them. i do nearly everything for them they arent allowed to drive i have their keys so i take them 2 times a week to the store/bank/post office etc. etc.  the problem is they insist that they can drive themselves they insist that they can shop themselves (after shopping trips they thank me like im their savior because they realise how bad it is, but immediatly forget afterwards how much i helped) but if they did any of this for themselves they would have killed someone or been killed by someone. i dont know what to do anymore i know i have to continue helping them but i have a life and its taking a toll on my mental health and social health but what can i do. they call me every day multiple times a day asking to go places and i just cant uproot myself to do things for them every day all day its becoming a full time job that im not being paid very much to do i love them very much and plan to never stop helping them even if i dont get paid much or at all but it is hard, is there anything i can do to help them understand im just trying to keep them and everyone else safe?",i need help,0

i finally went to visit my mom. she’s still living in her 3000+ sq ft house in a nice neighborhood (very safe). she has an underlying mental illness/paranoia/depression and now dementia (like stage 6). she can still use the bathroom. we have aides come in to help 4 hours each day. she throws a fit on any suggestion she should change her clothes. the doctor believes that a psych team would be needed to get her to bathe. we’re trying to keep her at home but it’s a lot to maintain (and she doesn’t have a lot of income) but i feel it’s time for her to move on and get additional care. i do worry she’d have to be highly medicated and potentially injured but an impatient nurse but i’m just kinda tired of having to take care of things from a distance. i also think it’s unfair on her neighbors to have to look out for her (and deal with an unsightly house). the house i could help improve but i’m just not sure it makes sense to do so. but she’s comfortable there and still recognizes it... what to do?,Mom hasn’t bathed in years and hasn’t changed her clothes in months,0

"my mom came down with alzheimers about 4 years ago, and it became severe enough about 2.5 years ago that we moved her into an assisted living facility. the facility is 3 states away from where i live, and we chose it because my sister and aunt lived in the same city where we put mom, but my sister has passed away (unrelated) and my aunt really has no time to be involved, which she made clear after my sister passed away. there is no other family in this city now.mom's condition gets measurably worse every few months, according to the staff at her facility. the latest is that she can no longer dress herself, or use the toilet herself, she needs daily assistance from the staff at the facility. she can still speak, and even read some, and eat without help, but she doesn't know the day of the week, and can't remember names.she is only 74,  and aside from the alzheimers, she is fairly healthy (she's had regular checkups). people in her family normally live into their early 90s, but none of them had dementia/alzheimers -- except one aunt, who passed in her early 80s.i'm not trying to be morbid, but i'm trying to understand if people whose alzheimers is on a certain point on a scale... have some expected life span? if her condition is such that she can't dress herself, or use the bathroom by herself, what's next? i'm not able to travel to her city often to see her, so i feel a bit like she is warehoused there now with very little family involvement. i had considered moving her to a facility in my city, but everybody tells me that such a move would probably be very traumatic for her, now that she is used to her current facility.if she is expected to live for 10 more years, i feel like moving her closer to me might be worth the temporary trauma, but if she is only expected to last another couple of years, then maybe the trauma of a move would not be good for her relative to her remaining years.","Is there some standardized chart of a person's life expectancy based on their age and current ability?

"hello, i got a dna test from 23 and me a few months ago, and found i have two copies of the e4 variant. which is associated with the highest risk of alzheimer's. when i saw this, i felt like my heart sank. i tried so hard to not think about it, but it keeps haunting me like a ghost. being 30 years old, immediately after i told some of my closest friends, they told me i'm worrying too much, that i'm too young to worry about that.my mom told me she can't think of any alzheimer's in our family, though, that wasn't reassuring because my grandfather has dementia, and our family isn't very close...at all. a family member could easily have alzheimer's and neither of my parents would know about it.i get complemented on my intelligence and ability to learn more than anything else, even though i don't feel like i'm that intelligent. either way, i heavily value the quality of my mind, and i always have tried to do everything i can do to either to improve or preserve it.i could do a lot more for my physical health, but i try to do everything i can for my mental health, even when i get migraines.so, being tested for two copies of the e4 variant was a huge slap in the face.i'm sure this doesn't mean i have a 100% chance of developing it, but that doesn't eliminate my anxiety. and it seriously doesn't help that most people i've spoken to about this is being unsympathetic.so, i guess what i want to ask is, has anybody else had the same experience?is it really possible for somebody with two copies of the e4 variant to live to old age without developing alzheimer's?is my anxiety justified? is there any action i can take to prevent it? i know i'm asking a lot of questions, i just...i guess i'm just really distressed about this. and i can't afford to go to a doctor any time soon.if you have any information you think be useful, that would be great.",Testing positive for two copies of e4 variant.,0

"i posted here about a month ago about my mother, who has begun repeating questions and such.she saw a doctor and has a nurlogy appintment in nov.but now, i'm worried about myself. over the past few years, i've noticed that i am forgetting what people tell me sometimes. the major example is my best friend lives out of state. we talk on the phone every few weeks. and while i remember i spoke to him, i forget little details. i am a writer by trade, so, taking notes on our conversations didn't seem weird, but now, i think it might be.and just today, i was chatting with someone on snapchat. i said something and they responded like 30 minutes later. chats in snap disappear after while and i couldn't remember what i had said and so, my friends response didn't make sense. i had an idea of what i said, but i couldn't place it.so, my mother most likely has the disease. she's 65. her mother had it, began showing symptoms at 70. and i'm 29, and just kind of panicking.anyone have advice?","I'm 29. My memory used to be great, but it isn't anymore. Should I get a diagnosis?",0

"how the heck has her body not overruled her and just crashed?! i know she's tired; she stayed up watching tv with us til around 10pm last night. but every 5 minutes or so, she'd catch herself nodding off and she'd force herself awake and sit up ramrod straight and look around and then relax back in her recliner. and she was cranky as fuck, partially because she refused to take any of her medicine, two of which helps her calm down enough to sleep. obviously when we put her to bed she was wide awake :/ my dad stayed up until like, 3am making sure she stayed in bed. she did, but every time he checked on her, she was wide awake! then around 5 this morning my mother went to check on her and again, wide-ass awake. mom got her to take one of her meds that help her sleep, but maybe she didn't swallow it or spit it out when mom left her room, because i checked on her right before i started making myself some breakfast (~9am), and of course, she's still awake. wtf r/dementia?! it's been over 12 hours!!!",Grandmother's been awake since yesterday morning!,0
"i hospitalized my 83-year-old father on 9/3/17.  if interested, there is a background post in my history (r/passport).17 days ago, i found my father in the kitchen, frying eggs after he had come in from a walk.  he was steady, agile, multi-tasking on the stove.  he was his usual robust-as -an-ox self, a man so strong and healthy that he always judged people suffering common ailments (flu, shingles, pneumonia, etc.) as ""lazy.""well, this my father disappeared on 8/26, was found in mexico disoriented a few days later, we rescued him on 9/3, and drove him straight to stanford hospital from the airport.after sleeping well, eating well, the man in the hospital was not the man i have known most of my life.  the man i knew was a narcissistic, verbally and emotionally abusive, man who would not give you the satisfaction a smile or even neutral demeanor; berating and humiliating his wife and children seemed to help him grow stronger, taller, satisfied.  the man in front of me now was laughing, joking, giddy, behaving like an eager child awaiting his favorite teacher who promised to read him his favorite books.  where did the eternally angry, disapproving man go?my husband suspects dementia, which can't possibly be diagnosed during a 3-day stay at the hospital.someone told me that this giddiness in the elderly is an end-of-life symptom.  zany.  but i don't have a better explanation.does this change in personality sound familiar to you?  if so, i would love to hear your story.edit: changed ""any"" to ""a""adding: please let me know if i should post this elsewhere.",Am I witnessing dementia?,0
"my grandmother has chronic constipation. like, ""meds work for 2 days max and then she doesn't poop for a week"" chronic. and for the bonus, she's 20/80 on realizing if she's peeing/pooping on herself, and 10/90 on actually telling someone. if we're getting ready to go somewhere and grandma doesn't want to go, one of my parents will stay home with her while the other and i go. so with that combo, we're at the point where, if half of us are going and half are staying with her, she waits right up to the point were about to walk out the door, to speak up and say she's gotta go. we can't just leave because it takes all of us (dad opens windows and passes items into the bathroom, and mom and i sit grandma on the toilet because she's probaly not done and then wipe her or shower her if she needs it and sit with her to supervise and make sure she doesn't get up to grab something that suddenly got her attention and then redress her because now grandma's all worn out and too tired to even stand so she's 120-some lbs of dead weight) to do the full clean up job. all of this takes no less than a half hour, by which time if we were going to say, church, we may as well not go because grandma's church is a half hour away. so that situation's happened about 5 times now, and it's rather new. so is this pseudo hostage situation (lol) gonna be our new normal?",Is this a new stage for us?

"hello! i'm making my first visit to a new patient tomorrow, and could use some advice on how to connect with her. she is in her late 80s and has advanced dementia - she does not speak english, and even in her native tongue, her speech is nonsensical. she apparently can get quite agitated, but i've been told she responds well to having her hand held.should i try to look up some phrases in her language? or would that be confusing/unhelpful? i'm hoping that non-verbal communication (holding her hand, facial expressions) will convey the important stuff (mainly, that i'm glad to be her), but i'm willing to try anything to get on the same page with her.thank you in advance for any advice :)",Hospice volunteer with question about non-English speaking patient with dementia (x-posted to r/hospice),0

"so i strongly suspect that an elderly relative has dementia. she is isolated from the rest of the family because of things she has done in the past. i don't know who has poa, if anyone. she has said that her dr. suspects dementia ( i don't know the doctor's name) so she is switching drs. this relative is paranoid and hostile at the best of times, it is all getting worse. thing is she won't go for medical attention because she has 2 dogs and won't leave them. the dogs are a mess too, one is very ill but untreated and the other is extremely unsocialized and terrified of everything. i can't take them. i would like her to be assessed properly but have no idea how to initiate that. she is not co-operative about anything. we are in toronto, ontario. any ideas?",Suspected Dementia,0

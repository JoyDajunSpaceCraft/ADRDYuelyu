"Hey all. To make a long story short, after a string of traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of Alzheimer's. My great grand-mother was also affected by Alzheimer's; however, she was older than my nana is now.
My nana has been divorced and my papaw is remarried to my mamaw (all these familial terms, lol). She has never hated my mamaw, maybe not liked, but never hated, though she now is certain that my mamaw and papaw got married immediately after my nana and papaw got a divorce and it burns her up. She genuinely believes it with her whole heart. To make matters worse, my nana was the one cheating on my papaw! So there's that.
I would argue that my nana is still in touch with our reality to whatever extent, but our timelines and belief of how events played out is so different. How the hell do you deal with something like this? Do you play into it, knowing it's not the truth? Just ignore it? Arguing only upsets her.",,1
"Hey everyone, I'm 22 and new here. My Grammy is about stage 5-6, and my family (me, my husband, and our two young kids) have just moved back to my hometown so I can be the caretaker for my grandparents, mostly my Grammy who is 82. She lives at home with my grandfather, they've been married 60+ years and up until this point he's been able to do most everything for her himself. 

I come over everyday now, about 6-7 hours a day, to help with meals, housework, activities etc. But I'm at a bit of a loss! My Grammy was an avid quilter, loved to crochet, scrapbook, make cards... But I can't get her to do anything! She isn't interested at all in any of those things or even anything in that area. She just wants to sit in her chair. Occasionally she'll read her Guideposts, or watch the Price is Right, but I'm really struggling getting her to do things. I don't want to push her too hard as she can get very testy, but I know it would be good for her to engage in an activity of some sort. 

Any thoughts?",,1
"My 71 year old mother has been dealing with Alzheimer's for many years. I've been bathing her about a year now. Dad turns off gas and locks doors ( supplying details to give a frame of reference ).

She often talks about going home to check on her parents (gone for 20 years) or kids (I'm her youngest at 34 years old) or whatever. She yells at my dad to take her home all the while saying their current home  is actually her house her dad got for her (it isn't).

We are managing, but what's best to say to her? When she pleads to me to pick her up and take her home? Most if the time, I can change the topic and she forgets eventually, but sometimes she gets fixated. Do I go pick her up and drive around? Do I gently remind her she is home? Do I just listen? What's best in your experiences?",,1
"What kind of questions to ask the doctor? My grandmother, whose (likely) dementia has been worsening at an increased pace for the last two or so years, but she was always able to talk herself out of a diagnosis when at the doctors, and my grandfather was in denial about all of it. She now hasn’t been to a doctor in over a year for any reason because she doesn’t like to leave the house. 

Lately she has been alternating between confusing my grandpa for her abusive step father or not know who he is entirely. She would call my dad at all hours of the day and night to tell him there is a man in their house, she didn’t feel safe, and wanted to go home. My dad is always able to calm her down, so although stressful for all involved, my grandpa was still not convinced she needed medical intervention. She oftentimes thinks people are breaking into the house, someone is stealing their money, or spying on them. 

My grandma walks hunched over with a cane. She can barely get around their small home on a good day. She hasn’t driven anywhere in 7 or so years. My grandpa has breathing problems and tires out easily, and often naps. 

Today, for the first time, my grandma left the house while he was sleeping. It is 30° and freezing rain here today, but she decided to go for a walk. A neighbor saw her down the street and took her back home. Grandpa called my dad, who came over and had a hard talk about taking her to the doctor. 

So, on Monday they will call and make an appointment with her GP. What sort of questions should we ask in order to get the full picture and to help my grandpa understand it a little bit better? I know this isn’t going to be easy on either of them, but we want to try to make things as painless as possible. 

Thanks",,1
"Showers are getting less and less frequent for my grandpa. Anyone have any great tips to get him in the tub? I've been living with my grandfather for 4 months as his caregiver. When I moved in he would take 1 or 2 showers per week, but now I'm lucky if I get him to take one once every 2 weeks. I'm sure this is a common problem in this community (I'm very new at this lol), and was wondering if anyone had success with certain strategies. Mine is that I don't let him know how bad he smells but I will make comments like ""man what a beautiful night for a nice hot shower huh?"" And he always likes the idea of a shower, but getting him in there is difficult. It's getting embarrassing to take him out in public

Edit: I'm 31M and he's 92M",,1
"Updates to my last post. Hey Everybody, it's me again. [This was my last post in case anybody is wondering.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ek96ll/super_frustrated_with_this_whole_process/) It was really nice feeling supported from everyone, this sub has really become a source of comfort, advice, and knowledge for me. 

I wanted to give a bit of an update. Incontinence started earlier than my predictions, with the first recorded instance happening last night. I don't know if it was a full-blown accident, as it seems more like she didn't follow bathroom hygiene for a while and maybe it built up to the point of being visible? I don't know, and it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. 

MIL was walking around and had a large spot on the back of her pants that I pointed out to BF. He tried to talk to her about it, but it ended up with her denying and him losing his patience. She eventually took a bath and we swapped out the pants. BF was exhausted and he's been in shock pretty much all night. He doesn't want to believe that this is happening and wants to believe this is a one-off and that she still has another 6+ months before having to worry about continence issues. 

BF is POA, and is feeling overwhelmed, saying he didn't realize that POA meant doing so much. I think last night was a huge eye-opener as even he realizes that fighting with his mom every day to change her underwear is a lot. He's been really sad about this latest step, understandably so. I've tried bringing him to the sub, but he says he's not ready for all that, although he appreciates it when I read some of your posts and helpful responses out loud for him.

We talked it over for a while, and he messaged his sister and we're having a small family meeting tonight after work. According to him, she hasn't been telling him all the awful details that have been happening when she takes MIL out once a week. I'm not sure about this, because SIL and I have talked about it multiple times. He says he was doubting both of our stories because he didn't see it, it hasn't happened to him, and that we were alone when it was happening. I pointed out that he's the one in the family that's famous for having a temper and also that he is a man and his mother has been getting increasingly sexist in the last year or so and that may be affecting the way she addresses him.

We also talked about our approaches to care. He admitted that he had been feeling like I was being a wicked witch and a bit of a dictator with trying to establish care. He also said I was being mean to his mom. I asked for clarification and explained that I keep my tone neutral and use easy to understand words when I'm asking her to do something because any other tone elicits an outburst from her as she really doesn't like authority, or me for that matter. He did acknowledge that I've never yelled at her, or sworn at her, or anything like that and that he didn't know that was why I was keeping voice low and that maybe he had misinterpreted what I was doing. 

BF apologized to me for being mean to me when he's realizing that me being ""cold &amp; clinical"" is simply trying to talk to him about where we are in the process and how to make his mother's quality of life better. He has been a bit frazzled and has never really had a routine, so it's been a constant struggle establishing one. For instance, last night, dinner wasn't even on the table until 11pm! Granted, the accident was a huge factor, but we're just all over the place schedule-wise.

I sat down with him last night and wrote out a schedule of care that she would be expected to get if she was in a hospital, or a nursing home. I told him I was willing to help as long as we could argue that the quality of her life with us would be higher than she would be getting in a home. I also wrote down a list of symptoms to bring up on their next dr visit in February. 

I'm hoping that after tonight's meeting, we can really start in earnest to find placement for MIL, or at least some sort of respite.",,1
"Enjoyable activities? Hi everyone. We lost my grandma to alzheimer’s last December and now my grandpa is progressing into mid/late stage alzheimer’s as well. He is extremely bored all the time and I want to find things for him to do. Right now he pretty much just watches tv. The problem is we have gotten him word searches (his favorite pre-alz), easy puzzles, simple games, etc but he refuses to use them. 

He is very stubborn and still lucid a lot of the time, so things that are too “childish” like busy boxes offend him. He is also still struggling a lot with not being able to drive. 

I feel helpless because every time we talk he brings up the fact that he is so bored and can’t do anything. Does anyone have any ideas how I can help? I live on the other side of the country so just visiting more isn’t currently an option. 

(Background info: he is about to be 87,  formerly a mechanic and handy man, mid-late stage alz, and lives in a small nursing home with round the clock care.)",,1
Needing Help convince reality of identities. Needing help with my wife(69) who was diagnose last January with AD. Since the end of October she has had difficulty recognizing me as her husband and confusing me with someone with the same name and very similar (in her mind). It does seem to come and go but often when she doesn't recognize me she wonders where I am and where I've been. Yesterday it kind of came to a head when she confronted me (she knew who I was) with where I've been. She also thinks she's not living in her home where we've lived for almost 35 years. How have some of you handled this type of thing? Is it possible to ask her to identify something on she and I would know for her to understand who I am? Very frustrating and any help or advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.,,1
"What do you do to keep someone with alzheimers busy/interested? Hi all, what do you guys do to keep an alzheimers person busy/interested/occupied? I know my family member does not seems phased my TV or music anymore. Also a lot of things you give her she wants to eat. I try to talk with her. I wish there was something I could give her to play with. I'm not sure if I am describing this best but any idears would be great.",,1
"Help with grandma’s pills. Hi, I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask. I’ve been taking care of my grandma for the last 4 months. Her Alzheimers gets a little bit worse everyday, but so far we’ve managed. 

Today I noticed she doesn’t remember who I am anymore, that hurts like nothing else I felt before, but my main concern right now is that I can’t make her to take her pills.

I think maybe she doesn’t trust me since I am now a stranger. (?)

Any advice would be great.

Happy new year everyone.",,1
"Looking for recommendations. Hi everyone, 
I’m looking for some advice. My grandma who has dementia/alzheimer’s ( not exactly sure)  lives with my grandpa alone together. He is her main caregiver, although she doesn’t recognize that he is her husband ( she thinks they WERE married at some point but not now ) and that she isn’t in her home. She will try and walk out the door to “walk and find her house”. My mother and I don’t live with them but we are close, we use a ring doorbell to see when she tries to leave and go over to help intervene although grandpa is usually able to handle it. My fear is that one day nobody will notice that shes left and we won’t be able to find her. 
The thing is that she always takes her purse with her, does anyone know of a GPS tracker that doesn’t need to be charged too often and works well, maybe that is compatible with an app. All suggestions are welcome. 
Thanks in advance!",,1
"Gently correct my grandma or allow her to believe what she wishes? Hi all! My grandma is starting to lose her memory (and I believe was told that she is developing Alzheimers, but I'm not sure). Anyway, what do I do? Should I correct her? She never says she doesn't remember things, she just says things that are untrue with regards to recent, current events, and often forgets the year. For instance she thought she was 75 and not 86. She thought my brother was turning 17. He was 21. She says she didn't vote when she did. It was the week after the election. She said she hasn't been to the special exhibition at a museum. My mother took her there the week before. 
I always just let the moment pass and agree with her, i.e. 'Yes, it's a very interesting exhibition, you should go, I know you like that sort of stuff.' 

My mum on the other hand is like:
' Remember we went last week? We went together and you said xyz.'

Which approach is correct? She means a lot to me, and it pains me to see this happening to her. This is a terrible disease. The only plus side I see is that it's happening so late in life and that she had 86 good years. :)",,1
"hello, all! i've recently moved my mom into assisted living, which takes a significant load off of my shoulders. however, she recently experienced her first fire drill there, and long story short, the ear shattering noise added extra stress which put her into a fib. we asked if they could give us a heads up before fire drills so she could get out of the building, but it looks like that isn't going to happen. what can we use to block out the noise other than ear plugs? she really doesn't mind if she can hear it, but it's so loud that she'd like to avoid feeling like she is at a club. i'd love your tips. thanks!",,1
"in december, my father p (m 78) who has stage 6 alzheimers got engaged to be married to his girlfriend of 18 months (f 72) n, who had managed to isolate p from his friends and family and gain control over his finances. in early january, we learned that p & n were meeting p’s longtime accountant and another lawyer to rewrite his will to remove his children and grandchild and give everything he had to n. p had the original will written in 2019 shortly after receiving his diagnosis. although p had failed a capacity test in december and could no longer legally sign his new will or sign his trust fund over to her, he could still get married as the bar is very, very low. despite his severe dementia, p still had many lucid moments and could seem totally fine for short periods. if p signed a marriage certificate, n would have legal control over his health decisions. it would also give her the cover she needed to drain away his financial resources in secrecy, a process she began even before the big day by redirecting the pension payments he received into a bank account she controlled. all n had to do is move him somewhere away from his meddling kids and take away his phone and he would be effectively incommunicado. something had to be done. scammers preying on the elderly in their community was nothing new to them. p’s friends and fam began to plan an intervention over zoom. the idea was that his younger son j (m 51) &  daughter in law s (f 52) would go over to p's house, surprise p with a meeting with all of his friends who would then confront him about their concerns about n and her diabolical plan. after that, j would show p the evidence that they had learned from the background check that n was a lonely hearts romance scammer who had already been convicted of fraud years ago and had lied to him about her own financial situation, telling him she was “loaded” and did not need his money, despite having a huge tax lien on her house. they would also show p a [checklist ]( abusive behaviors to try to get him to see how terribly she was treating him. once he was convinced, they would call the locksmith to have the locks changed, help him pack up his stuff, and drive off to a prearranged airbnb out of state. we also worried she may become physically abusive if he resisted her. early on we had learned that n had quite a temper which worsened when she drank. what would she do if she learned her golden goose was going to break their engagement? timing was everything here. thankfully, p's caregivers gave us a heads up that n was out of town that weekend and that she would not see him until she returned on tuesday. j set the intervention for monday. he said he had no plans to marry n (n wanted this kept secret!) about an hour later i received a text from my sister-in-law reading: on our way to arizona with p!! it would be a difficult situation for any person to realize they wanted to break up with a partner and take the necessary actions to do this, but for someone with dementia they may well be helpless. the other thing we found was that p’s dementia was much much worse than we had known or suspected, despite the increasingly dire caregiver reports. since our contact with him was increasingly limited to short visits and conversations after n arrived on the scene, we had not been able to grasp the severe decline in his memory and communication skills. n took advantage of p’s confusion over his own condition to convince him that he only had mci (moderate cognitive impairment - his initial diagnosis), which was vital in constructing a reality where she was simply marrying a man she loved and who loved her, instead of financially abusing someone dying of a neurodegenerative disorder. on the drive to the airbnb, j reported p had become incoherent after nightfall and kept asking them who they were and where they were going. they learned they needed to keep him out of the kitchen as he would wander around and touch all the knives and even play with the oven burners. it became clear they needed to get him into a care facility as soon as possible before p could endanger himself. thankfully, even at his worst behavior, he continued to be a very sweet and loving person towards j & s.   it would take about a month to get p examined by his doc and admitted into care. until then, they had to keep a very active senior safe and happy in a relatively small space, arrange for a high quality yet affordable memory care, reconstruct p’s finances after n put them under her control and then trashed them, clean out p’s condo and arrange for sale, and do a ft wfh job. first, a man claiming to be a local police officer called asking if p was with j and could they speak to him? j: how could we trust you with p? the sheriffs were standing in front of j's door (they not home) and wanted entrance and to speak with p to verify his condition. we appreciate the supportive comments. wow, what a saga, and terrifying to realize there are people out there who will do this sort of thing. thank you for sharing, and so glad your father is in a better place! so sorry this happened but elated that you were able to rescue p!",,0
"i hope you’re all doing well. we are helpmate, a company run by phd and master's students with a mission to help caregivers and people living with dementia navigate their post-diagnosis journey. **   currently we are gathering expressions of interest for our free pilot cohort-based program which aims to educate and upskill caregivers. the program will run for 4-weeks, comprising of a live session each week led by a specialist in the dementia space (gp, occupational therapist, nutritionist, nurse consultant, neuropsychologist) as well as hearing stories from people living with dementia and their caregivers. we are currently looking to start this inaugural cohort in late april/early may. **are you interested? **   if you are a caregiver and are interested in being part of a tight-knit community of caregivers and want to upskill yourself, please fill in the form below and we will be in touch! **   our team has been navigating this space for months. we have spoken to over 50 different people including caregivers, people living with dementia, loved ones, clinicians, and academics and one thing was very clear to the team. we believe the dementia space lacks a medium for many new and existing families to learn about how to adapt to their new situation. it was also evident that for many families trying to find specific information for their situation, this can also be very difficult as dementia is different for every single person and family. we hope to offer caregivers and their loved ones access to necessary information and surround them with a community of people who share their journey, with our cohort-based program.",,0
"it's been a rough couple of weeks with my mom (64 f). the week before last, she was stuck at home with me because she developed a skin infection on her butt from her nighttime fecal incontinence, and couldn't go to daycare because they wouldn't administer the medication she needed to treat it. on thursday this past week, daycare called me to let me know that my mom was having a really difficult time and complaining of pain in her legs, crying more than usual and just not herself. ""okay,"" i thought, i'll take her to urgent care when i pick her up. well, when i picked her up that day, they came out with three bags of clothes saying that she peed through her clothes i sent her in, her spare clothes, and walked out wearing pants that were loaners. the problem there was, she had not been exhibiting any uti symptoms at home. urgent care ended up not being an option because they all need appointments, and the only clinic that takes walk ins is closed now for the foreseeable future after an electrical fire that happened the week we were there for her skin infection. they got her triaged and we waited in the waiting room for a couple of hours before she started sundowning and just would not stop crying over every little thing. the sundowning actually ended up saving us, because we were able to get her into a bed faster, and who knows how long we would have continued to wait if i didn't bring it up. so we get her into the room, they cath her and say she has the cleanest sample they've seen in awhile, no uti. the pain is so difficult to help her with, because in the previous occasions i've had her seen for pain, it's really hard to pinpoint what's real and what's phantom, and then usually she's fine, but something does seem to be off. she screams as if i'm going to kill her when i try to swing her legs out to get her out of bed, or when i need to try and get her to sit up straight in bed, rather than hunched over to her right, or straining her neck, which will actually end up hurting her. anyway, the er doctor was really sweet and talking to me about life with her as it is now, and suggested looking into getting a hospice referral from her pcp. hospice had been suggested to me by a family friend, and that my mom doesn't actually have to be knocking on death's door, that we may be able to get the extra help just for comfort care. after the past two weeks, i feel like maybe these smaller conditions have just progressed her alzheimer's further, and it might just be the disease pushing her into a new stage (she's already progressed so fast this past year, and has been settled in moderate to severe over mild since after she moved in with me last february). i kept mom home with me on friday just because we were up way later than she's used to while at the er for hours, and i wanted to make sure she got some rest. well, friday morning after she woke up, she was really unsteady and unbalanced when trying to get her into the bathroom to change her, and she fell. i could not get her to understand how i needed her to help me help her get up. when she was a caregiver for a man with alzheimer's before she developed her own symptoms, the man she cared for fell all the time (not hard falls, usually he'd slip out of his recliner), and my mom could never get him up. the man's daughter told my mom she just had to call 911 each time he fell to have ems come pick him back up. it got to the point that ems told my mom that if she called one more time, she'd be reported for elder abuse and negligence. so imagine my immense dilemma when trying to decide if i needed to do the same. i did though, the guys who came were all great, and they were in and out in less than 10 minutes. but now i completely understand why my mom needed the extra help with the man she cared for. i'm thinking hospice might definitely be something i want to look into, but i was hoping to get any perspective from those of you who may have had similar experiences with hospice. any input, general information i might not know, suggestions or advice you may be able to offer would be really helpful! i'm also looking now into either a rollator or a wheelchair for her at this point, because the last thing i need is her falling at home, but also when we're not at home or she's at daycare. that's also kind of difficult to reconcile, because if she is at the point where she's not going to walk anymore, it's just going to make caring for her until i can get her into memory care, 10x more difficult, and it means that she is becoming further and further from who she used to be. i'm just going to share my experience with my dad, alzheimer's and hospice. we had moved my dad in to memory care february 2021. in september, my dad started having some aggression issues and violent outbursts. we tried really hard to get a geriatric psych eval but nobody was open due to covid. by late october, his facility told us we needed to find him a new place. unfortunately nowhere in the entire state would consider taking a man with ""behaviors"". we began looking out of state. i had been asking about hospice for a couple months and they finally agreed he should be evaluated for it. they told me in order to qualify for hospice, they have to have a life expectancy of 6 months or less. hospice came the following day to evaluate my dad and decided he qualified. they started him on dilaudid. we finally found him a new facility that would take him and very fortunately it was just a few miles down the road. we moved him in and the new place seemed great and much better equipped to handle my dad. i visited him a few times and they had a family thanksgiving gathering. my dad passed the day after thanksgiving and caught even hospice off-guard. i got a call that they thought he was transitioning to actively dying but i didn't need to rush down. 20 minutes later i got a call back to say that he'd passed. my dad was on hospice just under a month before he passed. it's worth an ask. their job is to help your mom feel better and be comfortable. i'll be thinking about you, op. geriatric social worker here. if your mom qualifies for hospice, go for it. get the care. get the nurse visits. get the social worker visits. get the chaplain and the art therapy and the volunteers and the pet therapy. welcome them to your home. in 6 months, if she qualifies again, awesome. if she doesn’t, you’ll have all these people from that hospice who know you and your mom who will be able to make recommendations on what to do next. i work in a nursing home and one of the biggest misconceptions about hospice is that the patient needs to be “knocking on deaths door.”  they don’t! instead of getting help and care and support, the family puts it off until the person is literally dying, and then they have all these hospice strangers trampling in to help, which is weird and awkward when the family just wants to be with their mom. emt here. if you can’t pick her up without help, we will happily help you. we understand that the disease puts her more at risk for falls. you are one person, you can only do so much. if it does get to the point where we are being called too often, we won’t threaten you. we will have a conversation to make sure you can find the appropriate resources for your mom. thanks for sharing, sorry i don't really have anything concrete to add. i've read plenty of people's stories where they put their loved ones into a facility that specializes with memory care. do you have something like that in your vicinity? essentially, if you aren't capable of taking care of her yourself, you should think about it to lighten your load. where i'm from, we pretty much only have one hospice in the whole country (less than 2 mil pop though), but it's very much for actually dying people, mostly cancer. most elderly homes offer extra care for people with dementia (basically the more help you need, the more it costs). your story made me realize i need to take care of some holding bars around the bathroom for grandma asap. listen when it comes to dementia, there is no real downside to hospice. you get more support, and there aren't any medications you really cut, not the same way as cancer meds. my grandmother was in a similar way after she broke her hip. we got her signed onto hospice in mid-jan. she was still up and walking around, with a lot of help (lifting up onto feet with gait belt, one person in front and behind, and a walker). even as we got her out of bed and worked harder at the heavy lifting trying to ""exercise"", she eventually was not able to take a step from standing, then could put her feet flat on the floor. we absolutely would not have been able to handle these fast drastic changes without the support of hospice. everyone says, they wish they started it sooner. i recently found out that people with dementia are eligible for hospice at a certain point, because it is a terminal illness-it does not necessarily mean they are close to death. they are another pair of hands (and heart) to care for your loved one and take a little pressure off of you. they have a lot of experience, give great advice, and are not only there to care for the physical/emotional needs of your loved one with dementia, they are also there to care for the needs of family members. it’s a great program, i can’t recommend it enough. best of luck. from what i understand a doc has to be the one to sign off on her being eligible for hospice care. they do it based on a reasonable expectation that the person has 6 months or less to live. my dad ended being on it for many years. when he got hospice care it was very helpful. he got a medical bed to help him sit up, wheelchair and other medical equip to help keep him clean. also nice to have access to home nursing. just because mom is eligible doesn't mean you have to use hospice. you can also pull her out at any time, and to put her back on it, the doc just has to approve, which im told is easy to get. i would 100% look into this. leave it up to doc to decide, and tell them everything. if she is eligible, id definitely look into all the options for starting up.",,0
"my grandmother is in her final stage of alzheimer’s disease. she hardly moves and is bedridden. her nurse sent a picture of her legs with mottling creeping up from her feet - said she would probably be with us for another two days. my mom, my husband, and i went to go see her. my mom sees her frequently, but this is the first time i’ve seen her since january. after my husband and i got home, my mom calls saying she checked grandma’s legs and the colors has gone away. has anyone experienced this with their loved one? yes, and unfortunately it may last much longer than 2 days....try 2 years unless of course the nursing home is planning on ""helping along the transition process."" my mom is 87 and has had dementia since at least early 2006 and is now at stage 7 for over 5 years. she started to develop bedsores last summer until we got a hospital bed, and the in home care nurse helped treat and heal her wounds.",,0
"my dad has been in assisted living for a short while now, and that is going great. the problem is everything else that remains. my sister and i need to prepare his house and its contents for auction/sale. of course, there are some things we both want in the house, and there are the feelings i have to wrangle with of “should i keep this or not?” it’s like dealing with someone’s house after they have died. i’m overwhelmed. i just want to get this task over with and move on, but it feels like there’s so much to do. i live three hours away and have my own family, so it feels like an impossible task. i suppose i’m just venting. did the same with my mothers house. if it has no real sentimental value and i mean “no real” do not keep it. set up 3 areas of a room. make a keep pile, a sell pile (estate sale, let go, etc), and a donate pile. the donation pile helped a lot with making decisions on things because i knew at least someone else could use it and it would do some good. once you start going you will be surprised how little you will keep and how fast the process moves. it helps. i still have boxes of my mom's things even though we emptied her house years ago and she passed away in december. i'm stuck with things that i don't want, but i know she cherished them. i'm in the same boat and totally feel you. we just put my dad in memory care a couple weeks ago and i'm so stressed about his house and all the crap he (and my mom) accumulated over the years. there are so many and i don't want all of them but i feel so guilty throwing them away. there are people who, for a fee, will go through all that stuff and hold an estate sale. that might not be the avenue you choose, but be aware that it exists. a senior center or local realtor could probably put you in touch with one. others have commented on the keep/toss/donate strategy. i've done that too, it's just that there's so much! my approach to big chores is break it down into manageable increments and keep going back to it when possible. since you live 3 hours away, you might put a couple cartons in your car with every trip and work on decisions from your home base. right where i am, too. my dad went into a facility two weeks ago. the kicker is we got a practice run. my dad had been keeping his dad's house for 15+ years his death. was 'cleaning it out' on his monthly and then twice-yearly trips across a couple states. last april, i saw my dad's condition and knew we had to get this house sold, so i got my brother and my dad on board (my dad was a bit resistant but knew deep down he couldn't hold onto the house forever) and planned a four-day trip to 'finish cleaning the house out.' had a realtor all set up. when i arrived it looked exactly the same as i remembered last time i visited like 10 years ago. some items cleaned, but mostly still a fully-crammed house full of stuff. we spent those four days frantically tossing, donating, and packing what we wanted to keep to take back home. packed a 40-yard dumpster to its gills. did a lot of emotional work with my dad trying to get rid of some stuff or get him to realize he has to take things back to his house. now it almost feels easier this time around because i'm practiced and he is not there to have to guide through things. it certainly helps me to read about how other families deal with this. my sister overpaid a cleaning/estate sale service to go thru our parents' house for us. we walked through together (i brought my best friend for moral support) and removed things we wanted. it's easy for us because i live in a different country, that limited what i could take home. i did have to sacrifice some small items to her crazy, and ultimately my friend just started putting some of my mom's knickknacks straight into her purse (my mom is still alive and now in assisted living) so my sister wouldn't keep them. my mom just put those things in a drawer so who knows if it was worth the subterfuge. be thankful you have a someone to help, i had to do this alone. although, i did not have the added “i want that” headache with a sibling. i started by doing many many runs to goodwill but just ended up getting a dumpster. i felt bad about trashing useful items, but it would have taken weeks and no charity would pick up. an estate sale would have ended up costing more than the dumpster since i, of course, kept anything of value. but, i don’t want to freak you out or anything, the house clearing was the easiest part of my alzheimer’s caregiving experience. that is something that could be done and accomplished. i'm in the same, same, same situation ahhh  i'm in front of his new home now, texting my sister, about to check in, thinking about how in a week ill be on the floor of his house hours away going through boxes. and my sister is no help 😤 (her having a new baby and also being in another part of the country is a pretty good excuse though)  you and i and all of us will get through this, because our parents would have if they were in our position i hired a junk removal service and moved the sentimental/valuables to a storage unit. hired a relator and got that baby sold. you’ll feel so much better when it’s done and you’ll hopefully have some profit from the sale to be able to to help fund assisted living facility costs. to me it feels like a violation of their property, since my mother is still living in nursing care. it took me a while to even go there and have a look at what needed doing. if it wasn't for my daughters i would still be stuck. i opened a shed door yesterday and just stood there crying. why did they keep so much junk? we have one room to put all the household items in for sale as we go through each room, cupboard drawer methodically. we will hold a garage sale to get rid of what we can, use fb marketplace for any items left and then call a charity to bring their truck. my biggest problem is getting rid of the clothes. all the donation bins are still full most of the time thanks to the great ovid cleanout everyone seems to have had, and the charity shops no longer want things. if worse comes to worse it will have to go to landfill but i would rather not have to do that. when my grandpa died (of cancer), i did most of the cleaning. keep some clothes you can wear, that's my favourite memento, because i actually use it often (kept a couple of shirts). i have a garage full of stuff i can't part with. maybe we should switch houses and clean each other's parents' stuff. i think i just created a new reality show. my brothers and i will likely be having to do this too in the near future and i dread it, i can see how you would be overwhelmed.",,0
"none of the major risk genes for alzheimer's are in the sex chromosomes, so females can pass those genes to male offspring just as well as they can to female offspring. that said, alzheimer's is approximately twice as common in females than males. how old were they when they became ill? elderly alzheimer's is not hereditary. young-onset alzheimer's is/can be genetic. most alzheimer's patients are elderly. also, women live longer than men on average. men are likely to die younger of other causes before elderly alzheimer's starts to happen.",,0
"i’ve gone through early-onset with family for decades. first my mom when i was pretty young 12/13 until 31) and now my sister from who knows when - past 20 years. my sister is now late stage. i don’t know how much longer she will hang in. i hate it for them, and i hate it for me. heartbreak my whole life. trying to be positive, but some days are so bad. you don’t have to be positive everyday. sometimes you need a break from being strong. give yourself that break, tomorrow’s another day. oh my...that's a very heavy burden on your heart from such a young age. i'm so sorry,this is such a cruel time taker of a disease. my family has it as well, i am scared how do you manage thinking about it happening to you? will you have kids? my wife, 54 was just diagnosed. i feel for you- having to deal for so long. i would love to know more about the varying stages and most specifically what are the indicators for which stages. your story and bravery can really help people. i'm all ears. much love",,0

"hi guys,  i hope this post is fine. basically today my mum has been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease, most likely alzheimers but we will find out more on a second round of tests in 3 months. it's heartbreaking for her because she has worked in the nhs in the uk on dementia wards for the last 15 or more years and has said it's her biggest fear to forget who her kids are. i'm out drinking at the moment (just a disclaimer against typos) but i wanted to ask some advice. of course part of that will be emotional support but another part is practicality. i want to start a conversation about doing things to make her life easier because she is okay at the moment but things will be different in ten years time. for example, she had recently talked about selling her house and mortgaging two to rent out to make passive income. i don't think this will be sustainable with everything in mind so i wanted to advise her to buy something outright that she can own and not have having over her if that makes sense? similarly i would advise her to live close to myself and my brother so if she needs us we are close by. this isn't at all intended to be patronising or anything i'm honestly just trying to start a conversation around ways to make her life easier for the years that are ahead. with all that preamble i wanted to ask if you had advice of things we could think about or start talking about in terms of preparing for the future to make sure she is comfortable, happy and independent for as long as she can be. i'm sorry if i am wrong or stupid with anything that i am saying; she is an amazing woman and my hero and has been a mum and a dad to me and i am just searching for anything i can that will make life better and give her less stress if that makes sense? if you were in the us, i would tell you to get a durable power of attorney and living will. i don't know if you need that in the uk. there are a bunch of resources pinned to the top of the dementia subredit. i would recommend you have an honest conversation about what she wants for her future while she is still able. i'm so sorry you were just hit with the probable diagnosis. between my grandmother and my mom, i've been dealing with alzheimer's for forty years, and when i read these sad stories, i want to be in support, but i still never know what to say. this is going to be a tough time, and keep it simple as possible, but if your mom is still lucid, take care of the financial matters as soon as possible, with an eye towards the very real possibility that living in her own home will not be permanent. the more you can prepare for in advance, the better. having other family members to help, is very important, as well, if you have them. 🥂 don't rush her talking about extended decisions. one thing that has worked well for me is to involve a social worker in some difficult discussions. you might also want to get in therapy yourself to help you cope with the stresses and sadness. it doesn't have to be weekly, maybe monthly or quarterly would feel right to you. i see a psychologist monthly and find it very helpful. i second the top comment. get a power of attorney and a will. im in the uk and helping my nana with it now. it covers both finances and health. i know it sounds controlling and patronising right now - but down the line there will be a point when shes no longer in capacity to make decisions and that is where you as a family will need to step in. this is as a safeguard for her wellbeing and assets knowing its someone she trusts managing this when she cant in her best interest. it doesn't have to come into effect until she's without capacity if thats a concern right now too! there are loads of options. i'm in scotland so if youre in another nation im not sure of the protocols, but speak to the memory clinic about all of this (they usually have handy info packs for both patient and family/carers). most importantly, look after yourself as well as mum! its so exhausting doing all of this at times, as much as you love them. reach out to carer and family support services for advice on how to proceed. theyre the experts at the end of the day. but ill also add that your own mum is an expert in herself; having a frank, open and empathetic conversation (while acknowledging there may be conflicts of opinions or difficulty in accepting diagnosis) is the best way forward to ensuring things are done the way your mum sees fit for herself. its still her and her life, youre just helping making things a bit easier. other little helpful things, you may or may not use them yet depending on how troublesome her memory can get at present:  -leave notes for all important stuff like brushing teeth twice a day next to mirror in toilet, how long and what temp to cook food in micro or oven. keep a notepad by the phone for her to write things as soon as the call ends. - buy a big digital clock that says the time and full date and the time of day it is in full display in common area (nana loves this!) - have a weekly wall planner that has reminders to do things like go food shop or do a bit of dusting  - speak to occupational therapy through social work to get adjustments to the home that make appliances and things more user friendly and safer to ensure shes independent at home as long as possible  - continue with stable routines/habits e.g. leaving keys by table at the front door, going to see you for coffee at the same day and time  - if she takes medications, get the gp to change them to blister packs that portion it into the day of week and time of day which js delivered to her home weekly. call to remind and wait until shes taken it, if this is a point of issue. good luck and stay well all of you xx",,1
"my mom's neighbour is getting worse and her half sister and friend are doing next to nothing to help her, instead, just leaving it all to my 81 year old mom to worry about. the neighbour, who i'll refer to as f, does not look after herself, wears the same clothes for days, repeatedly goes to the bank to withdraw money, which she then secretes somewhere, forgets where it is, then goes back for more, and is often lost, dazed and confused in the street, a mile or so down the road. meanwhile, despite my mom relaying all this back to her half sister and friend, all they say is that, because f is adamant she doesn't want strangers (carers) in the house, their hands are tied. they also just say 'she has safeguarding in place'. uh, ok.  so, it's all on my mom. you can call adult protective service and have someone check on her. when my mom had memory issues and was living by herself, she fell. when the doctor checked her she was ok but  he had a social worker visit the house w  they were actually very helpful with us getting the care she needed and some physical therapy. we had talked to mom before her fall and she insisted on living by herself. well, if it's too much for your mom, she can always step back - she isn't family, after all. but maybe your mom likes to feel needed? if you call the local social service agency, and describe the above, they most likely can have a social worker make a friendly visit. they won't drag the neighbor off in chains, it's more social. they can perhaps offer that there are free rides to lunch at the senior center, or something like that to get her involved. nice of you to care!",,1
"my grandmother is fiercely independent but lately has not been able to function the way she used to. i'm in a worrisome debate if it's regular aging or signs of something more serious. forgetting conversations we’d had the day before and misplacing car keys and stuff all the time 2011, my mom was complaining about the fancy new name that they gave the “tidal wave” that hit japan. there were a few things for me:   - his driving got worse. an excellent driver, he started to get into car accidents. drove a lot slower than usual and would  ignore usual traffic ""politeness"". - he wasn't able to grasp new games, even with my guidance. - we would call each other over skype to play our weekly games. did this for years. as soon as i started to see changes to those key abilities of his, i knew something was off. not being able to pay bills or follow recipes, she would just get too overwhelmed. all the while, refusal to see a professional. hiding and denying changes. and, of course the frequent accidents that weren’t her fault. it took a year but the state finally took her driving privileges away. “he” was always “she,” and “she” was always “he.” that started cropping up in 2017 when she didn’t even register as having mci on the moca (scoring 29/30). that was also the year my 23&me came back showing i had a copy of the apoe4 gene and i knew then, in my gut, my mom was on that path. then, slowly over the next few years, more and more words began to be replaced, if a store closed, it had “died,” if a tire was flat, it was “dead.” now, on her worst days, every other noun is just a “thing.” she’s still early stage and can live independently with very little assistance, but she’s right at the tipping point to middle dementia. praying before eating dinner - he would always do (lead?",,1
"my dad had a fall and his caregiver couldn’t pick him up. she called for a lift assist from the fire department and they wanted to take him in to the er just in case. when i got there, i asked them if they did a uti screen. the doctor said it’s not protocol. i knew a uti had to be the problem with his balance and increased confusion. fell on the carpet) i called his regular doctor and asked him to order a urine test. of course it came back as a major bladder infection. what would have happened if i hadn’t followed up and just let the infection rage?!? what could the hospital possible be thinking by not running such a simple test?!? ugh, so frustrating!! so, insist on a urine test! that’s insane. you can buy uti test strips even on amazon. i kept them in the house so i could check as my husband was prone to them. prior to that his primary care doctor just had me drop off urine to test. i combined these so i only had to get the doctor involved when i was sure it wasn’t just a odd turn. it’s not always a uti but it’s nice to rule one out before it becomes severe. my dad has had 3 bad accidents/falls on account of having a bad uti. first was a car accident (still early on in his diagnosis), another was a horrible face plant onto pavement, and lastly a tumble down the stairs. what is it about ad patients and uti? it’s crazy how much damage they can do to people with alzheimer’s.",,1
"my grandma is far down the rabbit hole and diagnosed with alzheimers or dementia. we are moving her to a care home tomorrow but one of her recurring issues is obsessively counting money. in her own home we just had her constantly pay us money, put it in a cabinet and then give it back to her each visit. now that she's going to a home with outside people, we don't want her having real money just in case. the bank of canada has a fake money printout for children but she can tell the texture difference between our plastic bills and complains.",,1
"i’m worried about my mother. she can’t remember the most basic things. she asks me the middle names of my children, names of family members, birthdays, etc. this seems like the early stages of alzheimer’s. what is more alarming to me, though, is her obsession with things. i’m not sure if it’s related to alzheimer’s and i want your opinions. she doesn’t take it at the same time each day and often skips some to “save money”. for example, if an app she has resets and she loses her ability to login using face id, rather than a password, she will spend hours trying to fix it. when she asks me a question and i’m speaking with someone else, if i don’t immediately answer she will say “say” or “hello?”  she needs immediate answers to text messages or she will send 8-10 at a time. are these all signs of alzheimer’s or something else? thank you for your help. yes, these could all be signs of alzheimers or another form of dementia. get her to a doctor to check it all out. good luck. many of those i experience with my grandmother, who's been diagnosed with alzheimer's. her orientation of time is really off & i've had to learn how to not get annoyed ... and i've heard it is common from dementia educators. your mother likely can't assess the amount if time between texts, questions, etc. anxiety & hyper fixation also seems to be happening, but that could be a variety of diagnosis. have her checked out, good luck! longtime use of klonopin (clonazepam) can cause reversible confusion and cognitive impairment. does she need that for seizures? i took it for years for restless legs syndrome affecting my sleep. after i got off it, my brain slowly became better able to handle my daily affairs.",,1
"my mom is well into the later stages of alzheimer's and can no longer do  any self care. her restlessness and excitability is really  tiring, so we requested a medication to ease her anxiety. to my surprise  an anti-psychotic ( aripiprazole ) was prescribed, and while she does  tell imaginary stories i do not see how this drug will address her fear  and anxiety. anyone got any experience with the effect of this meds with  alz patients, and any relevant advice? i thought something like  lorazepam would be prescribed. i do not have any experience with aripropazol in dementia patients. i will say that after my grandmother (probable alzheimer’s) started taking seroquel, her mood improved dramatically. i have a family member who is a neurologist who has also seen seroquel help quite many dementia patients. i bet many other people here can attest to seroquel’s impact as well. my understanding is that if the dementia is alzheimer’s it will have the intended mellowing effect, however if it is a different type (ftd or lb, don’t remember) it will immediately make the mood worse. my grandmother was also prescribed lorazepam while she was in hospice, but she was one of those minority of people for whom it did not have the intended effect. although it made her sleepy, she became extremely paranoid with the delusion that we had kidnapped her and were holding her hostage. my mil (moderate stages) takes hydroxyzine twice a day and it works well. she takes 10 mg in the day time, and 25 at night. it has certainly worked well  to keep her anxiety and temper tantrums at bay. since she has high blood pressure and takes meds for that, i doubt she'd ever be on seroquel.",,1
"anyone else experiencing their alzheimers loved one clicking when he/she can't remember how to say a sentence? earlier dad wanted to ask me if it would bother me if he turned on the tv but i guess he couldn't find the words. so he just walked over to the tv, pointed at it, and started making clicking noises at me like it was a recognized language. reminded me of that 80's old movie with the coke bottle. my dad went through a clicking phase and even a barking phase. hth mine says 5,5,5, a lot. it's getting to be a challenge. not so far. thank you all for sharing. no i understand better how this may progress.",,1
"my dad became unwell yesterday - very high temp, extremely confused, unresponsive at times, unable to walk. i called the gp who triaged over the phone and advised we call an ambulance as dad was deteriorating and needed hospital care. after 6 hours we called again and were told it would be several more hours. my parents live in a flat and we couldn't get dad up from the sofa, let alone down two flights of stairs in order to take him in ourselves. this morning i called the gp back in tears. he came to do a home visit and has decided that dad is ok to stay home under the care of the community team as his condition is improving. i'm relieved that dad seems to be better today but absolutely appalled. i work in the nhs but i've lost all faith that there's any support. so glad yr dad is better now, i hope he continues to improve. it's shocking that they never even came, must have been very stressful, i feel for you! we have ambo ramping problem here in australia, it's terrible. where are you? i hope you don't encounter this problem again. best of luck! big respect to you working for the nhs. both i and my grandma appreciate all the hard work you do.",,1
"my grandmother has been living alone for about 2 years and at that time more things have had happened that wad worrying as such. ashe has gone away for 2 times already in which my father just bought an gps tracker for her so that she wont go again. after this my dad was much more worried about my grandma, and made her stay here by lying to my grandma that she needs to wait for my uncle. in the first few weeks it was fine and my uncle was able to come to our home again and again, but then in the fourth week or so my uncle left to go to america since he lives there nowadays. this time it was different, it was today where she went out of our house and tried to go to her home. right now my grandma is arguing with my dad on trying to go home, she just wants to go home and me and my mom are very stressed about this situation because it is very irritating and since my mom is a baker, she always gets in the home. and my dad has had enough and had a mental breakdown about my grandma and surprisingly my grandma was fine about it and said sorry afterwards. what do i do in this situation? i desperately need help because it is very stressing for my entire family and my mom wants to leave and rent an apartment somewhere so that she can work in a nice enviroment. does your grandma have memory issues? can someone move in with her so she can be at her house? if she really can’t live alone and she likes to bake, maybe try baking with her so she is supervised. i am sorry i can’t be of much help. i have more questions than answers. i assume your grandmother has alzheimer's disease or something similar. there is a point where someone with that condition cannot live alone. from what you described, she could be at that point. i don't know where you live, but you could see if your local community has any daycare programs for someone like your grandmother. then show your parents the options. you could read with her or do crafts with her while your mom is trying to get something else done.",,1
"my grandma has alzheimer’s and she can barely see/hear so she “entertains herself” by scratching and fidgeting with her nails. does anyone know of a fidget toy or ring or something that would be good for her? i googled fidget toys for adults but i’m wondering if anyone has experience with this and can recommend a product the person liked to use. we have the same issue with my mom and the best thing that works are these plastic shapes that i brought which you thread laces through..i have no idea what you would call them but i found them on amazon, i think they are for kids to learn how to lace things up.. basically it's a flat 2d shape with holes in and my mom threads shoe laces through..she can sit for hours doing them, it seems to really relax her too. hope this helps my dad gets a lot of use out of the [playschool fidget cube]( he now tends to put things in his mouth so the smaller fidget toys aren't safe. we also got him some of those silicon bubble pop things. those fidget blankets don't hold his attention because he thinks it's just a blanket. any catalog we got in we would give to him, until he started tearing it and eating the paper. so the toddler toys have been great etsy has a lot of fidget toys made specifically dementia sufferers. the dots can be picked off like scabs. my mil likes to play with pop-its. i think this a good tactile activity for your grandma who can't see very well. it's like an easy and reusable version of bubble wrap. hope it helps! lap blankets, fidget muff. the dollar tree has pop it’s and such for cheap that you can try. does see like animals or babies? try a baby doll or they have animals that meow and pure that might help my wife has a little pillow with rings, and velcro straps and other little things to manipulate. latest thing she likes is a stuffed dog.",,1

"my great grandmother, recently diagnosed with alzheimer’s, was very fond of her two dogs, a pug and a corgi, however she couldn’t take care of them after the dead of my great grandfather, and has been living alone ever since. i was looking for robotic pets she doesn’t need to take care of, and saw two nice brands. perfect petzzz and joy for all. anyone know if there’s some hybrid with realistic breathing and sleeeping and the same functions as joy for that’s a pug or a corgi? set aside 180 pounds for this, hoping i can give the dog to her before her birthday of april 28. i would think just a nice cuddly stuffed dog would be great. i am going to visit my mom in memory care and was thinking of getting her a stuffed cat toy as she always loved cats. your live, time and caring is your greatest gift. i have seen some folks in memory care with stuffed animals that they hold and love on. i know its a recent diagnosis and you want to do something nice, but id be a little cautious with a pricey niche gift like this. its possible the other commenter is right, your time (or maybe your assistance to her primary caregiver) would *probably* be the better gift now, unless you 100% know shes going to love it, or itll have a great return policy. i got my alz grandma a stuffed dog that looked *realistic* and like a dog she used to have, around the same time i got her a baby doll that looked like a life-size toy.. she thought the *doll was real* and coddled it like a real baby, but was angry and offended that i would give her a toy dog doll. i had to return it. on top of that she did love the baby but it gave her a little bit of anxiety because she was afraid of waking it all the time. in any case good luck, its nice you want to be nice. my mum has a sleeping breathing dog toy. she prefers the more ordinary but lifelike soft toy dogs. she cuddles and talks to them..and it doesn't matter if they fall on the floor or get a bit messy.. the best gift you can give her is time. do things like take her on long walks (if she is capable of doing so). i feel like my grandma would be offended, if i brought her a toy dog (although she doesn't like animals as it is), because she'd still know it's a toy dog. i did encounter articles about pets helping a bunch and i am interested in having a dog myself, although grandma is resistant at this point. i'll keep these robotic pets in mind, thanks for bringing it up!",,1
"how do you handle this? my dad (alz, mid-way-ish through disease process) has diseased toenails that are difficult to manage. should i have a medical professional assist in trimming every 2 weeks? it’s painful for him, but i’m always worried about possible infection. additionally, best shoes for alz. he has these no-tie sketchers but they’re getting harder for him to push on. maybe crocs? think he’d be up for a pedicure? i take my mom in when i visit every few weeks. it’s a huge help and the team at her local salon is amazing. it has become a nice socialization thing for her. or if you think they’re really diseased maybe a podiatrist could clean things up first, and then they’d be easier to manage? following for shoe recommendations. podiatrist/chiropodist home visits - they can treat and cut his nails. crocs for outdoors, rubber soled velcro slippers for indoors. get a podiatry home visit every few weeks. gran is less squeamish when they do it. also has the added bonus that she perks up a bit with someone else to talk too. she wears sandals round the house that are easy to wear but can get cold. there are travel nurses at home specific for foot care. my grandmother is doing very well with birkenstocks made from eva foam, try the arizona model. very comfy, clean very easily (i wear them myself as well). we don't do her nails every two weeks, they grow way slower than mine do. she doesn't want to go to a salon, but she enjoys when i do her feet. i first soak her feet in hot water with salt (very salty, probably around twice the amount as i would use for pasta), squeeze of lemon juice (you can use any other acid on hand) and a pump of soap. 30 minutes is a nice time, but the water is gonna get cold, so check in-between. i got the recipe from a friend that does old lady's nails and feet professionally. after the soak, i first scrub her feet with that black sandpaper thing (i don't even know what's it called in my own language :d) and remove any harder stuff with a rougher stone. sometimes she gets these little blister like things on the tips of her toes. then i clip what i can, her big toes probably have fungal infections because they are very thick and crumbly, but that was before i started taking care of her, so it's probably too far gone to really do anything about it. i'd recommend good clippers, the big ones that kinda look like pliers are a lifesaver with the thick nails. for the end, i use a good foot cream and that's that. i used to do it every couple of days, because her soles were shot (really dry, flaking all over, she also has light diabetes, so that was a worry, etc. we had the same problem! took him to the podiatrist, and they cut his toenails, recommended some fungal cream, and gave us a list of people who can do monthly maintenance for him, including people who could go to where he lives (in memory care). get him the meds if his doctor says it’s ok.  in 3 months his nails will be better. my mum goes to a podiatrist and my dad goes to. my mum is the one with alzheimer's but dad goes with mum and they both have their apps so mum is more comfortable. before that i was cutting her nails and doing fungal nail treatment for her. we just did a foot bath this week, then i trimmed her nails. we used to do it monthly, but hadn't for several months recently. i could tell a difference, as she didn't want to leave her feet in the water for 20 minutes and kept taking one out, so i started after 10 minutes. when she was more lucid, she asked to go to a podiatrist to get her nails trimmed. i had never heard of that and thought it was weird, to but her sister told me that is a normal thing. i too use the pliers type clippers. i had seen them at pedicures before, but my grandmother bought them at walmart. those are the ones i have the best luck with. i don't know about shoes. when she goes out, a rare thing, she usually wears a pair of my easy spirits that zip up. they were too tight on me, to do i had given them to my grandmother who wore a size smaller. i bought some men's memory form slippers that are warm and big enough, but turns out they slide off the hardwood floors something awful. i guess she'll need a larger size or different style in the future. i just go to the nail salon and leave a big tip (like $10-20), which is double or more than what they charge for a trim.... just so they don't hate us going in.",,1
"my moms pretty bad off and believes that my dad who has heart issues ran off to die because he didn’t want her to find him. she also thinks the man taking care of her is her best friend mj. my dad has never left her side and i know it’s killing inside. is there anything we can do to help her kinda snap out of it or is it all just down hill from here?

"my mom has been diagnosed and lived with alzheimer for 4 years. her condition now is really bad and she doesnt have any common sense and manner at all, she can hardly be concious at things and even if i call her mutiple times she wont reply. but lately my brothers turned some sort of buddhism audio for her at night while she slept, i'm an atheist so i dont care about much but then he had to stop because my dad didn't want to involve in religious stuffs (yeah that's audio was kinda spooky for real). after  a few days, one night, it was like 1 am or something, i heard she was mumbling, normally when my mom sleeps, she has somniloquy so i just think that she is sleep talking but then i came closer i realised that she woke up and looked just like the first stage of alzheimer. she remembered me, remembered normal manners, remembered how to calculate and i asked her to sign her name-which she normally can't do, she did, of course sometimes she still mistook things but i surprised that she was concious and looked normal. but when she be able to read the clock and tell the time, she had to sleep and i was kinda afraid that if she sleep, things would be back to normal, and they sure were. have anyone met this situation before?????? yes have had a relatively similar experience. one night i was stepping in for my brother and his partner so they could go out. this was way past the time of her realizing she was sick - it was really shocking. looking back in it i’m glad it happened, it was a nice interaction and i haven’t had a good one since really. it's pretty common, i think. wow! music certainly is a great therapy, especially classical music like beethoven, so it’s worth while to explore different musical genres. i’ve seen these “moments of clarity” over my several years of being a caregiver, and it’s quite spectacular to witness. but people should tame their hopes and expectations that these moments can be repeated and/or extended. continued socialization, music, dietary changes, etc, can all contribute to reducing or slowly down the effects of the disease. how amazing! that must have been nice to have your mom back for a bit. here’s a buddhist rhythm to try. my grandma with alzheimer’s would always respond when i played guitar or chanted this mantra  reminiscing is vital.",,1
"this last year my father's mental condition has been deteriorating. those who've been in my place for longer, how do you cope during the progression? get power of attorney sorted out now, and i mean now. if your dad gets declared as lacking capacity, he can no longer sign to appoint one. then you have a lengthy, complicated and expensive legal procedure to get it done. trust me, that is what i am going through right now. had to call sheriffs a few times and had a few hospital visits. my dad was quite stubborn and insisted nothing was wrong, but i managed to get durable poa set up to help him with this big transaction he was confused on. he probably didn't understand he was signing a durable poa. i don't think i did anything wrong because it really needed to happen. i second and then immediately third the notion to get durable poa right away. it saved the bacon of everybody involved when he finally ended up in the hospital and they wouldn't release him except to a memory care facility. i then would say if he lets you, use the poa to get his affairs in order when you can still ask him questions. emotionally, well, it sucks the big one. my dad just passed away from alzheimer’s, he lived with it for almost a decade. as another commenter said, get power of attorney as that will allow for you or your mom to make important decisions for him. care is extremely expensive especially down the road, so i would try to get financials in order if at all possible. the way to get medicaid to pay for care is to spend down your assets to the point where it appears you have less money than you do, i.e. buying a house or car. down the line you’ll want to get in touch with an elder care attorney as they specialize in this stuff. spend time with him and get him moving and seeing old friends as those things just get harder as time goes by, but don’t feel guilty if it’s hard for you to be around him a lot because it’s simply depressing. i wish you the best of luck. being a caretaker for your parents is one of the most difficult and also rewarding things you can do. fill your mind and soul with patience, compassion and love. take lots of pictures and videos of good times and bad ones too. they become great tools for reflection and learning. she was 52 when she was diagnosed. get your power of attorney in order and before he is too far gone make sure that he has nothing in his name: homes, cars, access to accounts. we hired a lawyer for this. we were able to get my mom on medicare and no one went after my dad for money for medical stuff. my mom is now 57, and she lived in a nursing home, she couldn’t be left alone while my dad went to work anymore, it’s hard but eventually it becomes the normal. feel free to reach out of you have questions. i've dealt with alzheimer's most of my life. first with my grandmother, who declined quite rapidly throughout my high school years, and then my father, whose stroke got the ball rolling in the same year my grandmother passed. the number one thing i can tell you is to have patience, and when he gets combative or starts not recognizing you, keep in mind that those moments are not him, it's the disease. second, power of attorney is exceptionally important. all the upcoming doctors visits and legal struggles will be made ten times easier if you have poa. my mom had poa over my dad, and it was like pulling teeth to try and get her to do anything because she didn't want to admit he was declining either. when he passed in 2016, she absolutely shut down and i had to make all the decisions anyway, but had to string her along to sign paperwork. third, show him old videos if you have any, but also take new ones. cherish those memories. 💜 you or another family member should go to a doctor's appointment with your dad to ""discuss the incident of finding himself in another town."" something like that happened with my dh and the doctor promptly said ""you need to give up driving."" this is huge - most men don't like giving that up (women too, but it seems a bigger deal to men) and having the doctor say it may be the thing that makes it happen. a person with dementia not only endangers himself but others. as for you coping - are you his primary caregiver? if you are, or are going to be transitioning into that role - i strongly suggest you find a dementia caregiver support group. it helps you cope with your feelings as well as learn a lot of necessary tips for helping your dad. get an elder law attorney. get durable poa, **now**. you need the attorney to arrange his assets so that he will be eligible for a medicaid waiver home care and nursing home eventually, without draining the inheritance entirely. does he have a diagnosis yet? if he does not, you may be able to purchase a long-term care insurance plan. he is quite young and if he is also physically healthy, he may live with this for 15 or 20 years. * [ * [   **if you modify your base assumptions and expectations to set up a good environment for him, he can have a normal-feeling life for a long time. ** and reach out for help when problems arise instead of trying to diy until a crisis lands him in the hospital. because every injury and hospitalization (especially if surgery, bed rest healing time, and residential pt rehab is required) will make basic tasks require more help, which accelerates dementia. also, test him for hearing loss. for example, he needs to be living in a disability-accessible, walkable community asap. he must not be living in a home that requires him to drive if he wants to leave the house and do anything. he must have a roll-in shower, a bathroom that can take a shower bench. no stairs, non-slip floors. all these will make it easier for him to live without heavy assistance, longer. later on, it becomes extremely hard to disrupt their living habits because they cannot form new habits. but the home has to be safe. if he can walk to shops without driving, he will be able to socialize, run low-risk errands, and feel normal for a very long time. thank you all for the advice. the poa situation will definitely be a priority once it's all official. i should clarify there are a couple tests they need to do first, but yes, his doctors are fairly sure that this is what we're dealing with. i really liked everyones suggestions of memory documentation, since there's already so much for him that isn't the same and it feels like every month its a little worse. i find comfort just in knowing that others understand how this all feels and how confusing it is, for the family, but also the one diagnosed. like others said get both poas. find the insurance policies, car titles, passwords and any other important documents. i wish i had taken some of my wife when she was better.",,1
i stumbled on this 1-hour documentary this weekend and wanted to  share with you all. it's a former cnn reporter who is now in her 80s and  has the apoe-e4 gene and wanted to know how likely she is to get  the disease.,,0
"hey guys. my father-in-law is under 60 years old and was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer’s about 10 years ago. my mother-in-law had always said that she would like to put him in a secure safe assisted-living facility if/when he starts to get violent or too difficult to deal with. well, now it is “well he didn’t mean to hit me, he thought i was the dog” or “he isn’t going to hit me. he’s just making those motions with his fists.”  let me preface this by saying she has “read all the books“ and she even leads an alzheimer’s support group. i know she knows what she’s doing but i think her judgment is clouded because it is her husband. she is not admitting to her kids the full extent of what she has to deal with on a daily basis. she’s not in denial about the fact of the disease is progressive, and that eventually he will be beyond her capacity to help, but i don’t think she is ready to admit that he is far beyond that point. she wants to have kids and grandkids over but also does not want her husband to be upset and stressed and angry. her kids legitimately had to have a meeting with her to convince her to get help just two times a week with an outside service that can come and give her a break. the hardest part is that she has told me that she doesn’t want to put him in a home because it will make her feel guilty. i know it is hard for me to understand because it is not my husband, but it is so hard to watch her lose control of him and have to take care of him or take him for drives when she really wants to spend time with her children and grandchildren. are we being insensitive in thinking that he is more than ready to be in a secure facility? how do we navigate the conversation that she no longer has the capabilities as one woman to care for a 6 foot 200 pound relatively healthy otherwise man with early onset alzheimer’s? side note: the facility has an excellent reputation and we have family that works there. any guidance or suggestions would be appreciated. there's a saying that by the time a family is ready to consider placing someone in assisted living what they need is memory care. for many people with dementia getting medication right can help a lot with agitation and violence, too, and it doesn't sound like there's a geriatric psychiatrist in the mix. it's definitely worth consulting one. and on a practical note, is it clear that there's money for this facility? that may be a part of your mil's reluctance that she's not voicing. a visit to a certified elder law attorney (even though he's under 65) would also be really important in figuring out how to preserve what she has if medicaid is going to be involved, as it is for most people. in my state also facilities have to have a special license for people under 65, and those who have that license and also accept medicaid patients are few in number. (though those facilities may accept private-pay patients who will switch over to medicaid when the money runs out--that's something that needs to be explicitly asked, and it's also worth asking whether there's a difference in services when they move to medicaid (shared rooms are likely, for instance). has your mil seen the facility you are considering? does the facility have a social worker with whom she can speak and voice her concerns? not a sales counselor but a real social worker. has she discussed her situation with her support group? i have a friend who was hospitalized after her husband with dementia assaulted her. once the person with dementia becomes violent it is past time to make a change. it is my husband who has alzheimer's, and i expect to have him enter a memory care facility in the next ten days. i feel no guilt! he always told me ""i want to stay home, i don't want to go to an institution"" and i always answered ""i will keep you at home as long as i can, but the time may come when i can't do it any more."" that time is now. actually an admissions coordinator asked when i would want him to move in and i said meekly, ""yesterday?"" having to make that call to move a loved one to a memory care or other secured facility is incredibly difficult even knowing it's the best thing for everyone when you get to that point. my mom struggled with it the most and wanted to talk to my dad about it. i discouraged it as it would only make my dad angry (he was too far long at this point) and wouldn't remember. what finally helped my mom realize was when i told her my concern was if something happened to her, his primary caregiver, we'd be forced to put him somewhere and rushed. if we decided as a family, we could research places and coordinate his move for it to go as smoothly as possible. we moved my dad in to memory care february 2021 and he passed in november. my mom broke her arm and needed surgery three weeks after we moved my dad in to memory care. i had to move in with my mom for the first few days as she could not do much on her own then her sister had to come stay with her after surgery. so, had we not made the decision, the decision would have been made for us when my mom broke her arm. mom and dad are on the short end. both were rns for 25-30 years. dad, the one with alzheimer’s, has amazingly reduced mobility. (he had polio in his teens, so he got off with a limp.) mom is his caregiver until she makes up her mind. personal pride still reigns. you know, until dad falls again…  i’ve volunteered to help out, but it is up to her to accept help of any kind. so... he hits the dog? i would say gently that i would like to take over care decisions. if not, i would have a social worker come for an evaluation of both parties.",,0
"hi all,  sorry in advance for this rant but it’s half two in the morning and i realized i just need to get things off my chest in order to sleep. i’ve been caring for a 92 year old family friend with alzheimer’s for the past couple years. i (m22) live in the upstairs of her socal home and have been doing so for just over 10 years. my dad had to move here for work, but socal is very expensive. thankfully she allowed us to rent her upstairs at an incredible price. my dad passed away in 2017 so i’ve been here alone with her for almost 5 years. her alzheimer’s is getting to be quite advanced e.g. i keep getting this awful feeling like i’m catching alzheimer’s just by caring for her, being around her, or touching things she’s touched. i know you can’t catch alzheimer’s and i know those suffering from alzheimer’s need just as much love and attention as we all do, but it’s like a horrible phobia that i can’t shake! i’ve been distant with her, and her daughter only comes to visit for a week or so every couple months. all she really has is me and a few friends who visit for an hour here and there once or twice a week. i just want to do what is right for her and care properly, but it’s impossible with whatever this is i’m experiencing. thanks for reading and any advice would be much appreciated. you definitely can’t “catch,” alzheimer’s, but stress and depression can certainly cause you to be forgetful or have “brain fog” temporarily. i would have a real talk with her daughter about plans to keep her mom safe by bringing in a caregiver or moving her to a facility. i'm 67 and caring for my 81 year old husband who has alzheimer's. since the early days of his diagnosis, i've wondered ""is this contagious? my support group reassures me that it's due to picking up all the cognitive load that is cast off by the patient in this picture. my latest stressor is my husband likes to wander around the house picking things up and putting them elsewhere. he is teetering right at the border between middle stage and late stage, so he takes a lot of structuring, prodding, reminding, etc. i am hoping he can go to memory care within the month. and i could use a little more of an empty nest. good luck to you. one day your selfhood will return! stress, less sleep than usual, all things that can cause what you're feeling. for your sake and hers, i hope you have an idea of your future plans because if something happens, you may be homeless real quick. try to make sure to get some time to yourself where you can rest, relax, etc. best of luck op! and from such young age caring for an elderly alzhms person on your own, wow super very tough, i don't know how you manage - what a legend!. seems you're developing a stress-induced issue? actually, most if not all sole carers do. depression, anxieties, insomnia, eds, ocds, other & all sorts of mental health issues carers develop. so sorry eh, i feel for you, it's great you are aware & reaching out! i guess, your memory issues are result of stress, and the worry about that, is tripping another stress reaction. (some similar things have happened to me a few times too, over the past years i've been caring for my mum, lost my whole life & all my friends & job to move countries back here to care for her. not even trained well paid professionals can do this sort of thing alone for indeterminate years on and on, it's intense. and unless the family are paying you an adequately substantial amount of money to help out, you need to have time to  be living your own life, right? ok you're getting a great deal on rent - but how much of your time and emotional & mental health are you losing? like i get the strong bond you have with kind old lady, and you want to be a good human, but you can't run yourself into the ground for other people and cheap rent. i think for a start you need respite time-off, for sure. some counselling, would also probably be helpful. a proper talking with the daughter to get some other solutions organised. and are you connected with carer support orgs? so often, in the caring for someone else, the carer themselves are left by the wayside. they endure & suffer being the main pillars of support, they also need aid & assistance to remain healthy happy & strong! alzheimers .org or dementia .org can assist you with finding options & details for all those things. they are experts in all aspects of memory-loss diseases & conditions, have tons of free resources, information, counselling, telephone helplines, etc etc. contact & speak with or visit yr area alzhms / dementia org asap! they were life-savers for me, & my mum. of course it's the daughters responsibility to actually organise & arrange services / respite / in-home care / going residential / whatever for her mother, but who knows sometimes family members who live at a distance haven't really got around to finding out all that information - it might be helpful if you can at least get some printed literature / pamphlets / booklets whatever for her, to get things at least productively starting moving along somewhat. and she needs to start organising some more help sooner, not later, not in 3 months 6 months time. it's great you're persevering with college, good on you! i hope alzhms org can help you out with lot of options & info. hang in there, best of luck to you! give an update some time, i'll be thinking of you! \* hugs \* i lived in a house with a very old woman that had dementia. i provided the evening meal and did some laundry until she had to go into a home. i was desperate for help and nobody understood. even the health nurse didn't bother pressing her to see how far gone she really was. i found out how woeful the system is for coping with things like this, even the professionals other than in the hospital. because an ambulance came to pick her up one day when it got too much. only a week before i told her gp that her mental deterioration need urgent attention and i stressed the urgent part. i feel for what you're going through, it's bitterly tough. i found a new level of misery living there. i'm also sorry you lost your dad, i lost mine in 2016.",,0
"hey all. new member here. i guess i’ll give a quick background story; my maternal grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimer’s back when i was in late grade school/early middle school. i was relied upon heavily as her caregiver (assisting my mom and a daytime aid we had most weekdays) and it was traumatic, to say the least. my mom was diagnosed officially last month, but i knew it had been coming for at least two years. the pandemic and some bad doctors really prolonged the diagnosis finally being on paper. i guess i y need to talk to other people who get it. my boyfriend, whom i live with, isn’t as supportive as i need. i do not speak about her like she’s dead, but i can’t call my mom for advice. or to gossip. or to joke about our weird family anymore. we can’t go shopping and try on clothes together anymore. it’s simple things. i feel that (he is a bit abusive but i’m looking for a way out of this, i wish we hadn’t moved in together, it’s so complicated right now for various reasons…) he almost tries to minimize my issues because my mom “is still here”. some days he’s very loving and consoling but most he’s cold and is very critical of her doctors. he’s never met them, but he always makes sure to tell me every negative assumption he’s made. i finally have her with an excellent geriatric neuropsych, and he’s insisting that more could be done medication wise. i feel diminished. like, you don’t think i’ve discussed these things to death with medical professionals?! i’m the only child and my dad is no spring chicken and i worry about how this will take a toll on him. but more than anything… i miss my mom. and my partner is not comforting about it. he has a slew of his own family issues which he expects me to always help with, and i do, but him insisting i’m wrong because i use past tense for certain things regarding my mother is irritating. i’ll never be able to go to a broadway show with her again or bake together at christmas like we did every single year. i’m just so deeply  drained physically mentally and emotionally and all i don’t know how much more of his crap i can take while i handle my mom’s needs. i hate alzheimer’s and i hate the lack of empathy among people. thanks for reading, love and strength to you all 💜 i’m so sorry you’re dealing with such a double whammy of losing your mom and an unsupportive partner. i’ve tried to explain to my partner how many seemingly intangible things i’ve lost with my mother over the last few years (advice, consoling, shopping), and he doesn’t get it either. all i can say is get support where you can, from therapy and a caregiving/alzheimer’s community. i believe men don’t understand the connection between a mom and daughter. my husband (75) has ad and although i was able to see my daughter , we haven’t been able do do any of the fun things we use to do together . it must be harder on you not having those mother / daughter talks and joking around. my best advice is to enjoy the time you do have and  maybe get some videos of her while you can . also a book that gets recommended that may help you. it’s called the 36 hour day your dad may find it helpful as well. best wishes to you and a big hug from a mom. i am sorry you have to go through this and not get the support you need. you said so much of what i felt when my mom went through the progression of alzheimers. i grieved the loss of the mom i knew for 72 years. i missed calling her when i just needed my mom to comfort me and sympathize. i missed so much. then i thought i was so prepared when she did pass away last month. i grieved for her when she was alive,but then when she was actually gone, i couldn't even hug her or kiss her cheek or stroke her hair. i know for myself i had to find some acceptance that i couldn't get the old mom back, so i did my best to find ways to be with her. honestly, some times i really struggled to visit her,but i did usually feel better afterward, knowing i spent time with her.",,0
"if anyone can understand, it’s you guys. i (33f) am my dads only caregiver. he doesn’t need full time care necessarily at this point but it’s coming. i teach 75 minutes away from my home so my dad can stay in the home he’s lived in for nearly 30 years and i fully financially take care of my dad except for his small ssi check. my sister was going to visit from the other coast and take my dad for a few days while i was on spring break so i could live a few days of my adult life in my own home, getting things done around the house that i can’t get done otherwise. woke up to a text that she’s been covid exposed and is waiting on a test but most likely won’t be able to come out and visit. i’d be lying if i said i didn’t lay in bed sobbing at 6am because i’d gotten my hopes up at having a few days of freedom. tonight, went to check the mail and got the notice that the doctors office didn’t get the form in to ihss for our initial assessment and so he’s been denied. there’s no end in sight and once again i’m laying in bed sobbing. i have no help, i can’t get help, and i don’t have hope. i’m beyond burnt out and i’m doing this alone. my friends can’t understand because they don’t live this life. i can’t get to a support group and so my entire therapy sessions are just me desperately crying to my therapist. i don’t need advice. i just need someone to understand what this is. for what it's worth, as caregivers, we do relate to what you're going through. it feels like you're using yourself up taking care of your loved one, missing out on your best years. i wish i could offer more than to say hang in there, it's not forever, even though it might feel like it. take the small moments to yourself when you can, and take some solace in knowing you're doing the right thing. the role of a primary caregiver is usually a lonely one. family members may have good intentions, but are not involved on a daily basis, and soon tire of the intrusion into their lives. what's more, they tend to offer advice when they are not familiar with the real circumstances. because of that they have not been able to develop coping mechanisms to stay in the game. in ten years, i had about a total of two weeks away, and most of that time was spent in the hospital for surgeries and other things, and the family, frustrated by my mother's behavior brought her back to me, the same day i was released from the hospital. in the beginning, i had a knee replacement and because i couldn't get around, elected to take ten days in rehab, so i could partially recover, but my family could not handle my mom, so they brought her back home and dropped her off, and left her with no way for her to get around or anyone to help, so i got two days of rehab before i had to go home. you will be criticized for your decision making by family members who feel guilt for their own inabilities. in my case, they've talked behind my back about how she should have been in a nursing home long ago, even though they were not willing to take on that process themselves. bringing professional caregivers into a home where you also live is usually not practical, and as the patient advances they may become hostile to strangers in their home. in my case, two of my sisters are nurses, and when the time finally came, i threw up my hands and forced them to make the arrangements for the care facility. caregiving for a parent is a noble undertaking that is full of surprises and changes along the way, and only the exceptionally strong are fit for the job, so know that. i am sorry for your difficulties, but steel yourself, because you have only begun on this journey that's full of twists and turns. my wife and i worked hard all our lives and had such grand plans for retirement and this damn disease changed all that. i get up really early so i can have a little me time. see if you qualify for some in home help. is there anything you can do to give yourself a treat or reward? some method of self-soothing or relaxation? my mom died four months ago now and i'm still getting myself together. i'm so used to taking her from one appointment to the next and eventually her needing nursing home care where the phone rang multiple times a week regarding her rage, i still can't hear the phone ring without panic kicking in. i feel your pain 😞  i've been taking care of my parents for 3 years now as an only child with not much help from my own family. both have dimentia and i was just told two days ago my mom won't be able to ever come back home unless she has 24-7 care at home. that's going to be impossible for me to do so it's a crap shoot getting the help from dss. i also just had my first kid and he's only 6 months old so dealing with it all has me literally burnt the fuck out. praying for you in these tough times sister. my mom always said what you put in into life you'll be rewarded in other things that surround you. love your dad. your doing a great job thus far and god will repay you in many other ways. there's no playbook or guide for what we're doing but it's the least we can do for the people that raised us to be great people in life. goodluck. patience is a virtue 🙏 .hugs. i also understand the just crying at the therapist. mine had hearing aids and discreetly turned them down during our sessions. hah! i understand. teaching is also high stress and requires a lot of giving as well. will sister reschedule her visit? even though you won’t be on break-you could get some relief/normalcy? do you have summer off? can she come then? the form—can you re-start the process? the paperwork and appointments can be so overwhelming and they seem to come in waves. one step at a time. write things down and cross them off when done(helps me so i can see progress). find small things you can do for yourself. sometimes it may be having a good cry in the shower. or a quiet cup of coffee. wishing you well. i’ve cried my eyes out more times than i can remember. and for sure, siblings can’t really understand what we go through - they can say they appreciate all you do, and you can tell them all the stressful things you’re dealing with, but they truly don’t get it. i hope soon your sister will be able to come give you those few days off, and then not only do you get time to yourself, but she can also see firsthand what it’s been like for you. take care  eta: i know you said you don’t want advice, but i noticed you said you can’t get to a support group - the alzheimer’s association has free zoom caretaker support groups - it’s helped me to talk to people that get what’s going on, but also have been dealing with it all for a long time and have wonderful advice 🤍 i very much understand! i’m 30 f dealing with sharing responsibility with my sister for my mom (70 f) and her care. my dad died about 6 months ago and my mom is still living at home but unable to do instrumental tasks (cooking, cleaning, filling her own meds). it’s been a massive struggle especially since i’m expecting my first baby in about 6 weeks. i get burnt out very easily and it’s so hard to not get frustrated. it’s hard, just starting out in your life, and having to take care of a parent. denied for what? big hugs. and if health insurance, etc. the disease i could almost cope with, but the shit system of us laissez-faire capitalist mangled hell care is the thing that's really messing me up. i understand.",,0
"hello so trigger warning i guess is in order but a week ago we had to put our dog down as she was in pain from a tumor and that night my grandma stopped eating and the morning after she stopped drinking so it was obvious she was starting to decline and looking to be entering the death process on  wednesday she seemed to get worse and worse by the day and by that morning her 02 sats were ""low 90s high 80s"" friday she calmed down enough to have her go to a nursing home because her care was overwhelming mom and she required almost 24/7 care so we had her transported there and we came to visit that night and they had a o2 tube in her nose which confused us so we asked and they told us her 02 during transport was 71 so they put a tube in and then they just kept it going at the home i get them doing it during a transport but not at the home they say its for her comfort and wont prolong death but i dont buy it to be honest it seems like a part of death and i feel some people with alzheimers die this way so it seems like eliminating a way of death which to me is prolonging death at a certain point her body just wont function on that low of a oxygen level so giving her oxygen seems like prolonging i get that it might be for comfort but to me death is uncomfortable the body doesnt like dying i can understand the morphine and haldol because those dont do anything other than help with pain and restlessness it doesnt help life but the oxygen seems like it would help her live longer she needs to pass soon and quickly she wouldve hated living like this and she would want it to be as quick as could happen also this nursing home is questionable i went to check on her today and the door was wide open which would be fine if i didnt walk in on her completely naked on the bottom edge of her bed just sprawled out and she had a few visitors earlier shes supposed to get morphine every hour an haldol every two hours both people said in the few hours they were there they never had a nurse come in and they had to get them to go give her her medicine which irritates me so im kinda questionable on their opinion so id like an outside opinion  tl;dr: my grandma is dying shes at a nursing home and they have her on o2 which confuses me since it seems like it would prolong life the home says its just for comfort but it seems as if it would prolong life im all for comfort but death is uncomfortable and it seems like they are preventing that way of death so does o2 prolong life not an expert. my understanding is that oxygen just makes it easier to breathe, it doesn’t heal infection or damage to the lungs it just makes it so your lungs don’t have to work as hard for basic breathing. it’s not the same as intubation. my grandma died at home in march. she will just need a doctor referral, i'm pretty sure. also do you guys have a medical directive? we have one for my dad that covers all types of care and we made a decision as a family what we would allow and not allow. takes the pressure off last minute decisions. i am an rn on a dementia unit. i see this a lot. current belief is that supplemental oxygen is for comfort. in addition, we administer ativan liquid and morphine at scheduled intervals. most of my residents pass quietly and (i assume) comfortably. i assume your parents or other relatives are your grandmother's medical poa, and have already had end-of-life discussions to know what she would want. you don't need to understand the reasons for the interventions. if she is not being medicated on schedule, call it to the home's attention and ask for an explanation. also inform the medical poa, usually a relative.",,0
"my mother is a resident in a really nice memory care facility. last week she had another resident (a male who is a wanderer) come into her room in the middle of the night and crawl into bed with her. we got her calmed down and got her out for lunch so they could clean her bedding and make everything ""clean"". mom is usually really focused on keeping her door locked to keep anyone from getting in her ""apartment"" (there are a few residents who wander in if the door is open during the day so she keeps it closed and locked whether she's in there or  not), but she must have not locked it. we talked to the staff (they're great) and they said that they'd check her door every half hour at night and also if they happened to be walking by. so all seemed to be under control. however - my mother needs to feel secure in her room. i am looking for ideas or thoughts on how to handle this so mom feels safe - without making a big deal and getting this man in hot water, if possible. tia. my husband who gets into my personal stuff at home, is now doing the same thing at adult day care. staff informed me yesterday he has been going through other people's purses or backpacks and taking items out. i asked him about this and he denied doing it, but i trust staff's memory of events better than i trust his! i know it's not the same as wandering, but kind of similar. no advice, just wanted you to know this is definitely a feature of the disease. good luck to your poor mom. could the facility alarm her door during sleep hours? i'm sorry, i find it totally unacceptable that patients are allowed to wander at night. there is all kinds of alarms/technology to prevent this. i saw one little old lady that would just up and slap other residents. it's on the facility to make sure residents are safe. you must stay on management, most are profit driven, but you are a vital link in oversight. raise hell if necessary, i'm sure your paying$$$_. your mom’s right to feel safe trumps this man’s freedom to wander at night. i have no doubt he has no clue as to what he is doing; nonetheless, the facility needs to control this behavior or he needs a new level of care. if this were happening to my mother i would be most unhappy. they need to handle it. you need to raise hell with the facility. that it happened once, you were understanding, they told you the solution they would implement, you accepted that, and then it happened a second time and that’s entirely unacceptable. it sucks for the family of the man, but you have your own loved one to worry about so i would say that if the staff isn’t capable of protecting your mother from another patient, either those staff members or that patient needs to be removed. and you want monetary reparation on top of that since you’re paying $$$ for the safety and security of the room and its occupant and you’re not getting that, twice now. say you’re considering leaving a couple of reviews online about the negligence of the staff there, and how unsafe your mom feels because they apparently have no alarms, locks, safety measures or competent staff in place to prevent people from wandering at night. that’ll get their attention. don’t *expect* them to give you any compensation (and dont threaten to remove her, i’m sure they have a waitlist a mile long and will gladly take you up on that threat), but reminding them that you’re financially invested and have the power of google reviews might put a fire under their ass to do better. honestly though, get her on a waitlist for another facility. it seems as though you can’t trust the staff at this one to do their jobs. if the night staff get fired over this, and i say this as a professional caregiver myself, they absolutely deserve to lose their jobs for this level of negligence. it is not hard to prevent this situation with 24 hour awake staff plus modern technology...i’d worry about where they are dropping the ball in other places. or that despite the crazy amount of money each resident pays to stay there they are purposely understaffing to make more money. i know moving someone with dementia is hard and expensive but this is so unacceptable to me and would raise so many concerns about the quality of the staff and the safety measures they have in place. that man should never even be able to leave his room after bed time. ridiculous. i hope you get this sorted promptly, they give you a discount for her disrupted month, and they hire new night staff. oh my god.. i’m sorry but your poor mother, i can’t even imagine how terrified she must have been. this is unacceptable my dad was the wanderer but i sort of think he was doing it on purpose because the only part of his mind that worked was the, ""where da ladies at?"" i sure hope he didn't scare anyone. bed alarm for him. maybe one of those child safety locks for her door.... so she can get out but it takes a non-dementia person to figure out how to open it what facility? i am looking for a good one for my dad. feel free to pm if you want.",,0
"phew, documentary filmmaking is running me ragged, but i got some time this week to write a couple of caregiver tales! [don't-care-caregivers: what are the options when you feel like you're out of options? ](  [what's the scoop, poop? i spill the dementia family caregiver beans on the rodgerthat podcast. ](  p.s. wow, i'm still reading but i had to stop to write this:   i'm just after another crazy episode with my mother, scrolling through reddit. with one hand on my head thinking of post here this exact same question! i just can't do it anymore. my life is ruining, i lost my job, i've depression, nobody want's to be with her because she was a horrible person all her life let alone stay and live with her. i lost my job, i  lost my gf, my family doctor already knows that i got depression because of this. she kick me out of the house at least 30 times during these 3 years after i spend a day collecting my stuff, hiring movers she then calls me anytime between 2 hours to 10 hours later begging me to come back. i've reached the point that i just can't do it anymore. i lost so many things in the process, i basically will have to rebuild my life when this is over. don't care caregiver should be a community flair. thanks for sharing as always!",,0
"my mom has been seeing a neurologist and a few months ago she took some kind of written test to see whether she has alzheimer's or not. i'm not entirely sure what the test results were as my mom can be rather private about her health and down play things, but the doctor ordered a brain mri for her. my mom sat me down yesterday and told me that the mri does show alzheimer's. she has not been back in to see the neurologist yet as the doctor is booked out pretty far, but my mom is on the wait list for an appointment so hopefully she gets in soon. i'm not sure how far along the alzheimer's is or if they can tell that from the mri, but my mom seems to think she only has 4-5 years left. i have suspected for a few months now that she may have alzheimer's as she has been having memory problems for a while (started when i was in high school) but have noticeably gotten worse recently. also, alzheimer's does run in her family. she did have a brain mri done 2-3 years ago (i'm not sure if it was related to her memory issues or not) and they said that everything was normal; i'm not sure if maybe they missed something or if there really were no signs on the mri yet. she forgets things we have recently spoken about, sometimes as close as ten minutes ago. she forgets what she was doing. she doesn't clean things up around the house (i.e her dog pooped indoors and she just left it there). she forgets to bathe. however, i do think things are worse than that. she wasn't even going to tell me the results of the mri and was going to pretend that everything was normal but my dad convinced her otherwise. she has not told my younger brother yet. i feel very lost. i'm about to be 24, so i know that i'm an adult, but i'm still finding my footing in the adult world and trying to figure out my place. i don't want to lose my mom. i know i have to step up and help her, though i have no doubt that she will try to leave me out of everything and handle it herself, as she doesn't want to feel like a burden though i have assured her that she is not one. i'm sure my dad will help her with things but, while they are still friends, they have been divorced for over a decade and he works long, demanding hours. i wouldn't mind moving in with her to help her but she will not let me. she says that she will stay in her house for now, and hire someone to come during the days to help her. and when that no longer works/helps, she will move into a care home. i just wanted to confide in y'all and hopefully get some advice. my mom has told me not to tell any of my friends, which i understand and respect, but it means that i have no one outside my family to talk to about this. for those who have a parent that has been affected by alzheimer's, what was it like? what should i prepare myself for? what is something that you wish you had been told? how do i help someone who feels bad about asking for help? any and all advice is helpful. going forward, you will find that unless someone has a parent with dementia, especially early onset, they just will not truly get what you are going through. having a grandparent with dementia is not the same thing. you will find that the best support and understanding you receive is from others in the same boat as you. hiring caregivers and then going into a facility and not looking to young-adult children to take on caregiving is 100% what's best for her and you. her words right now are very important - don't forget them. she wants you to remain her daughter, not become her caregiver. many adult caregivers of parents with dementia are totally breaking down under the stress of caregiving, and wondering what our parent would want if they were in their right mind, or if our parent would understand if we need a break and have to hire professionals or place them in a facility. you already have all that information right from your mom's own mouth. dementia varies a lot from one person to another so keep in mind that your mom's symptoms and experience may be different from what other people tell you about. also, unless your mom has vascular dementia and a history of strokes, i think her 4-5 year life expectancy prediction will probably be wrong. i'd like to go back to times that i previously was complaining about - because i didn't realize at the time how good things still were. i’m 20 years old, my grandma had dementia from around 70 i would say. she’s 80 now, however i haven’t had to take care of since 2 years ago. i wish i could give lots of great advice, but i’m still learning myself. also, it gets easier, you learn what works and doesn’t i was a few years older than you when my dad diagnosed. i’m so sorry you have to go through this. being young makes it even more unfair. i highly recommend getting an elder law attorney as soon as you can. they can help you get durable power of attorney, health care power of attorney, etc. they can also help you navigate your mom’s assets. its important to do this while your mom is still mentally capable. one thing that’s not fun to think about, but important, is to talk to your mom about her final wishes. you can plan and prepay for her funeral. you can ask the funeral home to store the funds in a way that makes it so medicaid can’t take them. it’s also important to make sure there’s nothing left unsaid between you and your mom. the alzheimer’s association helpline (800-272-3900) has helped me a few times when i had questions and i wasn’t sure where to turn to. they are extremely caring and helpful. i also recommend starting therapy and making sure you take care of yourself. it’s also important to make sure you still live your life, you only get one. i dont have much advice but ill share my story in hopes something resonates with you. i was 29 when my dad was originally diagnosed with ad in 2019 (since then was diagnosed with cbd/cbs). every day for a month straight after diagnosis, i cried. all day. i felt so lost too. i went to work at cried at my desk. but every time i saw my dad, i was okay. i didnt cry. things have progressed (or regressed) and its now hard to see him but i can cherish every second im with him. having him keep talking about childhood memories and music makes him light up he is so happy when he remembers the life hes lived. its such bs though that we have to go through this. i get so jealous when i see my friends with their parents, enjoying retirement. sometimes its oddly comforting to know that others your age are also dealing with this. my mom is much older than yours and she was diagnosed a year ago. i'm not sure how you can prepare yourself, but there are a lot of resources out there. [  i found the attached to be helpful. best to you and your family. my dad was diagnosed in 2015 when i was 19 and he was 62. he had been showing symptoms for many years. my dad is now in a full time care facility and he has lost all his abilities. i want you to know that it will be hard. you will be grieving and you will be frustrated with your mother. please be patient with her. i wish i knew how little time we actually had. sorry if my comments doesn't make sense. i dont really know what to mention as there's so many things. ask me anything if you want. in 2019, my mom, 61 years old, was diagnosed with early onset ad -- which, like your mom, ran in her family. unfortunately it's impossible to know exactly how much longer someone with eoad has, but generally, in the case of eoad, the long-term prognosis is not great. you're going to be taking things one day at a time. and then later it'll become one hour at a time. it's very likely she'll lose any social filter and start saying mean, hurtful things. prepare yourself now for these things so you don't end up taking them personally when they happen. my mom has just fairly recently lost track of her grandkids' names (there's only 3 of them) and about a year ago lost track of who's kids are who's and who's wife is who's, but she still seems to very clearly know my brothers and i.  it's the disease that's doing this to your mom and mine, and it's a fucking awful, no good, bag of shit disease. help out subtly when and where you can. if the dog pooped in the house and she's skipped over cleaning it, then just clean it and keep life moving on. keep tabs on her rx and daily intakes to make sure everything's happening as it should -- and nothing's happening that shouldn't be happening. do what you can to be as present and patient as possible. it's very, very hard on the family, but also it's our moms that are the ones constantly confused, disoriented, and trying to figure out day-to-day life when nothing makes sense anymore. another thing... be kind and patient with yourself too. take breaks when you need them. my dad was not diagnosed until 2018 with alzheimer's and we suspect he'd had it since 2009 or so. he had a severe decline over 2020 and we ended up needing to move him to memory care early 2021 as my mom could no longer care for him. my dad passed away at 71 in november of 2021 and the last few years of his life were some of the most challenging. if you have personal friends/family who have experience, reach out to them. i found this subreddit to be particularly helpful in my darkest moments. ask all the questions and get all the history and life stories while you can. good luck and god bless. i’m only 19, but my mother was diagnosed about a year ago (the date should pass any day now) through her spinal fluid. at the time she was a registered nurse, but just before the diagnosis she lost her job at trader joe’s. at that point, my father was giving her a lift to work and home every day. when i was 18, she destroyed her car in a wreck because she somehow completely missed seeing someone right in front of her. we managed to hide it from the insurance company but she no longer drives, which i think was the best decision. **if this hasn’t happened a lot yet, expect it to start. 🤍 the whole process is brutal. she had already stopped driving 3 years earlier. 2 years later she was already getting lost in her own neighborhood, wandering in parking lots when told to wait, and telling outlandish stories that made no sense and her memories were already bad at that point. by late 2016 (literally 10 years later), she was clearly already in late stage dementia and had no idea what was going on anymore. prior to that i was fortunate that i had older tenants that rented rooms in her house that kind of looked after her. my father who was divorced since i was a child also came around so that helped too. i finally had to move back with mom along with my family when she got to the late late stages of the disease in 2018. she got to the point where she would just wander mindlessly in circles around the house, talking to her delusions, and go to bathroom in trash cans, or on the floor at times. later that year she had no idea who i was anymore and i am her only child. in late 2020 she lost the ability to stand and has been bedridden ever since. she is currently 87 and is completely motionless for over 17 months stuck in a hospital bed and just mumbles to herself all day long. to say her existence is downright horrible is an understatement and we all suffer right along with her because we really can't go anywhere now and haven't done much of anything for about 4 years and i have to do literally everything for her. i truly believe my mom's case is an outlier case as most patients don't last this long from what i hear from others (even her own doctor put her on hospice 2 years ago and didn't think she would make it far along into 2021), yet here we are still. nothing about this disease is predictable or easy. some days are better than others, the worst years for me were 2018-2020 when she was basically an out of control angry zombie like personality and would try to cause damage with any items or furniture that she passed by. now she can't do anything so it's a more controlled environment with lots of downtime, but very hard to watch none the less. the hardest part for me now is juggling her care while trying to offer a normal childhood for my two kids, but fortunately my wife helps me alot with the things i just can't do right now. hope this helps, good luck! my best advice is a second opinion with a memory specialist neurologist. misdiagnosis is common in the 50s age group and a brain mri cannot show alzheimer's. they are not very diagnostic and at most you can try to appreciate patterns of atrophy typically seen in alzheimer's but it's not too absolute. a spinal tap looking for ad markers or an amyloid pet scan would be much much more useful than an mri. everything that you described is also seen in pseudo dementia as well so it is important to make sure a miss diagnosis has not occurred. my father is now mid to late stages and while i’m older than you this might help. try to spend plenty of quality time with your mom now and take pictures. eg go to parks, zoos, beach, hikes. make some nice memories for yourself. try to get your mom on a good diet now. decent nutrition will help keep her mind healthy longer, whether it’s meal delivery service or whatever. do those legal things, even though it will likely be awful. also find the care home she likes now so there are fewer questions later. best wishes i appreciate you sharing your story. 30 years old here with my mom getting diagnosed with eo a few months ago at age 59. it has rocked our world as it has not run in her family up until this point. i had joined a support group for a meeting but all the caregivers are also older and just felt like i couldn’t connect with them. if you or anyone else would like to connect just to talk and vent about being a young adult who has to deal with this shit situation, i’d love to find a way for us to find a forum to do so.",,0
"personally i'd rather see the alz association focus on getting long term care covered by medicare, using the same force and energy they're using for this drug. or they could do a better job of creating more local support groups. or publishing more useful guides - it's interesting to me that many of the great guides or books like teepa snow never seem to be recommended by them. rather than bankrupting medicare for a drug that doesn't work, money would be better spent on research into preventing dementia and providing care for people with this god awful disease and others that require long term care. heck, money would be better spent on covering dental care.",,0
"this question was posed in 2017 and 2018 in this sub, but now that a bit more time has passed, i'm wondering if more people have read the book and tried the recommendations? i'm especially confused about how ""extreme"" of a diet do we need to follow? and since  damage starts occurring in the brain starting in 30's / 40's, my partner and i want to make sure we follow a brain healthy lifestyle, given his family history. thank you!!! it’s not grounded in repeatable science. in other words, you can’t prove a causal relationship between the proposed diet and alzheimer’s progression. it’s unfortunate, but anything that claims to solve or cure alzheimer’s is unlikely to be real unless it’s brand new, and coming from a major medical institution or medical journal. sadly it is as horrible as bredesen, perlmutter, or oz. if you want a diet to help alzheimer's, cut out as much processed oils (canola oil etc) and with it, fried foods as possible. the genetic link between alz and dementia is explicitly tied to the oxidative byproducts of fats (all kinds). the last group is 5% of the population, and account for ~1% of cases (protective variant). the differences are related to the protein's ability to detoxify the lipid oxidation byproducts. exercise, sleep well, heart healthy diet while knowing that it might not work. saved you many pages.",,0
"my father (m, 70) has been confined to a wheelchair for about 15 years, and is reliant on help for even getting out of bed and going out and about. my mother (f, 61) is there to assist him, and we are lucky to be able to afford carers who tend to him. recently, over the last few years, he has become noticably forgetful - from both small things, such as what day it is, what he had for lunch, or what time someone is supposed to come over, to other more things such as my brother's birthday, his cousin's name, whether people are dead or alive, etc. sometimes he will ask the same question 2 or 3 times during lunch or dinner, not realising that we have spoken about it already barely 5-10 minutes earlier. it has reached the stage where it is noticable even to people who don't live with him, but are meeting him socially. the problem is - he is refusing to acknowledge these things happening. in one instance, even when on text message he mentioned something unfathomable, and we tried to show it to him as 'proof', asking him what he was trying to say, he just shuts up and shuts everyone else out. looking at early symptoms of alzheimer's, he is displaying a number of them: forgeting about recent conversations or events; forgeting the names of places and objects; asking questions repetitively; becoming less flexible and more hesitant to try new things. but he refuses to see a doctor. i really am not sure how i even proceed with this - i do not live in the same city as my parents, and i know that my mother is quite anxious about what the future holds. in her opinion, even if we just know what is happening, either way, at least it makes it easier to deal with - if a diagnosis can be confirmed, wouldn't it be better to start treating with medicines as early as possible? and if he is being this stubborn now, and he does indeed have alzheimer's, what is it going to be like as it progressively gets worse? in the last month itself i have felt it get worse. any advice is appreciated, both on how to approach my father and try to make him see a doctor, as well as how i can help my mother cope better with this. thanks in advance! you can't really treat it very effectively, so i wouldn't stress about getting a diagnosis, unless you expect you'll need it to get subsidized care or some other form of government help. does your father visit the doctor at all? my grandma got a mental ability test during a routine checkup at her usual general practice doctor. you do just a couple of things, doesn't take long and it's enough to get the papers. have your mother talk to the doctor beforehand about what's been happening. i would request that the doctor tells him what kind of test is being done, my grandma felt entrapped a bit, because it wasn't explained clearly to her. does he take pills as is now? it's more important to start figuring out how you'll deal with more and more advanced care your father will most likely need. can you mother handle it alone or should you start looking for help? do you have to enroll him in a home sooner rather than later because of waiting lines? best to be prepared. start educating yourself and your mom about the disease (and i mean dementia here as a broad umbrella term, i don't think a specific diagnosis is very useful in patients with gradual onset over a couple of years), it's more about coping with it for carers. you have to stop caring about repeating things and getting asked the same questions, takes a little practice to get used to it. for example, my grandma always has this one story about someone stealing her bed sheets (partly true story, partly i removed some when i moved in with her). i stopped convincing her that it didn't happen, i just listen to her, confirm that stealing is horrible and that a bad thing did indeed happen to her, but that she is safe now. that way we both remain calm and move on with our day. the patients usually don't really know what's going on anyway (my grandma doesn't really remember, that she doesn't remember, if that makes sense). you gain nothing (i'd argue that you often end up achieving the opposite, just causing stress to both parties) by making your father admit he has memory issues, because he'll forget about it anyways and you'll be doing it all over again the next day. i'm sorry you're going through this. i've been going through this too, and it is probably the hardest part of the condition... the fact that they can no longer be reasoned with because reason doesn't get through. there's an account that i follow on instagram (i am in no way affiliated with them, it's just been a really helpful account) that posted something recently. when my dad was at a stage that it sounds like your dad was at, he was already out of it enough that we could lie or just not tell him we were taking him to a doc. i think we booked the appointment (you could explain to the docs office what was going on so they'd be ready for complications or resistance) and we might have told him but he forgot. then on the 30 minute trip there, im pretty sure we told him we were going to the bank, or for a doctor appointment for me, or going shopping. he sure wasn't comprehending the appointment was a neurologist for him. when in the docs office he was annoyed with the doc, and offended at being asked the ""stupid questions"" that ""of course he knew"" but couldn't answer. and thats how we got him his preliminary diagnosis and how we got him to all the other follow up appointments. this really works depending on how long they can retain a convo for tho. if your dad remembers a convo from yesterday, it might not work. if he cant retain for an hour, maybe? you could try taking him on an actual nice short day out and see how long he retains things from point to point. alternatively maybe you could luck out and find a doc who makes house calls? i do encourage you to try tho, mainly because of the chance that its *not* alzheimer's and is something treatable or even reversible. a lot of things can cause dementia and they need to be ruled out. sometimes, the earlier you catch a cause, the better the outcome too. one thing, has you or your mom looked into long-term memory care insurance? we just learned about this, but you can only get it before the insured person has been diagnosed with anything (with a broad definition of ‘diagnosed’). it might cost a bit now, but might really help you and your family in the long run. my husband does not  like to go to the doctor either. it’s probably best to make the appointment and not tell him until the day of. its not worth arguing with someone who has dementia , if he does have it. you could tell the doc about your concerns before hand and then tell your dad its just a routine check up . the doctor will just ask a few questions and judge his response. you can lie  to your dad about the reason for the appointment, if he asks . good luck . i  think i  know what you are going through. that was me for the last 2 years with my dad. two weeks later he had a referral for a senior eval. i accompanied him to the appt. and he scored a 22/30 on their exam recommended additional follow up, therapy etc. wouldn’t even commit to scheduling a re-exam in 12 months. so.. baby steps, i guess. now i work on follow up and recommended action (is his house safe to age in place, etc).",,0
"hey there, i've been following this sub for a while and i really appreciate that it exists. my grandma - who means the whole world to me - was diagnosed with pca/benson's syndrome (a rare, visual variant of alzheimer's) two years ago. but her health has drastically deteriorated in the past month. i’m not her primary caregiver but i check up on her every other day and make sure to cheer her up. we live in armenia where resources/awareness are very limited, so i’m hoping to engage directly with people who understand what i’m going through. ideally, i want to find or create a virtual support group for people who have a family member with pca or dementia in general. any words of encouragement or advice will be highly appreciated. thank you in advance. i’m so sorry, hun… i’m all in for a support group, maybe on telegram? i'll join as well. contact a geriatrics department or agency on aging, letting them know you want to set this up. even with limited resources, it costs them nothing to post a flyer or connect you with an outreach worker.",,0

"for those of you interested in the science of treating alzheimer's, there was a multi-day conference over the past few days where a lot of companies laid out how they've been approaching these different neurodegenerative diseases. [  so far, biogen has a product that passed fda trials for treatment of alzheimer's called aduhelm. it was initially listed at $56,000 for a year's worth of medication which was a staggering amount of money. this was a obviously a real downer because i was initially excited to hear biogen get the nod from the fda until i heard about the price. if anyone has experience with it, i'd be interested to hear about it. what's great though is that time is running out on them being the only treatment. it turns out that there are actually a lot of other companies that want a chance to perform trials and get something to market which will likely reduce the price and the possibility that one of these companies will knock it out of the park and for a reasonable price. two other hopefuls:  promis: [  alzheon: [  merck had one get to phase 3 trials, but wasn't able to pass. i believe they're still working on it. i think there are other big pharma projects as well. the cruddy thing about the biogen drug is it did not actually show cognitive improvement in the participants, rather it showed that it can clear amyloid which they think can slow progression. while we wait for a drug that is a cure, there are great programs to help people with the symptoms they have. this is a great one sponsored by nia  not trying to imply support for or against, but if you wanted to get involved in trying to lower the cost of aduhelm, the alzheimer's association has been trying to get it accessible to all for a while:   you could see if there is an alzheimer's association near you, especially their local advocacy activity. in my state they have us talking to lawmakers to push local and, if you want, national issues like aduhelm pricing, and using social media or whatever you're comfortable with. science moves slow...its the nature of science. ..and legislation can be slow too, but advocacy is one way us ordinary folks can speed some types of help along.",,0

"hi everyone,  i know both being stubborn and having trouble making decisions are symptoms of alzheimer's but i wanted to know why this is, if anyone knows. as time goes on my grandma has been getting increasingly disinterested (?) the other problem recently is stubbornness. for example she saw something in our neighbor's yard and asked my mom if it was in neighbor #1s yard or neighbor #2s yard. another example is taking showers. my mom asked her why not and she eventually said it was difficult...to open the shower door. we are lucky to get her to take a shower once a week at this point. does anyone know anything about these? why this shows up in alzheimer's, how it's a part of it and what we can do to address it? thanks for any suggestions. i really recommend teepa snow for understanding more; she's a very respected name in alzheimer's caregiving, and she's practical and funny and smart as a whip. i got into her via [this playlist]( but there are lots of other videos. for me it could be college-level calculus (or any calculus at all, really). imagine being in a family where everybody does this breezily and then being asked to solve a calculus problem--that's likely to be how your grandmother feels when asked to make a decision. not only can't she do it, it's stressful to be asked. the shower thing could be any number of things, and i wouldn't overfocus on what she *says* is the reason. the same could be said for drilling a cavity without novocaine, but not many people sign up for that either. so maybe it hurts her hand, or she's not sure if she's opening the door correctly and that's why it's not opening, or the bathroom lighting is confusing or the floor is slippery or it's cold, or she's struggling to get clothes on and off, or she forgets why she was in the bathroon, or she doesn't give a damn about taking a shower now because she can't smell anything bad and she doesn't enjoy them, so why bother? addressing it often means letting it go. good spotting."" for the shower, it might be time for assistance in the process, not just the direction to take the shower. the decision issue is because thought is much harder when you have dead brain cells. i try to be sympathetic about it, or sometimes order for my husband and he seems relieved. i don't agree that alzheimer's people are necessarily stubborn. two other things to know about dealing with dementia. it's okay to lie, as long as it's something not likely to be found out; and redirecting is much better than direct confrontation. good luck! never argue with a dementia patient, even over something as simple and clear to you as the property lines of your neighbours. as their brain changes due to the dementia so does their perception, understanding and ability to communicate effectively about the situation. as for making decisions, lets say the question is steak or chicken for dinner? does she remember what the choices are? has she forgotten how to eat a steak dinner? does she think she needs to help cook, but can't remember how? many dementia patients hate taking showers as the disease progresses: one of the big reasons is due to not liking the water hitting their head and the other is not remembering what to do. things that can help: don't give her a choice, make sure the bathroom is warm, have warmed towels or robe ready for after she is out, you may need to get in with her so be ready for that, treat it as very routine. stubbornness and the other problems are going to seem minor when she can't feed herself or walk anymore. the most difficult thing to accept is that alzheimer's is progressive, and there is no rationale that changes that. the way to handle this is to say “would you like chicken or steak for dinner?” rather than “what would you like for dinner?”. simply stop asking open ended questions! either-or, or yes-or-no will be relieving for both of you. for the stubbornness: similar reason, its because they can tell they’re missing information and it makes them angry/frustrated more often than not, no one likes to feel like they’re forgetting or they’re wrong about something they *think* they’re sure about. try reaching out to your local alzheimer's chapter. they even have support groups for you to share your experiences and ask questions. first you get scared. then you go to fight or flight mode. just keep it simple. my mom has had cognitive decline since before the pandemic but was able to hide it pretty well, no socializing probably accelerated it. april ‘21 i visited after being vaccinated (she in sc, me in nyc) i knew she needed someone to come in to help but she still refused so i let it go. fast forward to january 22… she had a heart attack in the shower and was down for about a day before i sensed something was wrong (spoke with her on a saturday, she was very disoriented, didn’t return my calls a few days later) & asked a neighbor to check on her. i’ve been here at her house caregiving since; she is and has always been stubborn and hard headed as hell. i’ve learn to deflect and redirect just like when i hang out with a drunken friend. dementia is brain damage… it won’t get better. good luck 🙂",,0
"the universe needs to calm down. i'm 33f and i take care of my parents who are in their 70's. mom has stage iv lung cancer and dad has a bunch of stuff going on. i also had a feral cat have kittens in my yard, shelters are full so i'll have to neuter them and their parents. dogs can't go in the back yard because of kittens, so i'm taking them out on leashes in the front yard. one of the dogs has gi issues and is on a bland diet rn. he had a normal stool, but passed blood with it today.also the kitchen drain line collapsed, and i'm coordinating the repair for my parents because my dad is hard of hearing. plumbers in and out of the house until 5pm. mom asks me to order ubereats, and keeps asking me to as i order food on my phone. dog with gi issues has diarrhea in the house. food arrives as i'm cleaning carpet and mom is anxious about why i'm not eating. dad comes in and demands to get him ice for his drink as i am cleaning up liquid doggie doo. i tell him to get his own and don't put any water down the sink... he put water down the sink after i had the plumber extract all the water for the leak detection specialist who is coming tomorrow.during all of this my older brother who is almost 50, is texting me that i can cook, wash my dirty dishes, and wash my dirty laundry at his house 30 minutes away. i have a portable dishwasher that only uses 4 gallons of water that's easy to dump on my own and a laundromat 5 minutes from my house. i instead ask him to bring paper plates, plastic forks, white rice, and unflavored pedialyte (last two are for the dog), but he wouldn't be able to get it until 8pm (not a big deal). then he says he can't do it because it's too much of an inconvenience for him because he got off work late and needs to go to bed. so i just ordered instacart.i understand the need for rest, but i only get 4 hours a day tops so to me it is more of an excuse so he can feel like he tried instead of actually helping. he has a history of being unavailable, bailing out halfway, and just being difficult. i was in the middle of typing this when my doggo had his accident and i had multiple trips with both dogs on the leash while ordering on instacart. i ate my dinner an hour and a half after it got here. i'm so tired. i still need to clean the mess the plumbers left in the kitchen. fml i need a break.",,1

"my grandfather has dementia. in recent months i have tried my best to get him the help he needs to preserve his quality of life. we got him a caregiver. he gets a physiotherapist weekly. we have taken him to a neurologist to get him on medication and advice us on what to do for him. on tuesday we noticed the one side of his body was lame and the same night he lost his balance fell and hit his head on the floor. the next day we took him to a doctor who suggested we take him immediately to a hospital. we then took him to a hospital. they kept him in casualty most of the day. they did blood tests and scans. they said that they don’t see any significant shift it his brain and that we should take him home as there are no beds due to the high covid cases. im from south africa and the covid situation is bad at the moment. we brought him home but he has been mostly unresponsive since then . he doesn’t speak , his barely conscious, doesn’t want to move or walk. we called a doctor to come home again to check him because his condition has just gotten worse . he checked him said his vitals are fine and said he can’t do much else. i phoned the neurologist and she can only give me the earliest appointment on the 30th june. we phoned a friend who works at a hospital and is a psychiatrist to ask if she can maybe advice us . she said she thinks it’s a brain haemorrhage from the fall but that sometimes with dementia it doesn’t show straightaway. i think there is something seriously wrong with him but i don’t know what to do from here.",I feel helpless.

"hey everyone, this post is about my dad he’s currently 68 years old and this week has been a rollercoaster. my dad has always been normal and has never had any issues as far as memory loss but as of lately he’s been forgetting things. now he hasn’t been  diagnosed yet but i’m taking him to a doctor  asap. i’m 25 years old and i lost my mother to cancer already and i can’t fathom the idea of my dad not recognizing me anymore! this week he has gotten into two car accidents(fender benders)  in the same day(my dad lives in ny with his wife and i  live in nj) and that was very odd and then another issue is that he’s forgetting where my aunt lives and he owns two homes in ny and nj. another issue that i noticed is that he’s splurging on things and forgetting that spent bought them; my dad has already spent over 12k and paid 6k for the accidents that he caused. i’m just very scared of the idea of my dad not being well, i lost one parent already and i can’t imagine losing my dad to this!!! please i’m just looking for answers. is there a way to prevent dementia from getting worse?! how do i cope with this!",Guys I’m literally freaking out and don’t know what to do!,1
"so here's the summary of the situation:* dad (80s) has late stage dementia. he is able to walk and eat by himself but that will end likely in the next few months. he has no other major health issues.* my mom (70s) is his primary caretaker, but she has back and other physical problems and can't really lift anything more than a few lbs.* life savings were destroyed before we discovered what was going on.* on paper, they make good incomes. however because of bad management for the past 10-15 years and some ill-conceived purchases/debts, about half of it has to go into fixing problems, so the amount left for spending is ok, but not great. they make well above what the medicaid limits are in our state.* the income sources and assets are all mixed together with both their names on most of it. so any kind of asset sale would be enormously complicated and the leftover situation would be bad for my mom after he's gone.* he does not do well outside of the home. he gets extremely stressed out and basically stops eating. i have no doubt placing him outside his home would kill him.ideally we'd like to keep him at home but my mom is not capable of lifting him or doing the physical work that we know is to come. i found out that medicare will not cover home bound care unless they need a skilled professional or therapy (which he doesn't. he will just needs help moving around, bathing, feeding, etc). medicaid is out of the picture because they just make too much.right now we have a part-time home health aide for a few hours a week but the amount of hours that will be needed will quickly overwhelm the finances and deplete the savings in a few months. i've talked to local resources but overall it comes to the same problems: he's too healthy physically, they make too much money for aid, but out of pocket expenses are too much. making him a ward of the state also seems like a bad idea due to the mixed assets and the loss of control.i've gone through old posts but didn't see anything that pertained directly to this situation. am i missing something? has anyone else gotten benefits for this kind of situation? we simply need home health aides for several hours a day. we don't need anything else.",Assistance available in this case?,1
"hi, my dad is 76 and was diagnosed a couple of years ago with dementia. i believe it was in the early stages at the time. he has recently begun to be somewhat delusional, telling me that someone was stalking his wife and that the police were called. he also believes the stalker is lurking around the house. none of this is true. the situation is very complicated because his wife is much younger and their marriage is also on the rocks. she would clearly prefer it if he were in a home of some sort. his finances are a mess and i'm not sure what he will be able to afford. i live in a foreign country and i am not in a position to help him financially. i don't have a clear question for you... basically i'm just really worried for him and dealing with a lot of complicated emotions around this. i do have one question no one will be able to answer, which is how long he likely has left. i am not actually asking this of you people... it's just the question on my mind. my dad has made some serious mistakes in his life with the way he has treated people and other really bad decisions, so i am feeling a lot of resentment as well, but i can't direct that at him (couldn't talk to him about this stuff even when he was healthy). sorry for venting... i'm just feeling really sad and scared for him. thanks for being here.",New to this whole thing and really freaked out,1
hello so recently i’ve been going to the grocery store with my dad a lot and he’s always telling he thought he saw someone we know for example he would say “ i thought i saw jim’s daughter” other times he would say “i thought i saw jim’s wife” and even when i didn’t go to the grocery store with him he would always think he saw someone he knows. he also forgets a lot of things like he would say who put this here and i would have to tell him that he did. maybe i’m over exaggerating please let me know what you all think,I think my dad is showing signs of dementia,1

"i'm about to write to the va, but need advice, especially from people familiar with the va. main question: for ftd patients mobile and mostly physically healthy, how can you get more home aide care hours of watching them, if your local va clinic says your at the max? (obviously cheaper for va to pay for than alf's!)* i'm thinking of trying to do that and get 4 full days a week of home aide help (is now 8 hours), and maybe adding locks to the doors so my dad can't sneak out when we're in the bathroom. my mom is so stressed from caregiving that she said to research alf's, but i think this plan would relieve us enough to keep him home. my intuition tells me the alf would be bad, and trying adult day cares was awful, they upset him and he refused to do anything but try to escape and run home.* background: my sweet dad is 100% disabled veteran, 62, supposedly all his health care should be taken care of for free now. the va reasoning my mom cited is that he can do most ""normal activities of living"", he just needs to be supervised because he likes to go out of the house walking, 3x a day and obsessively say prayers at different neighbors lawn statues, crossing a main road often too. i try to always jump up when he heads to the door and walk with him so i know he's safe. (no issues getting lost, always goes the same route, knows how to get everywhere/home, careful around cars) he has to be cooked for, and cannot say many sentences anymore, or express himself well.* so he has to basically be monitored all day. my mom's taken great care of him the last 3 years, but the stress of this is destroying us health wise, we both developed high cortisol, auto-immune diseases, failing thyroids, anxiety disorders, went from healthy weights to obesity (despite working out and eating very healthy!). and he treats her like a piece of furniture mostly while hugging me every day, so extra heartbreak for her.the other day she developed a scary sounding cough, and i decided she can't do this anymore (even with me giving her time off 3 days/wk) i cannot lose her too and be alone in the world with no family (kind of selfish, yea).* [fyi: if everyone thinks ""va just won't give you more hours, only a nursing home"", i will simply visit my senator to change it. i am an activist thanks to my dad's influence and will not accept va status quo anymore]any advice welcomed!!","Dad with Semantic FTD, how to get more weekly home aide care hours using VA insurance?",1

"hey folks. not sure if this topic has ever been discussed on this sub but i'd like to share our experience. i'm 57, caregiver to my wife. she's 58 yoad diagnosed in 2008. we have 2 caregivers with her while i work a 40-hour work week. one quit a few months ago - lately my wife has fits of mania, totally uncooperative, aggressive, etc. the intensity of this has increased over the past few months and it cost us a caregiver. through it all i've been trying various meds prescribed by her neurologist. seroquel, lexapro, xanax, etc. nothing worked - seroquel makes her damn-near homicidal. neurologist say to up her dose. total idiot. so medical marijuana was legalized in massachusetts awhile back. i recall my daughter mentioning ""we should try that on mom"". i laughed it off. with all the recent turmoil though, my daughters devised a plan to conduct an experiment with some cannabis candy. long story short:  game changer. wife is calmer but not whacked-out stoned. her cognitive ability has improved - i shit you not. just little things but it's improved. easier to manage, pleasant and, most importantly, she's reasonably happy most of the time. yeah, we're all making the obvious jokes (grateful dead, tie dye shirts, yada, yada, yada) but the fact it this has eased both our burden and her burden. i've always rolled my eyes at the mention of ""medical"" marijuana - condemning it as just another way for stoners to legally get high. drastically revised that thinking as of late. this is not a commercial for marijuana law reform - i'm just sharing my experience with the hope that it might help someone else. also, please don't think i'm advocating some kind of fish-oil-like cure here. this is all about managing her care, nothing more. i would be very interested in hearing other folks experience with this. thanks for listening.",Medical Marijuana,1

"a lot can change in a day. doctors believe my 69 year old father has ftd with als. over the past 10 or so years my father has had difficulty walking and taking care of himself that has gotten progressively worse. it started with just walking issues and discomfort but has evolved into his fine motor skills being almost completely gone now. his personality has changed a little over this time, too, but it’s been so gradual you almost don’t notice it. although, one noticeable thing is that he has become exceptionally sexually preoccupied and obsessed with right wing politics. what a combo, right? we were always pretty close and opted to live together about 2 years ago before i had any idea that there was a serious illness at play. in these 2 years, my father has declined to the point of losing any interest in showering or doing anything but watching tv and ordering doordash. he’s fallen multiple times, but it got worse about 5 days ago. i knew i could no longer have him at home — it was unsafe. the hospital admitted him and seemed annoyed that i brought him in since he was oriented and had normal lab values. eventually the doctor spoke to me and gathered more information about what had happened. i was feeling good that answers would be coming and my dad could be somewhere where he was looked after. it had been about 36 hours since i last visited him when i arrived this morning. what i saw was shocking. my father had lost the ability to answer most questions due to his inattention and distractibility. he had a flat affect and blank look in his eyes. after talking with a neurologist and psychiatrist, the diagnosis points to ftd and als. this acceleratingly rapid decline has me shaken. i’m still processing everything, and i just hope my father finds peace soon.",Frontotemporal Dementia and ALS,1

"i'm sitting down to write this because this journey is nearly ending and i had a breakdown discussing things in our imminent future: obituaries, funerals, blessing of the sick, last rites, etc. my grandmother is basically in the active phases of dying. it's been a little less (or about) 4 years since she was originally diagnosed but i truly think she might have had signs since 2012-2013 and was able to hide them. i remember her casually mentioning to my dad that she had once driven by the house 4 times because she couldn't recognize the house. this was far before we had a diagnosis. just my thoughts: i think one of the biggest things that didn't happen that i always heard happened was forgetting loved ones. she did forget the names of loved ones she hadn't seen in years or that weren't around much, but she never forgot my mom, sister, i or her sister that lives up here's name. she had blips where she would stumble over her sister's name but that's about it.declining wasn't linear....some things happened at a faster pace than others. for example, her ability to coherently put together sentences dropped very quickly whereas her motor skills were okayish for a long while. however, it seems when something fell off, it just went down to damn near bottom before leveling out for a while. dementia seems to be a long, slow mourning process. knowing that my grandmother's days are numbered, knowing she may not make it to next week hurts. i don't want to do anything at all but i can't stand seeing her like this. her breathing is irregular, she can't eat/drink/etc. she's sleep most of the time. unable to speak well. this is the opposite of what she used to be, who she used to be. however, while it hurts, i've mourned what will never be and what has been lost since her diagnosis. i knew the outcome but am far from prepared. i feel numb and scared but that's death i suppose. feelings, sicknesses, etc are more pronounced in dementia patients. utis can completely change a dementia patient until it has cleared. same with dehydration, or mental, physical, emotional stressors. when my mom got sick, my grandmother became a bit more withdrawn, concerned about my mom even if she couldn't properly verbalize it. finally (for now): while the person i once knew has long been gone, pieces of that personality came out every now and again and made me smile. those times where she showed that strong maternal instinct she always had make me feel a bit warm and at home. i don't have anyone to talk to so i put this here. i wish i could wake up and this be a bad dream. wake up to my grandmother cooking breakfast and drinking some coffee. go back pre-diagnosis, pre-dementia. hell, right now, i'd go back to a few months ago to her just calling someone in the house just to say she didn't need anything. i was blessed with this grandmother and man is it going to hurt knowing she's no longer here. i pray a cure is found so no more people have to suffer through this shit. never in my wildest dreams could i imagine this happening to our family.",Our journey through dementia....,1
"for no reason at all. my grandmother has had dementia for several years now but we’ve been lucky for the most part. it’s been shitty of course but in comparison to other accounts i have read or heard, i know it could be so much worse. in the last few weeks my grandmother has been telling my mom she’s depressed and sad. we’ve always had our off days or couple of days here and there. but in the last week, everything sets her off and makes her angry.  any simple thing you say to her will be responded to as though you have been whining about it incessantly and pestering her to the point of bursting. i have always been the one that said getting upset doesn’t help anything and to just try and be patient. silly little fool i was, that was before she was being downright mean and it’s like a switch has flipped. mom and i attended a caregiver support group yesterday because of how much this switch flip has gotten to us. there i learned that dementia can change on a dime. so this might just be the way it is now. i suppose i’ll get the hang of dealing with that, but god fucking damn it i’ve just been so hurt and angry at how she has been that i was the one to lash out just now and get her upset when it might have been fine otherwise. i’m so fucking angry at myself. i’m ashamed of the way i’m short tempered and miserable at home and then i go to work and chit chat and be charming with customers both nice and difficult, and i can’t maintain the same facade at home. my grandmother used to be my best friend. i constantly tell myself it’s a monster controlling her brain like some sci-fi movie. all medical science and logic and common sense obviously tells you it isn’t her acting that way and saying these things, and it isn’t what she wants but she can’t help it. but my monster visualization has not stopped me from letting my feelings get hurt and fighting back, which as we all know, there’s no point. it gets to all of us in the house so much. it would be in everybody in this household’s best interest if i could just be patient and be the one to brush everything off and be positive, even in the face of the most difficult challenges dementia may present us with. i could be the one to pull us all up by our bootstraps and diffuse things. people say that’s not realistic to be always patient and positive but to those people i want to say “you don’t know, it has to be done”. but i haven’t done it, and i’m feeling pretty selfish.  so now i’m just sitting here wallowing in self loathing, and all i could think of was to just write it out to whoever is listening here. just needing to vent. trolls, please leave me alone.",I just lashed out.,1

"my mother-in-law has this dreaded disease and she opted to go to assisted living in a rage, some years ago. she got tired of us asking her if she was alright because of how much she was struggling with everything. before that she had been living with us and getting progressively worse, not eating on her own, just laying about and very fixated on things she wanted us to do or get for her. my wife mentioned how needy she was to her mom one day and her mom flipped and started calling assisted living places on her own.now, she's been there for several years, in a very good place and they are great with her. she gets her diet needs seen to, gets her meds (this was a big issue when with us, she would forget and double up or just not take them) and they have all kinds of stuff for her to do, even in the pandemic.all the time, still, she calls and says that she thinks that she can go live in the houses on the property, where older folks live without assistance. she misses cooking, being free to do what she wants, etc.she keeps saying that she's in prison and that my wife put her there. these outbursts are happening more and more.this time, she wants a new chair, so my brother-in-law opted to buy her one. he's been researching it but apparently taking too long. so she (mil) calls my wife and asks what's taking so long. then she goes into her routine about how she can be living in unassisted housing and that the doctor said she's fine to do that.aside: when she was diagnosed, and then rediagnosed there were about 10 years in between. when we got the official diagnosis, it was recommended that we move her, because it would get harder and harder for her. she thinks every time she goes to get a physical that she's being reevaluated and rediagnosed and if she gets some answers right on her test it means that she doesn't need to be in assisted living, anymore.back to our regular story:so she calls my wife and blasts her because she doesn't know or care about how bad she's been getting and my wife takes it personally. basically neither of her siblings answer when she calls or do much to help. mil takes it out on us and lately, she's been brutal. she called one day while we were driving back from helping move one of our kids and since we were almost having fun, she belted out one of her classics about how we could have fun and she was stuck in prison.once in a while, her being upset, especially in this new and dreaded pandemic, i get it. you feel cooped up, and we do too. but turning her rage on the one daughter that does everything, and being so brutal and making it as though we've had her incarcerated is awful. my wife feels the guilt. she knows her mom needs to be in there. she can't do her own meds, she can't remember anything. she gets fixated on certain things (chair) she can remember and then harps on it to anyone who will listen. but my wife just feels so bad and so, she takes it personally. she knows her mom has to be there, but she can't just let it bounce off and ignore it or hang up.i feel helpless to help her, because for me, it would be different. i won't put up with that shit. i will tell it like it is and that's maybe mean or cruel. when she was with us and would harp on something, i would keep a tally and show her: ""you've asked me about this 7 times, today."" she'd get abashed and stop for a while. it wasn't to be mean, but it helped both of us.i suggested printing out the doctor's ruling that says she  needs to be there (assisted living) and having it framed and when her mom freaks out, show it to her, like some dick version of the notebook.i just get so tired of her being treated this way when she's done so much.",Brutal treatment of my wife,1

"my dad was moved from a short term to long term care place early last month. visits have not been allowed in either place. at the last facility, he had a phone in his room. when i would speak to him, he displayed the expected lack of memory and confabulation from his illness but he was alert. in fact, he was moved partially because he was often agitated and trying to escape.the new place has a shared phone screened by the nurse. whenever i talk to him, he sounds half awake. he barely says anything. i know that they've adjusted his meds but i'm concerned that they are just doping him up so he's not a bother. i don't know if there's anything i can do. it's really frustrating not being able to see for myself how he's doing. there are no open cases of covid-19 at the place and almost everyone there is vaccinated. it doesn't make sense.",Long term care facility is just sedating him,1
"i’m taking care of my step dads mom and she cries all the time. i’m pretty sure it’s fake crying most of the time. she just yells “help me” nonstop. i haven’t seen anyone talk about using the “cry it out” method they use for babies. is that not something we should do? because if not, how the hell do you get anything done ever? some days she cries every half hour. and some nights, like tonight, it’s every ten minutes. i told her to “shut up” for the first time. i got so overwhelmed, i’m sick, and tired and i just told her to shut up. i feel a little bad but also i really do want her to just shut up. she can’t get into any trouble seeing as she can’t get out of bed on her own and can’t walk without her walker. so would it be so bad if i just ignored her for a while? closed my bedroom door, turned off the baby monitor, and just ignored her for half an hour? my first half an hour of peace at home since last year when she started getting progressively worse at an accelerated pace? she is on 100mg quetiapine. she started at 25 and it worked for two nights, same with 50mg, and now same with 100. but it only works for those two nights. then it’s back to normal. my step dad never comes to see her. only once or twice a month. we almost put her in a memory care facility but then my mom talked him out of it because it might “disturb her routine.” so now my boyfriend and i are stuck with her for god knows how long with no help. her insurance doesn’t even cover a night nurse. i don’t know how much longer i can do this.",nonstop crying and no sleep. kind of a rant,1
so my mom is 55. she is diabetic.she had a mri of her neck before having neck surgery and they saw white matter in her brain. she asked her neurologist about it and told him she is having some memory issues. he said he thinks it could be vascular dementia caused by her diabetes. he said she could reverse it if she got her sugar better controlled. i've noticed her having some memory issues and saying the wrong or name only a few times. i'm mentally disabled and live with her and my stepdad. my grandma moved in and has dementia so it's been stressful. i'm very worried about my mom. so is what the doctor said true? does white matter always mean dementia?,Possible beginnings of vascular dementia?,1
"hi guys. my grandma is 86 years old, has dementia and is bedridden. we make her wear diapers and change it thrice daily. however, she would often rip the diapers off and pee on the bed instead. we kept telling her to just pee in the diapers to which she agrees but she still rips it off anyway. we tried putting trousers but she would figure out how to untie the knot so she can reach it. its incredibly frustrating especially with washing the mattress, the trousers, the clothes, cleaning the torn diapers, etc. anyone had any similar experiences or know a way to make her pee in the diapers? thanks guys",Help with grandma,1

"if i had to guess, going by the ""seven stages"" my grandmother is probably around 4, but moving into 5.  although, it's hard to tell because the deviations in her memory have become so drastic the past few months.  i see her seven days a week, so i'm familiar with how she is on a day to day basis.  on monday she might be completely out of it.  you would think she's end stage.  she doesn't know how i am, she doesn't know who my grandfather is.  she's just laying on the couch, speaking weakly and saying she can barely move.  she will ask where she is, and then insist this isn't her home, despite living there for 50 years.  and this won't be just a small episode, i usually stop by three times a day, morning, afternoon, and evening.  on days like this it will last 24 hours.  then, i could stop by the next morning on tuesday.  i'll get there at 8am and she's coming up the basement stairs with a load of laundry, she's got breakfast cooking, a pot of tea on, she knows exactly who i am, who my grandfather is.  she'll be talking about something she saw on the morning news.  later in the day she will ask my grandfather to take her out grocery shopping, or to go out for dinner.  it's suddenly like she's perfect.  then on wednesday she might be just as good, or back to monday, or somewhere in the middle.  thursday could be awful, friday could be amazing again as if she doesn't even have dementia.  she's seen multiple doctors, she doesn't have a uti (i know that will be brought up), she's just had a typical ""age related dementia"" diagnosis.  if anyone else here had a family member like this, how did you deal with it?  it's taking a toll on my grandfather.  he has the money for a home nurse/caregiver, but the issue is that right now it's impossible to schedule one.  he said he struggles a lot on her bad days, and i see it.  but at the same time, there's 2-4 days a week when having one there would be a total waste of money (and would piss off my grandmother when she's having a good day cognitively).  how do you handle this stage?",[deleted by user],1

"hello. i care for my mom (72, pd, mid level dementia) she lives with my family of 3 in our house, she has her own one bedroom basement apartment with a kitchen/bathroom. she has struggled with her clothing for a few years, things on inside out, things on backwards, wearing a shirt as a skirt, 2 socks on one foot, mismatched shoes etc. i tried buying her matching shirts and pant sets, hanging them in day order, nothing really worked so i help her get dressed and undressed daily, but we then started to have a different problem: she was changing her clothes, multiple times a day and often in the middle of the night. honestly i wouldn’t care, it makes more laundry for me but whatever, but now she’s starting to get tangled in her shirts, can’t get them over her head, and comes upstairs for help, sometimes in various states of undress (completely topless twice) which is very uncomfortable for my husband and son. i know it’s not intentional but it feels like she’s bored and wants attention and has found this works to get it. she does do workout classes 5 days a week, we grocery shop one, and my brother takes her to lunch on the final day, so she has activities daily.i’m becoming frustrated with having to help her out of a clothing fiasco multiple times a day. today i helped her get dressed, and an hour later she came up with the same shirt on but inside out and backwards. then 30 mins later she couldn’t find the shorts she had just been wearing, which were on her bed. then later she suddenly was in a different shirt, but it’s too tight! i have begged her: “just stay in today’s outfit” but she claims she doesn’t know what happens to her clothes or why she is doing this behavior. i visit her literally 10 times a day for food or meds, so i’m usually around hourly when she’s awake.does anyone have any tips? i’ve considered buying shirts that only open in the back. i hate to feel like i’m putting my mom in a straight jacket, but jeeze, i work fulltime and have so much to do in the evenings and weekends, dealing with the same problem over and over is so frustrating.thanks for reading.",Clothing struggles,1
"my grandfather has dementia, and typically my grandma is his caregiver but currently she's away on a trip for 19 days. she hasn't even been gone a week and already my grandpa is frustrating us. he lost his keys the first day she was gone, and he was incredibly upset about that. he doesn't drive anymore, but i think it's the security of having them in his pocket. and for the last four days he's been obsessed with getting their cat milk or whipped cream. their cat can't have dairy, it makes him sick and gives him diarrhea. tonight i finally took him into the store and tried to explain to him that the cat can't have that, and instead we got some dry and wet food, as well as donuts for him.i work in this store, and i had a lot of anxiety to the point of being nauseous while we were inside. i'm wondering if subconsciously i'm ashamed of being out in public with him. i practically have to yell at him for him to hear me, and with his illness i have to frequently re-explain myself. like i wonder if i just didn't want my coworkers to see this. plus there were other customers near us while i was telling him the cat gets diarrhea.i have a new respect for my grandma as well, i can understand why she's so upset constantly. i'm sure she wasn't imagining her retirement years being spent taking care of both herself and her husband. she's never had much patience in general, and now she constantly has to explain things and repeat herself while yelling. plus she's in incredible pain from arthritis and other things.i wish i could see into his mind, because sometimes he makes jokes and it feels like his mind is clear like it was 10 years ago, then there's times like these last few days where he's been obsessed with whipped cream.plus now my dad and i are starting to worry maybe we'll get dementia when we get older. im not super worried since we're both a lot healthier than he was, he smoked a lot and when he had kids he switched to drinking. but it's another health anxiety to add to my pile.i love him and it's sad how dementia has changed him so much.",vent: understanding my grandma,1

"my mother was officially diagnosed with alzheimer's just over 2 years ago. my dad passed away in 2014 and my mom lived alone in an appartment within walking distance from myself and my sister. while we noticed a gradual decline my mom still had a great quality of life. she spent 4 days a week at daycare in a nursing home, which she loved. they went on daytrips, shopping, to a garden center or the market and even to the christmas circus in 2019. my mom no longer cooked but still managed to prepare microwave meals. she couldn't do a weekly grocery shop so i did that for her. she forgot to clean but she got a cleaning help 3 hours a week. and while we mourned the mother we were slowly losing, we still had her around and were still able to visit and have a chat.two weeks ago wednesday the nursing home called to tell me my mother was short of breath and was running a mild fever and i had to come get her. my sister was able to get her tested that evening and the next day we got the result that she tested positive for corona.we have no clue where she got it. could be anywhere, since my mom never remembered to wash her hands regularly.from wednesday to monday my sister and i visited her several times a day each to care for her. we were given a huge box with protective gear to use on ourself but it wasn't enough since last week my sister got sick and tested positive, and in turn infected her husband and youngest teen son, oldest son still pending. i've been tested 3 times now, all negative.anyway, my mom had high fevers for days and eventually breathing got even more difficult and on monday our family doctor decided to send her to the hospital for oxygen and fluids. it was decided by a doctor there that my mom wouldn't be sent to the icu should her condition worsen, because she wouldn't be able to go through the rehabilitation process following intubation because of her alzheimer's. we agreed with that. she was allowed 1 visitor once a day and since my sister was sick i was in and out of the hospital all week. at first she was very ill, and we realized there was a very large chance covid might kill her. my mom is 77, has survived cancer and is a smoker. but what do you know, fysically she recovered somewhat. she still was weak and needed some oxygen but the fever passed and she seemed to do better.on monday i got some videochats going with some of her cousins whom she's always been close with. and while she was convinced she wasn't sick and she didn't have a clue where she was, she was still able to have a chat and she was lively. untill she wasn't. over the past week her alzheimer's seems to have progressed a year's worth or even more. she no longer understands where she is or why, she didn't recognize her own brother when he visited, she had a huge problem talking and forming coherent sentences, and worst of all, she was no longer able to swallow food or water.this afternoon we had a talk with the doctor there (my sister via video chat since she is still too sick to travel, no matter how much she wanted to be there), and we all concluded that my mom's quality of life was no longer there and that there was no hope of that improving in any significant way.the only solution was giving her food through a tube up her nose but she keeps pulling out her oxygen so we doubt she would accept such a thing, not to mention that it would only prolong her suffering at this point. so we have decided, with the agreement of the doctor, to seize all attempts at feeding her.this afternoon, right before the meeting with the doctor, her condition had worsened so much i was genuinely convinced for a second that i had entered the wrong room, because i didn't recognize her. she did still recognize me for a moment, mask and all, and whispered my name but that is the only coherent thing she said.i am still in shock how fast this virus has turned my mom into an advanced stage alzheimer's patient. how she went from still living on her own to no longer being able to speak and swallow in the span of two weeks. since the start of this pandemic my sister and i have been very worried about my mom catching the corona virus because she's such a high risk case, but we never could have imagined how this horrible virus could end things for my mom.i'm still mostly in shock. tomorrow we're talking with the hospital to get her out of there, maybe to a hospice or even back to her home since she is now officially corona free, so we can make her final days more comfortabele, since that is all we can do now, aside from waiting for the end.",Fast mental decline due to covid-19 in mother with Alzheimer's,1

"i [19ftm] feel for the families and the residents i meet at the nursing facility i work for. i've been getting to know the residents more and more (the ones that talk to me when i clean their rooms) and it's hard to watch them go through this. they tell me about their hobbies, families, what they did, what they want, etc. even if they don't remember their lives as well as they used to and they don't always make sense, they're just so sweet and interesting. i just like to learn from their experiences and their lives.there is one women, i will keep her name private so i can respect her family.. i will call her d. d and i talk all the time when i see in the halls on my way to another room. or just when i clean her room. she has been depressed lately. the residents all have their days, but it always gets me... i love these people and it hurts to see them like this, let alone the families. i found out recently that d loves puzzles. i thought about bringing her some puzzle booklets. she says she loves doing those and she used to do them a lot. i am just super happy to get to work and see these lovely people. i like to try to make their days brighter and i love to see them even in their worst moments because they all are going through something i cannot imagine. d even loves candy. her favorite is milkyways. another woman, i will call k, has been super, super sweet. she always makes me smile and i love talking to her despite her not making any sense. she is funny and very loving. i will say hi, ask how she is, even talk about our day. even though it's mostly me talking, she loves it. she even bothers the nurses just to speak to me when they are trying to do therapy with her.i always speak with the residents and always smile at them. i always interact with them all and give them my attention. they love it. i hope that it makes their days a little bit better. it's worth it. i just wanted to write about this because i feel for all of you guys dealing with this.. it's so hard to watch other people's family members dealing with that. i had a grandpa (mom's side) who battled with dementia and now his wife is following closely behind. i got this job to hopefully be around her more when we eventually cannot take care of her ourselves. she is doing okay as she can be right now, but not really herself. i just want to let you all know that everything you deal with and everything you feel is your strength. i hope all of you know that what you're doing is awesome. ❤️",Just Some Support,1
"some background. my dad has had parkinson disease for around 9 years, he was only 60 and in the last two was diagnosed with parkinson related dementia. he is in the late stages, lives in a nursing home and he struggles to know who we are. now and again he references family/friends names and things that have happened in the past.  he knows my face as 'margaret' we presume it is his cousin margaret he is remembering.  i visit my dad once a week and sometimes will bring my children along. they have never known papa before illness. so have grew up visiting him with no expectation of him doing papa stuff and always know papa as unwell. i feel personally i have dealt with my dads illness pretty well.  i've worked in a gp practice for 15 years and over the years have dealt with numerous wee patients that have become demented and as heart breaking as it is i've always felt toughened with regards to illness. i recently got married with no frills. i only told my mum and my husband told his patents, no one else knew. out of respect and the fact he is my dad my husband wanted to tell him and i guess in a way get his permission. he was having a good day when we told him although he still didn't remember i was his daughter. but he asked about honeymoons etc.  fast forward to our first visit after we got married,  me my husband and our six year old went to visit. he was sitting on his usual chair in the tv room and as i walked in did my usual greeting.  i had a can of juice in my hand for him and his first reaction was to grab it off me. i told him to hang on till i opened it and as i began opening it he was still grabbing it and angrily saying give me it. so that was a little upsetting but not  anything i hadn't dealt with before. we pulled our chairs in. my son's birthday had been the day before we got married so i say to my son tell papa it was your birthday.  so he tells him and my dad just looks right through him and draws his eyes off him.  i don't know if it was the incident with the stupid can that added to my emotions but for the first time i cried while in his company. i got up from the chair and went to look out the window. my husband continued to chat to him but my six year old came up beside me and asked if i was ok. i smiled and said yes i was just a bit upset. he then continued to say you know papa isn't well mummy, his brain is all confused, it's not his fault. i hugged my wee boy that seemed too wise for his years. here was me crying like a baby and having my child comfort me by mimicking the words i say to them after every visit.  my husband mentioned we got married but he wasn't for chatting. he seemed frustrated and angry so we cut the visit shorter than normal.the reason for posting this is can any one offer advice? should i call him by his name instead of dad? he  seems to respond to his name every time. should i keep taking my children to visit? he has never shown any kind of relation to them and the kids normally end up wandering around the home chatting to the other residents. i just feel this is not my dad now and each time i visit i'm left a little more disheartened.  i wouldn't wish dementia on my worst enemy.",A recent visit to my dad left me upset (advice appreciated),1

"due to my husband’s ftd behavior and his tantrums, our holidays have not been good for at least 6-7 years.  but, this year, it was different.  we opened presents, played board games as best we could, ate dinner, listened to music, and it was so very enjoyable.   my kids and i didn’t have one moment that was uncomfortable and my husband had zero tantrums and he was pretty mellow.  i know his behavior will wax and wain, but i am so thankful for this great holiday we experienced.  we all knew that holidays would be different because of his illness, but this holiday was the best in years.  it was so nice to live in the moment and just not feel like a complete and total caregiver to him, even if just for a day.  my adult kids both told me that it was a most enjoyable day and i am so thankful for the good memories.",This was a good Christmas….,1
"hi, i have had cognitive and physical decline for now more than 2.5 years, i'm at the end of my 30's.. my mris have been normal until august 2021. i had a neuropsychological evaluation that showed some memory loss with a none specific pattern. i had a lumbar puncture this year because i wanted to make sure it's nothing treatable. i wouldn't want to miss an autoimmune disease for which there could be treatments. the doctor who prescribed the test never got back to me but the test turns positive for protein 14 3 3. although it says prion disease is unlikely because of a negative quic test. of course i can google and see what 14 3 3 is associated to, but when looking further ive read that the protein is associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. the test said 'indirect marker for a neurodegenerative disease'. i was wondering if any of you heard that the protein can be linked with a treatable kind of dementia, because it's hard for me to work and i'm not sure i want to pay another neurologist for interpretation (the doctor who prescribed won't return my calls). also i'm getting less curious about what's not treatable because i know something is wrong anyways.",[deleted by user],1
"its been 3 years since my father's diagnose. he is 65 only. i am so sorry he never had the chance to live his 60's he went from 60 to 80 years old.its been downhill since then, he is on some medications to chill him a bit and get better sleep. i have been noticing he is beginning to have some kind of mild hallucinations. last night he woke up in the middle of the night asking my mom why there was a person there and why they were in the kitchen while such person is just a frame above the bed of leaves and they have been sleeping in my room as they are staying this week in my place and i will return with them to their home for some weeks.he is quiet most of the time, interactions have decreased significantly in the past months. i mean, he is not able to make a coherent phrase anymore. he stutters some words and its difficult to understand what he is saying, when he does sometimes comes from a weird observation, like trying to relate the tv controller with a little monkey there. nonsense.its clear he is losing his consciousness day by day. at least here he is not wandering that much anymore, he sits or lays in the couch and stays there. his eyes...his eyes are lost in space. he doesn't hear or understand clearly when someone is addressing to him and he needs help to conduct him where he needs to go. he is totally dependent in everything, even baths he can't do it properly in his own. this wasn't happening when i last saw him in january. sometimes i wonder if he is becoming blind because he cant see the most obvious things. my apartment is small, like 570 sq feet, two rooms and a bathroom between, he always misses the bathroom. he goes all the way to the laundry area or one of the rooms to pee. obviously the bathroom is damn small, and he is still not sure where to pee and even aimed with his hands to be sure pointing it to the side of the toilette. how is that possible...its depressing...very depressing. i feel some guilty for choosing to stay in the city while my parents and my brother (27, i am 28) lives 1 hour drive (i don't own vehicles so i cant visit them that often, i intend to do so soon  as long as i find some way or even save to buy a motorbike). i mean, wfh since the pandemic hit and living by myself for 5 years now, i have choose this life before his disease so i could gain some independence and find my own way and to be not a burden for them, i have a girlfriend i want to marry soon so i need to build my life and not worry my mom, i guess its the right thing? if she needed my help she might ask, and  i am glad my brother lives there to help them out. as i see them every 2 months, this means i only see frames of my fathers illness and its always getting  worse. my mom and brother are not that shocked as i am because they are there. my mom has been dealing better now, she has accepted that correcting him will not help, just comply and chill him when asking about going home or seeing his wife or dead relatives.he is not able to recognize any of us. i wonder what goes through his head...i needed to offmychest this because as much as i try to accept this as life the way it is and this is just one way to die, when i stop to think about it i just want to cry and i do sometimes, a little, because we need to keep going. i feel bad because we werent really close all of our lives. i mean, he was always there and provided us all, he did a wonderful job as father, we just didnt click when we grew up so our relation were just ok enough, i wish we had way more father-son moments as i see others doing. now its too late. however, i am glad i see a lot of in me from him, i am a fraction of the men he was and i am glad for that.as if the disease is not enough to burden us all we need to mind and deal with the judicial matters and battle for the right to not pay irs anymore. so sorry...we are no that religious but i know he had faith in god as i do, and i am glad i once asked him if he believed in god ans jesus christ as his savior and he does. so i know he is going to be saved and go to heaven peacefully. i don't pray a lot...once in a while but when i do i always ask him to relief my father's pain and give peace in his heart, the same for us and strength to deal with all that, i feel better afterwards and thats the way he have been living.i wish you all the best dealing with this. you are not alone",Hallucinations and venting,1
this is a definitely a very sensitive subject and i don't mean to bring up things that will upset anyone. i just had some questions about alzheimer's and the stages and when did your loved one pass.i have a very large family my grandmother has a lot of kids and a million grandkids. so there is definitely a lot of hands in the cookie jar. i am the who lives with my grandma as her primary caretaker. according to the fast alzheimer's scale my grandma is at 6c. she has been progressing fast since my grandfather has passed away. there is definitely a disagreement in my grandma time left and how it should be handled. some people think she only has weeks to months. she has recently fallen and broke ribs and now has pneumonia. so she is definitely struggling now and i know with anyone she could pass at anytime. but i believe she will beat this and recover. things i read and see saying people can live a long time in the 6 category and even awhile in 7 on scale. sensitive part could you tell me on what part of stage did your loved one past and was it complications or other medical factors or dementia related. thank you,Sensitive subject (sorry),1
"last week she still had a decent posture when sitting down, but her ability to walk had declined a lot... she took tiny steps and got very tired. but on monday her head was hanging down and her whole body was just slumped down. we've tried to lift her head up but her neck muscles to be too rigid and it seems like it hurts when we try to force her head up so we stop. it was a very rapid change and feeding her has becomed a big struggle. we don't know if it may just be part of the alzheimer's or medication. the doctor at the home has removed all the medication she used to take when she was aggressive and hyperactive. any thoughts ?",What could be causing my grandma to be unable to lift her head up?,1
"okay, i am really fighting hard to cope with my dad's early stage of alzheimer's. it isn't that bad compared to others. but, my dad keeps forgetting minor things, to a point where now it's costing me and my family money (more on that later). and on top of that, my dad is a really stubborn guy. i can say both those two don't make a good mix from my experience.due to his condition, he can't exactly maintain a steady job. so its pretty much my mom and me being the primary provider for now. my dad who works in it still gets jobs here and there, but its more contract-based, and mostly lasts 3 months.now, let me get to the part where it's costing our family money.but, let me first say this.. like i said before, my dad's condition isn't that bad, and i feel really bad for him. but,  its coming to a point of just pure frustration for me at least on my part.coming to a point where our house kitchen was almost fully burned down twice. once was our stove being totaled, 2nd time half the kitchen was burned down, and my dad was told by my mom multiple times to not use the stovetop, but did it anyways.now when it comes to whatever is left in our family savings just about a month ago my dad lost 1grand due to some miss placement of his certain investments that he can't remember. my dad didn't give me enough details because of his stubbornness. i could easily come up with couple of pages to what else my dad lost money-wise, and important items like a passport to his driver license due to this condition, but what happened in the last week or two kinda made me lost my anger.and today.... well... i almost lost it today where i had to walk out the house cause of how angry i got. today my mom left about 80dollars in front of my door to do some grocery shopping. i was sick all day, and was in my room just resting.as of right now, my parents is in the process of selling our house, so my dad can sorta retire and not worry about any debts, and of course, it will help his medical situation. that being said, we kinda hired these handymans to repair certain parts of our house in order to put it in the market so it can sell for a better price.so long story short, my mom left money for me to which my dad kept the money in front of my door and of course my dad not walking with these handymen, and forgetting that my dad left cash in front my door, like 100% for sure these crooks/handyman took the money, who i didn't know was going to show up today.i mean... i know it's only $80dollars, but just something triggered in me that got me really frustrated at my dad, when you also add all the incidents he did in the past. i had to walk outside just to vent my frustration cause of what my dad did. it was just one too many incidents that caused me to kinda lose my anger.another reason why i lost my anger today, cause just last week my dad gave someone $100 something dollars to replace our mid size fridge at our basement, to which my dad gave it to this one handyman who ofcourse didn't show up with our replacement fridge. this didn't have to do with his mental condition (or maybe it kinda does), but just adds up when my dad makes all these decisions combine with his alzheimers.my mom keeps telling my dad to be more careful with our financial situation, but he keeps forgetting minor and simple things, which causes our family to lose money. like i feel bad for my dad, but same time really frustrated cause he just won't listen most of the time.not sure what else to do, cause i know alzheimers is nothing you can solve in one day, but not sure if there are some sorta routines or medication. i know my dad takes some sorta medication, but ofcourse he won't give me the details.but, as of right now, i am kinda losing it. cause mom does make more money than me, and she works in the child daycare field. her, health isn't doing any better due to her age catching up. but, seeing money being lost by my dad, that's being hard-earned by mom is really hard to see. my dad didn't lose like all our savings or anything like that. but, just these incidents kinda adds up and doesn't make our already financial situation any easier.i thank you for reading this lengthy help i guess you can say. not sure if there is some sorta help group of sort that can help my dad's routine on not forgetting things and i guess not being stubborn is another source of method to fix i guess. but, just really hard to cope with, especially when my parents are in a tough financial situation.","I AM NOT sure what to do with my dad's what seems early stage of Alzheimers, leading me to great frustration!",1
"tldr: too grabby to leave with nothing, don't want to have to resort to just empty plastic containers to ""play"" with.  whether we gave it to her *to* break or not-but-don't-mind-if-she-does, anything she gets her hands on that has any moving parts gets broken/ripped/shredded/written on/etc. we made her one of those ""busy boxes"" with stuff she liked in it (clothes catalogs, jewelry, a blanket, etc), and we had to choose to either replace 98% of it daily, or just give it up because when she was through with it, the magazines were written all over/pages all torn out, she fiddled with the jewelry til it broke, she either picked at the blanket or managed to find the one loose thread and it was coming unraveled. in the car she found where the seatbelt kinda doubles back on itself and makes a loop small enough to only fit one finger through and she got a fingerhold and started trying to rip the seatbelt apart. she kept pulling at the car door handle (the locks were engaged) like she was trying to just break it off. *she broke a stainless steel egg timer* (she treated it like those plastic easter eggs with candy inside and pried it apart, then complained when there was nothing inside). she's like a really destructive toddler that wants toys but when you give them to her she just breaks them and then throws a fit when you hesitate to give her anything else, because no one really has money to just throw away on stuff that's gonna get broken within it's first 10 minutes of ownership. and because of the dementia, anything you say to her about it goes in one ear and out the other (if it ever went in the one ear to begin with!), or she gets mad and cusses you out saying that everything is hers and she'll break it just because you told her not to.","help my grandma's like a robot with only one setting: ""DESTROY""",1
"my grandpa has early onset dementia and he is becoming very sexually aggressive and saying inappropriate things. for example, i don't think he realizes that it's me that he is dealing with because he grabs my butt and breasts on a daily basis. when i tell him to stop because it isn't appropriate he will say i'm not hurting you. like another words he's saying let it happen because i'm not hurting you.he also says inappropriate things and uses words that are considered racial slurs now and when i tried to tell him that you don't call people certain things anymore he got mad at me. like for example, i told him that we don't call asians oriental anymore because it's considered racist. he tried to argue with me to the point of googling it to see if he was wrong and the first thing that popped up with something saying that it wasn't racist so he went with that. i disagree.i don't know if this has to do with his military service but he is a control freak and tries to run everyone's lives. he also says things that are inappropriate, mostly about women. like for example, he will say out loud look at that woman, she's so fat. women aren't supposed to be fat. it's becoming really exhausting and frustrating and i just don't know what to do anymore.he also follows me everywhere, even to the point of trying to follow me to the bathroom. i've told him no, that it's inappropriate and he still tries to open the door. i've gotten to where i have to lock the bathroom door. i haven't had any alone time in the past month and i'm starting to go stir crazy especially with the world being on lockdown. please help. how aware is he that what he's doing is wrong? is he may be worse off than i thought or does he know what he's doing and is just using the dementia as an excuse? i'm at my wit's end.",How do I deal with my grandpa's sexually aggressive behavior?,1

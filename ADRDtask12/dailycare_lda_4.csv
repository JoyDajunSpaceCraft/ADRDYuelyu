"the universe needs to calm down. i'm 33f and i take care of my parents who are in their 70's. mom has stage iv lung cancer and dad has a bunch of stuff going on. i also had a feral cat have kittens in my yard, shelters are full so i'll have to neuter them and their parents. dogs can't go in the back yard because of kittens, so i'm taking them out on leashes in the front yard. one of the dogs has gi issues and is on a bland diet rn. he had a normal stool, but passed blood with it today.also the kitchen drain line collapsed, and i'm coordinating the repair for my parents because my dad is hard of hearing. plumbers in and out of the house until 5pm. mom asks me to order ubereats, and keeps asking me to as i order food on my phone. dog with gi issues has diarrhea in the house. food arrives as i'm cleaning carpet and mom is anxious about why i'm not eating. dad comes in and demands to get him ice for his drink as i am cleaning up liquid doggie doo. i tell him to get his own and don't put any water down the sink... he put water down the sink after i had the plumber extract all the water for the leak detection specialist who is coming tomorrow.during all of this my older brother who is almost 50, is texting me that i can cook, wash my dirty dishes, and wash my dirty laundry at his house 30 minutes away. i have a portable dishwasher that only uses 4 gallons of water that's easy to dump on my own and a laundromat 5 minutes from my house. i instead ask him to bring paper plates, plastic forks, white rice, and unflavored pedialyte (last two are for the dog), but he wouldn't be able to get it until 8pm (not a big deal). then he says he can't do it because it's too much of an inconvenience for him because he got off work late and needs to go to bed. so i just ordered instacart.i understand the need for rest, but i only get 4 hours a day tops so to me it is more of an excuse so he can feel like he tried instead of actually helping. he has a history of being unavailable, bailing out halfway, and just being difficult. i was in the middle of typing this when my doggo had his accident and i had multiple trips with both dogs on the leash while ordering on instacart. i ate my dinner an hour and a half after it got here. i'm so tired. i still need to clean the mess the plumbers left in the kitchen. fml i need a break.", awesome work. cyber hugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nl717y/dog_piled_rant/,1
"my mother came home from rehab on friday. since then nothing happens unless i tell her. ex. let's go potty now. can you move to the table? it's time to go pot your plants. let's go potty again. i put your food on the table. go ahead and eat it before it gets cold.  here's you meds. take them. drink the shake i put in front of you 5 mins ago. remember you should be thinking about where you want to read or call your sister. she is fully competent. has no mental deficits. i feel so much pressure&stress in having to keep the flow of caregiving and control her every move & thought. i literally control everything that happens in our household. mom, the dog & me. does anyone have the same problem or suggestions?"," could this be an adjustment period with the return home from rehab?  my brother in law is in rehab now and experiencing delirium and confusion.  i am just wondering if your mom could be experiencing post rehab confusion?  lethargy?  depression?  i like the idea of a task list: things that your mother might be able to do for herself.  my father is much the same when it comes to doing things: call your grandchildren.  throw the overripe bananas away.  (he eats them and they go bad).  i added this to his to do list to keep his mind alert and his body active.  if i delegate a few tasks to my father, he can feel productive and useful and i do not have to stress myself trying to do everything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/njcb1b/suggestions_for_fostering_autonomy/,1

"i am currently caregiving for my overweight mother-in-law. she is a former psychologist former workout instructor and a retired teacher. she attempts to manipulate me psychologically but now that i know how she is and we're so who she is i don't let her. i'm just starting to not let her manipulate me. today was actually my first day. because typically i'll just do whatever she wants she is not that bound and she's unable to move without a walker she can do all the things that she needs to do for herself like cook hand wash laundry and bathe herself but yet she refuses to.i am just starting to push for her to bathe herself on a regular basis i gave her a sponge bath yesterday and today she was supposed to shower herself and she is refusing me straight up just saying nope not going to do it. there is nothing i can say after that i feel like i have given her the okay well it's because i'm your caregiver because i care about you because this is healthy for you. yes she is still refusing mei can't make someone do anything so she refuses me i think that's the bottom line that's it i can't make her do what she knows she's doing well i know she has to do. my sister-in-law however thinks it is my job they said i am the one who should make her shower but if she refuses me there is nothing i can do as a certified caregiver i can't make anyone do anything.i am also staying in this house so i am using her water washing my clothes using her laundry detergent using her electricity so the lines become crossed at some point like i am using her so she can use me but now i am putting my foot down i am doing the caregiver role not the servant roll not the housekeeper roll i get it she can't sweep and mop the floors easily i will do that that is my job i get it she can't get food out of the fridge easily i will do that that is my job but she can put her food on a plate she's been doing it way before i got here. and she can make herself a cup of coffee.i don't even know why she's making the coffee thing such a big deal i get it she's a coffee drinker and so am i but i'm the one who clean the coffee maker i'm the one who started making coffee every day i'm the one who even got the coffee maker clean to begin with because before i got here it was collecting dust and dirt and grime.anyways, this is more of a vent post but any comments are appreciated i'm having a really hard time we are moving out very soon we just got it an apartment and waiting for the landlord to clean it up for us to move into it to make sure the previous tenants did not break anything and get it move in ready. idk she just tries to manipulate me and for the longest time it worked. she was her cry if i gave her logical reasons why i wasn't going to do something and then i would just do it so she would stop crying. she thinks she's good at manipulation and i was a sucker at the beginning but now that i see how she is and know how she is i'm not going to fall for it anymore she's even said i can do all of this stuff it just hurts. and i get that it's difficult to get in and out of the shower. but i have to start doing my part to take care of her better i have to be more convincing as to where i go with this."," she sounds like my grandma. did she regularly keep housekeepers prior to you becoming her caregiver? i wish you the best but you need to have a talk with your significant other to try to get his family on board. it's really nice of you to do what your doing, but it is not your responsibility.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/mzr4kb/mother_in_law_help/,1
alright so i‚Äôm an in home caregiver for a little boy with special needs and he got sent home early because of mushy stool this was fine i know they don‚Äôt know that his medication does this but when he got home and i changed his diaper because i felt some pee i saw dry st on his bottom. i am beyond pied i‚Äôm pretty sure now that his stool was more mushier than usual because they didn‚Äôt check him and he sat down. i used to be a behavioral aide and i know it doesn‚Äôt pay a lot but ffs at least clean him properly!!!!, you pay peanuts and you get monkeys,https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/mwhs05/behavioral_aide_didnt_take_care_of_my_bud_right/,1
"my gran was moved to a memory care facility last year. she lived with us since 2014. when we cleaned out her mil suite attached to our house, we were left with containers upon containers of shit just thrown together that we didn't have the brainpower to organize at that time. ""i'll get to that later"". well, those boxes are taking up 40 sq ft of space in your basement, and ""later"" is looking a lot more like ""soon"".it's silly to jump into it without a plan. so i made you a plan. i developed your method. you have one less thing to think about now in this emotionally taxing project. get your coffee, and read through this guide. you're going to freakin' conquer this. let's make sense out of that chaos.here we go!determining the scopetake a gander at your stack of bins and boxes. take out each bin and rustle through it. focus on identifying what you‚Äôre going to be working with.example: for my gran, we had notes, paperwork, photographs, household items, ‚Äúmemories‚Äù (more on that later), and more fucking paperwork.number your containersthis will save your ass later and help keep you organized. number each box and tub. physically. write on those things with a thick ass sharpie ‚Äútub‚Äù or ‚Äúbox‚Äù and then a number. it doesn‚Äôt matter where the box came from. it doesn‚Äôt matter what order they‚Äôre in. just as long as you establish inventory, you‚Äôll be grand.example: i have tub #1‚Äîtub #5 and box #1‚Äîbox #6isolate one box & make roomtake out a container from the collection. place it in a comfortable spot where you have room to move around. you may be getting up and moving from place to place, so make sure your room is clean and clear of obstacles. a clean room is a must. put all the other containers in a separate area away from your organization room. trust me. if you look at it, it will only intimidate you.establishing categoriesyou know the term ‚Äúwhen organizing, never touch anything twice‚Äù? that‚Äôs bullshit in this kind of project. we are taking this rollercoaster in steps. the purpose of, what i call ‚Äúround 1‚Äù, is to separate trash from the important stuff, and put ‚Äòlike with like‚Äô.you‚Äôre going to make an area, preferably with another big empty container, for each category. here are the categories that will mostly encompass everything you‚Äôre bound to find in the hoard of miscellaneous small belongings thrown together at the end of a clear out.memoriesphotographspaperworkpaper memories‚Äúi have no idea‚Äùtrashlet me go over each category.""photographs"". every photograph you can imagine. even the printed ones. not the ones in frames. if you want to be really progressive, keep the polaroids seperate from anything else. the two types of chemicals used in the processing of the types of film degrades both of them. portraits, cat pictures, garden pictures, the literal only picture of your great grandfather. all of them.""memories"". these are objects, artwork, books, etc. anything a person keeps for any reason until they leave the earth. or your house. a lot of them are only sentimental to the individual and don‚Äôt mean much to you. don‚Äôt evaluate this concept yet. focus, remember your categories. move along.""paperwork"". this is the serious shit. your boxes will. will. have paperwork that you do not know if you should keep or not. place every 'document' that is professional correspondence, medical records, housing inspections, homeowners insurance, receipts, etc, into one designated ""paperwork"" box. don't stress yourself out wondering what it actually is and if you actually need to keep it just yet. just determine if it's administrative paperwork or ""paperwork memories"" and sort it first.""paperwork memories"". this can sometimes be easy to determine, and sometimes it can be difficult. because in my gran's final year or so living with us, she clipped everything out of the newspaper from articles on bird care (she has no bird) to saving full page advertisements. there was also a lot... and i mean a lot of notes that she wrote down from day to day that don't make a lick of sense. a grocery list. the word ""hair"". someone's phone number. the name ""nick"". the name ""lenore"". notes from my mother who was her primary caretaker. notes that say ""i'm going to the store. i will be back by 2pm. i love you."". if in doubt, keep it. and go through it later. but these are still paper memories and go in the ""paper memories"" box. this also includes stuff that is obviously important and needs to be stored like college diplomas, yearbook pages, letters from loved ones, cards, etc.""i have no idea"". you will come across some shit that's just... weird. like you really won't have a single idea what to do with it. make a box for your confusion and come back to it way later.‚Äútrash‚Äù is anything you determine to be trash. if you don't need it, and it doesn't tell a story or represent your mother, let it go. you might not want the scribblings of your parent in their decline of mental capability. you may want to hold onto those pieces a little bit longer. that is absolutely okay.things you will need for sanityyou‚Äôre almost ready to go through your first container! you will need a couple of things to keep yourself organized.post-its (brand name. they stick much better)a couple of black sharpies. i say a couple because you will misplace it every single fucking time you put it down and you need to be able to pick up another while the first one is probably sitting under a pile of crap.buy at least 3 boxes of sandwich baggies (sealable) and 4 boxes of freezer baggies (gallon).a notebook on a clipboard and a hoard of pens.trash bags. get the good brand.white mailing labels.file foldersscotch tapeopening pandora‚Äôs boxonce you have all of your supplies within arm‚Äôs or leg‚Äôs reach, your organization room is clear, you have one container, and you‚Äôve had your coffee‚Ä¶ put on a playlist. pro tip: nothing sappy or sad. one sad tune is enough to keep you tunneled on a certain object for way too long and emotionally exhaust you enough to cut your organization day short.open the box. take a breath.when you come across any of these things, grab a gallon baggie, slap a blank mailing label on it, and grab a sharpiephotographs or polaroidsadmin paperworkpaper memoriesexample: baggie labeled ‚Äútub #1 ‚Äì photographs‚Äù or ‚Äútub #1 ‚Äì admin paperwork‚Äùthe bulky important paperworkthis is something i learned the hard way. you‚Äôre going to come across certain things that take you a couple of minutes to figure out. and they will be bulky, but skirt the line between important admin paperwork and memories.for example: i found scatters of 400 pages of my gran‚Äôs book she published in 1998. it took me a good minute to accumulate all of the pages. and they just kept showing up in boxes. for like 3 days, that manuscript was its own category. i threw them all together in the end with the ‚Äúpaper memories‚Äù category.label. all. non-obvious. items.the term ‚Äúwhen organizing, you should touch everything only once‚Äù, has a more important mental and psychological message, which is ‚Äúwhen organizing, you should determine what something is, only once‚Äù.that folder in tub #3 that just says ‚Äúwest palm beach‚Äù. at first glance, you don‚Äôt know exactly what‚Äôs in that thing. could be anything, really. so take a look inside. grab a pen and a notebook on a clipboard. write down the contents of the folder.for example: on my notebook, the ‚Äúwest palm beach‚Äù folder had homeowners insurance, property tax assessments, receipts, email correspondences, inspection reports, final floorplan, and a couple of other things i don‚Äôt really remember.grab a post-it note, or a piece of paper big enough to tape onto the outside of the folder. write down, in sharpie, on the note, the contents of what is in that folder.why: when you go through the collection‚Äôs stack of paperwork during ‚Äúround 2‚Äù, you won‚Äôt have to spend critical time and energy determining the contents of every folder. when you have big bold labels on stuff, you‚Äôre saving your brain from expending energy doing critical thinking later on. you really don‚Äôt want to have to pick up the same stack of ‚Äúwest palm beach‚Äù 3 times, and every time having to flip through it to figure out the contents. do the dirty work the first time, and you will save yourself the trouble later.use those baggies!so many things can fit into baggies! notes. tiny school portraits. business cards. newspaper articles. they can all fit into baggies! label the bag with a the container number they‚Äôre in along with the category they belong to, and fill those babies up!method established. work through your collection.go ahead and sort the rest of the containers into your designated categories.sort yourself as you sort their stuffnever let your piles become super crazy and unorganized. if you have a hoard of labeled baggies just sitting around without being put into their main category, take the time to place them there. it is really easy to let the process take over your entire room/house/life. don‚Äôt let it. clean as you work.rome wasn‚Äôt built in a dayremember:  it will take days, maybe even a few weeks, to go through every single thing. especially if you're getting rid of their clothes and food and dishes, furniture, etc as well. you may have put off the boxes and tubs because of the physical and mental and emotional exhaustion it creates. you need to give yourself breaks, remember to drink water, and remember to drop everything and come back to it if it's just getting to be too much for you. you have time. and the process takes time. so take. your. time.just as an aside: i really, really want to emphasize a practice of self-care that i had no idea existed until this: taking your time. it's easy to have a cup of coffee and rush through half a box, but you will be burned out, exhausted, and super irritable every single time. taking your time will help you be more organized and will let your brain go through the process with ease rather than make it feel like it's some sort of race. you will thank yourself. remember to eat. don't become too tunnel visioned. don't get too caught up in what you find. and do not try to create more categories unless you absolutely need to.‚Äúround 2‚Äùyou will end up with containers filled with categories rather than containers filled with ‚Äúuhhhhh‚Äù.the photo container will be a whole project within itself. save that baby for last.sit down with a category and start figuring out if you need to keep it, keep it and digitize it, shred it, or toss it. the digitization process is also another project within itself. if you determine you need to digitize a document, shove a label on it saying ‚Äúdigitize‚Äù, a label of description of the contents, and then put it in a new ‚Äúdigitize‚Äù category.i have a method for digitizing and organizing your documents that i will probably write up another time (i‚Äôm still doing this and figuring out a solid method. i‚Äôm not finished, and i won‚Äôt be for a while).like with likeput things related to each other in their own folder. in ‚Äúpaper memories‚Äù, you will need to determine sub-categories.example: ‚Äúpaper memories‚Äù went from a box of loose papers to \~7 sub-categories such as ‚Äúphyllis‚Äôs education‚Äù ‚Äúlove letters from nick‚Äù ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs artwork‚Äù ‚Äúcards‚Äù ‚Äúnotes‚Äù and a couple others.another example: ‚Äúpaperwork‚Äù went from a box of loose papers to a crazy amount of sub-categories including ‚Äúsale of west palm beach house‚Äù ‚Äúmedical records 2016‚Äù ‚Äúreceipts‚Äù ‚Äúbank statements‚Äù ‚Äúlawyer‚Äù ‚Äúmiss kitty‚Äôs vet records‚Äù, etc.bonus round: ‚Äúphotos‚Äùonce you finish everything but the photographs, you can move to the photos. but you will have trained yourself enough through the first process to know how to sort the photos. and it's basically along the same lines as subcategorizing the other categories. i have about 2000 photos, and i think i have even more at the bottom of another box. so far, i have 34 categories of photos. everything from ""roeltgen family 1996 - 2006 sonora house, tx"" to ""cindy's wedding"" to ""strange photo tour of cindy's house"" to ""granny pre-1985"".i‚Äôm still working on photos. it‚Äôs a trip. but it is super rewarding.all in all‚Ä¶you will become much more comfortable with the entire sorting process the more you go through them. and it will get much, much easier.i wish you the best of luck. may the organization gods smile upon you. you‚Äôre not a robot. you will get through this. and i am so, so, so sorry for your loss."," you forgot one last rule: after you're done with mom's/dad's/gran's/gramp's stuff...organize your own.  get a file cabinet for the paperwork, because you may still be using it or need it.  and get your legal documents done while you're at it.  even before mom moved to assisted living, i did this with every paper i could find.  got photos, too.  but her ""stuff""?  with covid and distance (giving a time constraint), i didn't get to get her most of her stuff.  this led me and my husband to discuss what we would want--mainly the stuff in our living room and computer: framed photos and digitized photos, a few piece of furniture and shelves to hold the stuff on.  paperwork is already in a file cabinet, with legal and tax papers stored separately.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/mitm0u/making_sense_out_of_chaos_a_detailed_guide_on_how/,1

notes. tiny school portraits. business cards. newspaper articles. they can all fit into baggies! label the bag with a the container number they‚Äôre in along with the category they belong to, and fill those babies up!method established. work through your collection.go ahead and sort the rest of the containers into your designated categories.sort yourself as you sort their stuffnever let your piles become super crazy and unorganized. if you have a hoard of labeled baggies just sitting around without being put into their main category, take the time to place them there. it is really easy to let the process take over your entire room/house/life. don‚Äôt let it. clean as you work.rome wasn‚Äôt built in a dayremember: rome wasn't built in a day. it will take days, maybe even a few weeks, to go through every single thing. especially if you're getting rid of their clothes and food and dishes, furniture, etc as well. you may have put off the boxes and tubs because of the physical and mental and emotional exhaustion it creates. you need to give yourself breaks, remember to drink water, and remember to drop everything and come back to it if it's just getting to be too much for you. you have time. and the process takes time. so take. your. time.just as an aside: i really, really want to emphasize a practice of self-care that i had no idea existed until this: taking your time. it's easy to have a cup of coffee and rush through half a box, but you will be burned out, exhausted, and super irritable every single time. taking your time will help you be more organized and will let your brain go through the process with ease rather than make it feel like it's some sort of race. you will thank yourself. remember to eat. don't become too tunnel visioned. don't get too caught up in what you find. and do not try to create more categories unless you absolutely need to.‚Äúround 2‚Äùyou will end up with containers filled with categories rather than containers filled with ‚Äúuhhhhh‚Äù.the photo container will be a whole project within itself. save that baby for last.sit down with a category and start figuring out if you need to keep it, keep it and digitize it, shred it, or toss it. the digitization process is also another project within itself. if you determine you need to digitize a document, shove a label on it saying ‚Äúdigitize‚Äù, a label of description of the contents, and then put it in a new ‚Äúdigitize‚Äù category.i have a method for digitizing and organizing your documents that i will probably write up another time (i‚Äôm still doing this and figuring out a solid method. i‚Äôm not finished, and i won‚Äôt be for a while).like with likeput things related to each other in their own folder. in ‚Äúpaper memories‚Äù, you will need to determine sub-categories.example: ‚Äúpaper memories‚Äù went from a box of loose papers to \~7 sub-categories such as ‚Äúphyllis‚Äôs education‚Äù ‚Äúlove letters from nick‚Äù ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs artwork‚Äù ‚Äúcards‚Äù ‚Äúnotes‚Äù and a couple others.another example: ‚Äúpaperwork‚Äù went from a box of loose papers to a crazy amount of sub-categories including ‚Äúsale of west palm beach house‚Äù ‚Äúmedical records 2016‚Äù ‚Äúreceipts‚Äù ‚Äúbank statements‚Äù ‚Äúlawyer‚Äù ‚Äúmiss kitty‚Äôs vet records‚Äù, etc.bonus round: ‚Äúphotos‚Äùonce you finish everything but the photographs, you can move to the photos. but you will have trained yourself enough through the first process to know how to sort the photos. and it's basically along the same lines as subcategorizing the other categories. i have about 2000 photos, and i think i have even more at the bottom of another box. so far, i have 34 categories of photos. everything from ""roeltgen family 1996 - 2006 sonora house, tx"" to ""cindy's wedding"" to ""strange photo tour of cindy's house"" to ""granny pre-1985"".i‚Äôm still working on photos. it‚Äôs a trip. but it is super rewarding.all in all‚Ä¶you will become much more comfortable with the entire sorting process the more you go through them. and it will get much, much easier.i wish you the best of luck. may the organization gods smile upon you. you‚Äôre not a robot. you will get through this. and i am so, so, so sorry for your loss."," i pick up montgomery‚Äôs card and actually finger it, for the sensation the card gives off to the pads of my fingers.‚Äúnice, huh?‚Äù price‚Äôs tone suggests he realizes i‚Äôm jealous.‚Äúyeah,‚Äù i say offhandedly, giving price the card like i don‚Äôt give a shit, but i‚Äôm finding it hard to swallow.___^(*bot. ask me who i can see.* |) [^(opt out)](",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/minp1o/making_sense_out_of_chaos_a_detailed_guide_to/,1

"the situation:my paternal grandmother is 87 years old, she has her own little house in our backyard. my mother and i are her care takers eventhough my dad is retired and sits at home all day. her 4 sisters died from alzheimers and she's been getting worse since her husband died in 2019.recently she's been having issues taking her medication. my mother used to fill up her pill box for an entire week and hand it to her sunday night, then she'd either tell us she's out of pills in the middle of the week or she'd have pills left at the end of the week, causing a lot of arguing on whether or not she took her meds/took more than she should.recently we decided to give her the pills everyday so she at least can't take doubles and we have a better eye on it. she still sometimes claims we didn't give her the pills etc but its manageable.now about 3 weeks ago my brother said he noticed our grandma has a bunch of pills in her kitchen cabinet. my dad went to look for them and didn't find anything, grandma was insulted that we think she would hide pills. it was worrying cause ever since her husband died she'd make remarks saying she wishes she was dead too and that she would ""just take some pills and be gone"".but since my dad didn't see the pills, we figured my brother must've seen something else and moved on.now last night at dinner my mother went to the kitchen to get a glass and when she returned she whispered to me that my brother is right, theres a bunch of pills in the cabinet.now we don't know what to do. should i confront my grandma and possibly cause a lot of drama? or should i just take the pills out of the cabinet without saying anything."," yup. exactly what we went through with my mom. she'd hide pills everywhere, but with her it was because she didn't trust us to do her pills. my brother kept the week's worth locked away in a lockbox. he'd put out the daily box every morning. that worked well until the day she decided she'd save time and take all of her pills at breakfast. it didn't seem to hurt her but from then on every dose was handed to her individually, no more allowing access at all. whoever handed them to her made sure she took them all. after she was gone, even though we'd already gone through the house while she was still living and thought we had all of her pill stashes located and emptied, we found pills in lunch bags in her winter coats she hadn't worn in years, in the fabric drawers by her sewing machine, in bottles in the utility room stashed under other items. they were everywhere!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m134eb/grandmother_hoarding_pills/,1

"2014-2015 (73/74 years old): father's alzheimer was starting to be more prominent. it starts when he's talking to people, he'd keep repeating what he's saying. 2016 (75 years): he starts forgetting where is he going when driving. like, he would leave from point a to point b, and while on the road, he'd forget where is he going for point b is, and eventually ends up going back to point a. one time, he was going somewhere that's only a 30-minute drive from our house. while on the road, he forgot, he went into circles, and six hours later, he thankfully made it back home.2018 (77 years): he started to forget how to go back to the house from our yard/garden. you'd have to guide him. he used to water the whole yard, but around this time, unless you guide him, he'd only water one area.2019 (78 years): he started to forget how to go from one place in the house to another. let's say how to go to the bathroom from the living, or going to his bedroom. also, this is around the time that you have to give his medicine to him, as he cannot take it by himself. 2020 (79 years), you had start guiding him with personal hygiene, and when taking a shower. you have to make sure he actually gets in the shower, that he actually uses the soap and shampoo, and you have to pick out the clothes he's gonna wear, and set it on the counter. though, he still knows how to put clothes on. he also started losing his perception of time. when he wakes up from an afternoon nap, he thinks it's morning. or he'd wake up my mom in the middle of the night, as he thinks it's already morning. he would wonder out of his air conditioned room, to go some other part of the house, would sit down, and complain that it's hot. i would bring him back to the room. a couple minutes later, he'd do this again. he would also ask where my mother is, i give him an answer. then 30 seconds later, he'd ask the same question again. 2021: about a month or two ago, he's having trouble when you give him a command. let's say if you want him to flick a light switch.   based on the timeline above, what stage is my father at? and how long is this going to last before advancing to the next? also, i've read that people with alzheimer's would live about 8-10 years, or if they're lucky, up to 20 years. how long do you think my father is going to live?i would like to apologize for the dumb questions. i am just curious. especially, when dealing with this everyday. thanks.", tryi found it really helpful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/lqje7u/my_fathers_timeline_of_alzheimers_progression/,1

my mother in law moved in with us a few months ago when her husband passed. i'm her main caregiver as my husband is an otr truck driver and is gone about 3 weeks per month. mil has several health issues but she is moble with a walker and gets around the house just fine. the problem is her eating habits. she rarely will eat what i cook not refusing out right but saying oh maybe i'll try it later or something like that. meanwhile she eats all the time. like every two to three hours day and night. she doesn't sleep well at night and she also smokes so anytime she wakes up she has a cigarette and usually something to eat. that's what i mean by day and. she will eat anything that's grab and go. like fruits individual snack cakes cookies chips things like that. if we don't have those she resorts to peanut butter and bread . the problem is when i buy those things i'm expecting them to last at least the week but they're gone in two days.not only is this type of diet very unhealthy for her but it's impractical and expensive. at this point i just don't know how to break this habit of hers. i'm afraid if i stop buying the convenience foods she won't eat. or since she does have her own small income she will tell me to just buy the stuff with her money. which doesn't solve the problem of having to go to the grocery store every two days and having her eat all this unhealthy junk. since she moved in with us she also complains about losing her independence. even though it was her idea. so i am leary about telling her what she can or can't do. i'm also trying to get all of her doctors and medication straight since she didn't take care of herself while her husband was ill before he died. i'm sure there's a simple solution for this but i'm so overwhelmed with everything right now i can't see it. any help would be appreciated thanks in advance.," i'm sorry i did leave some info out of the original post. the reason i am concerned is for her health. she has several health issues including heart disease, she's had a double bypass. she also has a pacemaker , copd and some gi issues. her doctor has also said is she has some signs of early dementia. it's not a very bad yet but it's there. that's one reason i'm concerned about her rambling around in the middle of the night to get snacks because she had a minor fall (minor meaning she kind of slid off of the bed onto the floor then couldn't get back up again). when that happened she said that she was going in the kitchen to get something to eat. i can see where it would look like i was upset because she wants to eat twinkies instead of my cooking, lol, but that part is really the least of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/liwzqm/getting_frustrated/,1
"my mil (59) has lewy body dementia, she‚Äôs at a stage where she can participate in light conversation, but often loses her words and train of thought. she also has delusions and a lot of false memories. she is not capable of forming new memories. the only self care she can do is put her clothes on (usually backwards or inside out) and bring a spoon of food to her mouth. she needs help with every other aspect of her life. she‚Äôs been with us for two years. i‚Äôm her primary caregiver, a stay at home mom. i‚Äôm planning on sending this to her two sisters and my bil, none of which are involved in her care, other than the occasional check-in text. names have been changed.please let me know if you think i should add or change anything? have i over-explained? under-explained? donna - milemma - my 3 year oldgrant - my almost 1 year oldcharles - my husbandezra - brother in lawhey family, i‚Äôm so sorry to spring this on you so suddenly. as of today, our home is no longer suitable or safe for donna. i‚Äôve been struggling with this for a while, and we had an  incident today that pushed us over the edge. everyone is ok, but this can‚Äôt continue as is. when we first decided to bring donna into our home, i told charles that our boundary would be if she becomes a danger to us or our kids, or if we become a danger to her, then it would be time to find her somewhere else. that time has come. today, while i was helping grant nap (he‚Äôs been sick all weekend), emma went into donna‚Äôs bedroom, and hit her hand with a toy (metal) hammer, it was supposed to be in the garage, and she was supposed to be going to the bathroom. donna is ok physically. but she‚Äôs terrified and disoriented, she had trouble getting from her room to the kitchen table. emma has been dealt with, hammer is gone, of course. but i just can‚Äôt help but feel that something is bound to happen again. keeping the two of the apart has been one of my biggest struggles since we‚Äôve moved into this house. emma can operate baby gates and doors, donna cannot. the only ways to keep them separate is either inhumane (locking them both in their bedrooms, not happening) or extremely logistically difficult (what i‚Äôve been doing, constant supervision, made impossible because of grant‚Äôs needs, me going to the bathroom, emma‚Äôs extremely independent attitude & physical maturity, she‚Äôs the has size & capabilities of a 5 year old). now that grant has started to walk, the house is about to undergo another baby-proofing transformation; and it won‚Äôt go well for donna. then plan that charles and i have had on the back burner is to find her a skilled nursing facility in city name (the town where charles works and ezra lives. about 20 minutes from our home). we wanted to wait as long as possible to make this transition. please keep us in your prayers, this will be extremely difficult for all of us.", all assets will be drained be careful,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lfm3a9/its_time_for_a_nursing_home_this_is_the_text_that/,1
"i am korean in case anyone can help or has references. i am getting help from another user and trying fixing things with my husband so i'm very happy for this community. i would like to know if anyone can help my situation until we can get further help. my son and i have always been very very close even though we have not seen each other in a long time before the injury and i wish to not forget him and do what i can for him and make him comfortable.my son is 25. he is slightly underweight because he was recovering from an eating disorder and some damage before the injury. a bit back ago he came home from the hospital after he have suffered severe tbi. he suffers vision problems for which she is getting another appointment in a few days, he can see us and a family member and reacts. he also responds to me talking to him and reading to him even though he cannot understand or speak. he is often dead weight as he gets very confused but he has been a little more alert recently. i would like some help understanding or help with the feeding. i am scared to use a tube because i do not like the sound of it and he has been prone to ulcers and infections before and i know these can cause those problems.he lays down mostly but now for some hours through the day he will sit back reclined with support from pregnancy pillows or sit reclined in my arms. there are more opportunities to try having a meal when sitting but most don't go well. he is capable of opening his mouth for spoon or a suringe. he will move food with his tongue or lightly with his jaw. i cannot get him to take more than 5 bites of food in that time. it will be mashed vegetables or blending rice with a little salt.  he will take a few drinks of gonttomil shake or milk every couple hours, from a serving spoon or a handled lid cup. no soup or juice or shake i make. he will not have water unless it is in the food or milk or gonttomil shake. he had some of his favorite food yesterday which was much easier to keep focus but cannot eat that all the time. he will not eat anything my husband feeds him and he will stop any eating when husband is even at home, fortunately husband is mostly working or going out for the night. son likes a lot of coaxing and responds well but husband told me to not do that.he made a little progress the first week home but has since went back or stopped. i made ice pops and he liked them but could not handle the cold. i bought a mesh pacifier dummy for fruits and vegetables that i can use instead of the spoon Ôªøand he seems to enjoy it but cannot do it for very long at one time. he's getting there because now he likes to help hold the handles of his cup by holding my hands, or holding my hand when i put the spoon to his mouth but has a very loose grip.the minimum he will eat is half the shake and some mash from the dummy or five bites. he is not terribly hungry because he will get an unsettled mood swing or fall asleep during feeding or after a failed attempt at eating. i understand he has a small stomach but he needs to eat. the biggest meal he had was at yesterday morning and it had a whole serving of shake, a mash of 2 radishes and cucumber, mashed nashi, and a few bites of my salad and mushroom soup.","i have a child with severe brain damage,talk with other parents about the tube.   it was a gamechanger for us and solved many issues allowing us too focus on other things.   sorry i can‚Äôt help with feeding,we had to give up as it was too risky and she wasn‚Äôt getting enough nutrition.   it‚Äôs been 19yrs now,and while still hard to keep any weight we don‚Äôt have to fight a feeding process half the time.   talk with parents,not doctors about tube feeding please and you‚Äôll hear the perspective that matters most to you which is what helps.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/lby6xe/can_i_get_some_help_with_feeding_son_who_has/,1

"i will cut to the chase and give you the preface later. i called adult protective services to report self neglect on an 84 year old man i live with. i spoke with a social worker a couple days later and was told that a county nurse will be making a visit within the next couple weeks. she also spoke to the guy who has power of attorney over his medical care (he lives out of state but is planning to move in this house  soonish.) i really need there to be a formal diagnosis for dementia. this man is very stubborn and in denial of everything health related. what would be the best way to do this? he's going to deny everything.i was told by the social worker he hasn't paid all 3 of the utilities for months. he keeps getting shut off notices from the water company but none of them have shut off utilities yet. i'm very surprised nothing has been shut off. he hasn't seen a doctor in several months because his doctor retired. i told him he needs to call his insurance to get a new one but he doesn't listen to me. he's very stubborn and doesn't listen to anyone who tells him he needs to see his doctor. he has a very bad cut on his ankle that looks like it could be mrsa. i expressed to him that i think he has dementia but he denies it even when you tell him about all his memory problems. he loses his money constantly, his car keys were lost for what seemed like forever, he loses his canes for walking, he will ask the same question multiple times within a very short period. he's very moody and grumpy most of the time. he loves to argue with people over the tiniest most trivial things. most recently, he was calling out his dead mother's name while knocking on the guest bathroom door. i had to tell him there was nobody else in the house. most days he's fine but more recently he has started thinking other people are in the house and one time he checked the guest bedrooms because he thought people were in there. he hoards food to the point that when he finally gets to eat something, it has already rotted and expirped long ago. he gets mad when anyone interjects and wants to throw something away. the last jug of milk i saw him throw away had an expiration date of july 2020 and the inside hard yellow slimy curds. he has lost his sense of smell and i'm pretty sure he has no taste either. he doesn't believe anyone else when they tell him his fridge smells bad. he says they have sensitive smells which is not true. one night he went to the grocery store and was gone for a long time. he got taken home by a police officer. he had a blown tire and the cop said he was lost and didn't know where he was. the cop told me he thinks he has dementia and that he really needs to see a doctor because it's going to get worse. and also, he has a suspended license because he failed the written test . recently, he has been having bathroom accidents where he goes in his pants and then it runs down his legs and onto the damn carpet. he refuses to buy adult diapers. my dad bought me a carpet shampooing machine. i moved in here in 2019 for free rent and utilities in exchange for help around the house and yard. i'm not a nurse or caretaker and i don't do anything medical. i mainly do simple things like vacuuming, dusting, raking leaves, trimming small trees, etc. i have no authority over this man.", are there any relatives you can contact?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l9u4os/84_yo_stubborn_man_needs_a_dementia_diagnosis_but/,1
my dad has very recently been diagnosed with alzheimer's. he is 63 and has never had any health issues before this so has never had to take regular medication.my mum passed away 6 years ago so he lives alone and unfortunately i live an hour away.he is struggling to remember to take medication. any solutions?we have a monthly pill box (i can't get home weekly so this is the best solution). we have amazon alexa with an alarm going off at 10am and he knows this is to remind him but he still doesn't go and take them.he's now changed medication and has to take one pill morning and evening which is now an issue as he doesn't remember the evening one.he won't accept outside help yet as he's literally only been diagnosed for 3 months and has barely even told his friends yet. also are there any groups or places you go to chat about your situation? i think i would like someone to chat to about it all as its happened all of a sudden and it's a lot to take in.thanks for any replied and apologies for the long post.,"we bought a round medelert off amazon. it has a lock and moves to the next section. when it moves to the section, an alarm goes off (it's loud) and it continues to go off until the unit is picked up and turned over or for 30 min. you wouldn't have to lock it, but we do because he has doubled up before. it works for us. this looks exactly what we need. thank you so much! there are several options including the one just mentioned. my dad uses the built-in alarm in his phone to tell him when to take meds. then his meds are arranged in a weekly pill box divided by morning and evening meds. he's not good at using his phone and sometimes it's not even switched on. i think the one mentioned above will be perfect. thanks for the advice. there are services that will call him when he's supposed to take his medicine and they can actually stay on the phone with him while he goes and gets the pills and takes them. many are part of insurance companies, so you might start there with a call to see if they offer the service. if your dad is able to use computer or ipad, i am very partial to www.dementiamentors.org , for us as persons living with dementia .  there is also video zoom chat as a family on harry's friday night chat with forget-me-not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l8w0uv/remembering_to_take_medication/,1
"my father and i take care of my mother with advanced ftd at home. she started having swallowing difficulties a over year ago, and up until very recently we were able to follow the advice her doctors gave us to make sure she was able to eat‚Äîeliminate distractions, make the environment familiar/comfortable/have mealtime cues, alternate small bites of food with sips of a drink with a straw, and staying upright after the meal ends. the past couple weeks, though, mom stopped feeding herself completely. luckily she still opens her mouth when i lift a spoon or fork up for her, but she doesn't chew or swallow until after taking a drink, and even then only does so about a third of the time and by chewing once or twice before stopping. i've largely switched to soft or liquid food like scrambled eggs and soup along with nutritional shakes, so the difficulty chewing isn't as troubling as the worsening dysphagia. i'd  still like to provide mom with solid food if there's a way for her to still enjoy it safely, so if anyone has an unlikely solution that would help my mom chew i'd appreciate hearing it.i've heard that massaging the throat can help assist swallowing, but i haven't found a resource that explains exactly how to do that and my attempts at figuring it out haven't been helpful. can anyone tell me how this works or point me in the direction of a place i can learn how to do it?thank you for taking the time to read this. i have a feeling that there's not much of anything i can do, but it would be nice to be proven wrong."," we‚Äôve started down your path recently , too. now when we are eating anything that requires much chewing, i blend it into a pur√©e, even things that seem weird to do, like salad or rice (carefully because that gets super sticky). at least it keeps the variety of foods in rotation. also, my grandma won‚Äôt necessarily pick up a utensil to feed herself, but if i load the fork or spoon and hand it to her, she puts it in her mouth. maybe if your mom could follow a cue like that, she‚Äôll reflexively chew a bit (but still only super soft foods of course). i also demonstrate exaggerated chewing motions that cue her to imitate when she lets something sit in her mouth. she understands the visual better than the verbal instruction to chew her food.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l7exjb/hand_feeding_advice/,1

i thought unplugging every damn thing was just one of my person's idiosyncracies, i didn't realize it was a 'thing'. isn't it nuts how remotes are completely mysterious to them, no matter how many times you explain their function and concept, the whats whys and hows? there's this aftermarket remote operated light switch that has 3 sets of buttons on it, in order to correspond to 3 different plugs. we only use one set, so i put tape over the other ones with 'on' and 'off' written on them, an arrow pointing toward the one remaining exposed button, thinking it couldn't get any simpler? but no, just now she came up to me with three different remotes (god knows where she even found the other 2) saying it was defective, furiously pressing the taped-over buttons. üòîüò© i give up... unplugging is a thing.  it's really super common.  before we swapped out the alexa show, she would mash the buttons on top of it, usually taking the volume to 0 and turning off voice recognition, and ultimately would unplug the dang thing.  we had to get rid of it because as convenient as it was to use voice commands, grandma would read all of the suggestions aloud, like ""try alexa, download <whatever stupid thing>"" or ""try alexa, take a picture,"" or ""set a timer,"" or ""add dog food to the grocery list,"" (we don't have a dog), or or ""open daily quiz"" or whatever that skill was.  and we were also limited to prime video and they got rid of the best ""keep grandma from trying to do the dishes without soap, using the mankiest sponge from the depths of the cabinet under the sink"" tv show in their lineup"" (for the record, it was perry mason).  now we're using a tv with some sort of media stick that connects to a few different services.  we've been through a lot of shows, and lately have been having moderate success with father knows best. i like you like that. i'm also absorbing all these details like they're water and i'm a wilted plant. loving it.i've got to admit, before reading the comment below this one and figuring out that 'alexa show' must be a product name, i thought you were calling it the 'alexa show' bc of what a spectacle it became. and, in picturing alexa screaming at y'all don't forget the dog food (for this purpose i am willfully misinterpreting how she changed the volume) and then the timer goes off like a sonic bomb... i must also admit... i think i prefer it. okay my 'grandma' also half asses the dishes without soap, but doubles up on insistence that she will not be kept or disuaded from doing so.way to count your blessings, you! mine does not refill the toilet paper, alas. she does, however, smile a lot. she also doesn't have any notable sundowning or mood swings, is in shockingly good health for her age, has overall good hygiene, is not a picky eater, and she sleeps like a rock, allowing me enough down time to be her sole caregiver for 3 consecutive days without having to choose between sacrificing all elements of my own life/moving in here to be with her around the clock, or splitting the responsibilities with yet another person, thus pulling her precious limited attention in yet another direction.theeeere we go. nothing like a good bitch fest to work out the brattitude and slide back into gratitude. thanks for your help, my brother in arms. (by which i mean arms that hug) hah. my grandma has had a series of minor incidents lately. since she can't go to the gym anymore (and refuses ""home exercise""), she's gotten shakier on her feet, and in november she fell flat on her face. then explosive (and i mean, like, horrific) diarrhea in mid-december, and now despite our best efforts, a uti, which has ramped up the confusion several notches. sundowning has gotten more and more of a problem for us as time passes. i've lived here for uh, almost 3 years, and it started gradually but now she gets anxious in the evenings/as it gets dark because she feels like she's forgetting something (yes, everything) or that she's supposed to go somewhere.  we tried various calendar systems, but if she knows something is planned for the day, she will panic as she remembers something is happening but not what, and that panic will just follow her all day. (even if the event is detailed on the board, she will forget it / panic about it / forget the board is there and just continue to feed the anxiety loop.) so we ended up with a whiteboard with a permanent little message that we update daily:  > today is [month]/[day]> [weekday]> nothing is happening today!> love, [grandson's name]  and we moved a clock that shows the day/date in addition to the time to be directly beside this little board (so she doesn't get up to make sure the information on the board means today, because it can't mean today because isn't something happening today?).  when we had messages like ""haircut at 3:30"" she would start getting ready every time she saw the message, no matter what time it was--getting dressed to go out, looking for her purse and checkbook, and sometimes just walking out the door to find her own way there.  or ""dinner with [relative],"" she'd see that and wonder what i'm going to be doing about dinner if she's going out to supper, so she'll seek me out every thirty seconds to make sure that i know i have full run of the kitchen and liquor cabinet.  it's really sweet of her, and it's become something of a ritual, where she insists that i help myself to everything, anything in the house, and i say, ""yes grandma, when you come home, we will have eaten everything!"" and she laughs and goes along with whoever has come to pick her up. we have an echo show sitting on the dining room table. usually it's good for watching the news or something on youtube. my grandmother tries to read the suggestions, but she never triggers alexa. she says alex or skips the name. she will ask me what story was just quickly displayed and is gone before i can look. she hasn't touched any of the buttons yet that i know of.btw i loved watching perry mason and made it thru the available episodes before cbs all access ended for me. [deleted] it's possible. she has five children--her grandchild and their spouse are her primary caregivers, but i moved in when it got to be too much for two people.  i've known the family for more than a decadeshe never learned my name, but she remembers that i'm a friend. [deleted] yeah, i believe it. and i do tend to respond to jokes literally on the internet, even with little smileys to suggest that it's not really a literal comment.  because ... i'm just ... like that. +1 for the unplugging thing. my dad would call me every day to say the tv was broken, when actually he'd unplugged it and the sky box and couldn't get it back on the right channel. i lived over 100 miles away. i had to try to explain the remote control over the phone to his carers from this morning: if you must shit all over your hand because you insist poop isn‚Äôt normal and you had to stick your hand down there to investigate what was coming out of you, and you happen to actually remember to try to wash your hands (instead of coming up to me and waving your poop covered hands in my face like usual) can you please not turn the water in faucet on full blast and literally spray every inch of the bathroom with poop splatter that i have to clean up at 7 am, after the approximately 5 hours sleep you let me get? that‚Äôd be great, thanks. we almost retired from the ""family caregiving business"" last month because grandma had explosive diarrhea in the night and left a trail of poo prints down the hall.  the mop will never be the same again.  well probably not.  we'll never know for sure, we got rid of it. i have certain ‚Äúlines in the sand‚Äù and what you just described is one of them. i appreciate you. i opened up the newspaper today and the huge front page picture was of my dad getting a haircut at the barber! his caregiver took him but forgot to tell me. so much for social distancing. not using her walker, rolling walker or cane. insisting she doesn't need any of them, even though she's very unsteady on her feet and has had too many falls lately.stubbornly refusing help when clearly she needs help at times with walking, standing, dressing, getting lost in the house, turning the volume/speakerphone on her cell phone so she can hear the caller.not wanting to go to bed because she isn't home, but she will go through drawers and mail of this house that she thinks isn't hers.trying to feed everything to the cats irregardless if it's something they would or should eat. my mom fed most of her meals to the cats and dog, or tried, but they weren't in on the plans and didn't always clean everything up, so she'd get caught and say she accidentally dropped it. we actually started putting all critters out of the room until she was done eating because of this and the fact that her border collie weighed around 75 pounds and could barely waddle. > trying to feed everything to the cats irregardless if it's something they would or should eat.  my cat was diagnosed with diabetes about a year after i moved in with 'grandma.'  he never got terribly obese, he just had that bit of a pooch between his back legs, sort of like what female cats get after they've been spayed.  welp, now he has to take insulin twice a day (and he hates it) and we set out a bowl of ""decoy catfood"" to help prevent grandma from fussing with his food.  but he's a ravenous starveling monster and he's taken food out of her hands.  asshole cat, always has been more of a dog. one time my mother left her soiled adult diaper right on top of a very visible trash can in the women's bathroom of a restaurant.  thankfully my wife came in right after her and was completely horrified to discover this.  completely baffled why she didn't at least put it inside the trash can.  so yea people with dementia do some weird stuff. why must you have dozens of wads of toilet paper and paper towels stuffed into your nightstand? why do you insist on opening the blinds for light, even when it‚Äôs dark outside, letting the neighbors look in on us?why do you refuse to change out of your dirty clothes? why do you blame us for everything you don‚Äôt understand? i know the answer is always dementia. we live with my husband‚Äôs grandmother (with dementia) and disabled and deaf aunt, and i have 20 month old and a 2 month old-so it‚Äôs a lot of people to care for!-my baby is a boy. he is dressed in very masculine clothes. please stop calling him ‚Äúshe‚Äù.-if my children are crying please just ignore all of us. don‚Äôt ask them why they‚Äôre sad, or tell me that they‚Äôre crying, i‚Äôm already stressed and trying to handle the situation in an emotionally healthy way and your comments are very unhelpful and very annoying.also, my children‚Äôs names are not extremely common, you just think it‚Äôs the most popular name because you hear it every day because we live here with you.speaking of such; we live here. yes we‚Äôre going to sleep here tonight, yes we have a bed, no we didn‚Äôt just come into town, we‚Äôve lived with you for about 9 months now.-all of the doors are locked. i promise.-please stop saying ‚Äúyes i know‚Äù when i tell you to do things like use hand sanitizer before taking your pills, you obviously don‚Äôt know because every time i don‚Äôt tell you you don‚Äôt do it.and lastly jane (grandma‚Äôs disabled daughter who lives here as well, and not her real name) is totally fine. i promise i feed her/ she‚Äôs totally capable of getting herself her own breakfast and lunch. if you don‚Äôt see her in the chair right next to you then she‚Äôs upstairs in her room- but you should probably check the chair literally right next to you first before you ask. my mil thought my home is a hotel at the beach. we live in the middle of a forest. the house is surrounded by trees. she‚Äôd sit on the upstairs deck and comment on how nice it was to see the ships go by. i had no idea what she was looking at - because it‚Äôs a forest. she also thought i worked at this hotel, and that she was married to my husband - her son. so, she pretty much always wanted to go home (‚Äúit‚Äôs been so nice, but we really need to get back‚Äù), and would spend hours every single evening trying to bully dh into driving her home (the location of which changed constantly), and getting angry with me for stealing her husband. hahaha whoa. this sounds like a fever dream... just, completely surreal. i'd eventually start questioning my own sanity! like, who am i to argue? maybe i am just the bell hop in the arboreal ocean hotel, and i've stolen this poor sweet cougar's luggage so that she can check in any time she like...but she can never leave...?! or maybe i need some damn rest... üòù wow! i feel like my mom is almost ""normal"". thank you for being honest about your day to day lives. i really appreciate this insight. i'd like to add: why must you be convinced that you're having a heart attack or something major, when upon close observation, you are fine? but thank you for waking me up at 2 am in a fright. why must you be obsessed with picking up things on the floor, yet you have a nest of crap around you that you are extremely possessive of and i'm not allowed to touch?why do you insist that you are ""fine"" and that ""you can take care of yourself"" but you haven't made a formal dinner in years, eat very late at night (if i don't provide dinner), only do laundry if i say something negative, (ie gripe and complain) and spend your days being in front of the tv, reading a book or doing your dot to dot books?why must you mess with my head and go through moments of ""normalcy"" followed by long stretches of being blissfully unaware of everything going on? at the same time? why must you argue with me over anything? mom, your stories and memories from the 40's through the 60's are repetitive. mom, i'm getting burned out being responsible for you. i don't have the mental bandwidth to make sure you have mental stimulation, take care of your schedule, your finances, your health and hygiene, plus raise two teens (same issues with them), manage a business would a full caseload of clients, and care for myself emotionally and physically. something's has got to give. dementia is inexorable. oh my gosh, so true.  why does the counter and table have to be completely bare... does dementia turn them into minimalists?  i'm glad christmas is over because my grandma would always refer to the christmas decorations as ""too much junk"" lolsame with the used diapers.  always hidden somewhere, but why!?i didn't realize the unplugging thing was common with others too.we just got an echo show and are trying to work it into use.  so far, getting my relatives to figure out how to drop in on video call has been difficult.i solved that problem of her miscommunicating to relatives what she did that day by emailing a regular report every now and then and updating the google photo album of daily life pics.  it was really frustrating she would tell people on the phone she hadn't eaten anything that day when she just had a full meal.  and then because the phone volume needs to be turned all the way up, i'd hear ""what's (my name) doing over there?  she's supposed to be taking care of you!"" if i picked up the phone to tell them the truth i'd get judged badly for ""eavesdropping"" ...ugh haha 'why??' was exactly the underlying sentiment which caused me to start this post, and in this sub. because i knew y'all would understand /sympathize, and bc this is a question /frustration that our dementia-afflicted loved ones are not bothered by, not even a bit...at least, not anymore. they are not bound by our fetters of reason and logic! they're not restricted by our earthly 'trash bins' or 'lids' (shout-out to u/boethius70 hahaha)! they're free and their minds are clear and empty as a summer sky, and so are their countertops! - please feed your cat. i buy food for it. the bowl is always empty every time i visit. completely empty. i ask and get 'the cat has lots of food' yes but you don't give it to it.i don't want to take your cat but im going to have to take your cat.i do have a billion vents but that's one i think about at home gosh, i have the opposite problem, mum keeps feeding the cat all day, and way too much.  cat was going on a diet every 6 months cos she'd start getting obese.  i hid the cat food, then she'd get her hat & search for money to go buy some.  i have to keep the main cat food stash in my room, just dole out little bits every few days, and a few times a day take it out of cat food bowl & return to tupperware. great post, good idea, thanks!! waking up at 11pm & mopping the kitchen floor - 3 times - with liquid handsoap.  (i have to keep all the housecleaning products locked away, for safety.) picking up & using the bib always right next to your plate, and tucking your bib in firmly, so as to not spill food on clothing at every meal.  tucking the bib in the first time i remind you rather than not tucking it in the 5 times i remind you, thus it falls in your meal, then you drop bits on yourself, resulting in then we have to go do the whole ""change clothing"" tiresome rigmarole thing. the . cat . does . not . go . outside . after . dark.  you don't have to ask me a trillion times every night if kitty might want to go out, cos she's looking out the window, i will not ""maybe change my mind"" about it.  especially when you then say  ""oh well i think she should stay inside after dark too, i just thought maybe you might think she ought to go outside"".  aaaarrrgggghhhhhhhhh    no, i don't think so, you don't think so, end of story!!! don't cut off all the geranium & daisy flowerbuds saying you're ""deadheading the old dead ones"", ""isn't that what you're supposed to do so they bloom better?"".. well they won't bloom at all when you decapitate them before they even bloom!!    i've hidden all the clippers, i've hidden all the scissors, now she goes and gets a kitchen knife.  i go off for a few hours respite for myself, come home to disasters.  too many other, legion of frustrations, to enumerate. wow!  this thread is like therapy for me.  although my gripes aren‚Äôt nearly as bad as most of the others, living with them 24 hours a day is stressful!  here‚Äôs some of mine:the buildings we are passing in the car have been there for 30 years or more. they are not new. you have lived in this community for 70 years. please stop commenting every single time we go out about all the new construction please stop reading aloud every single sign, bumper sticker, license plate etc . just shut up!  please!please stop using rags to wipe your ass. we have toilet paper and wet wipes.  i‚Äôm sick of finding these rags that you rip out of towels in your bathroom. also, please stop throwing your wet diaper across the room. we have a diaper pail for that - sits right by the toilet. for now, my entire life revolves around taking care of you, your shitty house and your shitty yard (she lived with my dad for 8 years in an assisted living facility before he died so the house and yard feel into disrepair). you being nasty to me, as well as extremely paranoid that i‚Äôm taking advantage of you, is going to send you to a facility sooner than later no. you can‚Äôt live alone. please stop telling me how you can. you have no cognitive ability left to understand all i do for you. meds, scheduling and taking you to multiple doctors, shopping for you, cleaning up after you, cooking 3 meals and other snacks for you, entertaining you, doing your laundry, keeping you stocked with diapers and everything else, fixing and maintaining your house and yard, managing your finances, etc etc   you haven‚Äôt done these things in 15 years, at least. (she is 96).  and never a thank you. why do you hoard?  why keep dirty tissues?  why insist on keeping all junk mail from 1980?  why do you keep old boxes, wrappers, etc?  why keep all the other junk? she can no longer go in her daylight basement. there were rooms in the basement that had so much junk you couldn‚Äôt walk through the room. since she can‚Äôt go down there anymore due to the stairs, i‚Äôve emptied 70% of the junk into 3 dumpsters. another lesson i‚Äôve learned - i will not expect my kids to spend their lives going through my junk!!  i will downsize dramatically before i get too old. (i‚Äôve moved 2 times in the last year, so i‚Äôm well in my way to doing that). so many more frustrations. these are today‚Äôs. i empathize so hard with so much of this. do you have kids now? how do they fit into the picture..? my kids are grown and live 4-8 hours away. they are much more worried about me than her as i‚Äôm alone all day every day with her.  one of my daughters and one of my sons (i have 4 kids) stayed with her for a week each last year and it was a disaster. never again  - they don‚Äôt deserve that!  i won‚Äôt go into details about what she did but it ruined their opinions of their grandmother. mil has a thing for folding up paper napkins. in fact her fridge was full of totally rotten food wrapped up in napkins. she's in a memory care home now. we took her fridge , yeah i cleaned it lol.  you know what i found in there last week......a bit of food that would probably never be eaten wrapped up in a paper tissue. i threw it out immediately. my husband is behaving weirdly enough as is. i was creeped out. the screaming!! the all night screaming! as soon as she‚Äôs out down she immediately starts screaming bloody murder, i cannot imagine how this woman‚Äôs vocal chords aren‚Äôt permanently destroyed.also the banging of the walker all night long, she‚Äôll hold her arm outside the bed and bang it on the ground in her sleep all night long and if you take it from her she screams as loud as she can ear piercingly for as long as it takes for you to give back aaahh! when i was caring for my mom this was probably my biggest gripe - my mom had a whistle that she wore around her neck to call for help, and she would use it all the time, for the smallest request, with no discretion and no regard for the time of day. the only thing worse than the fact that this shrill noise would invade my brain non stop, was the fact that if my dad and i were both home, he would always pretend not to hear, even though that is literally impossible. he knew that my tolerance for listening to her suffer was lower than his, and that i'd eventually cave in and go help her first. my god this dynamic drove me insane. for a while i'd take pennies out of my change jar and hurl them down the hall at his bedroom door, so hard that i thought they'd punch a hole through the door lmao",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l6j8a1/ventrant_list_of_annoyances/,1

"my mother-in-law has been relatively lucky in that she was diagnosed 5 years ago, however can still drive (all-be-it to only a handful of locations - including the gym), and remembers everybody most of the time, 100% of the time if they are in the room or she can see them via facetime, etc.  however over the last few weeks we've noticed that a few routine tasks, such as making a sandwich or folding laundry have become increasingly difficult. we give her these tasks so that she feels productive and so that she doesn't feel like a burden (her words), however this only seems to set-off her level of frustration and stress, which usually leads to spiraling & confusion that i'm sure many of you know about all to well.as i mentioned, her decline has been relatively slow. now were' starting to wonder if this is a sign that it's speeding up. i know every case differs greatly, but curious about others who have come across this."," if she wants to feel useful, continue with these tasks, giving her less complicated ones like finding washcloths or socks, stacking (plastic) cups/plates, tie ribbons in bits or knots. a fidget quilt would also keep her occupied as things get worse- they make a lot of them on etsy and can be personalized or made yourself if you can sew or crochet ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/l0vptz/simple_tasks_no_longer_simple/,1

"by affected i mean by aging diseases that effect the mind and emotions. i realized that i see part of my mission as caretaker as making sure my dad doesn't go off the deep end. and doesn't make bad decisions that adversely affect health and wellbeing. let me tell ya it can get a tad bit nutty. and i'm sure many of you have seen worse. dad had issues sometimes with his poop. it is almost impossible to understand what the problem is. he will use the wrong words or use them poorly. and the symptoms and issues change from day to day. he may say diahrrea  but then say that suddenly he has to poop and he hurries to the bathroom. he has trouble getting up and walking w/ a walker so he makes it barely. then it all comes out whoosh! so he calls it the d but it isn't. he says he doesnt feel it coming 'til right before and feels thats not normal. he poops once and then its fine. no blood, no weird anything, no cramps or pressure. im guessing his system is old and sometimes acts different. so he tells me tonight  he just wants toast for brunch. i offer to cut out his sausage, no...just toast. sandwich? no...toast. pb on that toast? no...toast. his jello and banana should be fine.i just dont know from what he says that he has an issue. he always expects everything to be the same everytime. he wont or cant admit hes 94. frustrating. of course he didnt tell me earlier that he had a supposed problem today and i ordered sandwiches. which i would have altered his dinner if i'd known. but started him back  on metamucil  a few days ago so could be that. cant get him to leave the pepto alone either. so very set in his ways. thank you, ranting", my mil with dementia doesn't seem aware that she needs to go until it's critical or too late. this is common in the late stages of dementia.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/kuwgaj/for_those_caring_for_affected_parent/,1

"my grandmother has had about 5 stokes over the past 10 years. she has been living with my parents for the past 2 years after her last stoke which has led to significant dementia.she has an always right personally which has been enhanced by the dementia. since she has had several stokes before, she has learned how to handle their effects--meaning we can have no suggestions. she completely acknowledges she has mental issues and is frequently frustrated by them, but still refuses to accept even the smallest chunks of reality.we took her to her dentist the other day and she said that she hated this dentist and said that all they want to do is find ways to charge her more money. she said she had some form of pre-paid insurance at her preferred dentist but that my dad had ripped up the papers. she told us about this dentist and wanted to go there.i took her out driving to find it. she didn't know where it was other than some vague memories, and neither did i. she said my dad knew where it was and was upset he made me take her. we spent several hours circling the city, she wanted me to ask people on the street if they knew where the dentist was located.a similar situation happened about a year ago when she said she had money in a secret bank. my dad took her out driving around for it several times, probably why he passed the driving task to me to find the dentist this time.unfortunately the conversations between her and my dad often lead to argument as she lays claims over our chip clips or other things my dad can't just go with (such as driving her around to find non-existent business or walmart certainly not being the store where she buys her yogurt). while most of her stories and delusions can be uuhhuu'd, there are some that require intervention such as refrigerator settings, food choices, shower schedule, or that her aarp card only works for medicine. she doesn't like paying for anything, although very good standing financially.she doesn't like playing games or really anything else enjoyable (she is ""done with all that""). she talks of how she likes going to the store and helping people by talking through their problems. a worthy cause, but not scalable, especially during covid. we wanted to get some sort of professional caregiver or members of her church to visit, but she doesn't trust strangers and fears they will steal stuff. she spends her days just sort of existing and we would like to find something for her to do.i don't want to straight up lie to her as she isn't completely disconnected. she seems cognizant to those that don't understand the context deeper.i avoid correcting her but try to be as honest as possible and sprinkle in a little reality here and there without upsetting her just to maintain my own sanity. when frustrated by my parents, i say it is difficult for them too.i have maintained a great relationship with her and she is always overjoyed to see me when i visit my parents' every week. she takes me into her room and shows me/talks about various things and offers me food from her stash of junk food.", it‚Äôs not easy. does she refuse to shower? how do your parents handle that situation?my mom has dementia and the only real problem so far is her personal hygiene.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kdx52c/my_grandma/,1
"just had another bout with dehydration with my mother (94, i'm the sole caregiver). previous bouts had led to hospitalizations that were, on retrospect, unnecessary. doctor concurred that it was likely dehydration. while dehydration crises happen less, they still can. i watched her at breakfast and dinner as usual, but simply didn't take note of all those times she'd only drunk a third or so of her 16 ounce glass. i assured myself she'd be fine because i was giving her her usual shake in the afternoon. i was wrong. the onset of symptoms was slow, then swift, until she was trying to eat her napkin for her dinner. couldn't walk. fell, gash on nose. i got all this taken care of without a trip to the er, woo hoo. and went in for the fluids; extra drinks, making sure she drank all of her meal drink, and sure enough, she's back to her baseline for energy, exercises, etc. it most definitely was dehydration.what made me post this (i think i've done this before) was someone's post on here about their father trying to eat his napkin. it just made me wonder if the guy was just dehydrated. obviously, there can be more, much more causing delerium/dementia, but this one you have to look at closely. it seems very clear that dehydration is likely to be a, maybe the, primary malady affecting the elderly in their health crises. and it really may suggest many other problems, when it's this simpler explanation.you have to really, really watch for it, and do the math. how much did they have to drink for breakfast? oh, they poured a full glass, but how much did they actually drink? and for lunch? snack? dinner? if it all amounts to about 6 ounces for the whole day, it's just a matter of time. do the math. they're going to become dehydrated, no question, with just 6 ounces of liquid a day. hydration levels (according to my non-professional opinion) just slowly lower until they reach a critical point. but you don't notice it, like the famous frog in the hot water. i realize it can be incredibly hard to get them to drink. making really good shakes helps me a lot (i don't use ice cream but milk, evaporated milk, ice, flavorings, in a good blender). but as i've noted, i can still miss it. and i'm 99 percent sure many, many people are missing this maybe single most important necessity.so i'm making this public service suggestion. announcements are for professionals. i'm not. but i think what i'm talking about should be easy to see.", thank you this is really something to keep in mind when dealing with our elderly parents.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/kc05pf/pss_public_service_suggestion_dehydration_is_a/,1

"realy don't know how to bring this to a good solution. dad (94) had two pairs of glasses. couple months ago he went for an eye exam and his eyes havent changed, but he wanted a new pair anyway. he asked the guy for a different style of frame cause his old ones tended to slip. so he got a new style and was happy going home. they needed adjustment, all good. then there was something called a 'final adjustment'. then an emergency adjustment. each time the guy looks at me and i shrug and he fixes em and dad's happy. week ago he tells me they gave him double and blurred vision. i ask him today and he doesnt remember that. but he needs to give them back because they slip. cant get a refund of course, he just wanted to give them back. i suggested he get the lenses put in new frames and that he get the old style frames. now he asked for a new style cause the old slipped, now they dont slip but the new ones do. *and you see why i drink*anyway, i suggested he try wearing glasses #3 and if the frames are acceptable he have the guy put his new lenses in them. that is the hope. now my prediction is that in the shop theyre fine. after a few days they dont work. this is playing out to a slow neverending play.  he also told his glasses were a year old, theyre maybe two months. he told me his old pair were from the va and were $35 cause they didnt have a prescription.

is using a bidet/handheld bidet to clean my grandma who does not have control of bowel movements and can not clean herself safe? i am worried about this leading to a urinary track infection or infecting her hemorrhoid. i'm interested in hearing other peoples experience using one. what type do you use? what should i look for when getting one? is getting one that hooks up to warm water recommended?  has it made the task of cleaning easier? thank you!,"get one that you can attach to her regular toilet. amazon has them. when my grandma was in her final months with rectal cancer there was a lot of messy bathroom trips. luckily her bathroom is set up to where the shower hose reached to the toilet. my mom would use the hose to clean her because wiping too much hurt her. it worked out well. i would definitely recommend a bidet. thank you. i think we are going to give the shower head extender a try. there is one that you can attach to the toilet. you need to connect it to the hot water line of your sink and to the cold water line that goes to the toilet tank. they are not that expensive. my roommate had one installed in the last place i lived and i did use it a few times just to try it. i guess it would be helpful if someone has trouble cleaning themselves. i have and use one every day. from just my perspective as an owner of one, not as someone who's used one to clean someone else, i can see where it would come in handy. i would suggest getting one that has the ability to warm water because cold water there is quite a shock if you're not expecting it. that being said, there are a few things that you might want to consider:first of all, water doesn't generally come out warm unless someone's just used it before you. therefore you're going to want to get one with a self-cleaning feature (most have this) and let it run for a few seconds before turning it on to spray her posterior to allow the time to warm up.second, warm water bidets have a knob to adjust the temperature. they can be bumped fairly easily on some models. i would suggest using it yourself and adjusting it to a comfortable temperature, letting it run for a minute or so to be sure it's not going to get hotter, then put a piece of packing tape over the knob to stop it from being changed. a scalded bottom if it gets set to straight hot water by accident, especially if the person has trouble communicating that it hurts, is not good.i've heard that using a bidet can be good for hemorrhoids if you're not blasting the water pressure. i've read that gentle water pressure is much like a sitz bath and cleaning without rubbing with toilet paper to irritate things and leave behind ""lint"" can help alleviate itching. as for cleaning the more frontal area, most have a setting for front and back to redirect the spray. i'm a bigger woman and to be sure everything's getting cleaned, i lean forward a bit to help the spray hit the target better.  all in all, i can see a bidet being pretty helpful. use it yourself for a bit to become familiar with it before helping her use it. good luck! thank you! we have one for my gran, she loves it, she has limited dexterity so we worried about her being able to use it, but she is able to turn the nob. granted it is a rush of cold water and i think she'd prefer warm but other than that she likes it and it gets the job done. when i was a caregiver for a family friend they had one. it was a handheld one that just hung off the tank and it made things so much easier. i still would have to take her into the shower afterwards if it was really bad but it was so much easier than using toilet paper. i now have one at home that is a seat on the toilet and while it has some awesome bells and whistles i don't find it as convenient when dealing with cleaning another person. i am strongly leaning to moving it to another toilet and getting a spray one for the main bathroom thanks that is really helpful? i bought one for my disabled (and overweight) friend. she said it works great, but the water's cold. i tested it when i installed it, and yes it's cold but it works great. i highly suggest everyone get one because tp is just inefficient and wasteful. i got this one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/j94iqc/does_anyone_have_experience_using_a_bidethandheld/,1

"just earlier, grandma (88) was panicked about ""people outside that could look through the windows"".  she has large bay windows and a sliding door that both have blinds.  she has not really much said she is concerned about people looking through them, though she has talked about that sometimes in the evening but mostly about a deer that came up to the window.  also, lately, she would sometimes say when closing the blinds that we were keeping the keeping the virus out.  i think she still maybe thinks that but i haven't heard her say that for a bit.so i was confused by this newest fear of people and thought maybe she just woke up in the mood from a nap, and let her be for a bit.  but she comes over and repeats her worry and asks me to go outside and look in, so i tell her i will after i finish what i was doing.  i'm a little worried about her now how grumpy she seems, and i go first to the bathroom.  that is when i notice the bathroom window blind are mostly open and uneven.  i remember earlier today i dusted and lifted that blind a little to clean.  i can tell she's tried to put it down.  i give a large sigh of relief.  she had only wanted that blind down that normally is.  so i go and apologize to her for leaving it up and ask if that is what she had meant, and it was.  i explain why i lifted.  she seemed relieved too, though she still was repeating about it being up and thinking people would see her.  but i understood what she needed and she hadn't suddenly turned paranoid about the normal outside windows, which was my fear, so i am writing this much with much relief.my message is just to not dwell too much on the message (which could lead you in the wrong direction) but pay attention that they want help and try to find out what the real problem is, and you might find out that it makes senses even if the words don't.", poor thing. my immediate thought was that she's been watching the news and listening to trump tell everyone that the thugs are coming to get them.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ithnmd/misunderstanding_and_a_resolved_panic/,1

"this is my very first time posting here, and on my phone. not sure if it will come out funny. hello, all. i am 22 years old and take care of my grandma. she lives with us, and is 88 years old. she has dementia, and it is rather apparent. does not remember eating, even though her plate is in front of her empty. talks about the possibility of it snowing in august. just a ton of confusion with so many things. after she got out of the hospital in january due to being impacted, i became her caregiver. it all happened naturally. i do almost everything for her. laundry, dishes, prepare her all three meals and snacks, clean the house, etc. she is very, very appreciative of it all. she has the dementia and one other thing against her here. she hardly uses her legs, and because of this, they constantly kill her. the walk from the bathroom to the kitchen (which is not very far at all, a few steps at most) is too much for her. they ache so bad, and she has to sit down. she spends the whole day watching tv. from afternoon until bedtime at night. she never gets up. her legs look very thin, and it has to be her muscles experiencing atrophy. i am downstairs with her for quite awhile during the day. she calls me over the intercom when she is ready to get up, as her using the telephone has become much too confusing. i could be downstairs with her from 10:30 in the morning until 2:45 in the afternoon. a couple hours later, she calls me down to sit with her for awhile because it is ‚Äúso boring down here‚Äù. which i never once mind doing. today, for example, i was down there from 12:00 this afternoon until 2:55. at 5:00, she called and wanted me to sit with her for awhile. she said she hates sitting down here alone. i told her i had to feed my dog first, and then would be right down. have been down here ever since. she really loves the company. i guess i just wanted to get people‚Äôs thoughts on this, and if they have also experienced the same thing. also to ‚Äúvent‚Äù but that is not the exact word i want to use. thank you :)","hiya!  oh, yeh, that sounds hard, for you both.  you are doing fantastic job, taking care of her! sure it must be very lonely for her, and get boring for her, since she can't move by herself, and down there alone for some hours.  but it's difficult for you to stay all day with her.  so, do you mean you live in a house?  or apartment building? i guess physiotherapy would be good for her, but that's for professionals to advise about.  sounds like she needs a wheel-chair! so she can go outside, can you push her outside the door?  is there a garden she can look at, or a street with people passing by?  you can put a small table beside her, with idk, bottle of water, snack, newspaper, magazine... you would need to check on her every half hour, take her to toilet every 2 hours, even if she says she doesn't need to go.  go for a push up the street sometimes, to get her out of tv world all day.  the mental stimulation is helpful for general condition, to go out. or, do you have a car, can you drive?my mother is lucky - she is 87, but still very mobile. also can't remember if we had dinner yet or not (we had it half hour ago), but she can walk a lot - slowly but... we go out to parks, beach-side, have picnics. when it's cold or rainy weather we picnic in the car, i park it at beachside or a park, near a toilet, where there is some view & people passing by walking dog or whatever.  we take newspaper, magazine, crossword puzzle book, thermos hot tea, etc... sometimes she naps lol... i take my laptop and play on internet... it's a good change from at home.  often we throw a ball (or a balloon) - she often can't catch it & spends more time picking it up but she throws it, it's good exercise.. it's a great job you are doing, good on you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ip3sa6/needy_grandma/,1

does anyone use automated pill reminders? i‚Äôve see a bunch out there but i wasn‚Äôt sure how well they work. i‚Äôm considering something that‚Äôs a bit more secure because my dad has been taking more than his normal amount and i‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs going to continue.,"i used this one for my husband.  it has a clear lid so you can see when they have missed a pill time.  it rotates so you can set up a week or two depending on how often it‚Äôs set for.  it doesn‚Äôt ensure they take the pills but it will beep until it‚Äôs turned over letting the pills fall out.   i gave him a special bowl to dump the pills in and put bottled water on the counter next to it to make sure he had no reason to leave of get distracted.  i even used it when his dementia progressed beyond the point of being able to medicate himself to make sure i remembered to give him meds at the proper times.  livefine automatic pill dispenser, 28-day electronic medication organizer with alarm reminders, flashing light and safety lock - dispenses prescriptions up to 6 times per day - clear lid  we used a similar model (might even be the same one but i can't remember) for mom up until she needed to go to assisted living. the beeper wasn't very loud so if she was in another room she wouldn't hear it until someone passed through the room it was in and made sure she grabbed her pills. it was well worth the money. i'm not sure how tricky it was setting it up because the home health care nurse did the set up for us and continued to refill the pills. i think the one i bought had a second tray so you could fill it ahead of time and swap them out but we never used it. don't get the version with the opaque lid - it's harder to tell when it's time to refill. yeah it beeps for like half an hour.  a beep that was grating to me but my husband needed to be in an adjoining room at least.  it also flashes.  i had a spare tray as well to make refilling it easy. i just got a hero for my mom who i think has mci and has a staggering amount of medication to take daily. it comes with an app so you can see when they dispense the pills. they have to push a button to get them to go into the cup. it holds up to ten meds and can also do a reminder for meds not in the hero - like an aspirin. so far it‚Äôs working pretty well. she lives alone so the med dispense notification is like another check in for me. it doesn‚Äôt lock, however. i had seen one of these. i‚Äôm curious: do you buy the machine and also pay the monthly subscription? or does the machine come as a lease as part of it? the machine is a lease. it‚Äôs 99 dollars down and then 30 dollars a month for the service and app. i got the tab time one for my mum. it was really helpful for a couple of years to enable her to maintain her independence. stopped using it when she didn‚Äôt seem to notice the flashing light and loud alarm anymore. think they also did a sim card one that would let you know if it had been tipped up to remove the pills, but it was quite pricey. we got one for my mom. pills released am pm.  she smashed it one day to get the pills out of it. she was was sure she needed them.  so now the aide does it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/io7nh9/medication_devices/,1

(i really wanted to live in a place with public transport, pedestrian life, and cold weather.)a lot of my father's mind is still intact. he knows who he is, he knows who my mom is, he knows who i am, and he knows that i am here. he knows that i'm living abroad. there is still a lot of him left. he knows what's going on around him, to an extent. he likes bbc podcasts and he follows along. we went to the supermarket and came home and he remembered details of what we did at the supermarket (he found it impressive that i knew how to buy food).my parents' house has been overly cluttered with shit, and i convinced my mom to give a lot of shit to goodwill. most of the shit was random gifts from random people - glass tigers, giant miniature sailboats, metal apples on metal plates, wooden russian spoons, a large yellow vase with red chinese dragons (this object was very expensive and had been important to my father's mother), little sculptures, decorated plates and bowls, all kinds of objects from all over the world that people brought to us without asking and expected us to keep forever. every solid surface in the house was covered with this garbage. expensive garbage, but garbage nonetheless. the dining room table, the desks, the kitchen counter, the shelves, the dressers, everywhere was covered in stupid objects. thirty years of accumulated garbage ate up all the space, collected dust, cluttered the house. we spent the past two weeks collecting all this garbage into plastic boxes and dumping it off at goodwill. my dad wanted to participate in this cleaning project, but he really couldn't. he kept doing bizarre things like brushing the floor with a small brush instead of using a broom. we have one room that's full of books (which we're mostly planning to give away) and he started cleaning that floor with a wet mop, which was damaging the books. we told him to stop, because first we would take the books to some library and then we would clean the floor, but he angrily insisted to do it anyway because ""oh i won't damage the books."" the thing is, my dad was already like that when his brain was working. he would often do things that made sense to absolutely nobody but him, and he would fight you if you tried to interfere. it's one of the reasons my mom wanted to leave him. in my opinion, he had undiagnosed asperger's syndrome, because in the wikipedia entry for asperger's it describes my dad's personality a lot. as it turned out, he had no idea that he was using a wet mop (because he insisted it was dry), so i replaced it with a dry broom and he just kept sweeping.there are some objects that my dad would not want to throw away, like the large yellow vase from china, or a sprawling set of ancient wine glasses we never use, or a heavy crystal-glass bowl that was a wedding gift from some cousin, but he wasn't really capable of recognizing that we were getting rid of those objects. he just went along with it.i also found something which i thought was sort of incredible - a diary kept by my dad's mother during the years 1929 to 1933, when she was age 19 to 23. my dad asked what it was and i told him, i said ""it's a diary from [her name] from 1929 to 1933,"" and he said, ""oh wow! i want to read it!"" but then i guess he forgot about it five minutes later. it had been in the garage, sitting in humidity and heat, so i brought it to my room and read it. i can't say it was that interesting - she visited cleveland and new york, and she was in love with some guy named ray who is almost certainly dead - but having a 90-year-old diary from a deceased relative written when she was almost younger than the dog is quite remarkable. (the dog has also gotten really old and she doesn't like to play anymore.)there are a lot of little things that are getting worse. in 2015 my dad couldn't find his way to an elevator in a small hotel. now he can't recognize cabinets that he built himself twenty years ago. or he'll hold up an object that's very obviously a simple object like a cup and ask what it is. my mom installed some hooks in the bathroom for holding towels and he ripped them off the walls because he thought they were door handles for a cabinet that didn't exist.i've been staying home because i don't want to collect corona and bring it home, but last night i went out with one of my childhood friends, mike, and we sat at an outdoor table at a taco restaurant. he knows my dad. i told him what was going on, and mike said, ""he's going to start forgetting who you are."" that comment sort of caught me off guard, because i guess it didn't occur to me that it will get worse. it didn't occur to me that it's sort of a big deal that my dad still knows who i am and that i am here.i sort of avoid my parents, especially my dad, when i am home, because old habits die hard. he needs a lot of attention (even when his brain worked he needed a lot of attention) so i tended to stay in my room with the door closed, and now as an adult i'm doing the same thing. i feel like i am wasting this valuable time while my dad's brain is still working at the level that it is.i didn't expect to write this many paragraphs, i thought this would be a short post. but anyway i guess i would like to spend some more time with my dad, but i don't really know how because whenever i'm in his presence i feel overwhelmingly driven to go back to my room and sit in bed and browse instagram or some such stupid bullshit. i guess i'd like to know what are some things i can do during this early stage while he's still there. like how can i take advantage of this time.", take him to the park. talk and feed the ducks.or simply hold his hand. it's powerful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/iexpba/what_are_some_things_i_should_do_with_my_dad/,1

my grandpa is on the decline with dementia and my grandma is his primary caregiver while she can manage him. i'm visiting for a week helping them get their house ready to sell and compile old photos and records on her computer.one of the biggest issues my grandma has to deal with is his diet coke addiction. whenever he wants a drink instead of grabbing his open bottle next to him he goes to the fridge to get an unopen bottle. next thing you know he has 5 open bottles next to him and gets defensive if you try to combine what's left of them into one bottle or put the warmest ones back in the fridge.my grandma would hide them in boxes or in the back of the fridge so they would be cold when he would want one. (he's very particular that they're cold). that's been working for a while but he's been finding the hiding spots recently. he gets into random things a lot too and my grandma is getting burnt out from it (understandably). are there things people on this sub have found that help situations like that? is it a good idea to continue to hide/lock his diet coke up? any suggestions with managing that?," also i would suggest to maybe not keep multiple bottles in the fridge? like maybe two, and storing the rest somewhere at room temperature so he wouldn't grab them. then, if he takes the second one, even though he's already opened the first, put the first one back in the fridge and so on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i4g8ia/advice_for_controlling_a_diet_coke_addict/,1

"my dad is in what i believe to be the middle stages of the disease. we also recently moved \~6 months ago which seems to have increased/accelerate his decline. we've noticed that his more aggressive/violent outbursts are usually triggered by mirrors. he's convinced it's an intruder and as a result gets very aggressive. we do have 2 large slide-closet sized mirrors which we have covered with curtains, but we haven't covered the bathroom mirrors.has anyone else found a solution to this? how do you talk to them when they are convinced there is a stranger in the house? has anyone found a good way to cover bathroom mirrors so that they are still usable for other people in the house?any help or any other stories you have to share would be appreciated! thanks guys, take care :)"," hey hope you get help with this. when my mum sometimes sees reflections she gets frightened and her response is usually dependant on the mood she's in, she does get aggressive sometimes, so we just reassure her as much as possible, cheer her up, make her laugh put on her favorite music or funny youtube videos because usually the aggression comes from fear. er, it's always hard because there's not one answer with a problem with dementia it's just trial and error.i have had some success with the pill memantine which has made her aggression drop significantly, so maybe you could research that?wishing you the best of luck",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/gjs94r/mirror_triggers_for_people_with_dementia/,1

"along with trying to make sure my dad takes his meds properly theres trying to get his doc to write them properly and get the pharmacist to understand when they change a med. one of his docs needs to try new meds. she will start him at a low dose to see how he tolerates it and if good tells him to increase how many pills he takes. so she writes it for 1 pill 3 times a day or 3 pills a day. if tolerated after a week increase to 2 pills three times a day or 6 a day and if tolerated after a week increase to taking 3 pills 3 times a day. what i cant get her to understand is she writes the script for 3 a day then hes taking much more than that he runs out way early. since insurance thinks it should last much longer cause its written for 3 a day, they think hes overtaking it and wont cover another fill until the original time has passed.when they change a drug or the strength of the drug they write a new prescription. his pharmacy will keep filling the old ones so i need to cancel them. he got a call they had filled his old bp med, they had to cut the dosage in half. so i went down and explained the changes. delete the old 5mg script, fill the newer 2.5 script. his neuroligist told  me they transferred their script to another pharmacy cause it made it alot cheaper. but she didnt transfer, just called in a new script at the new pharmacy. so i let this existing pharmacy know they had moved and please dont fill that one. so it was delete the neuro med, delete the 5mg old med. i even wrote down the current meds they needed to fill for him complete with rx numbers, wrote on the list 'these are the current meds to fill'. found out today they had deleted all of them. either that tech grossly misunderstood or i made her mad. now they have to contact the doctor and get them resent. thankful he has bp and sleep meds for a couple weeks.dad has forgotten to take his sleep one a few times and taken several days at once so i prep his pills and give them to him and so far hes been fine with that. tonight i went with him at bedtime and showed him his sleep meds to be sure he took them and he got cross. im guessing  he has conveniently forgotten wanting me to help. it seems when hes weak he really wants help and is appreciative but when he feels better hes a crab. man, im a light touch. lemme just see him swallow the pills and ill leave so i can do something for me. loltheres always something every day. hes having digestive issues. i marked it down to the fried chicken last night, not greasy but still. trying to get some fiber, plenty of water, some fruit but no apples ever again. 4a.m. he woke up with abdominal urgency and couldnt get to the toilet on time. but after a nap he was strong enough to walk without his walker. seldom can he do that.aight, rest of the night is minethanks",,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gguxkk/frustrated_meds/,1

 around the block, down a nature path?  something?  anything?  how about for a car ride?  you may have no destination but that doesn't matter.  it is the act of getting out and the feeling that some control over what you are doing that may be the best medicine for her (and for you). make it a game in the car... when you get to an intersection, ask her ""right or left"", then just go where she says.  you may both get lost in the process, but enjoy the change of scenery.  just because we are quarantined doesn't mean you cannot get fresh air.  and when she wants to leave and then is faced with a prominent ""locked out"" signal, this will only intensify her frustrations.&#x200b;edit: here are the zoom ids&#x200b;&#x200b;today¬†  10:00 am  [virtual caregiver support group](  125-321-772  sat, apr 25¬†  12:00 pm  [virtual caregiver support group](  948-899-899  tue, apr 28¬†  07:00 pm  [virtual caregiver support group](  112-517-798  thu, apr 30¬†  10:00 am  [virtual caregiver support group](  125-321-772  sat, may 2¬†  12:00 pm  [virtual caregiver support group](  948-899-899  tue, may 5¬†  07:00 pm  [virtual caregiver support group](  112-517-798  thu, may 7¬†  10:00 am  [virtual caregiver support group](  125-321-772",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g66vnx/my_motherinlaw_has_covid19_and_keeps_on_trying_to/,1

"i'm interested in knowing if anyone else has seen similar results:my mother was unable to take care of herself in many ways (ex: leaving food and dishes out after eating to rot or putting them in odd places), but i'll focus on showering to give you an idea:-she took no initiative. i'd remind her to take a shower, she'd say she ""was going to"" or ""already had"", then when i convinced her to go she'd need to be guided to where the shower is. when she finally got into the shower she'd sit (we have one of those tub chairs) and i'd have to turn on the water, get the towels and washcloths, and put water and soap on the washcloth. if i gave her the soaped up washcloth she'd move it around a little bit and kind of nod off. i'd end up washing her entire body for her. she started taking donepezil and within a week or so there were some very noticeable changes. it's been about 2 months and here's the same shower scenario:- she asks me to help her shower and will walk herself there. she will either find towels or ask me to get them for her. she asks me to show her where the washcloths are. she either gets in the tub herself or asks me to help because she has some mobility issues and doesn't want to fall. she puts water and soap on the washcloth herself and asks me to angle the shower head  so that it's easier for her to rinse the washcloth. she might ask for help washing her hair.she also remembers a lot more now. another example: before donepezil my husband and i would ask her dates such as her birthday, my birthday, and his birthday. she'd hardly remember the month, and would place my birth year before hers. now: she can tell you all these dates without hesitating. she'll even remind me about things from the day before.&#x200b;has anyone else had results like this with donepezil? we got her sugars under control also and figure that helped. she was really bad about eating before (fried chicken and chocolate cake all the time), and then we stepped in."," just be aware that donepezil can get weird over a prolonged period, so keep monitoring",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g4wpmt/experiences_with_donepezil_aricept/,1
"hi there,i'm not a paid-caregiver. honestly, if i received monetary compensation, a lot of this would be easier - though still difficult. currently, i live with and look after my parents (65m, 63f) and i'm about at my wits end.so, my father is on a plethora of drugs, i'm sure you all know this kind of experience. he's doing okay, mostly, but his bowels are all kinds of screwed up - he shits regularly, he pisses whenever too much weight strikes his gut, it gets everywhere. mostly it's controllable and he can get to the bathroom fine on his own, but(t)...he's also lazy.like, i know most people haven't viewed themselves as 80+ since they were born, like me, and he has an internal view of himself as some hale 18-yr old or whatever. but he isn't; and unless mom or i are watching him 24/7, he'll let shit stick to his clothes, get it on the door handle and then, maybe wash his hands, trail it through the hallway... he has trouble seeing/hearing, so he doesn't always notice it's present, either.(usually he blames the septic.)even as essentially a full-time caregiver, i can't be around him 24/7, and unfortunately, my mom won't even tell me all the time when he's had accidents. she'll stubborn through and do it on her own, and she can't do it on her own.i asked her about it bluntly, and she started off with some 'oh, well, i want you to live your life' or something similar; i couldn't help but laugh.this is my life, it'll be my life until i die, they're still young and otherwise in good health.... anyway.i'd love to have some good solutions, if possible. i don't think an extra caretaker would work, because it's not so much that he's going unwatched, it's just that he seems to time his accidents for when neither of us are paying attention, aha.i realise this is kind of a more professional nook, so feel free to remove this post or point me towards a different sub, but if you've any ideas, i'd surely appreciate them.good luck with your own work out there, whether it's by inclination or choice, hope you're all doing well.","wow, that‚Äôs a tough one.  you don‚Äôt know the reason for it.  whatever the reason, i would tell his doctor at the next visit.  possibly they can look at his meds and/or rule out some physical reason.  maybe depression, meds would help that, even if he‚Äôs already on one (my dad is on 4).  i doubt it‚Äôs because of his lack of sight, i would think he would be overly cautious/clean.  have you tried having him help you clean up the mess? i know he can‚Äôt see it, but if you point him in the general direction he can feel it and clean it up.  that might make him more aware of what he‚Äôs doing.  just some ideas to toss around.  i would be so aggravated, don‚Äôt let it break ya.  stay strong, hopefully a reason will be found.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/g4f1pw/help_taking_care_of_parents_restroom_needs/,1

"just curious if anyone had any advice for medical devices that may be of great help when dealing with alzheimer's.  my father is in his mid 70s and had his diagnosis 5 years ago.  he is starting to become incontinent, and has frequent dizziness and gait issues now.  so far i'm assuming we have to make their shower wheelchair friendly, toilet handles, the reclining  sofa chair that helps you get up.  also looking into getting a hospital bed as right now he sleeps in a king size and will be a lot of laundry and linen changing for my mother to constantly be doing.  he has not started wandering yet, and can feed himself and is starting to have difficulty with buttoning shirts and putting on jackets and buckling himself into the car.  also does medicare or insurance cover these items as long as the dr writes a script?  any advice would be very appreciated!  sorry for the post being everywhere, but there is a lot to prep for.","for the incontinence, put away all of his underwear and put pull-up depends/diapers in their place - so he has no choice but to wear them. for the bed, you can buy material, by the yard, for his bed that is almost indestructible.  it has flannel on each side and rubber in the middle. you can cut it to size and you can have several of them. so all you have to do is remove the wet one and put a dry one under him.safety is paramount if he has entered that phase. take the burner knobs off the stove, hide the car keys,  put slide locks extremely high or low on the doors (where he wouldn‚Äôt think to look).  if he starts falling, put protective bumpers on the sharp edges of the furniture.  the best thing to do is to walk through the house and look at it as if you had to babyproof it for a toddler.  he also should not be left at home, alone. there are just too many bad things that can happen, just like that could with a child.please return with any other questions, or even to vent. most of us have been through this too and can sympathize. thank you!  i will look for this type of bedding.  is it something i can find at joann's?   they have baby and toddler grandkids that come over frequently so a lot of their things are safer and they have minimal furniture.  any door locks recommended for basement door?  i was thinking of changing out the handle because my mom is on the shorter side.  also i am trying to get him into an adult day care program in case i need to take her grocery shopping as he gets super irritated going these days.  he used to love shopping, do you think it would be a theraputic treatment to create a list he has to find in the store or do you think it would be overwhelming and make him more irritated? also think about helpful items for eating and deinking. plates with 90 angle sides to help get food onto spoon or fork. tumbler cups with lids and straws...., the sliding bathtub chair was super helpful for my mom. and if you have hardwood floors, rugs or hallway runners for high walking areas. and putting medication in a hidden spot. also find whatever he is interested in and get a lot of it. my mother became obsessed with clothing catalog and kid puzzles. it helped keep her occupied and mind working for quite a while. we also child proofed the cabinets and appliances. this stopped lots of dangerous accidents as she forgot the use of stuff. definitely get a hospital bed or add rails to the bed. we did both. medicare paid for the hospital bed. yeah, i was looking at hospital beds on craigslist.  does medicare pay for entirely or does your doctor write a script and you pay a copay?  my dad loved to shop, was wondering if giving him a grocery list and taking him shopping would be a good idea.  but he does get irritated going places now. hospice paid for my mother's hospital bed too and she did not die for almost 7 years after the doctor wrote the prescription. that's just what they have to write to get the bed and nurses paid for. it's scary but once you see that's the only way to get the bed and accessories without going bankrupt. it may vary state by state, but for my wife medicare (through hospice) paid 100% for a hospital bed, shower chair, disposable underwear, moistened wipes, lotions and soaps, waterproof pads (to put on couches, chairs...) 3x5 foam pad for the floor in case she fell out of bed, and all of her meds.basically anything the hospice nurse decided would be useful would show up the next day.if you haven't gotten a referral for hospice yet, do it tomorrow morning. i always saw hospice as a ""he is going to die soon"" type of referral. bi didn't think those type of things would be available for him at this stage.  i'll call his doctor tomorrow!  thank you i believed the exact same thing technically, the referal has to be for a life expectancy of less than 6 months, but i think that is taken with a grain of salt. the main nurse we had said she's had patients on hospice for over 2 years. please let me know how it works out. thank you, will do!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/d3x82s/preparing_my_mothers_house_for_fathers/,1

"a little over a year ago, my grandma had to move into our house. we had to make sure she didn't go up the stairs, so my mom made some barriers from pool noodles. we originally had one next to the stairs and going up to my mom's room, but she kept coming into the living room, taking my stuff, and just staring at me and it was unsettling. my mom put another one going into the living room. 30 minutes ago, she found out how to use the carabiners and i need some help on how to keep her out of some areas, but not make it look industrial or too forced. we need it to look bright and colorful, or else she'll think we hate her. we also have some totes stacked up (as you can kind of see in the first image) to act as a barrier to keep her out of that area, and she hasn't noticed them yet.the barriers: blue: mom's room. orange: living room. yellow: stairs (sorry for the bad quality)"," hi there! i fully empathise with your situation as i live with my nan who has dementia too - however we are in the fortunate position that she likes to spend all day watching tv in her room. i'm assuming you're using basic carabiners to hold the pool noodles in place, and therefore your grandmother is dexterous enough to push the clips open. therefore i would recommend buying carabiners with a screw-lock - they're normally used by climbers because they are more secure; so you could get them online or in an outdoor activity supplier. the screw-lock twists over the carabiner's clip like a lid on a water bottle so that it can't be pushed open. i don't know if this will stop your grandmother entirely, as for all i know she might be quite dexterous and able to twist it off - but they do lock very tightly and so she should at least be slowed down or put off. also, because it would only be a small change, it wouldn't seem unfriendly or like you are trying to block her.i hope this helps and i wish you the best, i'll attach a picture of one for you :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cx5bqt/any_advice_on_making_boundaries/,1

"taking care of patients with parkinson is not an easy task. you have to be extra careful while attending them as patients often face issues with walking, eating and all other actions which requires muscle movement. here are some caregiving tips for taking care of your loved ones grooming:the stiffness of fingers and hands restrict patients to use their muscles effectively as before. switch traditional brush with an electronic brush. also, avoid touching the back of the patients‚Äô tongue as this may induce gagging. to address excessive drooling always keep a hand towel by your side. along with the traditional brush, switch razors with an electric shaver. aftershaves often cause rashes and redness, therefore, use lotion after a shave.bathing:avoid using bathtubs at any cost as it could lead to tripping hazards. make the patients sit on a safe shower stool and clean them using a hand-held showerhead. for patients suffering from dandruff, you can use a mild dandruff shampoo of a little quantity and ensure a proper rinse. for drying the patient, use a good quality absorbent towel. gently dry off the whole body of the patients, followed by wrapping them dry with the cloth. dressing:dressing accordingly can help a person with parkinson in a great way. always dress the patient in the most comfortable and simplest way. use dresses like elastic waistbands, front opening tops, tube socks while avoiding tights, pantyhose, etc. replacing buttoned outfits with velcro is also a smart choice.in reliable parkinson's care services in houston, tx, the caregivers advise to lay the clothes out before letting the patient go for a bath. it is advisable to let the patients dress as much as possible. ask them to sit down while trying on clothes. additional tips: refrain using shoes with rubber soles.eating:constipation is a common health issue associated with patients with parkinson disease. therefore, try to integrate fiber in their diet regularly. start by adding a slow amount of fiver and increase their fiber intake in a gradual manner. foods that come with fiber include grains, vegetables, fruits, whole bran cereals, etc. patients with parkinson also face trouble while swallowing food. avoid giving them too dry food, instead cook them food which is moist, soft and easier to swallow.as patients are more prone to falling hazards, the likelihood of getting fracture also increases if they lack strong bones. parkinson's care services in houston, tx suggests adding calcium-rich food in the diet plan of the patients. it‚Äôs necessary to serve them calcium-rich food at least three times a day. food rich in calcium includes cheese, yogurt, vitamin d-fortified milk, etc.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/c03zl1/some_caregiving_tips_from_parkinsons_care/,1
"hi all. i'm hoping your collective experience can help me with something.  my husband, children and i live with my mom, who has mild-to-moderate (as of a few months ago, although i think we're moving solidly into moderate) dementia, most likely alzheimer's. she has recently stopped driving, so we are doing all of the household errands now. she did not want to give up driving and really liked running errands by herself, but it just wasn't safe anymore. she really enjoyed going to the grocery store by herself and walking the aisles to do the shopping, and feels she is ""being deprived"" if we will not allow her to do the grocery shopping alone. problem is, she is unable to stick to a list and neither she nor we can afford the gross overstocking she wants to do. she does not believe that we do not need the things she is absolutely convinced we need, no matter what. we just don't have the time to let her do this and then return the extra groceries before she notices, and if they come in the house (there's cold stuff so we can't just leave it in the car or garage to return later, even if we did have time) she opens multiple containers of the same thing, and then we can't return or donate them. this has been an issue for a while. we just don't have the money or storage space or time to keep dealing with this grocery issue, and now that she's not driving we are just not going to take her to the store so she can continue wasting so much money on all this food that is just going to go bad. we can't. she can't afford it, we can't afford it. it's over. but she wants it so bad and we're depriving her. &#x200b;she also really wants brand name convenience foods she's become accustomed to, but that really she couldn't afford and now that we are buying all the household groceries, we can't afford to keep feeding her that way. i'd like to buy a couple of things each week that i know she likes so it's not such a harsh transition, and see if i can get her to try store brand where i can. her appetite is kind of hit or miss so i feel terrible not just buying what she likes, but i just can't. i wish i could but i can't afford it. &#x200b;so my questions: i apologize a lot. i redirect a lot. my sister takes mom for two days and one night every other week, and i have an application in with the area agency on aging for respite care but there's a wait list. i know she can't understand. i will not get her to understand. do you have any suggestions to further help my mom and i through this transitional time of losing the independence of driving, losing an activity she so enjoyed, and losing access to the luxury convenience foods she likes all at once? if you've read this far, thank you just for listening and thank you in advance for any advice."," what happens if you don‚Äôt take her? i know you don‚Äôt have poa, but if she doesn‚Äôt have a way to the store ...  of course, you‚Äôll probably hear about it nonstop for awhile. if you can last longer than her, it might be worth it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/byuex2/advice_needed_on_a_situation_with_my_mom/,1

"these are just a few step-saving ideas of mine.  if you have some to share i greatly would appreciate it.  ever idea might save us all another 100 steps during what is otherwise an over-filled day of work.save an empty water bottle.   when you open the new bottle pour 1/3 of  the water into the old bottle.  the 1/3 full bottle is easier to lift and to get to their mouths when they are laying in bed.  when that 1/3 is gone, refill the bottle with another 1/3.  cycle the bottles, making the next empty bottle into the 1/3 one.  no spills - no mess - and easy for someone with little strength.flavored, non-carbonated waters are easier to swallow than plain water.  so have a bottle of lemon water near the bed for those too-big-to-swallow pills.check with your nurse first!, but usually if  the pill has a defined line across the middle of it you can cut the pill in half safely.  its easier to get down two halves of one huge pill then have them choke on one enormous one ...pin or clip a plastic grocery bag to the bed rail, hand rail, or fitted sheet, right at the level of their extended arm.  you have an instant garbage bag they can reach and you can easily throw away.stock up on those little tubs of puddling, fruit, and jello.  they are great snacks, and can be stack right net to the bed for easy reach.  since some meds, like antibiotics, need something in the tummy you don't have to make another trip to the kitchen.paper and styrofoam plates, and plastic silverware can save you a dozen trips a day.  just throw them away in that clipped grocery bag and dispose of them at the end of the day.  we can all worry about the environmental impact of those things later, right now we are focusing on 'conservation of energy' for the caretaker ... and care receiver.if you don't have a hospital bed or hospital bed table you can pick up a sofa table at walmart that slides its legs under the bed, and rests the table top over the bed.  they are cheap - around $20-25 - and mean that you can place more things within their reach.thank you!", these are great suggestions. thank you,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/bkxuhc/simple_ideas_to_save_one_step/,1
"so, my grandfather has had alzheimer's for quite a few years, but it has only ever affected his short-term memory. over the last year we've suddenly been having gastro-intestinal issues with him, and it's becoming more frequent. the first was a stomach bleed, which is not really related to his dementia. however, we have had to be more conscious about what he can eat so that his stomach isn't aggravated. we very nearly lost him when that happened. in the last month or two, we've noticed he is not chewing his food anymore. he has always been very greedy with food, with a massive appetite, which i think is making this chewing problem much more serious. an example was when we went out for a meal, and he was literally lunging at the bowls on the table, and before the food had even made contact with the spoon, his mouth was open and ready to have food shovelled into it. he ate two whole bowls of prawn crackers before the starter and main course, and it was honestly a very uncomfortable situation for our family to sit through, and we were very confused about why he was being so greedy and excessive with this. he isn't normally that bad.he went into hospital with a blockage a few weeks ago, and my father has been trying to encourage my grandmother (who is mentally very healthy, but physically not very mobile due to arthritis) to only make him soft meals, which will not block him up. last week he threw up a lot of unchewed food again, and then again today he has been sick. at this point it seems pretty obvious that his food is becoming a problem, and my grandmother is not helping the issue. she certainly understands that he needs small pieces of food, soft food, and healthy food to maintain his overall health. i'm especially concerned about the choking risk of him not chewing, which she seems to miss. my grandmother is actually lying to her children (my dad, aunt, and uncle) about how she chops his food into ""miniscule"" pieces, but we know this is a lie because we have seen the unchopped vegetables etc. she is very lazy and will talk about how they are eating well in front of us, but we have seen ready-meal packets in the bin at her house. i can't understand how she has seen the negative effects of eating certain things for him, and still gives him these things and is lying to us about it. we don't know what to other than constantly telling her what she needs to do. i am in education and her children are all in full-time employment and cannot give him the care he needs day to day, she is the person who needs to and she will not listen."," try blending fruits like banana,  papaya,  kiwi with honey. can add yougurt too to make a smoothie. can refrigerate for consumption during course of day. consider packets of milk supplements too. all the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/bkkzot/my_grandfather_keeps_having_problems_with_food/,1

"if you have a bed bound family member you are caring for you'll need a few things. over the years i came up, through trial and error, with some products that just flat work better. also a few just practical tips. this will be for everyday items, not for beds, mattresses etc.you'll need gloves. my preference is the curad 3g vinyl. they come in various sizes in boxes of 100. some people have a personal preference for nitrile gloves. those are fine too. but with either you'll use a lot of them. guaranteed - you will pull one or three out of the box. never the two you need. üòÅdisposable washcloths. think really large wet wipes. invaluable for many uses. you can't do better than members mark (yes, sam's club!) premium washcloths. they're just better. they come in a box of 480, which is 5 packets of 48. that'll last you a while. the sam's club stores have them but they're not very good at all on keeping them in stock. i just use amazon.medline z-guard paste. now, this product is a little expensive because you use a lot. but by far the very best product for healing skin problems like chafing. also very good for preventing them. it comes in an orange tube. there's usually a 2 tube option, do that.underpads : there's 2 sizes. 23x36 and 30x36 inches. i use for different things.some people buy bibs for eating. they're washable but after a short period they get so stained they're just not useable anymore cuz they look so nasty no matter how much you was them. i use the smaller underpads as bibs. the armageddon for my wife was hot dogs. i'd cut them up but mustard would go everywhere! the pads help because you can cover the shoulders. but at any rate if you make a big mess you just toss them. i also found a lot of other uses for them. i use mckesson underpads lite uplt2336. they're very absorbant.and the big underpads. i will tell you, after i switched to the mckesson underpads ultra uphv3036 we never had another leak thru to the sheets. they are very absorbant.pro-tip. take two of these and lay them widthwise overlapping in the center of the bed. then take a third one and lay on top of those lengthwise. it seems you're using 3 but you'll rarely have to replace more than 1. maybe 2.diapers, or as they're known in polite society, briefs. definition time - in the industry what we think of as diapers are called briefs. what we would think of as pull-ups are called underwear. it doesn't have to make sense...the prevail per-fit 360 are far more absorbant than any other i ever found. easy to use too. buy a bigger size than you think you'll need.", your love and devotion shine through this post. i hope many folks get the benefit of your hard-won tips. my best to you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bakp21/some_practical_tips_for_dealing_with_the_bed/,1

"since my aunt‚Äôs passing (from alzheimer‚Äôs) in december, it‚Äôs been a downward slide for my mom, who was diagnosed last april, but probably could‚Äôve been diagnosed in 2016. i‚Äôd wager she‚Äôs in stage 5, and the gears are starting to slip all over the place. the latest: dinner time. i‚Äôve cooked for my mom for years now, and rarely had a complaint. this has mostly been via home delivery boxes, as since i‚Äôve signed up for so many, there‚Äôs almost always someone willing to offer me a half off discount, making it easily worth it.for the past two months now, i‚Äôve noticed my mother has tossed half the food i‚Äôve fed her, either hiding it in the trash or putting it back in the pan. instead, she‚Äôll eat pbj or frozen meals... back up food i keep in the house for when i‚Äôm feeling lazy. basically, all she‚Äôs eating are things that are carby and sweet. it‚Äôs also worth mentioning i had to stop buying snack cakes (her favorite) because she started going through a whole package in 48 hours. tonight, i heard her openly ranting about how i only care about what i want to eat and never gets her anything. i must admit, having no sweets in the house has been great for my waistline, and i have a feeling all that sugar riles her up (i‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a coincidence that the first time i put sweets in the house for the past two weeks (valentine‚Äôs day chocolate, of course) is the first time in half a month she‚Äôs has a tantrum, though it does seem to happen about every two weeks).any advice on how to deal with people who only want sugar and carbs? i can keep the house stocked with pbj and frozen meals, but i can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôd be good for her in the long term (for what it‚Äôs worth, she does have access to ensure and i give her a multivitamin with her medication). i don‚Äôt even think she‚Äôd know what she‚Äôd want if i asked her what she‚Äôd like for dinner, and the meals we had growing up were red meat heavy (something i‚Äôm trying to cut down on a little) and, frankly, not very appealing to me now."," my boyfriends mother is the same way. she lives with us and her palate drives me nuts! we could get her a hot fudge sundae multiple times a day and it won't be enough, not to mention the behavior that comes with it. i find that if i get things that mimic sweets, she'll eat them. we buy chocolate hummus and take the label off, she thinks it's frosting and will eat it with strawberries and pretzels. she also will eat honey roasted peanuts and cocoa roasted almonds. i'm asian and dinner can be stressful as she doesn't like my 'weird' food, so i normally cook two meals, one that i want, and something i know she'll eat, like marinated chicken breast with sweet potatoes. she will eat her weight in roasted sweet potatoes and carrots. instead of stocking juice, which she'll guzzle a whole bottle, i buy powdered drink mix and use it as more of a treat, along with thinning it out with a little seltzer water.i also find that a little ""you can't have that"" helps sometimes, if i act like something healthy is just for me and i'm not sharing, she'll make a point of grabbing it and eating it out of spite.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/aqrxtn/new_this_year_feeding_difficulty/,1
"a little backstory: i collect video games and have amassed moderately sized collection through years of yardsaling and flipping. while my mother used to understand how i amassed this collection, she now assumes that i'm stealing her money to buy games.today i went to the store to pick up a couple things i needed. for the last week, i've been setting up a digital camera because i've noticed some of my games have been pulled out of the shelf, and it's unlikely my cats could accomplish this feat. when i arrived home, i checked the recording, and noticed she'd come through with a trash bag, looked at my trash can, and walked away.prior to leaving for the store, i couldn't find my hat, a favorite i'd had for nearly a decade. when i came back, i gave the house a good search, even asked her if she'd seen it. she said no; i didn't expect her to say yes. as a last resort, i go out and check the trash bin, thinking maybe it ended up in there. imagine my surprise when i found a half dozen of my games in the trash she'd just thrown out, valued at maybe $100-150 total. i pulled them all out, brought them inside, and against my better judgement asked why she threw them out. it'd been the first time i bothered asking her why she'd done something frustrating in months.she said she didn't how they got out there, and she hadn't even emptied the trash, even though the current bag was clearly new and someone had to have done it. my breaking point achieved, i left immediately to follow through on the plan i'd had considered for months but hadn't executed, thinking it wasn't too bad yet: replacing the doorknob to my living area with a locked version.when i came home, bag in hand, she said i had an addiction (assumedly because she thought i had a video game in hand). i walked away, and she's been ranting out loud, jumping up and down, and yelling random nonsense for the last 20 minutes.my brother have been discussing assisted living for the past month, and i've told him i'm not sure she's bad off enough to go in, but i think we're getting there in a hurry.", my advice would be to look into memory care facilities. or a nh with a memory care wing. my mil is in assisted living and has to get to the dining room at certain times daily for meals. she also has to go wash her own clothes. they do clean once a week but that's it.just something to consider. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/alicr7/she_threw_my_stuff_out/,1

(saw later in your blog you are doing that - good! use whatever works!)2. cbd oil worked wonders for my mom when she was having a lot of anxiety... god knows about what exactly... a lot of times she would have hallucinations and cry or scream at nothing (making no verbal sense though, as she had aphasia really bad), so we started with inhaled vapor pens with cbd oil only... no thc in there to make her ""high"" but the cbd did work most of the time in keeping her anxiety at bay. we also used lavender essential oils at night diffusing next to the bed and that helped literally every night and she wasn't waking up in the middle of the night screaming and having night terrors. 3. ""mirror lady""... my mom had issues with this as well. we put up a curtain in the bathrooms over the mirrors and took down any in common rooms so she would stop seeing this random unknown person in the mirror. of course, she didn't know it was her, she just thought another lady was in the house with her and would do the same thing.... (when she could talk somewhat) ""there's another woman in here. who is that? why are they here? are you cheating on me?

"i recently purchased a newer home and immediately after, i moved my elderly aunt and terminally ill (stage 4 colon cancer) uncle in with me. i wanted to help them as they are elderly.  my generous wealthy sister assisted me in both physically moving them, paying for the rental truck and additionally buying them a new queen size bed. we worked very hard for thee days getting the basics into the house and making them comfortable. the very first day my aunt consistently complained that i had thrown all her things away ( i have not thrown anything away - it's in the extra stall in the garage) and complained about everything. my sister pointed out to her how lucky she is to have someone willing to help them, she probably could have been nicer about it, (not to justify it but we were both tired and frustrated and their lack of appreciation). now my aunt refers to my sister as the bad one! i've been at their beck and call when i'm not working, fetching what they want from the grocery or dept store. last night i went into their bathroom to get the garbage and the floor was pissed under. i cleaned the bathroom and offered to change their bed, she freaked out on me. i'm trying so hard to help them and have given up any life of my own and they don't appreciate it or care. my house absolutely stinks, i know he's sick but damn, he can't even piss in the toilet? i'm frustrated and don't want to be a doormat. please do you have advise in dealing with ungrateful family?", do you have a comode on the toilet? sometimes with men their penis won't go into the toilet and it will get on the floor. you can get a comode with an insert that might help with the problem. it looks like this  it makes it so the urine is contained and goes into the toiletask him to sit instead of stand while urinating and to make sure his penis is down. if he is confused he might not have realized what happened. it might be that you need to help in the bathroom. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/a80f00/super_frustrated_feel_like_a_bad_person/,1
"my dad, who is 76, recently started having trouble swallowing pills.  i give him his morning medications, and he immediately begins chewing them up.  i tell him to stop, and he says im not chewing! and then continues to chew right in front of me, to which i tell him ""pop, i can see you chewing the pills right now.  you cannot chew up aspirin its bad for you"" . he rolls his eyes, drinks water, holds the pills in his cheek and claims he drank them down.  15 seconds later he is sucking on, and chewing the pills again, like its candy and he is savoring the flavor.  he does this with his multivitamins as well, which is particularly disgusting as it coats his teeth and tongue orange and gives him pretty bad breath.  my question is why?  and has anyone solved this?  it just started about 4 days ago, and in addition to this he has begun randomly peeing in his bed and he wont even get out of bed after he pees. he just lays there and then claims he didn't know it was wet.  but then later will admit he knows he peed the bed, and he doesn't why know.  that coupled with a very rough cough, and difficulty getting around - could be have pneumonia?  i had him checked for a uti which came back clean.  does anyone else have any idea what this could be?"," i can‚Äôt help with the swallowing issue but definitely have the doctor check for a uti, as strange peeing habits are often the result of one (and they‚Äôre so so common in people with dementia). hope you have some luck sorting this out!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/a5ldb7/cannot_swallow_pills_and_coughing/,1

"i''m wondering if people out there in redditland can provide some experience and advice on the transition of loved ones from private home to nursing / care home.my mother-in-law has been suffering from a form of dementia (tests are on going) for quite a few years.  she had been living alone since her husband died some 5 years ago and the disease has ever so slowly eating away at her independence and faculties.  a year ago my wife & i moved her from her home in ireland into a small house a few streets away from us (in england) so that we could be on-hand to provide company, assistance and care.  over the last 12 months those three things have changed in order of significance.  we have nurses & companions visiting two times a day to administer meds, food & company and we visit in the evenings after work to walk the dog, stock the fridge, talk and provide evening meal.  at the weekends we can devote much more time and do shopping trips and family meals.it is strange and stressful as someone becomes mentally younger as they get older.  the loss of language and understanding of fundamentals of life such as time and functions of things like cookers, tv remotes, telephones, showers, dog bowls..   yesterday i did a small shop to re-stock the fridge and set about fixing a non responsive tv (usually a two second job!). i said ""how about a cup of tea?"" and asked if the dog had been fed...  simple questions but what a disaster!last week she could have easily fed the dog but not now. she: (coming into the living room holding some gubbins from the bin) ""is this the thing?"" me: ""no, that's not it"" (it is old pasta parcels taken out of the bin where i put it a few days ago). ""let me show you where the dog food is.  that needs to go in the bin - it is not good for the dog""  she: ""oh"".  the pasta shapes fall out of the packaging and all over the floor.  the dog leaps onto them and starts eating them faster than i can pick them up.  they are mouldy and nasty!   i salvage what i can and drop them into the bin again.she: ""there's no...  i don't...  where's food?""me: ""here's the dog bowl and his food"" (pointing to dog bowl & food container on kitchen floor next to dog bed.)she: ""oh, but it is empty""me: ""no, it is filled with food"" (i open the lid & show the food)she: ""oh""i know she can do this - i've seen it many times.  i go back to the living room to work on the tv and return to the kitchen after a short while to see the food in the bowl and the dog eating it.   phew.   i get back to the tv.  now, normally the tv is not functioning because of socket being turned off or some such simplicity but not this time.  we have sound and channel change but no visuals.  i get stuck into this and after checking cables, batteries, sockets, input device and running through a few re-boots i determine that the backlight has gone and the tv is done-for.  dang.  the tv is vital companion for the periods where there is no carer.i go into the kitchen to explain that the tv is broken and that i'll have to pop out and get a new one but i arrive to see a disaster zone in the kitchen.  she has taken out one of the ready meals i had bought (a rather large fish pie) and hand-scooped and squished the contents into the dog bowl.  there is food all over the place!  it's all over the worktops, on her hands and up to her elbows, on her face...  she is busy trying to wipe everything clean with a kitchen cloth but basically speeding fish pie everywhere.   i gasp and let out an involuntary cry of dismay.she: (angrily): ""what's wrong?""me: (deadpan) ""ah, oh, er.. no.  erm, ok.""she: (very angrily) ""i'm giving him his dinner.  there is no dog food!""me: (in dismay).  ""but there is! here it is (shows dog food)""she: ""no, that is empty so i've fed him this and now i'm cleaning""me: ""right, ok""meanwhile the dog is getting stuck into a massive pile of fish pie.  she continues to wipe and wash things.  i check the fridge and see that in fact the fish pie is not the only foodstuff that has been opened.  there is prawn curry too.  so the dog has had crusty pasta, dog food, fish pie and some prawn curry in the space of an hour.  this is going to have an impact...so, things have rapidly changed over the last few months, weeks and days.  her behaviour has become increasingly irrational and we have definitely reached the point where a home with other residents and 24 hour nursing has to happen.  the only alternative is for one of us to give up work to become full-time carers or get a live-in carer but what she really needs is company and a safe environment - not being closeted up in her own home.  not that she will see it that way.  i foresee tantrums and difficulty.as if by magic our preferred nursing home (nicest, friendliest & they take pets!) advised a few days ago that our time on the waiting list is over and we can have a room next week.  we have said ""yes"" and will be moving her on on monday.  we know this will be a huge stressful event and are mulling over how we should announce it and perform it...  any experiences good / bad and advice would be gratefully received.    apologies for the diatribe - i couldn't stop it!&#x200b;summary: dementia getting worse.  what are the do's and don'ts of transferring to a specialist care home?","you're doing the right thing.  don't tell her ahead of time.  dementia patients don't remember the details (or generalities) of discussions, but they do remember emotions.  don't get her upset for no benefit. thanks.   we've decided not to tell her until the day of the move and are going to start preparing over the weekend to make the room as familiar as possible. maybe a favorite chair, lots of pictures on the wall, we have residents that have a wipe board or a calendar and write down when family saw them and when they will be back next so the hcw can show them if they ask where everyone is. favorite dry foods can be kept for them, a lot of my residents have ginger ale in the fridge and cookies. paid companions are great they will take your loved one out to get their hair or nails done or out for lunch because the hcw on a unit well be looking after 6 to 9 other people and won't have a lot of time to socialize with the resident.  thanks for the reply.  unfortunately her favourite chair is in fact a rather large (and lovely) sofa which will be too small for the room.  we do have a familiar chair and cabinet and plenty of pictures and bits and bobs to bring...   a family album of pictures is a good idea - we'll put something together an try that as a distraction.  she always hated photos (of herself) but i think she might not remember that any more.  we have got a whiteboard for the carers and us to write on - we were hoping that she could read it to understand what is happening each day but sadly her concept of time is shot and reading comprehension is low.  still, its a good call to bring that too. something else we did was to take dad over for lunch a couple of times so going there wasn't strange or unfamiliar.  i'm sorry you are going through this.  all of us here know how soul-killing this process can be.  take care of yourselves and carve out time to have fun.  it's important.  wonderful that you got a space to take her. there is no easy way to do it. think of all the things you did when you sent your kid to school for the first time. one constructive thing you can do is to try to make the new place smell a bit like the old place. bring in whatever perfumes cleaning products, room sent etc that she used it home. i wonder if they have a room scent called stinky fish dog.? don't try to think of everything at once , you can always bring different things over later. when i moved my uncle, and he would start complaining about it, i just kept telling him this was the what the doctors said to do. i am sure the staff will have lots of tricks to help you also stinky fish dog!  yes, scent is a really good idea.  we'll add perfume to the list of things to bring when setting up the room so that it can have a familiar odour.   i was comparing to to first day at school too... i think there are a lot of similarities as she becomes mentally younger. we told my dad that we had to do repairs on his home and he had to move out until they were completed.  we furnished his room as much as at home as possible. he always asked about going home and would become extremely agitated if we told him it was impossible, so we learned to let him believe that going home someday was a possibility even though it wasn't.  as you've seen, reasoning with them is impossible, they live in an alternate reality. thanks.  we wondered about this too.  the roof needs repairing or some such...  we will probably use this as an approach until she becomes calm or forgets.   the trick, i think, is for us to make the room as familiar as possible.  transition day is all about a house move but concentrated. i'll share this story again as maybe it'll help you. the day we took mil to the long term memory care unit, she would not go. my husband and bil called me to come over and help as she was being stubborn and argumentative and even violent in her resistance. when i got there she was covered in her own excrement, wearing her underwear, and yelling/screaming/punching back at her boys. i redirected her via distraction. i got her dressed and into the car and by then she'd completely forgotten where we were going, or so it seemed. as we drove she suddenly got it in her head we were taking her out for lunch. (we did not tell her we were taking her to lunch). she got all excited about it and chattered away for the 30 minute drive. we got to the home and she still thought we were going there for lunch and she was still upbeat. hubby went in ahead to let them know we were there (weren't sure we were at the right building) leaving me with mil in the car for a few minutes. it was at that time that mil got completely lucid, and told me that she knew this was the memory care unit. and she told me, ""please, i am going to object, fight, yell scream.... but don't let the boys falter. i know i need to be here. it's become really scary to be at home alone. my memory is just not that good anymore."" she made me promise over and over again. then hubby came back, and we got her out of the car, and by the time we entered the unit, she wasn't lucid and yes she fought, yelled, screamed. but i kept my word. the brothers didn't believe me but it really did happen. she wound up in that home for about 5 years, we visited her frequently, until she passed from cancer. before the cancer she was safe, sound, healthy and well cared for, beyond what we could provide. i should also add she had a dog she loved. that winter before admittance, her memory was so bad, she let the dog out to pee in a snowstorm. the dog was found days later frozen to death. that was one of the turning points when we realized it was time. in later years she didn't remember her beloved dog at all, even though we shared pictures.  wow.  thanks for the great reply.   we experience the same lucid and non-lucid moments...   i think for us we are hoping that she won't be that lucid so that there will be less fighting against the move. set up her new room prior to bring her.  we had one adult take mom to visit at their home while we worked on moving stuff out of mom's house and into her new place.  we got the place all set up nicely with her own bed, lazy boy chair, small table & chairs.  and pictures hung on the wall.  the home may have a list to help you remember all the things you should bring (ie. sheets, toothbrush, etc).  having the room set up ahead of time allows her to come into a peaceful environment rather than being in the middle of a chaotic move. thanks.  this is the approach we will take. !  we are off to the home shortly to assess the room and then start preparing the list of things and how to do it.  you're right - we should ask the home for a list and their best practice for this kind of thing.   i'm going through this right now, too. it's so difficult. he has been living in an independent housing where they provide one meal a day. he has somewhat of a companion, but recently she's been declining and so has he. so, my family and i think it's time to move him into a place with much more care than he has now. even though it's going to be hard. it's taken a toll on me big time.  update:  we moved mother into the care home yesterday.  it was not easy.  she was furious. livid. i prepared the room ahead of arrival and we managed to cajole her into the car and then out of the car and into the entrance and then she refused to budge.   she did a sit-in on the porch but after coaching and coaxing and ultimately ignoring her she walked in by herself.we knew that if we had given her forewarning it would have made the move much, much more difficult.  we have a difficult week out two ahead but fingers crossed she will calm down and ultimately see that the community she is part of will be much healthier, safer and happier than being alone with this dreadful wasting disease (that she refuses to accept is happening).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9zpedk/advice_on_moving_from_home_to_care_home/,1

"i've been caretaking for my father who has fairly advanced parkinson's disease (pd) for a while now. he prefers to keep some autonomy, which can be helpful and take some of the burden off of myself and my family, but has it's own difficulties. as of the last year i've been more closely observing his water and nutritional intake and began to grow concerned about a few things, chiefly not drinking much water and having a very low protein intake.first step, i got a general idea of a minimum daily water intake, found an appropriate container and kept it simple: make sure you drink this entire container (~60 fl.oz.) of water a day to be in a fairly safe place. the next step, we started recording what foods he was eating so that we could enter them into a food tracker so that we could see information such as calories, macronutrients, etc. and have an idea of what needed to be adjusted. it was also a good excuse to get him to challenge himself physically and mentally by learning to input this information on a computer.well, we started. and then it all fell apart. all of a sudden he stops drinking enough water, and more-over, stops using the water jug set out specifically for him. his reason was, ""oh, i thought we were done tracking my water,"" even though nothing of the sort was ever even brought up. it was always intended as a permanent solution to ensure his hydration, but he just out of nowhere comes up with that.now he's drinking very little water, with the worst day recently being something around 16oz of fluid, which i find concerning. when i talk to him about this, there's always some reason or excuse. stuff like: ""well, when we first started tracking my water i was doing really well""""well, yesterday i drank enough water."" (usually not actually the case)""i thought i was doing well.""""i drank a lot of water today,"" (he hadn't, and if i show him the jug of water he finds another convenient excuse)""i didn't know we were still doing that.""""i didn't feel i had to.""""i'm working on it."" (x hours later he hasn't drank more than a sip of any liquid)when confronted with the facts, he just finds another excuse. if i show him how much water is left in the container, he ignores it and changes the subject. if cornered, he simply becomes upset and tries to disengage from the conversation.tracking food and nutrition is almost the same exact thing. he doesn't always meet caloric goals, and he's generally very low on protein. because of his condition with pd, musculature is a big deal since he doesn't have very much to begin with - he is a very small man and very low on weight with very little muscle to boot. he can't really afford to lose weight or muscle mass, but over the last year he's dropped a few pounds, and with his eating trends, it's concerning.reason doesn't seem to work. there's always an excuse. i want to be able to give him some sort of autonomy, but it's beginning to seem like that's simply not realistic. i'm not really sure how to handle this. i can't just force-feed him, and it feels wrong to tell him he has to sit at the dinner table and drink all of his water and eat all of his veggies before he can leave the table. i can't get him to eat or drink the way he should and there doesn't seem to be a way to make sure he's going to. so some support and advice on how some of you have tackled similar situations would be really helpful and appreciated. thanks.","i am a caregiver for my grandmother who does not like to drink water. sometimes if you put flavor in the water they will be more likely to drink more. for protein, you could try an protein shake or ensure or boost as a meal replacement if you are really concerned. make sure you check with his doctor before you decide to use a meal replacement.  good luck. my dad won't drink water without mio drops anymore and he has a chocolate  protein shake every afternoon. i used to worry about everything too then finally realized that it doesn't make a difference. my mother loves mio lemonade drops, she only drinks water with it. i also feel the same, what's the use in worrying? if something happens, it happens. we cannot control every tiny aspect of their lives, and they still make decisions. don't overlook cognitive issues.  it takes work and effort keeping track of fluid and what you are eating.  i have a hard enough time tracking my medications, thankfully now every four hours for sinement due to dbs, but other meds are every six hours (i can eat those with foods), but tracking water is a challenge.  bottled water is expensive, so i like your idea of the jug of water but still hard to keep track to remember to fill that.  my wife often will ask what i had for lunch. somedays i just get sidetracked and forget to eat.in a way having a scale that automatically measures the weight of the jug would help in tracking and reminding him to have a glass of water.   our parkinson's workout coach always reminds us ""1 oz for every two pounds of body weight"".  i'm at 240# at 6'3"" but 120z of water just seems too much. yet i can drink four 22 oz bottle of water without much thought.oh, parkinson's also plays havoc on our bladder.  both loss of control, and not being able to empty it.  i've learned it is easy to empty more of my bladder sitting down than standing, but that takes time!  other times my bladder lets loose without warning, yes there are pads for that, but my not drinking water before running errands or long drives, less of an issue.   i realize not good.   thanks for stopping in, parkiedude! i see you around a lot and know your username well enough, so it's always nice to hear what you have to say, so i appreciate you taking the time. cognitive issues are certainly a (major) part of the problem here, and memory as well. he's been through dbs surgeries and recovering from the final one for the second side. prior to dbs surgery he needed a neuropsych evaluation and was diagnosed with mild cognitive dysfunction. so it definitely is a factor and we are aware of it, but it is difficult. but the worst is that he becomes very stubborn and refuses to accept some things, even if they are right in front of him. this may also be a result of the cognitive issues, but the tendency towards stubbornness makes all of our lives more difficult and is something we are slowly trying to work on. though it's hard to know exactly how to work on it, sometimes.we've taken steps in order to combat that, such as leaving simple instructions, notes, to-do lists, etc. the water jug is ~2 quart (~64 fl.oz.) pitcher which we use and keep on the kitchen counter so that it's always in view when he's around the house and eating, and he can see how he's managing his water. we just fill it every night and record how much is left - no worry about keeping it filled, if he needs more beyond 64 fl.oz. then he can drink from the brita or bottled water, or whatever he chooses. it's mostly just to get him over that minimum goal and keep him aware of it.there's also a chart on the fridge to show how much water (from the juge/pitcher) he's drank (drunk?) during the week, and in larger letters at the top it reads, ""/u/half-wizard's father's water progress: at least 2 quarts/day"" where we record how much water he's had over the week. we also have ""drink more water"" on his daily routine / to-do list, and we often remind him.but for example, as of 1pm my time today, he'd drunk less than 10fl.oz. of liquid, so i told him that he should work on drinking more water, to which he replied, ""i've been drinking lots of water."" i then turned to the counter beside me and pointed at the almost-full jug of water, to which he then replied similarly, ""well, i've had a lot of water."" well, no, he hadn't, and it was plain to see, but he wouldn't accept it and kind of brushed off my request to drink more.and i think that's the heart of the problem, and the bulk of the trouble. we're trying to deal with it, but it can be difficult. hence why i turned here. i certainly appreciate your insight.> my wife often will ask what i had for lunch. somedays i just get sidetracked and forget to eat.to be fair, i do that often enough, myself! lol :-x so i can hold that one against him. generally, for him though, it's rarely that he forgets to eat, but more often that he focuses on eating lots of carbs. we've taken steps to address that as well (reminders, ease of access of pre-made foods that aren't carbs, etc.), but the ""stubbornness"" / cognitive issues does trip us up.>  i've learned it is easy to empty more of my bladder sitting down than standing, but that takes time!definitely. i read that somewhere, maybe from another post you'd made, or someone else or somewhere else. but we've been encouraging him to sit more, which can be helpful, but he doesn't always remember.in general, though, the days he drinks more water are the days he tends to have the least amount of trouble urinating. i take care of my grandparents, both have many dietary restrictions and my grandmother, who also has parkinsons, is insanely picky. when i've spoken to their doctors about similar issues they've told me, generally speaking, that as long as they know the consequences of disregarding the restrictions -and in my grandmothers case usually refusing to eat anything healthy- then leave them to it. you can also try gatorade or similar if he is not responding to water. ensure and other nutritional drinks could be an option as well. my grandfather is on a strict water intake but he gets incredibly bored with plain water. adding in some fruit juice/tea/gatorade or other flavoring helps it become palatable. could it also be he just doesn't think about taking a drink? he may not feel thirsty so he just doesn't think of it? maybe set a timer to remind him to take a drink a few times an hour or if someone is home with him bring him a smaller cup (8 oz or less) of water a couple times an hour and have him take a drink then. possibly bring him a few grapes or a small piece watermelon or other fruit at the same time and try to encourage him to take a bite or two. you'll get a little more nutrition and fluid into him and may also help encourage thirst. you are right that you can't force feed him but if you feel that he isn't mentally sound to make these decisions for himself speak with his physicians directly, they may suggest a feeding tube if he is fairly (of his own accord) malnourished. to that end, pointing out to my grandmother that a feeding tube might be necessary if she won't eat something healthy each day does help. it's not mean or a threat it's just a reminder of the reality of the situation. we've only had to remind her a few times but if there are memory issues you are dealing with it may have to be a frequent conversation. aside from all of that, take a breath. you are doing all that you can do. it's extremely difficult taking care of an adult who has their own ideas about what is right/enough and add in any memory issues or extreme stubbornness and it can all feel impossible. remind yourself- as much as you remind him to drink water and eat right- that you are doing the best you can and that is all you can do. <3  i use tricks to get them to drink more.  jello with emergenc in it is good. apple sauce, variety of drinks, no one  drink plain water. same with foods, my goal is to make food they eat healthier rather than feed them healthy food. small servings that look good help. i have been taking a client to the senior center for low impact aerobics, bingo and lunch. the socialization is helping.  emergenc isn't necessary as we already have him on a routine of taking multi-vitamins and his vitaminc and other vitamins/minerals are at a safe level. it's mainly the macro-nutrients and water that are a big deal right now.but the jello - that might be a great idea. i'm not sure if he'll actually do it, but it might be a good way to water down some jello and get him to have some. i'll see if he'll go for it. he does like using applesauce for a lot of things, but that isn't a primary source of hydration.>  ...no one drink plain water.as someone who is currently drinking plain, iced water as i'm typing this......i lol'd.> same with foods, my goal is to make food they eat healthier rather than feed them healthy food. i've been trying to focus on this. my father and his wife aren't particularly good cooks and tend on the very simple, very bland, very... boring.... side of food. so i've been trying to liven it up a bit for him to try to get him to eat tastier foods which are healthy.>  i have been taking a client to the senior center for low impact aerobics, bingo and lunch. the socialization is helping.keeping him active is a toughie. hes reluctant to do a lot, and doesn't like being around people. his stubbornness, unfortunately, goes as far as to being active and doing things and has hindered progress in that domain as well. we've just finished a round of surgeries and he's recovering, so hopefully after he's fully recovered we can get him out doing more. but i'll give a little more emphasis on trying to get him doing a little more in the social aspects as well.thanks for your time and response :) although to you the facts and reasoning are extremely valid talking to an elder oftentimes is like talking with a child, in my family the nurse that takes care of my father plays with him to make him drink water ""did you notice who finished that cup? i thought it was for me?! "" maybe finding a ""fun"" way to get him to eat/drink could help you! my grandmother lost a ton of weight when she was in a nursing home and was actually diagnosed with anorexia. after i had her transferred to assisted living, i started buying her protein enhanced water and a special high calorie ice cream. the protein water is flavored, so she enjoys drinking it and she loves ice cream so she didn‚Äôt even notice that it was actually a nutritional supplement. she also takes a daily multivitamin to help meet her nutritional goals. she was able to gain 30 pounds in a year with these minor changes. similarly, when my dad was going through chemotherapy, he often refused to eat or drink anything but strawberry milkshakes. nutrition is important, but when someone is dangerously thin, getting them to eat or drink anything is better than nothing.  thanks for your advice!we do make sure he is getting multivitamins to cover those bases, but protein is a bigger problem for him. i'll discuss protein powder / drinks with him, but that really seems like something he will stoutly refuse. it might just have to be a, ""here, drink this"". but we'll give it a shot. thanks. ""food fights"" were among the most heated and frustrating when i provided caregiving for my father.  the first few years we were caring for him we were actively trying to keep him healthy and avoid suffering.  the stubborn insistence on dietary and fluid control made sense to me, his caregiver.  what was i doing if i just facilitated or tolerated insufficient or indulgent food & drink choices?  caregiving is always an emotional roller coaster where regular rules don't apply.  a patient may be dealing with something they don't want to share with you...urinating may be getting increasingly difficult...so they choose not to hydrate.  they may find it humiliating and exhausting they are being micromanaged by their child.  this is a critical juncture where their remaining autonomy is important.  yes, their choices may backfire on them and even cause you more work and suffering.  perfection is the enemy of the good.  don't aim too high.  find accommodations where you can.   bless you for caring so much, and for wading through the turbulent waters of caregiving for one's own parent.  role reversal is one of the trickiest components of it.  i often used this thought to calm myself.  ""would i be mad at a toddler for not eating their veggies and drinking their milk?""  no, just concerned.  i would also work to find creative ways to get the desired result. thanks for your support, it means a lot.i definitely understand what you mean with the ""food fights"" and this all really hits home. i try to be very mindful of it, and as much as i don't like to think of it in that way, i do kind of see it as a role reversal, and i think it's somewhat inevitable. but i try pretty hard to allow him autonomy, but it is difficult, if not impossible, to do so all the time. some days he simply can't, and some things he just can't manage on his own. no doubt this stresses him out, but i try to encourage him to work together on this, as a team, because if we just butt heads and disagree all the time it will only make it harder.> perfection is the enemy of the good. don't aim too high. find accommodations where you can. thank you. i try to be mindful of that and i'll try to keep that in mind as i go forward.>  i would also work to find creative ways to get the desired result.i totally agree. unfortunately, that's one of my shortcomings. i tend to be someone who can, at times, be whimsical, imaginative and creative - but it has to just simply come to me. in a way, i'm a showerthought king - if i do not find my muse, i sit in the quiet dark, and no amount of trying is ever actually being creative. part of the reason why i'm here looking for help.thanks again for your response. sometimes people with cognitive difficulties can't explain why they don't like something, so come up with ""other ways"" to say it.has his voice changed any?  more slurred, or softer or lower or raspy or mumbled?  he might be losing control of his throat muscles.  that affects speech but also how we swallow.  could be he is slightly choking when he swallows water, so he tries to avoid it.  if you see any of those signs, take him to a speech therapist who can retrain those muscles to work together.is your dad still able to use the toilet on his own?  some people avoid drinking water if they're afraid they won't make it to the toilet in time.he might just not be able to remember to drink water or eat the right foods.  but rather than admitting it, he says stuff like ""i thought we were done with that.""another possibility is that parkinson's plays with the autonomic systems, so he might not be feeling thirsty or hungry, even if he is.talk to his doctor.  maybe he needs a caregiver to come in and be with him while you're at work, to make sure he's getting nutrients.another thought--if he's topped up on meds before he eats, then he might eat more because he feels like it's easier to move.does he like soup?  that's an easy way to get veggies and water in at the same time.  ensure tastes good and is water and protein together--another benefit is that it's very easy to drink so it doesn't take much energy.are you aware of the interactions between protein and l-dopa medications?",https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/973vj9/need_advise_on_how_to_handle_making_sure_someone/,1

(eg. she used to listen to classical music for hours but now does barely recognize any music and has even less an interest in listening to them. my dad is always the optimist and insists that her condition is better than it is. he will for instance insist that she still always knows where she is or that she still recognizes me, when in fact she stopped recognizing me (as well as him) years ago. but he also a lot more active than my mother and tries to keep up his lifestyle where he regularly travels between two homes and tends to two large gardens. he has hired a part-time carer to support him, but this is mostly to enable him to continue this lifestyle. eg. he takes the carer along to the second home as my mum is nearly unable to travel in a car as opposed to have the carer look after my mum in order to be able to spend a day or so away. the results are that i believe my mother is lacking some of the basic needs of care. i'm hoping to carefully address some of this on my next trip to see them. but as i only see her every two months or so, i'm not really clear what these basic needs are. i have worked on a list which i have added below.i'd be grateful for any feedback on this list, especially omissions and items that i should not concern myself with. i've tried to also list this in my priority order. medication: my mother needs medication 4 times a day. he is managing this and checking that she takes it. he prioritizes the prescribed medication over supplements that she has always taken. my concern is that some of these supplements (esp. st. john's wort) is known to reduce the effects of other medication and i keep asking him why he still wants to give it. my mother also rarely complains about pain at the moment but is habitually prescribed a painkiller (not a very strong one) and i want to address this with the prescribing doctor. liquid: my dad regularly checks that my mother is drinking, but he does not record the amounts. as my mother typically uses a straw, a lot of the water is left/discarded when it is refilled. i'm concerned she may not be drinking enough, though she had 16 refills, they were often far more than half full when discarding the previous drink. i'm trying to get him to record it so he can discuss with a doctor if she needs to be put on a drip. food: it has become very hard to feed my mother. i weighed her intake the last time i was visiting and she had about 80g of bread with ham in the morning as well as 100g of a stew. my parents only eat twice a day now (more about this is the schedule section). i'm trying to convince him to get a microwave as it clearly is too much for him to cook, alongside a delivery service. he tells me he often makes a soup that they have as the main meal for several days in a row. other family members have told me that a meal can be just a piece of cake.schedule: my dad is usually getting up at around 9 am and prepares the breakfast - which always involves getting fresh breadrolls from the bakery and setting a table with a variety of things, most of which remain untouched. he then gets dressed and then helps my mother to get up. on the days i did not get involved, we never had breakfast before 10:30 am and usually not before 11:30. the dinner between 4pm and 7pm and my mother usually goes to bed at 8pm then gets up at 10am, giving here a total of 14 hours in bed. my dad's schedule: my dad often is most productive after my mother is in bed and regularly does not sleep until 3 am. i've asked him to change this and try to get some sleep a little earlier. hygiene: my parents have always hated to shower, but used to go swimming. usually in the non-swimming season they would shower once every two weeks and otherwise wash themselves with a small facetowel. i've felt that this is completely inadequate and have urged him to get his shower changed to a wetroom so she can sit and shower regularly but i'm not sure if this is common. hygiene/clothing: my parents also always had issues with changing clothes regularly. my dad now gives her fresh underwear daily (i used to get scolded as a child for not weearing it 2-3 days), but her other clothes tend to be reused for often 1 week or more. i'm not sure what is common, but the clothes do stink and i felt incredibly uncomfortable around them. i want to prevent this getting to a level where a separation has to be forced, but i'm really looking out for advice how to best change this as well as what changes are the most urgent."," please don't take this the wrong way - but you sound so controlling. you cannot control what your parents are doing from *three hours away* by only coming to visit twice (if that?) a month. it sounds like your father is doing his best. it's a very hard situation to be in.i'm saying this from a similar situation. i have two older brothers. the both moved out, making me primary caregiver. one of them *never* got along with my mother but he always feels some weird responsibility towards her. it comes off as him acting more superior than us.i think there are some things that you should talk to your father about, but there are some things that you just don't have control over unless you are actually in his position. maybe see if there is extra help that can come to the house? see what insurance or local organizations can do to help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/92fvwl/strategies_to_support_the_primary_carer_from_afar/,1
"my father is in his late 70's and is starting to worsen with his dementia. i hate seeing that because my grandmother had it and it just makes me break down every time my mom talks about it. my question is this: i know there has been some research done on the effects of coffee and dementia. my parents have never been coffee drinkers (which is funny, because all 7 of us brothers and sisters are). if we were to introduce coffee into their daily routine, given that he already has signs of worsening and that he's never really drank coffee before, would it necessarily help? and if so, are we talking about black coffee here, or maybe a little half and half?", try red wine ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/91gmu4/coffee_with_my_dad/,1
"without getting too detailed i'm trying to find out if my mom has dementia or just major depressive disorder. my mom seemed to have rapid dementia come on in a matter of days concomitant with other issues (dementia happened a couple days before other diagnoses): anemia, low folic acid, low potassium, magnesium, intestinal ulcers, and ultimately breast cancer. there was also some alcohol usage before this but we dont know how much. that being said, it seemed like my mom went from being normal to having severe memory loss in a matter of days. after a few days she kept thinking her mom, who died 10 years ago, was still alive. unable to remember day of the week or what time it is. difficulty remembering things that happened more than 15 minutes ago and so forth. my mom also lost weight, but gained some back after being in the hospital for a month, and after a week in the hospital lost the ability to stand or walk. right now in rehab hospital as of a day ago. throughout all of this we had mris, ct scans etc. doctors did not find anything wrong w her brain as far as they could tell that's not normal for someone in their 60s. it's now been a month and her memory issues have only gotten worse. she keeps thinking she is in another state or that i live in another place. she sometimes forgets my name unless i grill her. the doctor basically told us dementia or alzheimers but could not give any details or a diagnosis of what stage she is at. this has all been extremely frustrating. i always thought these things came on relatively slowly. currently waiting on results of a final test to see if its paraneoplastic syndrome or a couple other things. upon getting her to the rehab hospital the main nurse said its possible it could be major depression coupled w extreme anxiety. i know my mom has been depressed for a while now, and shes always had bad anxiety. it's just i didnt realize and still have trouble believing that those conditions can cause such extreme cognitive deficit. they're ordering a full psych evaluation. i just wanted to post here to see if anyone has any insight. thanks","i know this is verrrry late. but i was experiencing mild dementia that was called ‚Äòadhd‚Äô and ‚Äòdepression‚Äô by various psychiatrists. tried meds etc. nothing truly worked until i adjusted my diet.i learned about seed oils (vegetable oils) and their deleterious effects on, in my case, my health. after 5 days of no processed food and eating a lot of animal fats, i went into remission. i now believe i had what they call ‚Äòpseudodementia.‚Äô and that my very poor diet of either fast food binges or hummus and chips + a ton of uber eats very often amounted to some 1/3 of my consumed calories coming from seed oils.when i quit it, and ate nothing but pasture raised eggs, bacon, ghee, and tons of grass-finished steak, i woke up on day five as though i emerged from a twenty year coma.life has only gotten muchhhh better since. on day six i introduced raw milk and sourdough and have never gone back. i eat a fat heavy (emphasis on animal fats) diet but am by no means, carnivore or keto. i eat all sorts of things now. just no processed foods. i tolerate eating out just fine. but keep it to a minimum because everything at a restaurant is either cooked in seed oils or comprised quite literally of seed oils.your mothers condition worsening upon an extended stay at the hospital would line up with my thesis, because hospital food is notoriously laden with massive amounts of seed oils.i hope you and your mother are doing well. i pray she got the help she needed. if not it is not too late to try this. give it five days just like i did. i‚Äôd be shocked if she didn‚Äôt make some progress.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/902q5a/dementia_or_depression/,1

"because of unfortunate circumstances, 1.5 years ago my brother (now27m) and i (now22f) became the primary caretakers of my mother (now58f) with early onset alzheimer's. she's currently towards the end of stage 4. she lives with us full time and we have a hired caregiver who comes in and assists her when we're at school/work. the issue: mom loves sugar and anything unhealthy for her. since mom has moved in with us she's definitely gained a bit of weight (nothing drastic, just enough to be noticeable). this is likely because she's now in a situation where she can afford to eat out or stop for ice cream, whatever. we are happy to make mom happy. after all, it is the little things, right? the thing is, at first she had a good balance. we kept a veggie and fruit tray fully stocked in the fridge and she would eat as much of that as she would anything else. but now she's gotten to the point where it's the same each day. breakfast: sugar filled coffee, pop tarts or a different sugary pastry. one time i came in to find her dipping oreos in her coffee. lunch: a local sandwich shop. she gets one loaded with beef and cheese and dressing and requests and second one for dinner. dinner: second greasy sandwich from earlier. she drinks 3+ cokes a day. lots of sweet tea too. we'll try and encourage her to drink water but she gets mad at us and says she drinks it constantly and we don't know what we're talking about, so most days we just leave it be. my concern: her bad eating is going to create more health problems that will ultimately cause her more stress. my question: how hard do we push? is it worth trying to create healthy eating habits at this point or do we just let her enjoy her time?"," >my concern: her bad eating is going to create more health problems that will ultimately cause her more stress.probably, especially if you let this pattern continue because it's easier all round for it to continue.i wouldn't, for example, ever dip an oreo into coffee because i don't like oreos, but i might dip a different biscuit into a drink because i like the taste. there's nothing wrong with that, but eating too many biscuits one after the other won't do any good in the longer term.a little question - does she have problems with her teeth, is this why she seems to be preferring to eat softer food?>my question: how hard do we push? is it worth trying to create healthy eating habits at this point or do we just let her enjoy her time? of course it's worth it. do you have a family meal in the evening? if so, then why let her have just a sandwich when the rest of you are eating something that's both more nourishing and also nicer.drinks? if somebody offered me either a fizzy drink or water i'd probably take the fizzy drink because it tastes nicer. there's more to drinking than quenching a thirst. maybe offer fruit juices, or have a bit more choice - and reduce the number of fizzy drinks in the cupboard. somebody who drinks a lot of liquid will be filling themselves up with empty calories and 'feeling full' for a short time, but will soon feel hungry again - so will drink more, because it's the easiest way to feel full.diet in general is quite important, so is enjoying food. can you get the carer to take your mother to a different place for lunch, or at least to vary where she goes, so she has to choose something different?my mother in law is a lot older than your mother, and she has her meals delivered. her lunch is a hot meal, every day, and with a dessert. she really enjoys this. along with her lunch she has her 'tea' delivered. it's a sandwich, a savoury pastry, a cake, a piece of fruit, a yogurt or similar. all in all it's a fairly balanced diet, along with her toast and marmalade for breakfast, in fact it's a better diet than she was eating before because she was reluctant (unable) to prepare a decent cooked meal and often forgot to eat - part of her condition that she tried to hide.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/68a83a/healthy_eating/,1

"hi, i've been sort of back-up caregiver for a while to my sister (her husband is/was primary)  but now i'm primary for a while at least.  my older  sister is frail, diabetic, level 5/6 dementia, incontinent, etc.  i never had children so this business of constant laundry, changing clothes, ""suggesting"" someone brush her teeth or change her panties, cleaning up if she doesn't... and the feeding, my stars, what do you do about the unending food preparation and clean-up?  help.  tricks for tact would be appreciated.  easy food & snacks needed.  and how to develop patience?  i cut her nails for the first time today!  i was so scared i'd nip her toe.  how do i know what to do?","my child had a nanny growing up, so i had *no* experience with caretaking when i retired early in order to take care of my mother when my father died.  (i'm her only relative living in-state and she wasn't thriving in the nursing home my sister had put her in.  okay, ""wasn't thriving"" is an understatement; she was calling me multiple times a day begging me to get her out of there!)    first:  you're a saint for being willing to jump in and help out.  when the going gets hard, remember that.  you're doing a really good thing and doing a really good thing is rarely easy. second:  it's going to get worse -- but then it will get better!  so as it gets harder and harder, and it will, remember that.  as you figure things out and get in a routine, it actually does get lot better.  third:  don't beat yourself up if your sister's health declines.  given her health challenges, her path is somewhat set and, as a result, the best ""win"" you can probably hope for here is to stabilize her health.  there will be other things you can do that will help your sister and her husband, but i think it's kind of important -- and hard! -- to realize that ""getting better"" oftentimes isn't one of them.  if you can get your head in the right place for that, it will help. fourth:  set a time limit.  it's hard to do this difficult work if you're thinking that there's no end in sight.  i really suggest that you have a conversation with yourself that goes something like, ""i will commit to doing this for x weeks/months.""  calculating how far you've come -- and the time remaining! -- will really help you get through the difficult times.  and as that deadline gets closer, you will start to think about and plan for the future.   has bil fully recovered?  will they need home health aides to support them?  think about your own life and the people in it who are sacrificing *you* to this effort.  make a careful assessment of what you're sacrificing in your own life so you can think about it and make a knowledgeable and concerted decision about whether you want to go on and on what terms.here's how, after seven long, hard, head-bangingly difficult years as my mother's caregiver, i figured out some of the things that you mentioned: **constant laundry, part 1** - *find a fluff-and-fold service asap.*  yes, you can do it yourself and, once things settle down a bit, you will.  but right now, stabilizing your sister's health and mastering the routine is your top priority.  if money is a barrier, you can save by washing heavier sheets or blankets at home and letting the fluff-and-fold service do her clothes.  (they typically charge by the pound.)  this will save you a lot more time -- and frankly, effort -- than you'll realize.  i discovered this in desperation when i fell ill and it's been a super safety net at times when things get crazy or i'm overwhelmed.  **constant laundry part 2** - make sure she's got enough clothes, sheets, waterproof mattress covers, mattress pads, and anything else you're washing all the time.  you don't want to find yourself needing to change the bed or put her to bed only to realize that you're out of sheets or nightgowns!  having more than enough of the things you launder the most means that you won't be constantly chasing the laundry.**changing clothes** - if you're changing clothes a lot because of incontinence, the incontinence products may not be working effectively and it's worth investigating why that might be the case.  your sister may need different ""panties"" -- my mother wears the heavy-duty ""overnight"" ones during the day, for example; there are also products called ""doublers"" (pads that you put inside the ""panties"") that you can use at night.  we've also found that some brands work better than others.  (we tried a wide range and finally settled on tena products at the recommendation of a friend.)  it may be that the system for changing her panties may need some tweaking as well, i.e., she may simply need to have help changing them more often.  figuring out how to improve the incontinence issues is probably the best time (and money) you'll ever spend.  it means you don't have to spend as much time ""cleaning up"", it reduces laundry, preserves her skin and self-respect, makes it less likely that she'll get a urinary tract infection -- and improves everyone's spirits!it's often suggested, moreover, that you can get someone on a schedule for emptying their bowels by having them go sit on the toilet at certain times of the day -- ""training"" the body that now is the time to urinate/defecate.  if you can get her on a schedule -- and i suspect she probably is on some kind of a schedule; it's just difficult to perceive and you don't know what it is! -- that will help a lot with everything!  i.e., you don't have to ""suggest"" that it's time to brush her teeth; it's just something that always happens every day after x and before y.  if bad breath despite brushing is an issue, she may not be drinking enough water.  (people with incontinence often try to drink less because they think they won't have to urinate so much; this results in their becoming dehydrated and you just have more problems, so it's definitely worth it to do everything possible to encourage them to drink.)  you can encourage it by having a glass of water sitting beside her at all times.  i try to make the glass of water more attractive for my mother by using ice water and a straw; flavored water might also be more attractive to your sister.   if you can figure out what the barrier to tooth brushing is -- tooth pain, difficulty holding a brush, difficulty standing, or even not wanting to leave a certain tv show, whatever -- you'll have a better chance at figuring out how to get over it so it's not a constant issue.  there are also ""adult teeth wipes"" that can be put on a finger and the teeth can be cleaned that way.  they are not a substitute for brushing but they could be helpful if mobility is a barrier. **feeding** - again, a schedule is super helpful!  if possible, try to find out from her or your bil what she generally has for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.  because she is undoubtedly on a special diabetic diet and i am unfamiliar with what that might entail, i'm reluctant to make any specific suggestions.   i do, however, buy single servings of anything that i can to reduce spoilage.  another suggestion, kind of along the lines of using a fluff-and-fold laundry service until you get your sea legs under you, is to use paper plates!  even if you have a dishwasher, someone has to load it, run it, unload it and put the dishes away.  paper plates just go in the trash!  we use them rather a lot; my mother doesn't care and it really reduces the amount of dishes.  **smell** - you didn't mention it but, along the same lines, if your sister is incontinent, smell is an issue.  febreeze is now your best friend!  i used to try to economize by using generic trashbags but, honestly, one of the smartest things i've ever done is pay just a tiny bit more for trash bags that have been treated with febreeze.  i spray it on upholstery, the rug. i use the 2x air freshener kind in the air.  this is a difficult enough job to do in the first place; you don't need to be hit by stinky smells every time you open the door!  by the way, i also always keep a spray can of lysol -- or the generic brand -- along with (1) a pump dispenser of hand sanitizer, (2) clorox antibacterial wipes, and (3) paper towels on hand all the time.  i also keep disposable latex gloves (i don't have a latex allergy; if you do, there are alternative disposable gloves available as well) to put on my hands for ""clean ups.""   having what you need when you need it is really critical; it gives you a lot more confidence!  keeping yourself healthy is important to everybody and, since you're being exposed to a lot of germs here, it's not something you'd want to overlook.  if your sister uses a commode, i'd suggest using the plastic liners; that will make that chore much faster and easier as well!  **patience** - knowing that you have a ""stop date"" will help.  it's also helpful, i find, to put a smile on my face -- whether it wants to be there or not!  keep pleasant thoughts about your sister in your mind, maybe remembering good times you've had or things she's done for you.  make yourself think three nice thoughts about her every morning.  be aware of your own needs; i find, for example, that i am less patient if i am in pain (tennis elbow, for example), so being aware of that reminds me to take an aspirin or whatever.  i'm also less patient if my own needs -- for sleep, for peace and quiet, for alone time -- aren't being met, so be aware of what you need and be creative, if necessary, in finding ways to meet them.  (having at times no other option, i've even sat in my car in my mother's driveway.  it wasn't entirely satisfying, but it worked in a pinch!)your bil's reluctance to call in home health aides is almost universal among caregivers -- they all want to wait until the last possible minute -- and it is a **universal mistake.**  if you can encourage him to integrate someone into their routine -- perhaps as he continues his own recovery -- you will be doing everyone a great favor.  and if payment is the concern, almost every state has a program that can provide assistance since aging in place is much less expensive than in a nursing home.  i hope this helps!  i'm sure i haven't thought of everything so, if i can be of any additional assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out.  and best of luck!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/4g3zpk/new_to_thiscrash_course_needed/,1

"my 83 year old grandma has been living with us for over 10 years and has alzheimers and diabetes. early on it was a real hassle trying to learn how to take care of her and deal with her illnesses but we've adapted and have a much easier living situation. fortunately my grandma still has strong verbal skills, can walk and is only forgetful of very short term events. the biggest dilemma with her is that she has become accustomed to jumping on every opportunity she has to sneak food from our kitchen fridge which is a problem as she doesn't combine normal meals and almost always go for carb heavy items which spikes her blood sugar to incredibly high levels. she won't hesitate to do this even after eating a full meal. we do have preventative measures in place which is primarily locking her door whenever no one is downstairs in the adjacent living room to supervise her. we end up feeling guilty for locking her door for so long that we end up leaving it open but she essentially waits for someone to walk upstairs and rushes to the fridge. though i realize her alzheimers can make her forget when she last ate and that her diabetes can cause her to feel hungry even has food in her stomach their have been many instances where we catch her sneaking food, ask her to put the food back and she proceeds to start eating it right in front of us until we forcibly remove it from her. her main target is often ice cream but we started keeping all of the very diabetic non-friendly food in the garage fridge which has a electronic keypad on it, this resulted in a multitude of unsuccessful attempts from her to access that fridge though she has succeeded on occasion when we forget to lock the garage door. it's these kind of events that tells me she willingly attempts to sneak food most of the time. i setup a small whiteboard next to her that i write down the time for every meal of the day and check whether she ate it. this has been helpful for her from what i can tell but it's questionable. on top of that i don't always remember to update as i'm not her sole caretaker and she sometimes misplaces the marker. no matter how many talks i have with her the one thing i seem incapable of changing are her food sneaking habits. i can understand if she forgets she ate recently but her food sneaking is very intentional. only passive security measures such as locks have been able to truly prevent her from sneaking food and even then only if we lock it which we sometimes forget. besides that the only other issue is her excessive knocking on her bedroom door. almost every time it's to inquire for her next meal which she likely already had recently. her balance has been getting slightly worse though this is most notable when she has low blood sugar which has led to some nasty falls. however through constant reassurance and reminders she now uses her walker regularly but even so still tends to fall with or without with blood sugar fluctuations. i make sure to be nearby when she has to travel through the house.","there comes a time when you have to ask yourself what you are accomplishing by tight blood sugar control. there is a lot of controversy about this lately:>but for someone who is 85 and frail, has other chronic diseases and already takes lots of medications, who lives in a nursing home or needs that level of care, aggressive treatment for diabetes is unlikely to pay off in better health, dr. lee said. looser glycemic goals might serve better.finding a doctor who is more in touch with the current treatment of an elderly dementia patient might result in less hypoglycemic falls and more ice cream.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/475x2e/advice_for_my_grandma_with_alzheimersdiabetes_of/,1

"catswearhats i work with clients like this frequently. the montessori tasks are great, such as the folding towels example. some of the others i have found successful are in this article: 1. prep tables with materials for activities such as puzzles, sorting exercises and other games. 2. lay out a basket of clean towels to fold. 3. have a basket of clean socks that need to be matched and folded. 4. put out a bin of plastic plumbing tubes that can be connected and put together. 5. for advanced dementia patients who may take comfort in holding dolls, a series of dolls and doll clothes can make for a pleasurable activity. 6. for those who enjoy cooking or baking, a safe kitchen environment and baking ingredients.  depending on the client, talking about their childhood can be successful. asking questions such as where were you born? did you grow up on a farm? and then go from there depending on their answers. simple oral quizzes, keeping in mind their level of functioning, is great too! we have whole binders where i work, but i'll see if i can find an example online... k like this: 1 a cake named after a baseball play2 president carter‚Äôs favorite cake3 integrated cake named after a stone4 cake that is like a babies5 a 16 ounce cakeanswers # 1 bunt cake # 2 peanut cake # 3 marble cake # 4 bottom cake # 5 pound cakei find that when all else fails, everybody loves taking about food. talk about what her favourite thing to cook is, does she like sweet or savoury? things like that.and in crisis moments, i find that validation therapy is effective. live in her world. if she is concerned about something, try to help her with it, validate that those feelings she is experiencing are real, before trying to redirect her to something else. if you have any additional questions or anything, feel free to pm me! i just came off a co-op rotation working with alzheimer's clients, and am still there on a part time basis while i compete my studies. it can be stressful at first in an environment like this, but you'll hit your stride and do great! :)",,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersCanada/comments/32hhm5/awesome_calming_suggestions_from_redditor/,1

"i've seen comments from others with this problem . . . i'm  frustrated, hurt, and aggravated rn, so forgive me if this is all over the place.my mil (mid-70s) is in the beginning-ish stages of dementia. we have a neuro &amp; neuro-psych that she sees regularly. summer of 2020 after a car accident, her driving ability was medically evaluated (she's cleared to drive). though, fortunately, she doesn't drive much. she lives on her own. husband goes over at least once a week to hang out, do things around the house, and -important- to fill her pill box for the week (heart, bp, blood thinners, etc etc). home health aide comes once a week. she and i speak  once or twice a week for over an hour at a time. mil and her widowed neighbor speak every day on the phone and keep tabs on each other. she also texts dh every night when she's upstairs in her bedroom. she's physically frail. a hip replacement a few years ago (retirement happened at the same time), a knee replacement is in the works, and other joint/ arthritis issues. mil also doesn't have many friends &amp; the only real hobby she's ever had she can't do bc of arthritis in her hands. her gp - who sucks and i've nicknamed ""dr. feelgood"" - keeps giving her oxycodone for the pain (i know). she's become obsessed with it to the point she ends up misplacing it by putting it in ""safe"" places and forgetting etc. now, we get to the problem. she's always been someone who gets into her head and becomes anxious when she has too much time on her hands. this has obviously worsened.  she picked up her meds including oxycodone early this week. all the meds in their own paper bags etc. monday, dh went to do the thing, including dealing with getting all the meds our of their paper bags and putting them in her weekly am/pm pillbox. note: the oxy doesn't go in this pillbox. the next day, she and dh were texting all morning about missing oxy pills from the bottle. i didn't know this, so when he left for his daily walk, i called her to chat. we chatted for a while, i mentioned how the past 2 days had been terrible for migraine. next thing i know, she says ""this is going to sound accusatory."" explains how she's missing 21 pills and the only ""reasonable"" explanations could be that either the drug store screwed up or dh took them for me. i was pissed. but, calmly &amp; firmly told her that her son would never do that. i then hear her say ""oh, hi"" then to me ""he's here."" ok, not knowing this has been ongoing, i shoot dh a quick text about it.when he got home, he explained that he remembered there was a pill bottle lid that was on cock-eyed, so he went out to the garage garbage and found the bag that had all the paper bags from her scripts in it. he found about 15 loose oxy in one of the white paper bags. he brought them in, explained how he'd found them. she says (and the story changes) essentially she opened the oxy bag and bottle in the car ""to check it."" for what, who knows. whatever. he also bought a monthly pill box specifically for the oxy and split them all up. we think all is well. yesterday evening she calls. apparently, she'd been perseverating on this since tues afternoon and still thinks he took pills as there are still a few missing. he calmly tells her again what he'd done, how he'd found the missing pills &amp; that some may have made their way out of the paper bag into the actual garbage, and no, he didn't dig thru all that. nope, he took them. dh has the patience of a saint. he has to be extremely frustrated or hurt, to raise his voice. she knows this. he finally lost his cool and raised his voice to her/ yelled. it kind of snapped her back. he ended up telling her how he's very careful not to bring up the dementia often as reasons for things as he doesn't want to make her feel bad, but she needs to entertain the possibility that it's that. she seemed to take this to heart, it made sense, sincere apologies all around. 10 min later she texts about how she's going to go look in the garbage. fine. she didn't text last night before bed as she does every night. home health aid is there today, so we know she's fine otherwise the aid would have called. i know we've got to figure out something re: oxy and her behavior surrounding it. we're trying, but all the cajoling from us and her neuro changes nothing. her gp is old, seemingly doesn't care, and loves the sound of his own voice. she sees her neuro every 6 mths (all doc appts are with dh). fortunately, i also see this neuro and have a long established relationship. my next appt is soon &amp; i plan to talk to him too. all that to say, what do we do with all this? do we need to bring up the dementia sooner when she gets like this? she's not to the point where redirecting works. she's also a very intelligent woman who will not be ""handled.""  ack. apologies for the length of this  post."," report that doctor, he has zero idea of how to manage pain. she is obsessed because she's addicted. the addicted brain, after a while, has a hard time measuring g pain vs dependence.this is hard, i went thru the same w my mother. got my eyes opened to a lot of my own preconceived notions of how early dementia presents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uyfp6t/mil_what_is_her_vs_dementia_perseverating_about/,1

(the police would find him and bring him home.)  now, the most annoying thing he does is he has no idea of personal boundaries.  he's always digging into closets or boxes and finding things which he wanders about depositing throughout the house.  he has stolen my electric toothbrush and my eyeglasses and it took a few days to get both of those back.  he must try on 5 or 6 complete outfits a day and discard them in a big pile.  you're talking about her having her own space but you will find that doesn't register at some point.also there's the possibility that she may become aggressive at some point.  even if she doesn't, you may have to lock up your drugs and your knives and scissors for safety, put an alarm on her bed and on your exit doors, and struggle to keep her out of the kitchen when she no longer understands food safety.  she may leave faucets running and burners turned on, or the microwave running when empty.anyway, most of this won't matter at the beginning, so you can change direction in a year or two or whenever it seems merited.  but i am coming to the opinion that dementia does not always fit well in a standard home.bless you for wanting to make this situation the least impactful.  she will forget who each person is.  i suggest the family focus on accepting being forgotten.  this is like her death because she will go away but not physically.  realize she will become someone different than each of you know.  her reality will change on a moments notice and my best advice is to go with it.  as long as there is safety in what is happening, if she thinks her daughter is a visiting neighbor then go with it.  i would play some of her favorite music at times and maybe even sing along.  usually this is soothing.  if she needs to be busy, give her laundry to fold.  anything you don't want to disappear put it out of her reach.  i have yet to find my tv remote.  if you  have pets, normally they find them comforting.  my mother never tolerated a dog in the bed until she had alzheimer's then she would walk the house until she found her boo to go to bed with.  can't have real pet, get one of those robotic animals.  i also gave my mom a dollbaby to dress and play with.  this is a very challening undertaking.  i stayed in prayer daily for peace and my mom never became agitated while in my home.  she may have forgotten who we were but she knew the people around her loved her.  memories may fade but emotions continue to be felt.  expect paranoia.  wouldn't you be scared if you forgot who you were and where you were all the time?  good luck.   blessings to ya[dos and don‚Äôts.](",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ubo4vd,1

"you didn't read that backwards. my dad legitimately forgets that he has eaten. every day, every meal. he's 67 and had a stroke in 2014, absolutely no working memory and his long term memories cut off at around 1979. i moved him into my house after my mom passed in october. over all, we love having him around and bonding with his grandkids! but there's one issue: he is always eating.for example, i'll cook dinner. he'll have a serving and ask for a second. no worries there, i have two teenagers - there's always plenty of leftovers. but here's where it gets funky - he'll go put his plate up and grab a pb&j sandwich on his way back. up to 3 times per meal. he also pops out for a sandwich.his wait shocks me, too. he's maybe 5'6"" (about 1.7m),but weighs about 160lbs (about 80-ish kg, doing the math in my head). we've had tests run, but his docs have no clue what is making so utterly ravenous!anyone who has had a similar experience?","my mom was the same. we would give her half her lunch the first time she asked for it and the other half the second time she alleged she hadn‚Äôt eaten. you can offer a lot of liquids as they lose the ability to distinguish thirst and hunger. so maybe some tea and a few heathy cookies?an effect of the stroke, perhaps?alzheimer's patients often like sweets; but are not necessarily ravenous.my dad had the exact same experience. he gained so much weight because he would forget. he would also get up in the middle of the night for snacks multiple times too. my mom ended up having to hide stuffthis happened with my mom. she still doesn't remember, but now her appetite has curbed.i think that's pretty common with people like me who love to eat because of how nice eating is. it's not that he's hungry, it's that the usual curbs on his appetite, which is different from hunger, are the highly complicated calculations that his brain can't do anymore. my friend with alzheimer's is the same way, and one of the ""eat to live"" carers tries to reason him out of eating all the ice cream at once. and i'm like ""that wouldn't even work on me, and i don't have alzheimer's.""i agree with hiding and disguising food (a brown paper bag will work with my friend); i would also consider finding some things that he could eat a lot of and making those readily available. rice cakes are hard to eat fast and have good crunchy mouthfeel, and you could try diy popsicles that are mostly water with a bit of juice for color and flavor, for a couple of examples. fridge and cabinet locks can work in some households, but it sounds like right now your dad might be just as capable of unlocking them as you are; anything you can do to make it look like a food is all gone will be helpful, like hiding the full jar of pbj in the over-fridge cabinet and keeping one with just a tablespoon on the regular shelf. (and don't throw that one out when he uses it--just add another tablespoonful from the secret source and put it back on the shelf.) it's going to be more a matter of supervising and redirecting him, and/or making peace with the slipping out for a sandwich. it's also possible that it's a kind of brain stimulation that's too satisfying to be easy to stop--a lot of what you're describing is ""this feels nice and i'm going to keep going."" it might be worth exploring a fast transition to something really interesting and absorbing for him when you consider a meal is over (and have the kids bus his plate rather than pointing him back to the kitchen). unfortunately, a lot of the things that would likely serve your goal here are the opposite of what you'd want to do with a pair of hungry teens in the house, so you may want to enlist them as helpers in making this work for everybody.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/uay7zd,1

because ‚Äúmom won‚Äôt like it.‚Äù with his copd he couldn‚Äôt get to it in time or he‚Äôd collapse trying. can i have a ‚Äòwtf‚Äô here? she is incredibly possessive of my father and has jealously threatened him that it‚Äôs either her or the cat. she doesn‚Äôt care if we (herself included) starve until dinner but if i prep a breakfast or lunch for dad and i, she petulantly exclaims that she was going to surprise him with xyz meal (not so)what i didn‚Äôt anticipate was the way i‚Äôd resent this angry, mean, manipulative, paranoid woman who has snatched my mom‚Äôs body and taken the family hostage.i feel terrible for complaining but i‚Äôm basically her punching bag & it hurts. vent over edited for spelling.","if i were you, i would buy a tundra fire extinguisher can from first alert.  it looks like a red can of pam cooking spray.  you take the plastic wrap off of the sprayer, and put it where your dad can get to it.  if there is a fire (god forbid), it would be much easier to use for an elderly person.  your mom is definitely progressing, and the only consolation is that the next phase may be the ""sleeping all the time"" phase.  you can get much more done when she gets there.  unfortunately, your dad is in need of almost as much help as she is.  it is very difficult to change 60+ years of roles and habits.  stay strong, caregiver warrior....you have a ways to go.i commiserate with you. my grandfather died young long ago, while his kids were still in their teens. my mom has told me, if he hadn't died way back then he would be suffering now due to his wife/her mom, exactly the way you describe. grandma has served as the sole caregiver for her disabled son for decades. and as we have transitioned an exit ramp for him these couple years, she *fought* very simple ideas that would make his life a little easier and better. like, signing him up for a weekly art class for disabled adults at the local community center. that made her angry! because her caring for her son is not even about his best interest anymore, it is about her having a purpose in life. so she is extremely possessive of that role. she is 90 and on hospice now. every time we need to change her diaper, she kicks and screams so much you'd think she was being tortured. three times a day. we are just trying to carry her to the finish line with as much dignity left as possible.40% of alzheimer's caregivers die before the patient, of stress-related disorders. i think it's time to look into a nursing home for mom. at least to start arranging all the finances (possibly divorce) so that she qualifies for government assistance. or else, alzheimer's could steal your dad prematurely too.this is exactly the situation we were in, and then my dad who had no health issues had a stroke, a brain tumor was found on the mri, and it was over. suddenly, i was the one available to be with her. doing everything her doctor's said (as i caught her up on all the appointments my dad had given up trying to get her to) by putting in security cameras to monitor her when we were not with her, setting her up with medical alert systems (she put them right into the trash the minute we left) getting her meals all set and ready to microwave (the dogs got them for dinner along with their dog food). it was overwhelming. we'd cut power to her stove/oven or turn off gas to her heating system (she liked to turn up the heat as high as it would go on hot, humid days or turn it off in the middle of winter). she was able to turn the gas or power back on. it became a never-ending battle of wills.for missing jewelry, if she hasn't thrown it away, my mom's favorite hiding spot (we found it later when we were moving her into assisted living) was behind the access panel to her bathtub. this meant she had to pull out all of the storage baskets, get down on her hands and knees, lean into the bathroom closet, remove the screws, pull off the panel, and then put everything back in place. yet, my husband saw a bra strap sticking out and found that was where she'd hidden all of the bras she'd accused others of stealing.we took her out to lunch one day, we returned and she started yelling at us for bringing her to a stranger's house. she didn't recognize her own house, and it was the home she'd been in for more than 50 years. that's when we decided we couldn't do it anymore. we sold the house and used the equity to pay for assisted living. that ended up being the best choice for her. the first place she was in was ill-prepared for alzheimer's, as we learned, but the second place was fantastic and she made friends and didn't want us hanging around as much.i‚Äôm sorry. no one should see their mother go through this awful disease. does she have a neurologist? is she taking any medication for her alzheimer‚Äôs? it sounds like it is becoming to much for your dad to manage. a doctor could help with medication or to put in some boundaries - at least they did with our mom.at times i had to say right to dementia patient ""your freedoms are causing me all kinds of hardships!  i'm making some rules (and taking things away) to make things easier around here.  do you want to live here with me, or go to memory care?""he improved his behavior for a few hours.  sigh.thank you for sharing. i‚Äôm sorry for your struggle. i‚Äôm hoping i can get my dad to visit his sil who lives in one of these retirement resorts. she is the widow of my dad‚Äôs brother who died of dementia so maybe she can help him realize that this could be a good thing for mom and certainly for him. we have 2 modes of thinking: analytical & intuitive. dementia obliterates analytical & leaves behind intuitive which is why there is no point in asking who, what, where, when, why and how type questions. as toddlers, we develop intuitive thinking first. that‚Äôs what dementia patients are left with and why they so closely resemble toddlers feeling allll the feels with no way to adequately express themselves. i mean,  i can reason this out in my brain and yet i still have a hard time wrapping my head around the resulting behaviour. this disease is a particular brand of horroredit to add comment",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/slkcfu,1
"how important is diet in mid-stage dementia/alzheimers?my uncle, 78, is firmly in the mid-stage of dementia/alzheimers. my mom, 75, is his primary caretaker. her biggest concern: that he‚Äôs not eating properly. though he gets (and eats) meals on wheels usually twice a day, he also buys packages of cookies and chocolate. he‚Äôll eat a whole package in a day or two.i understand how important a good diet is when you‚Äôre young and healthy, but does eating this much sugar at this stage/condition in life have a huge negative effect?","we made sure our mom was in general getting nutrients but quite frankly her life with the disease sucked so bad that giving her a mcdonald‚Äôs hamburger every other day was the least of our worries. the only thing we really were concerned about was her access to junk food because she‚Äôd forget she‚Äôd eaten and would eventually make herself feel sick. i believe my brother and partner eventually childproofed the fridge so she couldn‚Äôt do that.it seems many with dementia crave sweets. part of the reason is the ability to taste is diminished or lost. sweet is the last to remain.  his cookies and cakes may be the only thing that he can really taste. as the disease progresses sweets are the only thing that many eat. my mother lived a long time on ice cream, mashed sweet potatoes and ensure (and very little of those).i think with this awful disease we need to prioritize quality of life over anything else. if he‚Äôs happy, that‚Äôs what matters. also, he very well might be eating the whole package of cookies in a day because he doesn‚Äôt remember how many he‚Äôs already had. if mom concerned enough and is nearby, she could break the package of cookies into zip top bags with a few each and drop one off each time she visits.i feel you. and not making light, it‚Äôs just all i‚Äôve been dealing with too. i‚Äôm at the point of trying to find some humor in it. it feels like trying to keep sugar away from a little kid. my mother will eat a gallon of ice cream a day with 3-4 pepsi‚Äôs and make herself sick. every day. so i don‚Äôt buy her any and she gets upset that she has nothing to eat or drink. she lives in a facility that prepares nutritious meals with good size portions. she eats 2/day. but her sweet tooth is out of control. she doesn‚Äôt remember or believe that she‚Äôs ingesting so much sugar outside normal meals. i try to stock her up with fruits and vegetables but they just sit there while the junk food disappears and she claims it was never there. tonight she showed me that she needed food in her fridge and i pointed out the carrots and asked her why she hadn‚Äôt opened them. she said ‚Äúoh yeah-i‚Äôve seen those around somewhere.‚Äù her friend in the facility told me yesterday that a lady had a birthday and her son brought her a cake. after celebrating in the common area my mom offered to carry the cake back to the lady‚Äôs room. instead mom just took it straight back to her own house. the lady had to knock and ask for her birthday cake back. my mom apologized, walked the cake over to the right door and then looked down at it in her arms, licked her lips, said goodbye and went back to her house with the other lady‚Äôs birthday cake again‚Ä¶the lady ended up just giving my mom half‚Ä¶ i too am trying to be understanding. i can‚Äôt force her to learn impulse control at this point. it‚Äôs a learning curve. i‚Äôm working on substitutions and building better habits. i have figured out that she will down low sugar fruit cups if the ice cream is gone. that‚Äôs a start. i have figured out that if i get her nice gum she will chew that and it seems to stave off the sweet tooth. any other hints would be appreciated.my dad was obsessed with sweets early on. managing his disease was already challenging enough, so i just let him order the sugar. doctors recommend a mediterranean diet, but that is so incredibly difficult to maintain for someone in this disease process. now he‚Äôs in a facility and his meals are balanced for the most part. i wouldn‚Äôt stress about it, alzheimer‚Äôs is a relentless bitch and a piece of salmon won‚Äôt save your family member.dr. mary newport would definitely say diet is related. if only i could get my father to eat better. it‚Äôs hard with a grown up kid. big hugs.my dad will be moving into a care facility at the end of the month and will probably be eating better than he has in a long time. he loves his sweets and wendy's.main thing to keep an eye i'd say is other health issues that could arise. my dad needed 5 fillings recently.... guess the caregivers weren't brushing his teeth! sigh...my mom lost her sense of taste after a surgery 25 years ago.  her sense of smell is now going. as a result she doesn‚Äôt eat very much & is becoming quite thin.  i try to get her to eat but she‚Äôll (always) angrily respond with, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt need the calories (she does), do i look skinny to you? (yes! ffs, yes!) it‚Äôs of great concern because she has osteoporosis that requires biannual injection. she‚Äôs becoming quite rigid in the way she holds her arms & torso & she takes shuffling steps. she does pound back coke zero tho (don‚Äôt get me started) which is about the sensation of carbonation. i guess this vent was a long way to say, as long as food is being eaten, you‚Äôll have other hills to die on.  *big hugs*sugar is bad, young or old.i'm (m60) luckily 12 years younger than my wife (f72) who has been diagnosed with alzheimer's.diet is important. we eat well, and we are trying supplements which i've read can/may help alleviate symptoms.we also walk quite a bit.the only downside is she is restricted to about 1 glass of wine a day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/sk1dgs,1

"my grandfather in his 70s is now facing the problem of properly using a washroom its not that he cant use his reflexes its just that he does not want to enter toilet he wants to do wherever he wants . its has become harder to force him and we dont hit him we try not even raise our voice ofc have a force with hand but to some extent we try our best to talk to him sweetly but we dont have our best days either we have life of our own too . he used to sit on toilet at first but these few months we are trying to make him atleast go to the washroom and pee while squatting (that's how he does no matter what) on floor and he does but now he's doesn't want to go in there at all we have to change his clothes two times a day lets not even talk about when he has to poop. there's is sudden rapid decline in his intrest to go to bathroom at all and we are not prepared for it at all he wants to do whatever he wants and he gets annoyed when we tell him what to do in best case ,in worse case he will hit. we cant use diapers too because he has a habit of taking off his trousers first ,we did try and as expected he it off.anyone knows how to deal with this situation? any smaller suggestion helps alot . also mind that this whole thing starts happening in few months","how do you know he is not having incontinence?  incontinence happens with alzheimer's. in addition, people with dementia also forget where the washroom is located and all of the steps for using the washroom.  and sometimes they don't recognize household fixtures, such as the toilet, and may confuse something else for a toilet. the confusion and forgetting can lead to people with dementia, especially men, going to the bathroom in inappropriate places. you can try a few things: if he is removing his diaper, there are special undergarments to help with this. it's called ""adaptive clothing"" - you can get an ""adult onesie"" which is designed to keep adults from removing their underwear. you can get it online from several places. one is ""buckandbuck"".  they also have trousers that close at the back. you can also try getting him on a toileting schedule: bring him in after meals and every couple hours. also, if you supervise him closely you can lead him to the bathroom before he goes in the wrong place. even with this, there are bound to still be accidents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/se6kkv,1
"i recently moved in with my grandparents so they wouldn‚Äôt have to go into a nursing home. my grandpa has severe alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia to the point where he can barely watch tv or do anything that requires more than 5 min worth of attention. i basically just play cards with him, do word searches and watch westerns and ww2 docs with him all day. thing is he gets very antsy around 3 or 4pm everyday thinking he needs to go somewhere or do something. when i ask him what we need to do he just says ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know‚Äù and gets angry. he loves to work. he unfortunately worked everyday for like 45 years and i believe his brain thinks he needs to go just out of habit. i am wondering if there are any jobs i could give him? what‚Äôs like a manly job he might enjoy doing?  any suggestions are appreciated!","we gave my mother-in-law a plastic drawer with many dividers from the dollar store. we bought a bunch of little items such as buttons, ribbons etc and she can spend a lot of time sorting them into the various compartments. her sorting system changes each day. for your grandad, perhaps you could get things like screws, nails, washers, etc. you can tell him that they need to be organized and it would be a big help if he could do this. he may or may not enjoy this but tactile activities can be relaxing for them and they can feel productive.you could tell him he just got home from work and now it's his time to relax. never ask, just divert. try some music from his era.folding clean towels/underwear/socks, clipping coupons, shining his shoes, filling weekly pill containers with vitamins, running a handful of papers (worthless/harmless papers you hand him) into the shredder (pull it out of the closet) one by one, handing you clean dishes one by one from the dishwasher/drying rack while you put each one away, tidying up books on the bookshelf, watering a small potted plant, sorting the clean forks/spoons/butter knives into their slots in the drawer. my grandmother used to pray the rosary during this time with a follow-along recording too. i hope one of these items sticks.he may also need more physical exercise like long walks, etc, if he can. he maybe used to a lot of moving and changing to a sedentary lifestyle can be jarring.late evening is a difficult time. sundowning often starts around 4:00. my mother had trouble then no matter how active we had been during the day. you‚Äôve received some great ideas. the big thing for us was to keep mom busy and close to us. she would do well sitting at the table while i fixed dinner. i would give her something to do. she did poorly if i would leave her watching tv while i fixed dinner. she would start heading ‚Äúhome.‚Äù  this helped for a long time. eventually she did need medicine because her sundowning got worse and included hallucinations. i only say this so you can watch out for that possibly starting. sounds like you are doing great. good luck.this phenomenon is called sundowning and if you google it you'll find that is very common! there is no permanent fix for it, so make a list of things you can try, and try to match them to that days mood.someone who's just checking the time can still be diverted by a 'i did the groceries already/ partner is getting the kids today/etc' but someone who's in the confused wandering phase may not be calmed down by that anymore. it's often influenced by hunger, bathroom needs, tiredness etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/s9hly0,1

"hi everyone,first time poster who has benefited a great deal from all the advice and support over the years reading through various posts and comments.mil has advanced alzheimer's. we are having trouble with her bowel movements. she gets very constipated for a couple of days, during which time we give her senekot, fiber gummies, milk of magnesia etc. then she will void herself but the problem is that the timing of this is uncontrollable. we try to sit her on the toilet throughout the day but she does not understand the concept of pushing. on a few occasions she has voided herself in her diaper at night and then reaches in and pulls it out. needless to say it is a big mess.  last night was a really rough night for my fil and we rushed over to try to help with the cleanup. clean up involves trying to avoid her touching anything, disinfecting the entire bed area, while also getting her into the bath which as you know is another big challenge for alz patients. we do notice that she is constantly reaching into her pants at night. any suggestions for how we could solve this problem? we are going to play around with the times of day when we give her the laxative but it seems as if she is not on the schedule at all with her bowel movements.thanks in advance for any suggestions you might have.","my father in law wears a kind of jumpsuit garment  under his clothes that prevents him from reaching into his pants. it zips in the back so he can't undo it himself. maybe something like this? especially at night if that's the problem time.a bedside commode can make the trip to the toilet faster and easier and the space around her is more easily controlled.  you can lay out newspaper, or barrier pads underneath as well. using barrier cream after each incontinent episode is important.  get a basin with soapy water to use near the bedside commode so you don't have to do a full bath if you can get away with it.  there is a rinse free peri wash that i really love.  a few squirts, wipe with the disposable wash cloths to remove soil, then a quick scrub and pat dry. i have found that full baths are not pleasant for dementia patients.  making the bathroom warm and utilizing a shower chair will really help.many women who have had children can lose their tone to push, which makes things harder to move out. you might find a bisacodyl or glycerin suppository at bedtime might provide results by morning so having one major clean up might really help your day.  fiber gummies are terrible for elderly people who may have trouble swallowing and that would be a less safe option for her. if her hands are busy, put something in them.  a disposable glove on her hand with a washcloth, for example.if she is restless at night and does not stop playing with her diaper, i'd talk to the doctor about getting something to settle her down.  she isn't comfortable and it could be due to ""sundowning agitation"" which can be treated and improve her quality of life.source: hospice nurse of 20 years.. me :-)i think the problem is you are waiting for her to get constipated, then giving her laxatives.try this:  1. a capful of miralax (generic is cheaper) in morning coffee or other beverage.  plus 2. a glassful of psyllium husk in water, orange juice, or some brands come orange-flavored, just add water.  plus if stools are too hard, 3. add a stool softener pill (sodium docusate)  at bedtime.the goal is regularity, not cycles of constipation/laxatives.  also, if she ever takes a narcotic for pain, maybe up the dose of the above slightly.  if she is eating extra fresh fruit (like when it's in season) maybe cut back slightly, still doing the above but less.this is working pretty well for my spouse, and i do it too.  i hope this helps!read the label on the meds, they usually take 6-12 or more hours to work. so maybe the dosing should be done with/after dinner, in hopes of an am bm?  does her medical team have any ideas for rx?  or maybe she could benefit from a consultation with a gastro.  it's possible she could be prescribed something that'd have more predictable results. have you tried pajamas that'd preclude her from being able to reach down into her pants?  thinking like adult one-piece feety pajamas..?  but i realize the nightmare that may induce in trying to get a late-stage ad patient into single-piece pajamas...i keep a glass full of water for my wife and it helps making her regular. i just have to coach her to go.timing of the medication is important here, but so is spending enough time on the toilet. and already mentioned: try to stabilise her movements. most of our patients get washed and brushed etc while sitting on the toilet, so that they get enough time to go, without just making them sit for 30 minutes. writing down what the subtle clues are helps too: unrest, walking, emotions changing, pulling on clothes, searching in cupboards, waddling, touching the stomach, frowning etc. that is probably a good time to offer a bathroom visit. lastly: has she been checked for utis, and infections? fecal incontinence ofcourse introduces a great deal of bacteria, and patients often can't say what's up. itchy crotch should probably be checked out. could just be skin irritation, but that would still benefit from a protective cream.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/rz0uvv,1

"my mother has a living will and i don't understand how that works when she stops feeding herself. it says not to give her artificial nourishment if she has a terminal illness. i have a friend who said her mom just said ""i'm not eating any more"" and died a week later. has anybody else been in this situation? i'm want to be mentally prepared for it because i'm her medical poa and i have a combative sibling who i will have to be dealing with.","so with ours if dad stops eating we will not put in a feeding tube. we will opt for fluids but that's it. we also will not opt for any life saving measures like no breathing tubes. if his body is ready to go then it's time for  him to go. with food dad will mostly feed himself and if he gets to where he had trouble lifting the soon we will feed him. but, if he refuses to eat we won't force him. stuff like that. good for your mom getting that set up early.i understand its just like the other commenter said. no feeding tube, but if they are willing to eat and are just having motor skill problems eating, id feed them, but not try to force.  you might ask their doc to ask if they can get into hospice care, and explain the situation. maybe you can get some medication to help ease their pain from going out like this. doc and hospice might also be able to provide their opinions on whats normally done to help smooth conflict with sibling. good luck.when my grandma went into hospice, she just wasn't hungry. she'd eat a bite at most of food, but everything was palliative. enough care to make her comfortable. no feeding tube or intravenous fluids. she passed around a week after she stopped eating/drinking.artificial nourishment would be a feeding tube.with my grandmother, she didn't have a living will but had talked to me about her wishes before her diagnosis. i was medical poa and decided on palliative (comfort) measures only. dnr, no feeding tubes, no intubation.if your sibling is ever pushing a feeding tube, there is plenty of research showing that feeding tubes are contraindicated in people with dementia. if there's going to be disagreement among family or family & facility staff, it is sometimes around hand feeding. for instance, dementia is advanced, the person is mostly non-communicative and is totally dependent, and the staff spoons pureed food in her mouth and she naturally swallows. the person is not seeking out food and has zero quality of life but will still swallow food and liquid that is put into their mouth. everyone has different opinions of this and it's not specifically addressed in a living will. i think we need living wills that specifically cover different scenarios related to dementia so family doesn't have to be the one making the choice: either to prolong a miserable life or to end things quicker.when people start dying, they stop feeling hungry and wanting food. (part of this could be that food is not enjoyable, as they are choking on it as their throat forgets how to swallow). they are not feeling pain due to hunger. they don‚Äôt die because they starve to death. they stop eating because they are dying.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/rpr2sy,1
"any advice on dishwashers? my dad loves to putter in the kitchen loading or unloading the dishwasher, cleaning counters, and hand washing large items. it's been his job since i was a kid. mom would cook and dad would clean.  recently, i noticed him putting dirty items into the clean dishwasher. and mom caught him trying to put dirty items back in the cupboard. i would hate to take this activity away from it because it seems to give him purpose and he seems to enjoy puttering for hours over a 10 minute cleanup. :)i bought one of those clean/dirty signs but i'm pretty sure he isnt capable of reading/comprehending it. should my mom or myself stand in the kitchen with him like a drill sargeant inspecting his work? should we tell him we will be doing it from now on? find him another activity every time he tries to do dishes? switch to paper plates? is there such a thing as a dishwasher lock?","the appliance lock when the dishwasher is dirty may work. i work with some families that use them in the kitchen it does sound like it‚Äôs a good activity for him. when it comes to activity it‚Äôs not really the end result or product that matters, it‚Äôs the process of doing that‚Äôs important. we all need meaning and purpose and a feeling of accomplishment. maybe if the dishwasher is locked you could have another dish related activity like sorting silverware or putting away clean items sitting out. it doesn‚Äôt hurt to make up stuff to do and someone living with dementia will often happily do the same thing again and again.sorry i don‚Äôt have any suggestions, just wanted to say i‚Äôm glad i‚Äôm not the only one dealing with dirty dishes being put back in cabinets.as his memory declines he will rely more and more on habits. his executive function is not able to analyze clean/dirty‚Ä¶, but his habit memory will allow him to do some things (load or unload) because the brain stores these habits in a different place. keeping these habits will help him be more independent as time passes. you may have to watch him or create times where he does his job while supervised. for his sake keep him helping. you want to protect his self worth and foster his need to be needed as long as possible. be thinking now of tasks that he can do, fold towels, sort socks‚Ä¶ down the road. the ability to do things disappears, but the need to be loved and needed stay to the end. i‚Äôm sorry i don‚Äôt have a good suggestion for you. i lost my mother in august to this horrible disease. doing things kept her calm and happy. that‚Äôs why i share this.we have this problem too.  i had a little trouble rolling the lower rack back in so i asked him if he could do that.  half an hour later he had most of the internal parts disassembled and laid out on the floor.i have had to ask him to stop using the washing machine (laundry), dishwasher, coffee maker, telephone, and cords to various devices (lift chair, heating pad, cpap machine).  he can still reheat coffee in the microwave though we've had to replace it once because he melted something mechanical inside it.  the thermostat is always being fiddled with, too.he has the ego of a full grown man with the judgment and common sense of a toddler.  it's very trying.  you really have to watch them as closely as you would watch a 2 year old.my only advice is be as proactive as possible to avoid these situations as best you can. it sucks. my mother will also do these things. so to keep her from putting dirty items in with the cleaned dishwasher i have to put everything up as soon as the cycle finishes. if there's anything dirty in the sink i have to be sure to put it in the dirty dishwasher as soon as i see it or it'll end up back in the cabinet. she also has a bad habit of wanting to use dishwasher pods for the clothes washer and tide pods for the dishes. at a certain point you really have to watch them like a hawk. notes and written instructions only helped at first.agree with lonestar.  i learned to empty dishwasher  asap after it finishes running so it always has dirty dishes in it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/rjwx2i,1

"partner (senior) having difficulty completing tasks. they tried to explain it to me and they said, they will be doing a task but the other part of their brain tells them to go on to a different task. so they don‚Äôt finish the current task and move on to the next. sometimes it feels like they‚Äôre going in a circle. does this sound like alzheimer‚Äôs? his family doctor prescribed donzepil but his heart doctor told him to not take this medication unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary. i haven‚Äôt noticed anything strange yet but it‚Äôs worrisome. and he won‚Äôt go to an actual specialist. :(","it very well could be. i swear the alzheimer's just exacerbated my grandma's adhd.... she's constantly bouncing from one thing to another, and it's like she no longer possesses any ability to ""wait"". as in, will stop herself mid bite, to get up, and turn on an unnecessary light across the room.  another example, is her taking her meds this morning:took meds out of the despenser.walked around the corner to the kitchenput meds in a little bowltook out a wash cloth and laid it on the opposite counter.walked into the livingroom, opened her jewelry drawer, stared at it for about 2 minutesgot a phone call .... she walked back over to her meds.got herself a glass of water.hung up the phone.she walks away from meds, again, to put the phone on the receiver. went into her bedroom.comes back out 2 mins later with a kleenex (there is a whole box by her chair in the living room)lays the tissue out on top of the wash cloth.then pours pulls out of the bowl, divides them into piles before finally taking her meds one little pile at a time.it is very similar to what my husband does, a million half-finished tasks.  also tasks finished but done wrong.  he has put gallons of milk, cans of soda, and now eggs in a freezer instead of the fridge.however, you can't make any conclusions based on one symptom.  if you point out the unfinished tasks and suggest a neurologist could figure out what's going on, would he go for that?if the anti-dementia drug is actually bad for your partner's heart, you sure wouldn't give it unless you actually know what the illness is, right?donepezil is largely ineffective and comes with a number of side effects. ymmv, but i don't recommend it. best bet is getting to a neurologist. there are a number of conditions that cause cognitive symptoms associated with dementia that are potentially reversible (normal pressure hydrocephalus, extreme vitamin deficiency, etc). if the cause is reversible, the earlier you can get to the neurologist the better. outside of that, external memory aides (reminders, checklists, labels, etc) can be very effective at helping persons with dementia stay independent and on-task.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/qsg0wp,1
"my grandmother is 88 years old and lives in her own separate house located on our property. she's been diagnosed with alzheimers about 1 year ago and since then she's been rapidly declining. today she was out with my mother and i got the job to go take a look around her house cause we have the feeling she hasn't been taking her medication (we put her medication in a pill box every day and hand it to her in the morning and she brings us back the empty box in the evening).she has forgotten to take her medication before and then quickly emptied her pill box out and put the pills in a drawer so that we wouldn't tell her off, so i checked there first and there was 1 pill. i moved some papers aside and there was a whole cup full of what mustve been 30+pills. i was sorta shocked.i decided to keep looking around and when i checked her pantry my heart sank. i found all kinds of medications tucked away between kitchen towels and food. 3 boxes of aspirin, imodium, codeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracodine, boxes of her blood pressure medication.. i don't know how she got them  cause they're not expired so they can't be that old. i left everything the way i found it and i guess we'll just tell her doctor about this. it makes me wonder if she can be trusted to live on her own anymore and if maybe it's time for her to go to a nursing home. moving into our house isn't really an option, this situation is already extremely stressful at times. is this a common thing with alzheimers? how do you make someone take their medicine when they just lie about it? we've tried to make her take it while we're standing there but then she gets offended and says we act as if she's a child.","if she absolutely refuses to take meds in front of you you may have to trick her by lying about what it is or hiding it in her food. confirming its ok to do this with pharmacist first, like putting it with hot food or crushing it or whatever, or finding different forms of the same med that might be easier to take or hide in their food. but because of the volume of hidden meds.. i don't actually think she could be left alone unless someone is willing to supervise her meds taking. a thing i found recently is it can make a difference who asks her to take the meds or eat the med spiked foods. like a grandchild or a sweet relative who they don't associate with having authority. then they might be less likely to get defensive, and feel more like they are they are being nice to that person, or doing them a favor.my mom broke one of those expensive timed pill delivery machines because... who knows?  we just try to get her to take them now in front of us.  but the doctor has said this may be the price of living at home.i think you have tobe  open and honest and let you know that you know she has not been taking her meds. she has to take them in front of you. dementia patients will often lie and say they did. you have to watch and be prepared to have her open her mouth to check. unfortunately, they often try to hide in their cheeks ect. if she knows the consequence is either she goes to a care home or stays and takes pills she should comply. once she is on her medications properly, some of her behaviours may settle down. ultimately, she will need a carehome. dementia patients usually get very defensive. be prepared to be tough and have a plan with your mom. it may take a couple of conversations.also the dr needs to be aware and i hope she has had mini mental exams that prove she can no longer look after herself. also a personal or advance directive, placing your mom as her decision maker. good luckthis may indeed be a sign that it's time for her to go to assisted living.   is your grandmother still safe to be around a stove, for instance?  are you certain that she will remember to turn off things that she turns on?   can she scald herself by leaving a hot tap on?  one of the many sucky things about alzheimers is that patients do get too sick to be cared for in any but the most wealthy (in time or money) families.   there is no shame in realizing that your grandmother can no longer be safe in a separate house.my mother, also, started refusing pills.   we talked to her doctor and determined which of her pills were necessary for her immediate comfort and which were not -- for instance, her  antidepressant versus her weekly fosamax for bone density.  some of the drugs she was taking were to ward off long-term problems, which made sense as long as she was willing to take medications.right now, i think she's only taking an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic to improve her mood.   both of those can be ordered in a sprinkled form that can be sprinkled over ice cream/pudding/whatever.she should not be living alone any more.  she can‚Äôt handle everyday tasks and may put herself a n dangerous situations. if you can‚Äôt have caregivers with her at all times, then she should be in a home.can always lie and say the doctor said if she won't take the pills in front of you that he won't let her live alone anymore. but you're probably right that it isn't long before she needs 24 hour supervision.i find a pill hidden in a chocolate candy goes down quick.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/q9xnxy,1

(see: insulin resistance of the brain)- make hybrid strain teas and consume orally. yes on thc/cbd combo. if the thc is not compatible with patient then reduce and increase gradually. (sativa/sativa hybrid for am; indica/indica hybrid for pm)- eat loads of fat and micronutrients. (see: keto, paleo, & mediterranean food collections)- also take a look at fodmap lists to see if elimination of particular food may help with gastro issues (that often get the ibs hand wave diagnosis)- use vitamins and supplements because old digestive systems have reduced ability to absorb nutrients from foodif you got a rx from the neurologist for donepezil; take note/read about what are acytel cholinesterase inhibitors. cannabis has those properties and more. generally, the majority of neurologist (and in particular, all of the one's i met) do not know that 3 square meals a day helps the brain tremendously; most do not even mention diabetes type 3 because they are too busy talking about the cult of alzheimer's and making to their next patient on time, about 12 minutes later.don't forget to patient's consumption of any substance with sugar beyond a glass a whole fat milk (what's that about 6-7 gm?). restrict all fruits too and watch for improvements in behavior and ability to eat. if restricting all sugars and fruits does not yield the results you seek in 30-45 days then dementia is less likely due to an insulin resistance root cause.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/o7x37c,1

that is a unique individual. take this as an opportunity to reflect on what makes life worth it for you and update living wills and durable power of attorney for health care for yourselves.my one thought on mil is could she be depressed (often accompanies diabetes and cognitive decline).  ask md to evaluate or find a gerontologist.put a dog tag on her key chain with name, address and your phone number for when she gets lost wandering.  otherwise, now is the time to stop trying to make her take care of herself.sounds like my elderly parent (sits all day all alone, watching tv and eats food that is not healthy).you can lead a horse to water‚Ä¶we just do what we can but if the person will not change, it‚Äôs necessary to just accept that.  fighting with an elderly person who is deteriorating is worse than simply being with an elderly person who is deteriorating.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/uof21h,1

"hi everyone, i've seen a few posts about ageing parents and dehydration and would love to get your thoughts on the situation with my dad - mid 70s, who was recently hospitalised with severe dehydration, after a serious of utis had knocked him off his feet.thinking about how to get him to drink more...i've read through other posts which talk about stressing the importance of hydration, and also making sure that the water is accessible (easy-to-open bottles, right temperature, etc.)the thing is that my dad has issues with his prostate too and he has said that he doesn't want to drink too much because between that, his prostate and other issues like arthritis and general ageing-related aches and pains, he'll never get a good night's sleep i.e. he doesn't want to have to get up to go to the loo.i'm considering suggesting a urine bottle.  but am very reluctant to do so because i worry that i may offend him greatly, and he may consider it a sort of attack on his dignity.  i know this because his mobility is not that great over more than a couple of dozen meters, and one time i suggested we get him a wheelchair at the airport, he did not take the suggestion kindly.  sorry for the long-winded way of asking the question: is a urine bottle suggestion for someone who can walk to the loo a worthwhile proposal, or can it only be viewed as humiliating in this context?","the nurse suggested liquid iv ‚Äî you add a packet to a bottle of water and it triples the hydrating impact (like gatorade or pedialyte, only more so).  available at target or costco.  my mil loved the flavor.one possible solution is that he hydrate early in the day, that way it‚Äôs not going to bother him as much overnight. a small amount of liquids at dinner, but mostly hydrate by noon-2pm.i've more than doubled my daily fluid intake.   at first, i had to go to the bathroom as much as 5x / night (more typically 3x).    however, now, its settled down and i'm going once a night.  by urine bottle, do you mean like this:  [or [i suggest the first one, or a commode chair or something like this:[i also recommend that your dad decide.  what is his main goal?  staying in his own home?  living independently?   dehydration, chronic uti and possible kidney infections won't help him achieve those goals.at least, that is the sort of discussion that helps reach my momgood luck!what about a condom cath at night? you roll it on like a condom and it drains your pee to a bag so you aren‚Äôt wetting your underwear and you don‚Äôt have to get up.

dentist wants to pull all mom's remaining teeth for dentures because she has so many cavities.  oral surgeon disagrees & says she will just lose the dentures.  anyone have experience with dentures for older parent w/memory issues?,"sort of, my dad died before his teeth were ready which sounds so weird written out lol. but if it were up to me, so long as the parent is physically comfortable and able to eat, who cares if they're riddled with cavities. anesthesia with dementia is bad. change, with dementia is bad. i'd worry about the whole new hygiene routine too, plus can they distinguish between the discomfort of adjusting to dentures vs badly fitting genuinely painful dentures?that sounds like it would be quite traumatic to have all remaining teeth pulled. i guess it mostly depends on her level of discomfort. what does it look like cost wise to get the teeth removed vs repaired? is there risk of infection, effects of teeth removal- like weight loss or dehydration from being in pain, etc., is she in a facility or has home care? older people heal more slowly, so would the pain of this be worth the time remaining in her life based on historical family life expectancy? are these cavities the result of not having regular dental care for a long time, and is this a new dentist for her? i tend to side with the oral surgeon, and give the dentist less credibility if they are newer to her healthcare circle.you also have to realize with dementia, once the dentures go in she may not ever let you take them out again to clean them, nevermind simply losing them (which is also likely). there's been many a horror story of infected abscesses forming in the mouths of dementia patients because they won't let their caregiver remove the dentures for any reason at all. their gums turn into a fetid and shredded looking mess. that is much worse than a few cavities. and if she is too weak to fight you on that she may be too weak to have her teeth pulled and then sit for the denture mold to set. unless a specific tooth has a high likelihood of abscessing, maybe have that one pulled but leave the rest and forget the dentures idea. a lot of dentist like to money grab and come up with reasons to do unnecessary work. for example, when i was 20, the dentist i went to at the time was absolutely 10000% adamant i needed a tooth pulled because of a black spec on the x ray. she insisted it was rotted on the inside. this is a tooth that never gave me any problems or pains and looked perfectly healthy. she was so goddamn insistent that i decided to get a second opinion. the second dentist confirmed the tooth was perfectly healthy and the black spec was dust or debris caught on the x ray. his x ray was clear. he called the first one a lunatic. she just liked to pull teeth for the cash even if it was totally unethical and veering into malpractice. she was not shy about bullying people into getting her way. just because they're a dentist doesn't necessarily mean they're a good one or good for what a dementia patient needs.i went through this last year with my mother, had all of her remaining teeth pulled by an oral surgeon with local anesthesia.  all of the teeth were rotten, and several of the missing teeth had actually broken off at the gum line so there was some excavation involved.  considering all that was involved it was surprisingly fast and non-traumatic, and once her mouth healed she was a lot more comfortable.  for a while my mom thought she wanted dentures, mostly for vanity, but she's forgotten about that now.  i was anti-denture for the reasons others have stated- she's likely to either misplace them, or just never wear them.  she's in a snf and the dietetics people have been more than happy to accommodate her toothless state.  she has no problem eating most food.so i'd say that if your mom's not in pain, keep on keeping on, but if she is, filling/pulling teeth might not be as bad as it seems.  but dentures probably aren't necessary.my 91 year old mom had a partial. we found it in her bed, on a shelf in her living room, not always where it belonged because she'd absent-mindedly take it out and set it down or forget to take it out at night and then lose it in the bedding. we were concerned she'd choke on it so we had to add it to her care plan and pay extra for someone to watch it. however, she needed it to eat, so we hung in there with it. best wishes to you as you work your way through this one!",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/taonq1,1
"i have a widower father who is mobility-impaired.  he has 24/7 caregivers who stay with him and help him.  he is almost 80 and in very poor health.every day is the same: he sits in a recliner all day long, is wheeled to the kitchen table for meals, is wheeled back to the recliner, and then is wheeled to his bedroom.  he walks just a few feet per day and goes outside only once every few weeks.he has vitamin d deficiency and i would think that sitting all day long would not be good for him.  he‚Äôs definitely put on some weight.  surely going outside and even waking around the yard or even just sitting in the sun for 15 minutes would help.i ask him if he wants to go outside or go anywhere and he doesn‚Äôt want to.  would you let this continue?  or would you force him to walk some (he can, with a walker) and force him to go outside?thanks.","as an introvert and mobility impaired person, give him reasons to go outside, don't give him just a vague question.  concrete ideas and what they'd do for him would be best.  make it fun and try to get him to *want*  to do it.  forcing him to do it will just make him resent it and do it less.if he likes to read, ask if he'd like to go to a bookstore to get new books or if he'd like to read out there.  if he likes shows, etc, see if he'd like to listen to the radio or music or even get a small portable tv for out there.  if he likes certain foods or beverages, ask him if he wants to go pick up the food rather than getting delivery, or find food you can't get delivered, like fancy coffee or his favorite supermarket stuff.  put a table outside so he can occasionally eat out there.  make a point of keeping him company out there for meals.when you go outside, ask him to join you for simple errands, etc., and let him take advantage of them.  think of things you wouldn't do yourself.  find an old school barber shop and get him a straight-razor shave, make sure he has shoes and socks he really likes.maybe a physical therapist could assess how much he can really move, and if getting him to walk around is safe or even possible. if he falls, will the caregivers be able to lift him back up?my mom thought my dad needed to move more, but he really wasn't capable of it at that point and just kept getting hurt, until he got to the point where he couldn't stand or even move himself in bed, which made caring for him more complicated.vitamin d supplements would be important to use if he refuses to go in the sun.oh man - i went through this with my mother.  she literally just sat in ""her chair"" and watched tv all day.  she would fall asleep on and off throughout the day and then not be able to sleep at night.  she just rejected anything and everything  suggested.  she was just done.  i'm 200+ miles away so it was left to my father and brother to deal with her and i had several suggestions to which nothing was done.  the one i think that could help is to see if your father is eligible for in-home pt or anything similar.  this way someone would be helping him to exercise, it would be someone new to interact with and it's much harder for them to lash out at a non-family person.  i wish they would have tried it with my mother but no one was willing to take it on and i was pushed out of her care decisions.  i think it would have added to her life and would have made her wake/sleep cycle more even.  i tried!  i wish you luck.my dad is the same and his physical therapist gave him a ‚Äúprescription‚Äù to get out of the chair after an hour of sitting and to walk around.  i am not sure if he is doing it.  i am a person who works out a lot and i strength train, as such my parents tune out my concerns about his lack of physical activity because they think i am not normal.  i worry about him all the time.could he possibly be depressed?you said your dad is in very poor health. i know you would like him to get up and move around, but he‚Äôs probably in a lot of pain. walking more than a few feet is also exhausting. his balance is probably way off, too. if he falls and breaks something you will have a whole new set of problems. take him for short rides to get him out of the house.i'd ask him to look at something outside that you need help with. like maybe how to fix a thing or does this tree look dead ...make him feel like you need his help ‚ù§things to consider. i would offer dont force him in anything. what kind of shape is he in mentally and physically. does he have dementia or alzheimers or parkinsons? does he suffer from weakness or balance issues? maybe he 'can' walk a bit but its uncomfortable physically or mentally. maybe he does need a reason to go on the patio. try music. nothing reached my dad like playing his music. take him to sit on the patio and listen to his fav music. ask him questions. be gentle if he cant remember. get him a pair of wraparound uv shades. elderly can be extra sensitive to sunlight. he should walk on smooth even surfaces so be careful. when it gets warmer even sitting out in the cool of the evening. string some party lights, not too bright though. he may or may not want to do alot of walking, esp if he hasnt walked much for awhile. take him for a ride in the car. drive him by places he used to go. maybe theres a new store or restaurant. just getting out is fun.talk to him and see what he says. ask how he feels about walking, about say, going out to eat. my mom the year before she passed was easing into dementia. she didnt want to go out or be around people. my dad on the other hand didnt have a problem being around people. i think the main thing is to look at this from his eyes. try and figure out what hes thinking and why. even just a bit of insight goes a long way. for example, my dad held it all inside and never told anyone anything. i know he had his struggles but never let anyone in. there may be communication issues, understanding issues. consider talking with his doctor/neurologist. maybe they can assess him and suggest to him it would be good to get a little walk and outdoors. the fresh air would be great. lead him, carrot no stick. make it easily accessible, make it fun and be with him. maybe if he sees he likes sitting on the patio he will do so with his caregivers.  one more idea to get him engaged. see if he will tell you stories of his life and of the family. you can record it or take notes. there are several speech to text and record programs available.  check and see if he has old photos tucked away in the attic or a closet. go through those with him and see what he remembers of who they are etc and make notes.  there are probably alot of old memories he has forgotten he has tucked away. you could make it a weekly or every few days thing. make it a regular at any rate. no problem if he doesnt remember some things.after i moved back home i wanted to save the family stories, neither of my folks were interested. before she passed mom finally told me a few stories and it was so interesting. dad told a few to my bro on skype. interesting the things i was just finding out after 64 years.  then after dad passed i found so many things from their young days and many old photos. many of the people in them i didnt know. many of the memories would have been neat to talk with my folks about. their hopes and dreams. how they dealt with life. i think that for some the elder years they feel like life is done and theyre just waiting. they've forgotten so much of what theyve been through, their victories, their memories. going through those keepsakes reminds em. anyway, novel done.  best of everything for you two, take care.best of luck and hope this helps.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/t4ixb5,1

and there's so much....  luckily, i can fit into most of them, but our styles just don't match...  and it's all just horribly sad.not to be morbid, but you will eventually have to close down her home. if there is no use, no fond memories, no point at all to the clothing now or in any foreseeable future, it's better to do it now. source: had to clear out my parents' home after both passed. i'm not sure which was more traumatic: sitting hospice, or clearing out the mountain of stuff‚Äîwith their senior complex breathing down my neck to move faster, and no place accepting donations because covid had just rolled in.i don't think there's an ethical problem but would suggest that if there are a few pieces that might elicit a positive emotional response - something she used to wear all the time when she was younger, her ""favorite"" purse, your dad's favorite sweater (i'm assuming he's gone) - just keep them. it doesn't hurt anything. you can weed out 90% of it and get her more room.to be bluntly honest, you're going to do it now or do it later after she either passes away or has to move. if it makes her life better to do it now, do it now. if it makes her life worse, do it later.i did exactly that, and she fought me but we did it together. it took many attempts at suggesting we do it before she finally gave in. i had her sit on the bed and try on clothes that i thought were too big, asked about things that seemed way out of style or not her style, asked about clothes that i knew she liked but were stained or torn. i made a pile to keep, a pile to donate, and a pile to throw away. we did clothes, shoes, handbags, underwear, all of it. many of her shoes and coats were mildewed. most of these i threw away, not worth trying to clean. we also got rid of all of her heels or any clothing that she can‚Äôt function in anymore. i will admit that some things ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù made into the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù pile. i will also admit that the donation pile is still sitting in my office, nine months later (*yeesh*) for me to go through. some of them i think might pull in some decent money from a consignment shop, but i need to launder them and really look at them in good light. there were a few items she wanted to keep ‚Äújust in case‚Äù, for sentimental reasons really, and i let her keep those, of course.it‚Äôs not an ethics question, it‚Äôs a relationship question. if you can get her on board, then do it. if she‚Äôs going to hate you for it, don‚Äôt do it unless you absolutely have to. if it‚Äôs going to be a battle, pick your battles.i'm probably repeating a lot of what's been said already, but if she's truly not up for helping with decision making, quietly go about it with her best interests in mind. what would she wish to keep, what would still fit her, etc. and then donate the rest to a cause she would have loved.since you mentioned the ethics of it, your mention that the clothes are taking up a majority of her bedroom space, that‚Äôs your justification right there. ultimately, having all that stuff is potentially going to be overwhelming for her sooner or later. and if it isn‚Äôt overwhelming for her, it surely will be for you when the time comes to clear it all out.my dad is early stages dementia - we had a similar situation with disposing of his huge book collection (especially after a stack of art books toppled on him and trapped him).we are a very ethics-conscious family, so this experience did test all of us. ultimately, he wasn't dead yet, they are his belongings, we aren't entitled to it. but he and my brother came to an arrangement where my brother would help him reduce his book collection and ensure the valuable and sentimental ones stayed. the unethical bit was that dad didn't realize that he had thousandsssss of cheap books that could be donated. basically we weighed his safety against his judgement, and safety won. i still feel icky about it, but the reality is is that dad will eventually go into assisted living, and his kids will be the one paying for storage.my brother would sprinkle books to dad and ask him to pick and choose, small bits at a time. we catalogued each book and ensured that if something was misdonated, we knew which ones could easily be re-ordered. we hired some dude from india to create a python script that somehow tagged all the valuable ones, which were kept. no books are being sold as of yet. if dad ever comes on board with that idea, the money would be cycled back to his care.be careful about what you're donating though. my brother accidentally donated a 10,000 dollar book to goodwill. $10,000. yes, you heard right. never found it. gowns, silks, those might be quite valuable.unless she's a hoarder, she may respond positively to a downsizing: ""sure mum, you need some clothes, but do you really need 20+ light jackets with buttons you can't close? why not keep the nicest 5?"" (mine does, with some persuasion).she's a dependent. if you have a child, it's perfectly fine to get rid of clothes no longer being worn. it's no different for a dependent parent.i think it‚Äôs ethical. in fact, i would characterize it as a duty. and if you have any sentimental feeling toward any of i,t just take photos of anything like that before you give it away.senior centers here have used clothes stores to raise money  i would not throw her clothes away specifically. they  don‚Äôt make things the way they used to and so donation , while a pain in the-  seems better for clothes up to the 90‚Äôish",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/sjtlpx,1
what struggles do you notice with your parents/patients regarding medication? do you always have to assist them with medication intake?,"they miss it or double take it. i had to hid them but they found it and double took. bp medicine psi got so low had to go to hospital.it's hard.at age 90, my good friend got her medications delivered from the pharmacy in daily pill packets.  this allowed her to know if the pills were for today.  another friend, younger but with dementia, had a service that stopped in twice a day to see she took her medications.  neither my mom nor my mother in law can accurately take their meds.  fortunately, my dad and father in law have taken it over, but i am watching for the day that no longer works.i've got little dishes for morning and evening. they are two different colors. like soy sauce serving dishes or catsup-for-fries size. i parcel out a day's worth late at night. she takes the morning dish when she gets up, and flips the dish upside down. she takes the evening one going to bed, flips upside down. i can tell at a glance whether she's taken each set on time. she gets to retain some agency in taking meds.obviously she's still able to retain some awareness, and take only one dish at a time. adjust as needed.alternative: a big wall calendar. put doses in little zip-loc bags. (search for ""pill dose bags"" on amazon to see. can also be had at pharmacies.) tape each dose to a day on the calendar.hide the bottles, or keep out of sight.get a medication dispenser. google it. it screams an alarm and dispenses meds like a pet food dispenser. also ask his pcp what meds can be stopped. many can.we use a pillbox with my mil and that helps her organize and remember her medication. in addition, i also developed an app to help her mark off whether she took her medication (i.e. fully taken, partially taken, not taken). if it helps, you can try it out (it's free) - [meetcarederly.com](",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/sivuw4,1
"hi all. thanks for a great sub. i've gotten so many great ideas for help with my elderly father with mobility and cognitive issues stay independent/get help. i live out of state.**question**:  currently my father gets meals on wheels delivered, but he won't eat the dinners because many of the meals are not food he eats (pork, shrimp, etc). he's losing weight and i'm worried about him. he does go to the grocery sometimes, but it's difficult for him to get food he likes because of mobility problems. he does cook for himself, but not very often. my late mom cooked for him during their 40-year marriage. my retired cousin (60f) was raised by my dad and says she'd love to come one day a week and cook a couple of meals for him. he likes her cooking.  she says she doesn't want any money, but i'd like to pay her something.  what do you think is reasonable or appropriate?  (she lives in a mcol city and doesn't drive, so i would pay for her uber/lyft of ~$25 as well.) i was thinking $30 and paying for the grocery supplies, but i wonder if that's too little or too much?  thanks for your help! (i'm not looking for other ideas about how to get food to dad.  we've tried grocery delivery service and door dash, but dad really only likes to eat when its a home cooked meal)","i guess it depends on what you can afford. $30 isn‚Äôt too much, but you know what, i‚Äôd just insist on paying for the groceries and the cab.  i say this because she was raised by him and is doing it out of love.is it possible that your father isn‚Äôt dissatisfied with the meals on wheels, door dash etc but is really terribly lonely and not accustomed to eating alone? your cousin will be providing a much needed service and paying for her transportation, food ingredients and then some is a great idea. make sure that she knows how important it is to sit down and eat with your  father. if he can join a senior center and eat his main meal there on weekdays he could benefit from the socialization as well as the nutrition.i'd double that or 30 plus an gift card. will he eat frozen meals? there a boatload of different types at the store. instacart him enough each week to make up for what she doen't make.not an answer to your question, but does he have a big freezer? i was at my dad's place a few weeks ago, cooked an enormous quantity of food he likes, and then vacuum sealed it all and froze it. it's good for about 2 years that way. he can't cook at all, i mean, not one bit, but he is able to reheat things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/s8wjcb,1
"my mil and fil both live with us due to a number of bad financial decisions and their house was practically falling down around them.  they have a hard time (well, i should say my mil) letting go and accepting help.  we wanted to get someone to come in and help with laundry but they said no, we can do it.  a year has gone by and they have done like one load a week of essentials.  we discover they have scads of laundry piled up, so much so that i started doing it sunday and i am only halfway done.  i went and bought bins and vacuum bags because, to me, if you haven't used it in a year, you might as well pack it up (i would give it away but....baby steps).  my fil says, we can just leave it in the laundry room (um, nope) and my mil says, i don't want to pack them, they will get wrinkled.  i have a low tolerance for nonsense so if by the time i am finished with the laundry and they don't have a solution to their own problem, i am going to pack them and put them in the basement (obviously they will never know, they sat in a dirty pile for a year). my question is, does anyone else have issues like this with their parents or in-laws?  it's like they can't accept that they can no longer do what they could and they are too proud to ask for help. it is quite frustrating!","i would imagine you have lots and lots of company.  they will have an answer for every objection.  i have just learned to not lie down in front of that train.  i do a lot of maneuvers to let them save face.  you‚Äôre better than i am; i would have packed up all the laundry and taken it to one of those wash and fold places when they weren‚Äôt looking.i hesitate to admit this but... i'm not always honest with my mother.  when i find that my mother has 5 of the same shirt (she does, or rather, did), i'll give 3 of them away without telling her.  she doesn't notice.  when it gets near the hoarding stage, they don't actually know what they have. and limiting them to what's manageable might in fact be merciful.please note it's been hard for me to get to this stage.  i try to be  honest in general... but white lies might be permissible in this extreme situation, where you're dealing with someone who isn't really playing with a completely full deck.so... i think putting things in the basement is more than reasonable.separately -- if you ever do get them to a ""completely clean"" state (and yes, it's going to have to be you or someone else who does it, they never will), you're going to have to put your foot down and set some rules.* they must do a load of laundry every day* fold it or hang it while watching tv in the evening* no laundry anywhere except the hamper... anything that doesn't fit in the hamper gets put in the ""donate"" box.if you don't set rules for them (and this is your house, right?), they will immediately go back to their old habits.(trying to channel them for a minute: they're in a somewhat strange environment, it's hard for them to face the bad financial decisions they made, they're a little depressed, it's hard for them to get motivated to deal with anything let alone their laundry.  by the way, have they been filing their taxes?)one last suggestion: take a photo of the piles of dirty laundry at its messiest.  if they're anything like my mother, **they won't remember** how bad it got, because after all, they're in denial about it now.  they don't see it.  (there's an annoying commercial out there now about being ""nose-blind"" to bad odors -- they're ""blind"" to the piles.)you may need that photo as evidence to remind them if/when they start to backslide again.  your house, your rules.i solved this by hiring a house cleaning company to come in once a month. they're paid a bit extra to do the laundry and change sheets, whilst my pops sleeps in his lounger. he'd say the same thing as your folks (yes, in principle they can do it, but they are not, in fact, doing it) for ages until his place got so bad i couldn't stay there anymore during visits. even then, every visit was spent cleaning and organizing. now i just organize, ha.edit - just to add, i did this while my sibling, who also apparently hates cleaning from the looks of things, was staying with him. she would have had to argue that she would keep the place clean, and then actually do it, so she said nothing and just lets them in when they come by.they are in your house. they can‚Äôt tell you that you can‚Äôt hire someone to do laundry. hire someone and have them do all the laundry. i also agree the stuff from that pile can be put in the basement because presumably all those clothes can‚Äôt fit in their closet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/s7plm6,1

""well, whatever you want, i'll be happy with..."". it all drives me batty. i've found the easiest way to get around it all is to assume they're asking because they want it, and then be direct. ""mom, i don't want soda, but let me get you some."" or ""i don't want soda, but i'm going to have water. do you want some soda now?"".  or even ""hey, mom, do you want soda? you keep asking me about it. if you don't want it, why don't we talk about something else?""you might want to look at low context/ high context cultures and styles:maybe a different situation...my mother (88) is doing that too but i think it's partly because she's embarrassed to be asking for something for herself.  she needs a lot of help (in a wheelchair, some dementia).i'll say, ""time for your lunch"" and she'll reply, ""if you want...""no, it's not what **i** want, that's not why we're doing this, but she's losing so much control over what she does, it's hard for her to say ""thank you"" because that would be admitting that we're doing stuff for her and that would be admitting that she needs us to do everything for her.like i said, this may not be your situation.my mom is 66 and im 37 and she does the same shit to my dad, who is 77. she tried it on me a few times and i checked her right away. i don't have patience for anymore nonsense. what did it for me is when i would coupon and i always had frozen yogurt coupons. i would clearly ask what flavor and she would say ""vanilla but if they don't have it, get whatever"". and as soon as i did that, she would bitch up and down about vanilla. did this to my dad as well. i let her have it and when she kept doing it to my dad, i stopped buying her yogurt and other stuff all together. i'm married with kids of my own and i don't have time for it. i see why her and my dad never lasted. call me petty but thats my experience.  and she never knows what she wants to eat. you can give her all.the time in the world and it's always , ""idk what i have a taste for"", so.now she gets whatever i give her or she doesn't eat.this sounds culturalnot generational.this is my mom too. ‚Äúis that all the sauce you‚Äôre putting on my pizza? is there more sauce? will it be enough sauce?‚Äù mom, just say ‚Äúi‚Äôd like some more sauce on my pizza‚Äù please don‚Äôt make me play guessing games! she‚Äôs starting to lose her memory a little too so i think it‚Äôs partly that she can‚Äôt find the right words to say what she needs to say directly. that could be the case with your mil too.i can't speak for your mother but for me, growing up it was occasionally very scary to be direct or say what you want or meant, so trying to pack it all in as something the other person wants or allows became a way of speaking or attempting politeness.i don't get flustered, or start screaming or anything tho.my mom was born in 1942. she was not very good about directly saying she wanted or needed things. i think her needs and wants were always supposed to take a backseat to her husband and kids for her generation and culture.i don't think she expected people to read her mind and if she wanted a food or drink she would probably get them. if you asked what restaurant she wanted to eat at or what she wanted to do for her birthday she would not tell you though.my mom does this (except for the yelling part) but she‚Äôs in her mid 80s. my sisters and i are in our 60s and can be pretty assertive. maybe because we all worked outside of the home and learned to be more direct despite our southern culture? with my mom i ask her directly if she wants x. mom: do you want to go to walmart? me: do you want to go? perhaps replying to your mother‚Äôs question with a question will help her get out of the passive cycle.omg, you've just described my mother. she's in her 80's, does exactly this. infuriating. she's been doing it forever, to the point that it became a family joke. it's less fun now.it's helpful to know i'm not alone.i tend to respond like the previous redditor: no, mom, i don't want any \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. would you like me to get you some? if she says no, i'll move on to something else. it's manipulative behavior, and takes two to play.i have a problem with that hypothesis. i think it's more of...a. the way that, for several thousand years, women have been conditioned to be subservient. b. it's a control issue. she gives you control when you fulfill her needs. both things could dependent on each other. please knock off the ageist crap. jfcthat may be my mother, who is 92. i'm not quite 70. i hope i never treat anyone that way.omg, this is my mil.  we say we are going to go to dinner, we ask her where she wants to go because we hope it will eliminate 5 minutes of ""do you want to go to cracker barrel?""

"we moved in with my father to help him, but a couple of months ago, we noticed he stopped washing his hands after using the bathroom. we struggled for last couple of months on how to address it with him because he's the type who will get angry if you embarrass him. i was able to to tactfully bring it up this past saturday and he pretended to wash his hands the rest of the day by simply running the water for us to hear. as of yesterday and this morning he no longer is even pretending. it's gross and unhealthy not only for him but also for my wife and i. he'll use the bathroom and then plunge his hands right into the ice bin (even though it's automatic in the fridge door), we have to watch everything he touches now. such an awkward situation to be in. i'm curious to know why he doesn't anymore and how to get him to return to the practice of just doing it. we don't think he has dementia yet. ","i'm in a similar situation with my dad who is suffering from dementia. he is beginning now to be unable to handle personal care very well. and, trust me, that is going to be a serious issue for both of us. i don't have a good solution because my dad is also likely to react angrily to anyone that contradicts or questions him (similar to your father). and, you're also right that even a topic like this discussed and agreed to will be forgotten and the behavior will return.so, you have to decide if you can work around it or have the stress of constant, repeated confrontations about the issue. (although you might put a sign up in the bathroom similar to restaurants that reminds people to wash their hands.)luckily, my dad and i had a discussion a couple years ago when he told me that i ""was not ever to be his caregiver"". now, because of the pandemic, etc. i have fallen into that role to this point (although he would say otherwise -- ""you're not a caregiver; you're just my son helping me."". but, as we all know, these things never get better -- only worse.so, my solution which is probably not yours, is that i'm now researching professional caregivers and senior facilities (if need be) because i sense my time as ""caregiver"" coming to an end. once he crosses that line where he can no longer handle personal care, he's going to need real help that isn't me.i moved in with my bf's parents to take care of them during the last year of their lives. his mother had dementia and not only stopped washing her hands, but also started eating food from the fridge with her bare hands. like, all the time. she would literally just stand in front of the open fridge dipping her hands into all the foods. i tried to keep an eye on her and anytime i could, i'd make sure she washed her hands and used the proper utensils to eat. but i couldn't watch her every second, and i couldn't get her to remember on her own. it may not work for you, but my solution was to simply buy a cheap used mini fridge and hide it in my room where she didn't even know about it. then i just kept my food separate in there. kept me sane loluse disinfecting hand wipes that are safe for the skin - after the bathroom, before meals, etc.  no fighting, just a quick, thorough wipe and that's it.  place them in different areas of the home so there is always a box or pack of them to quickly use.  you should be able to do it quickly enough that there is no ability to complain before the wipe hits the waste bin.i suspect he no longer knows how.literally wash his hands like you would a child's. they want to act like children, treat them like children.in am.in a similar boat, hand sanitizer is working now. it is not ideal, the automatic soap dispenser did not help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/qpd35i,1

"because the facility where my mother lives has been under a government-required covid closure, i was unable to visit her in person for forty days. finally on october 10 i was permitted to visit because she became eligible for hospice due to weight loss.what i saw was very troubling. she couldn't cut her food, which would explain why, if this was happening for 40 days, she has lost so much weight. i found meals in the refrigerator and freezer that both contained meats that would have been too hard for her to cut into bite size pieces. i promptly requested that from here on the meals be cut up, and lo and behold she's eating them!the covid restrictions had caused the closure of the dining room, so demented residents (and everyone else) were being served meals but not observed eating them. the might have been thrown away, stored away, who knows, but for that length of time no one checked.having dealt with that problem, i've arranged either to be there for every lunch and dinner or to have someone else there to make sure the meals were appropriate for her to eat and that she's eating them.her delusions continue but again, once i've been able to visit, her delusions are not distressing her like they were before. the current one is that she's supposed to host an engagement party with up to 18 people. several days i've gone in before dinner to find she has set place mats and napkins out around the table in anticipation of this large group arriving. i figure it's harmless although there is a certain level of distress when you think you have to get ready for a party. yesterday there were two butter dishes on the table and when i asked why, she said, ""we're having corn on the cob, and everyone will want extra butter."" so at least she thought of that! she starts seroquel this afternoon.last night, she fell and hit her head. she was uninjured on the outside, meaning no cuts, no blood, but on the inside she suffered yet another setback and this time it's serious. a caregiver got her up and dressed for bed, and this morning helped her get dressed and rather than to her walker, moved her into a wheelchair because she continued to report dizziness and balance issues.it appears that going forward my mom will need increased care. she is, in the words of the head nurse, ""in decline"" and it appears to be happening faster and faster. i don't know how much longer i will have her, but as i did with my dad, rather than try to guess how many days, weeks, or months we might have remaining, i will just enjoy them the best i can.","why wouldn't the caregivers notice she hadn't been eating and was losing weight? it seems like they would be trained to recognize what was happening. i imagine it would be something to note on a chart, ""resident not eating meat."" makes me very angry to hear that your mother was half-starving.thanks for the update. shame that there isn‚Äôt enough staff to check whether residents are eating. someone should have figured out that she needed her food cut.the nh my mom was in kept track of how much the residents ate and entered it into a log. i would even have to tell them if i brought her lunch or dinner so they would know why she wasn't eating what they cooked. aides would cut up food and feed a few parents.something is very wrong if they didn't notice this and her weight loss.i am so very sorry.  mom was doing okay (i thought), and then hit a decline.  but stabilized (i thought).  it was one drop after another.  i am very happy you'll get to spend time with her, even like this.  when it gets to be too much, take a break.  vent here if you need/want.  lots of love coming to you from california.nursing / assisted level care was already bad but i think during covid it has downright become inhumane.  hope your mom can improve.you are the face of grace in all of this.  my heart goes out to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/q7m9vc,1

does she not clean the bathroom? this is absolutely not normal behaviordepending on how overweight he is, especially if he has back problems too, he could be having problems reaching to clean himself thoroughly. a comfort height toilet with an elongated bowl could make it easier for him.this sounds like someone is purposely smearing it. could this be a new mental health issue? i have encountered this behavior in a younger person who was mentally ill and it stopped once the mental health issue was treated.maybe he‚Äôs having a hard time wiping. perhaps one of those toilet paper holder sticks might make it easier for him.my father was ocd clean and now he insists on wearing the same dirty clothes.  his hygiene is horrible and he becomes angry when it is brought to his attention. it sounds as if he could have a problem with fecal spraying.  adding more fiber to his diet could possibly help. i eat chia seeds. that have soaked in liquid and a small amount has lots of fiber.i give 89yo dad time to himself on toilet riser, then go back to restroom to help. i warm the baby wipes with hot water from br sink, add a bit of johnson baby soap and squeeze wipe (to distribute soap) so it's not dripping. use my foot to slide the trash can to toilet, then hand him each baby wipe (for him to wipe) until he's clean. i have to remind him not to drop wipe in the water but to use the trash can. then i use aloe vesta foaming cleaner on his wiping hand, he runs it on both hands, then give him on more soapy baby wipe to wipe hands a final time. my dad has dementia we use the soapy baby wipes to cleanse the front side too. usually at depends change. dad needs help with that because he cant reach all the way to feet to slip them on.it is probably dementia. my father stopped caring about any hygiene when it got to a certain point and my mother could no longer get him to bathe anymore. toileting has become a huge struggle. he is now officially in hospice and he refuses to let anyone else help him if he has a bm (which is a mystery because he is not eating much), except my mother but he is too weak to get up, a falls risk and won't let any hired help, help. i would get him checked out by his doctor. my dad's history is diabetes, heart disease and he is also on dialysis... i believe he was diagnosed very late for his vascular dementia/alzheimer's, partly because he has a difficult personality and we believe he was able to hide these issues for very long and because my mom has been in denial for a long time. he has been on a downward slide for a while. is not really verbal, except for one word responses that don't always make sense. i'm also going to guess that if he is unsteady, you need to get him a safety commode (goes over the toilet) with handlebars. it could be that he needs to steady himself and it is making it difficult for him to wipe? also maybe wet wipes (don't flush them down the toilet even if they say they are flushable!) can help him to wipe better, but fewer times if he is having trouble using the bidet.this will seem insane, but can you hide a cam that will let you see whats going on? i know that some elders have a fascination with poop? some forget how to wipe and all. maybe hes just not getting centered over the toilet and its gets on it and then his hands. the other thing to consider is if he doesnt notice and then touches something else or pickshisnose or scratches his eye it could cause other  problems.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/pvfmk9,1

"so today i went to costco and the amount of ""stuff"" i brought home (toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, and tissues) was pretty overwhelming to her.  i found a place to store everything but she felt i was doing too much (she was out of everything).the real ""bridge too far"" was that i bought towels.  i should point out that i'm 50 and i think every towel in the house is my age or older.  who doesn't like nice fluffy white towels?  someone who feels like linens and laundry are her domain, that's who.  they're still in the trunk.  i considered telling her they're my towels but i could tell she was a little upset so i just backed off.as a complete aside, i'm still finding tons of stuff in the house that needs fixing and remediating that.  those of you following the saga will be happy to know the basement dehumidifiers are 100% squared away ;)today it was the p-trap under the guest bathroom sink - it had completely rusted out!  so i went to home depot to buy parts, and came back with a new trap... plus a smoke / co detector for the kitchen (there wasn't one before) as well as a fire extinguisher).  in many ways i feel like i'm here at exactly the right time.  i hope so, anyway.mom was able to remember that her appt with her np is tomorrow and that she should shower in the morning so i'm getting her up at 8:00.  she hasn't showered since i've been here and i've been asking her to please take care of herself.  faced with the idea of an appt. with someone she knows tomorrow, she agreed to shower.  i asked if she felt safe in the shower (i.e. do i need to install grab bars?) and she said yes.  i will probably install grab bars anyway.i talked to a couple of [aging life care experts]( today and it was great - they basically act like a project manager / case manager / focal for your loved one.  it's exactly what we need to let mom continue living independently for as long as she can.the next few days will likely be tough.  tomorrow we'll talk to the np and get a referral to a neuro for the memory issues.  going out really wears mom out, so either today or tomorrow i will re-introduce the concept of getting in-home help, and communicate that i am not leaving until we get some level of care in place.  then i'll stay for a few days to make sure the wheels i set in motion are running as expected, and be able to go home with a clear conscience.thanks all for the support.","with in home help it does a lot of good when the client and the worker both know what is needed and what is expected. your mom needs to know beforehand what she will want to do when the worker comes - hide out in her room, watch tv, chat with the worker or go for a walk. the worker needs to know if she is there to provide companionship or to just clean, or to clean and help organize things. a lot of people don't want someone in because they don't know their role in the situation. talking it through and being clear on expectations is a key to success.sounds like you're getting things kinda under control.  i think this case manager will really help.  don't forget all the finance/organization stuff i had linked to.hah, the towel issue. there's something about that generation and not replacing their linens - threadbare bedding, holey paper-thin towels, and kitchen towels that are half a century old. and they don't get changed/washed as often as they should, either.but it's hard when you want to replace their stuff, even if they're not hoarders. i've stopped insisting on new linens, as long as they're clean. whenever i visit my mum, i feel like i'm trying to get months of laundry done in a week.check in with your local area agency on aging.  my mom got a lot of help through them.  it's not everything, but it is a big worry off my mind.i wonder about a smoke detector in the kitchen, won't it go off all the time during the course of regular kitchen use? i was under the impression that you weren't supposed to have one in the kitchen. (we set ours off about once a month with the cooking we do, and it isn't in the kitchen, just nearby. but our above stove fan isn't that great and i do a lot of high heat cooking.)my mother's smoke detector in her living room gets set off really easily from her regular cooking activities (bad ventilation in general + no fan in kitchen) and then she finds herself climbing up on the couch to reach it to turn it off. which makes me cringe of course that she'll fall, but then again moving the smoke detector at a lower position is also not ideal for detecting fires. we're moving her to a new place soon that will have better ventilation. in conclusion, i might worry that climbing up a step ladder to turn off the smoke alarm once a week could be more dangerous than not having one in the kitchen.my folks are at a point where they should be moving to an independent senior living situation (with assisted living on the horizon), but my 89 yr old stepdad absolutely refuses. this puts my 83 yr old mom in the position of doing everything to care for both of them. in a huge house. with a huge yard and 3 acres. he is no longer driving and hers is becoming questionable. it is really all too much for mom, but she won't leave without him. a couple things that i've been able to do to help them stay at home:i now go shopping with mom a couple times a month. she drives and i get a chance to observe her driving skills. i also help her bag, load and unload the groceries. bigger purchases i make for them on amazon and they reimburse me.  even though there were tears i was able to convince her/them to hire a housekeeper once a month for a deep clean. my brother does the heaviest yard chores and recently washed the exterior windows. mom is still doing the flower beds, but they hired someone to lay barkdust. i try to take her to most doctor appointments so i can hear what they say and then give her advice. despite some chronic conditions she always downplays the severity to the doctor so it's helpful for me to be there. i also talk to her on the phone at least once (sometimes twice, three times) per day. she is forgetting a lot of what i tell her about my schedule day to day, but is able to track very well on theirs. old fashioned calendar on the wall helps the most. op, regarding the towels - can you give them to her as a gift? sometimes people will accept a gift like that instead of thinking it's charity because what they have isn't good enough. just a thought.yes, definitely make sure that the home health aide knows what her responsibilities are and that your mother also understands them.  several years ago my husband hired a home health agency to come in and help his grandmother who lived in another state.  the aide was supposed to do meal prep, light housekeeping, bathing assistance, occasional transportation to doctors appointments and a few other things.  we quickly found out that the only service she was providing was companionship, which is important, but almost nothing else was being done.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/pp4vjs,1
"hi friends.i'm pretty bushwhacked today but got through it.  mom's short term memory is thoroughly shot, i have to keep reminding her (gently) of simple stuff.me: ""i'm heading to home depot""her: ""aren't you going to have lunch?""me: ""we just finished lunch. we had tacos.  you had a banana as well.""her: ""that was a good banana""me: ""glad you enjoyed it, would you like anything else while i'm out?""her: ""aren't you going to have lunch first?""etc.  today i visited with several of the neighbors and got them little gifts to say thank you for their thoughtfulness.  straightened up the basement and worked on getting both dehumidifiers connected directly to the sump pump (bypassing the collector buckets) so they won't need to be emptied any more.  fortunately i'm pretty handy and there's a lot of tools so i'm in good shape there.tomorrow i'm doing a costco run for paper goods and will help mom find a place to store everything.  going to start working with her on getting rid of old stuff (she's not a hoarder, she just hangs on to things for far too long) so we can make room and simplify the house.  getting a fire extinguisher and the wifi-enabled thermostat as well.med appt. is thursday morning, she is remembering to take her pills and seems physically to be doing quite well (mentally she cops to being foggy).  i've asked for referrals to geriatric and neuro as she's just been seeing an np for the last couple of years (nothing against nps, i just want her to have a relationship with a doctor and start going to regular appointments).also working on in-home care tomorrow, i've gotten zero traction from emailing local agencies so i'm going to call them directly.  also going to see what i can find on the [hhs site on aging](thank you all again for your support and feedback.","one thing i could use a bit of advice on:she will not. stop. messing. with the thermostat.  it is driving me nuts.mom is tiny (5'1"", 120 soaking wet).  she gets cold at 74 and swears she can't sleep below 77.  i have intervened several times from letting her put the furnace on to ""warm up the house"".  running the heat in the atl area in september will just bring up the sewer smell from the basement again and make the dehumidifiers work overtime.she is up at least once an hour from 8:30 to 1:30 am ""adjusting the temperature.""  i am a little worried she won't be able to work a nest but i'm hoping my wife and i can monitor it remotely / potentially put it on some [""child settings""]( - the hell of it is, i think she gets some pleasure from setting the temperature in the house.  like constantly.any thoughts?edit: inb4 the ""dummy thermostat"" suggestion.  don't tempt me ;)i think you really should disconnect thevcurrent thermostat but leave it in place so she can mess with it all she wants, and install the smart thermostat with parental controls and maybe even with a box over it to hide it. the need for a semblance of control is very real. sigh. a heated mattress pad helped my mil a lot. i don't know what your dictionary will say. but i urge you to start putting her on waiting lists for places to live with support in your area. the decline can really snowball. can you disconnect the stove and any gas fireplaces etc?about fiddling with the thermostat, suggest finding a device that uses ai (artificial intelligence) that determines the position of the person in a room and adjust the temperature according to the size of the room... in that way, the room maintains the right and comfortable temperature for the person in the room so that one does not need to meddle with the thermostat...",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/pogis1,1
"i honestly think the worst things about this phase of life is the bathroom issues. my elder is mobile enough to make a mess ten times worse with their version of cleaning up. generally grabbing a box of tissues or stuffing a dirty brief or underwear into a urinal ( how?) or using a sock or pillow case. i say repeatedly, if you have any kind of issue please just call me, i will help. and the next thing you know you are, at 2am, in the middle of hurricane ida's rain storm, unable to open the windows for fresh air and lots of mess. the only smart thing i have done is layer the bed in disposable pee pads and when disaster strikes i can fling them off the bed and not have to change the bed in the middle of the night. and that is a pretty good victory, and i learned that from you smart people.","continence issues just don't get talked about enough in my view. so many elderly folks think it is only them. they are ashamed and embarrassed. many reduce their fluid intake in the hope of trying to reduce the problem. feelings of urgency coupled with jelly legs just make the whole thing worse.it may not be an inevitable part of aging but it isn't unusual.  we just don't talk about it. younger folk make jokes about adult 'diapers' which adds to the stigma.i've lost count of the number of folks sitting on urine soaked chairs who will swear blind to me they don't have an issue. underpants stuffed out of sight, urine infections, sores, social avoidance for fear of being caught out or being smelly. the consequences just go on and on.do your pelvic floor exercises people and if it comes your turn, know it isn't uncommon. if you have mental capacity be honest with yourself and seek help in managing the situation.the urine smell at my parent‚Äôs house was unbearable. my dad bought a small plug in air freshener and declared he fixed the problem. ugh!portable commode next to the bed, lined with the disposable bags and preloaded with some of those scented absorbent granules was a big help at night.learn to stack incontinence underpants liners by putting holes in every layer but the bottom most one. you can stack up to five. thank me later.ugh bathroom issues are the worst. one thing i'll say is there might be some signs that an accident is imminent- my grandfather would sometimes randomly get up and start asking to ""go home"" (when we were already there), refusing to accept the obvious reply and getting more and more irritated and aggressive. since his dementia was bad and he had been talking about his mom who had passed away decades ago we assumed he was just confused. after a while i realized that when he asked to ""go home""  he had to go to the bathroom and was trying to be discreet/wanted to go somewhere private and didn't know how to communicate his needs. so when he would start asking to go home i would walk him out the front door and around to the side door by the downstairs bathroom. drastically reduced the number of accidents/diaper changes/soiled sheets; not sure if it applies to your situation but looking for non-obvious signals might helpagree.i agree with dilly\_dolly\_daydream - i think so much of it is tied to shame.  they don't want to wear adult diapers, they don't want assistance toileting, they hate it when they soil themselves.  so they try to cover, with disastrous results.  mom's gotten dehydrated and kidney stones because she limits water intake to limit urinary incontinence to what panty shields can handle.  it was hard enough to convince her to use the shields.  and it must suck to have your private shame known by your children and other caregivers.portable commode? adult diapers? baby wipes (don‚Äôt flush those). there are some overnight potty training tricks for toddlers that might be useful. for example do multiple layers on the bed: waterproof mattress cover, absorbent pads, fitted sheet, absorption pads, and fitted sheet. that way if there‚Äôs an accident in the middle of the night, you don‚Äôt have to put on another fitted sheet since it‚Äôs already underneath.also get a good enzyme-based stain remover so that it breaks down the poop from clothing/sheets. i really like puracy (link below). i don‚Äôt think you need special laundry detergent like for cloth diapers if you use an enzyme-based stain remover. the urinary incontinence i can handle-i dread the day it is fecal incontinence.the disposable chuck pads (pee pads) are wonderful!  we also have a much larger, washable pad that goes under the disposable ones. plus the mattress has a plastic cover, similar to what you'd use for toddlers who wet the bed.we started using [incontinence diapers]( once the messes became too frequent for the hassle of changing pull-up incontinence underwear -- we've used the diapers on both my dad and sister (azlheimer's). also, the [adult-sized wipes]( have been immensely helpful for cleaning up the mess. just remember to throw them in the trash instead of flushing down the toilet!  as for the stink of the wipes and diapers, we use febreeze scented/odor blocking trash bags.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/pgbpcw,1
"my mil(79) is a widow the past 20 years. she still lives alone but we‚Äôre thinking that won‚Äôt last too much longer due to her health decline. every bedroom, closet, pantry, cabinet, drawer is packed to the brim with newspapers, plastic containers, plastic utensils, paper cups, magazines, paper clippings‚Ä¶. her counters and tables are covered in random knickknacks and papers. her floors are clear and clean and her home is kept clean. it‚Äôs just so much junk. last year her water heater leaked and i cleaned out the entire pantry of years worth of papers and plastic containers. it is now refilled to the brim just the way i found it last year. the day after the water heater leaked her deep freezer died. so i had to do the same cleanup in the laundry room. plus empty the freezer of 30 year old thawed food. my so works out of the country most of the year so he wasn‚Äôt able to help. this list goes on and one. yesterday i moved garbage bags and boxes of old newspapers and magazines in order to clear her entryway for emergency purposes. i got her permission to move these things first. but then she panicked and said she had to go through every magazine and newspaper before we recycle anything.  all i was doing was moving them not tossing them. i never mentioned tossing them.i am a very patient person and i can bite my tongue like no other. but inside i‚Äôm angry and frustrated. when she passes it‚Äôs going to be such a huge pain to go through all this junk. i know i should just keep my mouth shut and just keep the floors clear of clutter. anyone else deal with this before?","there‚Äôs a hoarding sub can probably help advise you.fyi:  when she does pass you can rent a large industrial dumpster a lot cheaper than you might think.   as long as you don‚Äôt have to go through the stuff and can just toss it, cleanup will be a pain but probably not as bad as you think.   a weekend of hard work with a little help and most of it can be gone.my grandfather was this way. honestly, i know it's hard but i'd have to suggest keeping on as you have been for now. the way you describe her panic is very common in people with hoarding tendencies, and rationalizing with them won't remove the anxiety they feel at the idea of tossing things. you've done the right thing so far by asking permission to move things. assure her you can be trusted, and you aren't trying to go behind her back to get rid of things that matter to her. respect goes a long way in this situation!the issue may be forced if she becomes unable to live alone. depending on her reasons for hoarding, she may find it easier to let things go if she knows she has to downsize or move into assisted living, etc. if you try to clean it all out now, she may have the mentality that she has the space and it's not hurting anyone, so why bother?if you are in the mood for some dark humour: i often wonder if this is the real reason vikings (and other cultures) came up with the idea of pyre funerals.my mil is a hoarder. when she passes, we plan to just haul everything usable out on the lawn and give it away, then probably rent a construction dumpster and have it emptied several times to get rid of the rest. we can't do anything about her hoarding while she's still in her house.i don't know much about hording, but what if there was suddenly some great charitable need of magazines or plastic containers? what if the boyscouts were doing a magazine recycle drive so they could raise money for something special, or some local orphanage needs lots of plastic containers to use for indoor gardening so the orphans can have more healthy food... something that would tug the heart strings and give her a positive feeling as she gives these items away.   just a thought.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/pdto2j,1

"hey all,my mom has started keeping spoiled food and she yells at me and has a fit when i tell her i'm throwing it out. she has been drinking milk that went sour on 5/9 according to the label (and smell, obviously)...i told her it was expired and she said no it isn't, i just opened it today (5/16) so i showed her the label as said ""yes it is, you're drinking spoiled milk"" and then dumped it out. clearly this wasn't the best tactic on my part and i feel guilty but i don't want her getting sick. she got mad and went back to the tv.would it cause her more distress if i threw things out without her knowledge? i want to keep her in the loop because she is semi-independent but i've been working nights and even though i pay a cna to come a couple times a week to just spend time with her, i'm worried she may eat something moldy eventually if i'm not there. the cna says in her experience elderly people tend to keep old food ""just in case"".another issue is that she will make a dish one day, forget she did, eat something else, then i'll find her cooking that and dish again the next day. i tell her ""you just made that yesterday, why are you making it again"" and she'll just say ""no i didn't"" so then i show her the container from the fridge and she gets frustrated and says ""i never made that"". again, poor tactics on my end but i don't know how else to show her. plus it's a massive waste of food.i know it's my responsibility to monitor this stuff but i need the extra money as a financial stop gap measure until i get back into my professional career. the food waste is one thing, but her getting food poisoning is worse. i know as her primary caretaker i should be on top of this better, and i have been but with this job it's harder. have any of you experienced this food issue?","i regularly clean out my mom's fridge without telling her. to her, everything is ""still good"" even if it's a yogurt that expired months ago or whatever. if your mom is making the same meals over and over and not remembering, i think chances are good that she won't realize if you threw stuff out. maybe start with the most dangerous stuff first, and see if she realizes? trying to rationalize with a person who has dementia about whatever wrong thing they believe won't end well for either party unfortunately. it sucks when we're just trying to help and keep the person healthy and it upsets them, just making the whole job harder. you should probably let go of this idea that she can participate in safety decisions. i know how unnatural it feels to start having to parent your parent. :-(i hope the cna is around while she's cooking? if she's forgetting whole meals i'd be worried about her leaving burners on, leaving food out too long etc. :-\ good luck.yep,  my mom would drink spoiled milk and brown bananas with fruit flies buzzing about.   ""it's still good!"" she would protest.   dementia distorts perceptions of what is safe to eat.    expiration labels might not be understood anymore.   if dementia has destroyed the sense of smell.  then the sniff test to see if something has gone off is impossible to do.i like the word ""nevertheless"".   your mom is screaming at you that the food is no good?  ""i understand you are mad but nevertheless we are throwing out this unsafe food.""  it's weird to parent a parent but you sometimes just have to power through on non-negotiable issues.   i would try and toss stuff out when my mom wasn't looking.oddly, as she advanced in dementia, she decided any foods that were opened were bad or unsafe.  even a fresh bag of cookies i bring by to memory care is rejected after she's had a few of them and then sees the package 10 minutes later.  ""those cookies are  old, i have no idea where they came from.""i don't know how to solve the problem, but offer the thought that it's a very important one. my father at 96 had a variety of physical issues centering on the gi tract, intake and elimination. he lived 1000+ miles away. after mom died, i took on a commuter lifestyle to keep an eye on him in (semi)independent living facility (lots of aids and helpers, but not 24/7 hawk-eyed supervision).as a civil engineer, he had always been fussy to a fault over safety issues. but the kitchen (even microwave, toaster) were a foreign country to him. brainfog made him even more a stranger in a strange land.i'm convinced he left meat lying around for a week+ in the fridge, ate it, got ugly digestive results, skipped a scheduled medical treatment because he felt lousy that day, and that was the start of a cascade of health problems that led to his passing. his passing wasn't a direct result of bad food, but he had little physical resilience by that point, and many other health issues waiting to pounce. each issue would set off another issue, or treatment for one issue would set off another issue. basically like lighting one tiny cherry bomb while standing in a fireworks shed.i'm 33, parenting my dad (76). it does suck, and as someone with no children, it is really hard. i have had to learn that no means no. i throw everything without him looking. if it's when he is awake, i distract him and then throw things away. at one point, he thawed chicken in the fridge and left it there. he literally could not smell that it went bad. you may have to reduce the amount of food stocked in the fridge to avoid the waste, and throw away things in the fridge without her knowledge. depending on how far dementia has progressed, she may not even remember that the fridge used to have more food. lastly, it may be time to turn off the stove. my dad survived on sandwiches until i could afford to have him placed in memory care. he left the stove on one too many times that it was no longer safe.throw it out and replace everything fresh. clean as she is unaware, or distracted. don't ever be forceful, she feels resistance more then ever. your resistance will make her irritable. she doesn't want to be losing so much control. make her feel involved but with simple minded things. and laugh together as often as possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/ur3m63,1

 ,"i think its ok to laugh. humor is the better way instead of being upset since as you know dealing with a loved one with dementia is beyond tough. my uncle has moments of eating things and some things inedible so i have to watch him with things he's tried to eat like napkins,magazine's and bottle caps that i've taken away. once he ate unpopped popcorn kernels lol it didn't hurt him and he seemed to enjoy them.why not laugh? getting through this without a sense of humor would be even harder than it already is. and thanks for the laugh.  my mom was mixing her blueberries into her ratatouille. she offered me some, and i told her i already ate, and she kept on, telling me how good the blueberry ratatouille was. i had to chuckle. hey, as long as she likes it!i found my mother spreading yogurt on a piece of bread, folded it in half and swore she‚Äôd always eaten yogurt sandwiches!üòÜüòÜüòÜthat‚Äôs funny. my grandma does stuff like thislolsad smile.that's gorgeous ‚ò∫Ô∏èthank you for finding and sharing the levity in this moment :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/undn27,1

 ,"there can be a difficult recognizing objects. so it might trigger in her head that it looks like a sink because she hears water.  a bowl may seem like a hat. that is why prompting is necessary at this stage. for instance some don't recognize that the food is in front of them until told it is or helped to start eating.if she is still able to read, you might try posting big (i mean big) signs by the objects you want her to use- we do that with my 89-year-old mil when she stays at our home (like her bedroom, the bathroom, the bathroom sink with instructions to wash hands). it‚Äôs not perfect, but it does help (along with a lot of supervision).mine can‚Äôt figure out where she is supposed to put the toilet paper. she wanted to do laundry and put the soap in the spice rack on the back of the pantry door.your never going to understand how they come up with these things,yeh idk, sorry, that's hard.   maybe put a clear simple picture/diagram of 'handwashing' over the basin?   pictures can help more than signs with words.   my mum often sweeps/rakes the pavement outside her house of leaves - a few weeks i came home & found her out there with a mop.  hmm....unfortunately my grandma has done this a few times too in the past. i can only guess what goes on in her head. so once she finishes going to the toilet, the next logical thing is to wash her hands. however our sink is in a separate room to the toilet and so i assume she sees the bowl and thinks, oh yes basin with water. she probably has forgotten where it is too. nowadays she needs basically 24/7 supervision, so it's not really an occurrence anymore.it can sometimes help to hang signs. i once cared for a woman who saw her walk in shower as a washing machine. flooded the bathroom, then thought the washer was broken and tried to call for repairs. hang signs above the sink, toilet and shower that simply label it and maybe a clip art type picture of each item.i'm not sure what is up with that.  my mom would pretty much stuff the toilet with toilet paper and find something else to wipe herself with - the shower scrubbie, the shower curtain, a towel, whatever was close.  her bathroom hygiene was horrendous.from what i‚Äôve seen with my grandparents this can be understandable. best thing you can do is not freak out and guide them, make a sing-songy response. they can latch on to that panic and get more confused. your grandmother knows that in the bathroom you pee/poo and wash your hands. what she might not be able to do is understand which tools to use and when, so she tries to do it all at once. she knows what she needs to do but not how and that is scary for her so she gets by as best she can. i came downstairs at 3am, my grandfather loved to clean and liked everything tidy. he had the whole microwave in the sink. he needed to clean the inside of the micro wave (he used to wipe it down daily) and the place you clean cookware is in the sink. makes perfect sense! as for the bucket of water; the examples you give involve complex thought, remember the brain is just a wet squishy mass with some chemicals and electricity, even basic things we do are immensely complex functions. your gran may just see the water and be able to connect it to ‚Äúwater washes‚Äù. thinking about water quality and being appropriate just won‚Äôt connect in the same way.i freaked out pretty bad when i saw my uncle doing the same thing and wondered how long he's been doing that. so now i go into the bathroom every time he does to prevent this. its really mind blowing what our loved ones might perceive things from their point of view like my uncle the other day couldn't find the bathroom and almost urinated on the vaccum lol i gotta laugh cause there's still plenty to be sad about.i know its gross and the disease is so ruthless like that. i wish i knew a good solution other than thoroughly clean her hands after every bathroom use or as you feel is needed. have plenty of wetwipes and sanitizer if she doesn't want to wash her hands at the sink. i'm sorry you are dealing with this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/uggxkn,1
"my mother-in-law sometimes gets very anxious and obstinate when we try to give her the meds that will help reduce the episode.  like a catch 22.sometimes she spits out the applesauce or pudding that has the crushed med in it.  i almost wish seroquel came in an injectable for those times..not even sure if that is an option.  anyway, do you guys have any solid tricks to get an angry loved one to take the med that will help?","omg, we had an old cat that wouldn't eat and the vet gave me a gel to rub in his ears once a day.  insisted i wear gloves when administering because it would make me hungry too.  wish i could remember what the med was.  oh well, probably not ethical to give to our loved-older-ones when they pull this. sorry.  i'll just let myself out now.......i usually have the best luck when seroquel is crushed and mixed with strawberry jam. sometimes i place the mixture between two soft cookies (""here's a jam cookie!"") or else spread on toast.take a syringe, put the pill inside, fill up with some water, cover the tip with your finger, and pull the plunger down forcefully so that it shoots back up a bit (without removing it completely) a few times, it dissolves the pill. though i would check with her doctor first to make sure there isn‚Äôt an issue with dissolving for administering it.there is a liquid form that may work better for you.  ask your pharmacist.hmm..we've had luck reserving my mils favorite drink, (grape juice) solely for taking meds and then to finish after the meds are complete. we've also taken to only taking them while standing so as to be able keep her head tilted back. i'll think on this. good luck to youwe had this problem a lot. my dad would either be agitated about something else or in the middle of an episode where he suspected us of poisoning him. we also tried hiding crushed meds, but the problem was that once he was in that state, he wouldn't eat anything we tried to give him.however, he had an insatiable sweet tooth and would eat random brownies that happened to be lying about. these brownies had been made with cbd oil. as long as he didn't connect them to us, he'd eat them, and then he'd calm down, and we could try meds or crushed meds again later.i sympathize. i know that catch 22 well - the very meds that will reduce their paranoia will also trigger it, so you can't get them to take the thing that will get them to behave more rationally. some days my dad just didn't get his meds because pushing would trigger violent episodes, and nothing else worked. other days, we had to drop it initially, but either cbd brownies or waiting until his mood had changed would do the trick.mostly my uncle will take his meds but when he doesn't i use cherry pie filling. the cherries are pitted which is great because i can slip the pills in the cherries to hide them. he doesn't wear his dentures and the pie filling is soft enough for him to swallow without chewing. it is a sticky mess to do this method but worth a shot. sometimes i serve the cherrie pie filling over a bit of ice cream. i hope something works for you and best of luck‚ù§yesterday i threatened my mother with institutionalization and life in a wheelchair. and if worked. it‚Äôs not my nature to be threatening and mean, but it often works with her. maybe because it is her nature to be that way. i‚Äôd much rather have a gentle, loving relationship with her, but she only relates to me as the antagonist.this sounds really frustrating!  so i looked stuff up--seroquel doesn't come in a patch, but it looks like you can get it in gel/cream form and in liquid form (you might have to go to a compounding pharmacy instead of a regular pharmacy to get it in these forms).  some other anti-psychotics do come in patch form.talk to her doctor and/or pharmacist before you crush the pills and stick them in food. some meds have a coating that slowly dissolves over the 12 or 24 hour period.  if you crush and those kinds of meds, then the medication gets released all at once and doesn't work right--she could be overdosed for the first hour and then getting hardly any medication at all for the rest of hours before the next dose.   i'm pretty sure seroquel is one of those. these tips might help.  [   finding a calm and quiet time to take the meds helps because her brain has a much harder time focusing on one thing when a lot if information is coming at her all at once.    it's like when you're driving somewhere you've never been before and traffic is crazy---you have to turn off the radio and tell all your passengers stop talking so you can focus all your attention on driving. putting the pills in a daily pill organizer can help because you don't have medication bottles out.  the pill organizer is one thing, vs. many pill bottles.  it also helps if mil refuses her medication because she thinks she's already taken her pill for the day--the organizer ""tells"" her she hasn't taken monday's pill yet, not you.taking your pills together can help, too.  (if you don't need to take meds, take a tic-tac candy.)   she can see what you are doing, and it reminds her of what she needs to do.   you can follow up with a sweet (or sugar free) snack.does she have a favorite glass/mug she likes to drink out of?  is there a piece of music that she likes and puts her in a good mood?   what time of day is she in the best mood?  morning might be better if she gets agitated in the evening.  check with the doctor to see if she can take the med at the best time of day for her.   does she respond better to one than family member than another?  do some breathing exercises or something calming before you approach her.  (i know it's easier said than done. )  since she's already anxious--if she is interpreting your body language to say there's an unknown danger around her, she's going to want to focus on that and not on taking pills. if she refuses at first, come back in 15 minutes, she might change her mind.people of mil's generation are sometimes more likely to listen to an authority figure.  this video shows how they had a trusted family doctor write a note saying that the patient needed these pills.  does she have a drink that she particularly likes?i move quickly, ""heres a piece of chocolate for you, and a drink, oh here have this (meds), and oh this piece of chocolate is awesome have a bite"". each thing i put in her hand otherwise it gives her time to think about it. i then shift to something happening on tv or outside and slow the patter down until we are quiet visiting again.. so far so good.there are injectable antipsychotics. they give them to non-compliant schizophrenics every few months. not sure if they would be suitable for dementia patients or not!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/ueykew,1

"so, my mom has always really enjoyed hawaiian pizza, blt's, mexican food - and now she doesn't seem to like any of them. she says ""it doesn't taste right"" she, of course, still wants sweets, which, according to the alzheimer's website is normal, but i have to be really careful because she's pre-diabetic.  is this the precursor to her refusing to eat entirely?  she is in stage 6d according to the research i've done.","i would talk to her doctor and weigh the pros and cons: the risk of her becoming diabetic versus her quality of life, enjoying the pleasure of sweet-tasting food.i don't know the answer to your question but a lot of protein shakes taste sweet but are specifically made for diabetics.  like there's glucose control versions of boost and glycerna.  i recommend those.if she gets worse foodwise which i suspect she will, id put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in one meal per day too.  oil is the most calorie dense food i know of with 130 calories per tablespoon.there gets to be a point in life that quality is more important than quantity. let her eat sweets.years before we realized that my mom had alzheimer's,  she stopped being able to taste salt. today, my mother's brain is failing her in so many ways, not being able taste foods properly lines up with all the other cognitive failures she is experiencing.dementia or not...people's taste buds can start to fail/weaken as they get older. taste buds can shrink and become less sensitive, starting even as early as the 40's and 50's. add into that, your sense of smell can weaken as you get older...and your sense of smell can affect your sense of taste. other things like medications and illnesses can make it worse. dementia just messes with all sensory input, in general...which does not help.as some others have mentioned...you can get sweet protein/nutritional supplements that are meant for diabetics. you can also get alternative sweeteners to make the sweet goodies she likes...but makes it less risk for the diabetes.another thing to try...the sweet/salty can be the first to weaken. if they are saying the foods they used to enjoy taste different to them...try strengthening the flavor by adding more spices. also, try alternating between bites of the food and drink.my dad is more recent in his dementia diagnosis, and not a severe decline yet...and i swear he has been salting, peppering, and ranch dressing seasoning everything to death for year. i am constantly having to wipe a layer of salt/pepper off his food table after each meal. and i even season the food really well.my mom found things much spicier as she progressed. she used to like spicy food, but she went down to my spiciness level (i think too much pepper is spicy; forget anything like salsa, even mild; basically, there‚Äôs a joke that ketchup is called ‚Äúnorwegian hot sauce‚Äù and i can kinda see where they‚Äôre coming from‚Ä¶). at least it meant she had a spiciness guide because i could tell what might be spicy for her that normal people wouldn‚Äôt even think of.she had always liked sweets, but that definitely got much stronger. the sweet tastebud is apparently the one that stays around the longest. i remember my grandmother (at like mid stage) discovering sweet tea when we moved down south from new england. i remember her with water saying ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt sweet enough‚Äù.i would definitely agree with the others who have said about enjoyment of food being the main goal at that stage. we had already stopped some of the less necessary prescriptions at that point (with the doctor of course).i hate to say it but has she been tested for c0vid? if it's not that it's probably the disease progression -- as my grandpa progressed all he ate was cookies and ice cream (literally that was it). just remember that the most important thing is that she's getting enough calories to survive and is happy. i wish you luck. since she's pre diabetic it might be a little trickier but there's definitely options.this may also be a sign of difficulty swallowing or chewing, expressed as ""not tasting right.""  this is associated with both dementia and the normal aging process.  the foods you are describing would be difficult if that is the problem.  it's also possible that she needs dental attention.you can get that evaluated and possibly get some speech therapy where she (and you) will learn more about the mechanisms of eating and strategies for dealing with that.  in the meantime, you can try dicing her food into small pieces, adding thickener to her drinks, and encouraging her to clear her throat after every few bites.since she likes sweets and seems disinterested in foods she normally likes you could always try boosts, ensures or glucernas. they have kinds that are good for pre-diabetics and managing blood sugar. they have a variety of sweet flavors she may like and you could possibly use the drinks (if she likes them) as an incentive to eat her food.it is very common for elderly people to think that food is poison. it is because their sense of taste changed, and everything tastes bitter to them. i think your mom is at the beginning of this. try giving her ensure, they make a sugar free version.loss or changes in sense of taste and smell are common in dementia patients, as the disease progresses the affects can differ but if she is still wanting to eat then feed her what she wants.hey thanks for your input everyone.the biggest problem now is that she is getting so she'll only eat junk food.  i allow her sweets from time to time but she's gaining so much weight i can't handle her.  she's closing in on 200lbs at 4'11"".  anyway, i'm calling her doctor tomorrow as it is because today she said she was hurting under her tummy (she has what is called an 'apron belly') and i looked and it's...bad.  always a new curveball.sugar-free sweets?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/ubyh3z,1

thanks a lot in advance.","have you thought about baby locks on the cabinets and fridge? i have issues with my mom she try‚Äôs to go out the front door and we have one of those covers that just spin around unless you know how to work it. i agree with leaving out healthy snacks for her to pick out. my mom also doesn‚Äôt remember sometimes when she has just eaten- i leave her empty plate out until she goes to bed, that seems to help her to see that she ate.you need to get her to a doctor. this isn't just the mindless snacking of everyday life. some part of her brain that signals hunger or fullness is no longer working.in the meantime, buy some low-salt healthy popcorn, the kind you pop at home. make sure to pick out the kernels. rice cakes are also good.they're mostly air so you can spend a lot of time eating without consuming too many calories. but that's just a stopgap to save some money and tears until you can get her to a doctor.we are having a similar issue with my mil. i always read that people with dementia lose weight, but she's getting big enough that we worry about being able to move her, even between the two of us. the issue is she refuses healthy foods and tears through the house looking for snacks - and when she does find them she hoards them, eating them when we're not looking. she is offered lots of healthy options all day long. i think the only option for us is to remove all that stuff from the house permanently, even though we know she's going to badger us to hell and back about her beloved pepsi and chips.i had to put a door on my kitchen because my mother asks for food all day. many times after just eating. i‚Äôve also caught her eating non-food items. think dish sponge. paper towels and such. so the door put a stop to just all day grazing. but it doesn‚Äôt stop the constant begging for food saying she hasn‚Äôt eaten.she could also be confusing thirst for hunger. it is a chore to get my grandma to drink most days. but she also has put on weight. low activity has definitely helped. but she has a sweet tooth so she might eat a donut and then another because she doesn't know she had one. like others have stated, locks on the pantry or cabinets. we had to use those when my sibling was little because of raiding for sweets. also trying to set a food routine? breakfast, mid morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, and dinner have helped us. i usually rotate between cheese, nuts, fruit, and she has a glass of milk.my dad is also constantly ravenous, although losing weight.  we had to take food out of his house (he lived in small detached house behind my sister‚Äôs house) because he would feed it to his dog.  his golden retriever was getting very overweight despite many efforts to control his food intake.  my sister took all the food out but would offer him frequent snacks and drinks.  he always accepted, saying he hadn‚Äôt eaten all day (not true of course).  we could never give my dad chocolate or anything unsafe for a dog unless we were right there.that is really frustrating.  i would say start hiding only the sweets and snacks, and put out healthier stuff like meat, veggies, and fruit where she can eat it, that will be better for her and more filling so she won't be able to eat non-stop like she could with just carbs.go to a doctor. there are a lot of new medications with few side effects that could help her (like semaglutide).i‚Äôve noticed recently that my dad is eating multiple additional meals throughout the day. he cooks for himself (but also eats spoiled food) and doesn‚Äôt remember that he‚Äôs eaten dinner. stock piling food has been an issue since he got sick, and now he is also addicted to the social interaction he gets from grocery shopping so it‚Äôs become a big issue. he‚Äôs alone during the day. he also doesn‚Äôt drink anything so i‚Äôve been working more on getting him more drinks he likes that are available and everywhere.my mom is like this.  we have to hide food from her otherwise she will gorge herself on anything that she finds appealing, which is usually junk food.  she's already overweight and  is still gaining and it's getting hard for me to care for her.  she doesn't need lifting up (i wouldn't be able to do it) yet, thankfully, but when it comes to cleaning herself after the bathroom, i am having to help with that more and it's awful.   good luck, op.  i hope either child proofing the cupboards will help or that her doctor can help you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/u9oqcs,1
anyone have any tips on how to get the smell out of the mattress? grandmother peed bed and didnt know until i checked 30 minutes later. saw wet spot went close and felt wetness kn the carpet. anyone have tips on how to get pee smell from the mattress?she is still in the bed and refuses to get out. my nearest help either isnt coming right now or is supposedly too busy (grandfather retired and in pasture)mother is on her way but 15 minutes away and need to get ready.,"we have used a portal carpet cleaner - it has worked super well. monitor her behaviour closely- this may be linked to a uti which can cause psychosis in dementia patients. if you notice dramatic behaviour changes, work with your health care provider.yes i would try the salt and baking soda. soap and maybe a fan directed at it. working with dementia patients sometimes we have  to extra super tape the attends so it can't be removed easily. definitely invest in a plastic mattress cover. definitely a challenging time. as others have said monitor for uti symptoms. if she just had a procedure done, bacteria could of been introduced at that time? frequency is a uti symptom.  not sure what you refer to as cleaning something, perhaps a vaginal pessery, which is a device for vaginal prolapse.this won't help you now, but possibly in the future.  i use a disposable underpad on my mom's bed.  i've tried a couple, but my favorite is one made by walgreens ([   the pad is 30"" x 36"" and i place it under the bedsheet.  if there is an accident, i do have to wash the bedsheet, but the pad protects the mattress.  i also place a pad on her recliner chair.  it's pretty absorbent.enzyme cleaners for pets like these worki don't know how to clean pee that's already been soaked in.  i've tried pet urine cleaners before.  if it's small,, that will work but large amounts where the urine has already crystallized won't work..can you just rip off the fabric part since it sounds like it's part of the bed itself?i know there are waterproof matress protectors, blanket protectors, pillow protectors.salt and baking soda usually can do the trickdo you have a cover for it?  get one that encases the mattress and flip it until you are able to get a better fix.i second those suggesting a mattress encasement cover. you may also want to look into getting absorbable under pads for the mattress to further protect the mattress.bissell spot cleaners work well for upholstery, cars, any accidents.  i would get a rubberized mattress pad as well.  if you have removable seat cushion covers, you can slide a plastic garbage bag over the cushion and then put the cover back on over the bag.  this worked on my sofas and any seating you want to protect.this stuff is the best i've tried to remove urine odors.

"my mil is barely eating.  we've been letting her (read: giving up fighting her about it) eat toast during the day (because we are not with her then and it's all she would eat, even if we, or the carers, prepare her anything). but she has tea with us every evening. she usually eats a small portion of whatever i prepare for her (i do her a separate dish to us, old fashioned 'traditional' english food). but just lately she is only eating 1 or 2 mouthfuls before announcing she is full.she is looking a lot more frail, which i assume is nutrition related. i have tried making tea earlier, making tea later, going for stuff where she cleared the plate previously! nothing is working.she does seem to be eating some biscuits and sweets during the day (not many, but that in it's self is unusual). she has never eaten much of anything. she admits she is never hungry, but won't talk about it. she says if she didn't have to she wouldn't eat because she doesn't enjoy eating, never has. she also always thinks we have just eaten (as in, she think we had lunch recently).i don't think it's about my cooking. and i make the type of dishes my fil used to cook her. i go for soft and easy to eat foods (she has dentures).any suggestions for what to try her with? (currently i give her shepherds pie, fish cakes, fish fillets, pasties, mac & cheese, jacket potato's).  **edit -** the responses have shocked me. you all feel its quite significant and bad news. i wasn't prepared for that. i think i need a bit of time to get used to this. ty for the helpful suggestions.  **edit #2** \- no more 'end stage' comments please. she isn't end stage. she looks after herself all day, she has never had a fall, she uses full sentences, can discuss her interests, dresses herself, can use the phone, can operate a tv remote, etc. ""one swallow doesn't make a summer"" (pun intended)  i will try less bland food.","this imo is one of the hardest parts of dementia. i know with my grandpa we got to a point where all he would eat is cookies and ice cream, that's it. we eventually had to figure that eating that's better than nothing, and if i ever get to be 95 i'll want to eat cookies and ice cream all the time even if i don't have dementia! liquid supplements like smoothies and protein drinks are always good too if you can sneak them in. just remember that this is the disease process and even if all she eats all day is toast, sweets, and tea, then that will at least give her calories. wishing you all the besteating difficulties are [typical with dementia]( especially toward the end-of-life stages.  she's likely just not feeling hungry or thirsty.my mother is in hospice with dementia.   she also eats very little and i've been told it's okay. she's not feeling hungry and also, refusing food is one of the last things that people can control in their lives.   having some control means a bit of dignity.my mother, if she eats, tends to eat sweets.  any calories at this point i think are fine.   it sounds like you are doing a good job in providing good meals, familiar dishes.yes to all of these.   lost my mom in march after a slow 2 years and a really fast downhill 7 months.  she stopped eating a little less than a month before the end.  my blessings and sympathies.  its time to consider comfort/palliative carechocolate protein shakes, you can freeze and blend to make them more like a milkshake, and grind her meds to put them in there too.i've been buying jelly drops for my mom (i'm also in the uk!) if you search for them online they're a company that make jelly sweets specifically for people with dementia. they are colourful and look very appealing, but they're just water and minerals, so it's a very easy way to get people to take fluids because most people are very happy to eat the 'sweets'! i know you mentioned that this issue is more food related, but i would highly recommend jelly drops as my mom gladly eats them and i think that helps. they're not cheap but i don't really care at this point.my great-aunt was in a similar period before. she would claim she's not hungry, even if she didn't eat the whole day. she only once asked for food, a very weird very rare type of dessert to be specific. only grandma knew how to make it and when she ate, we made like a whole batch. everyday we would try to trick her as ""(grand) nephew/niece x is trying to learn how to make, taste and give feedback please."" it worked for a while. also, nutritional shakes are useful usually. i suggest talking to their principal physician for suggestions on what would fit their dietary requirements. sorry you're going through this as a family, it must be very hard.i'm going through something similar, and she's lost so much weight so fast it's concerning. at the moment, she also eats 3-4 spoonfuls and then she's declared she's full. so we give her liquid meal replacements like upandgo to try and give her more calories, and whatever she feels like eating - she has a sweet tooth so cake or ice cream are her go tos for her difficult to eat days.dementia can cause long held likes and dislikes to change, including favorite foods and disliked foods. sometimes family members get stuck in the rut of ‚Äúshe‚Äôs always liked this‚Äù or too hung up about nutrition, and this is inadvertently contributing to the lack of appetite. i have witnessed this with my family member. he loses weight and says he‚Äôs not hungry when staying in a particular environment and when he comes home to me he has a healthy appetite and gains weight. it‚Äôs not about being a good or bad cook. in general, people with dementia will gravitate to more strongly flavored foods. sweets are a favorite. i hesitate to give specific food recommendations because i‚Äôm not in the uk. don‚Äôt ask what she wants or expect her to come up with ideas. this is too tough for someone with dementia. pick up a variety of prepared foods: plenty of snacks she can graze on and plenty of sweets. rich, sinful, or the stuff you‚Äôd want to eat if you didn‚Äôt mind getting fat. definitely cookies, ice cream, puddings, pastries. there are foods that tend to be sweet and extra flavorful too - such as asian noodles and things with dipping sauces, fried sweet potato with sauce, etc. experiment. the goal is just to get calories in her, regardless of the form they come in. if you have zero luck, there are medications that stimulate appetite. you haven‚Äôt said anything here that sounds like ‚Äúend of life‚Äù. these food issues are common with dementia in people who are nowhere near end stage and there are solutions.virtual hugs... [ might be an informative watch and listen.  it's always ok to encourage someone to eat/eat more and drink/drink more, but the decline in eating and drinking is natural.my mom would eat lime yogurt. and liked sour stuff, like those sour popsicles they sell.i'm not sure if anyone else has mentioned this yet, but one thing a lot of people don't realize is your taste changes as you get dementia. your sweet and salt receptors get duller. your sour and bitter receptors are the last to go though. so food isn't going to taste as good. it's going to taste bitter instead of sweet. everything will be bland and boring.unfortunately it could also mean she's reaching end stages. if she has a nurse that comes to visit, see what they say.in patients with dementia, it‚Äôs possible that their interests in food and eating habits fluctuate. unless she is starving and becomes very weak, it is okay. try giving her a variety of things to eat and meal supplements such as ensure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/u4djo6,1

"my mom is in al for a few weeks now. she has moderate dementia, with moments if lucidity but she‚Äôs not really self sufficient. the facility is good but sometimes when i come trash has built up, things aren‚Äôt in their place (she has a tendency to pull things from her closet and put them around her room), non trash things are in the trash, the tv remote is lost, etc‚Ä¶ and i have to spend some time ‚Äúresetting‚Äù everything to a good state. she hasn‚Äôt taken advantage of al facility activities, just hangs in her room watching tv. she seems relatively content but the longer i stay away the more disoriented she seems to get and the more calls i get from her about things she can‚Äôt figure out that she forgets she can ask staff about (like tv, temperature).i‚Äôve been visiting daily but it doesn‚Äôt feel sustainable. that said, i‚Äôm not seeing how i could be away for too many days. was hoping to learn more about how others approach these situations.","i visit 4 to 6 times a week. it‚Äôs getting a bit exhausting, so i might try to stick to 4. my advice to you would be to try if you can to have some sort of schedule. i generally arrive after dinner and stay approximately one hour. we sit in the same place and talk about the same things. the routine aspect of it helps i think. but then she might expect me on the days i don‚Äôt go (even if i told her the day before), because of that routine that is in place. in the end, i think that the important part is to find a balance. something that works in your schedule and that is consistent enough to not disorient her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/u201pa,1
"opa has now started advanced choking. he eats very very slowly. i know that dementia affects the part of the brain that controls swallowing. but i don‚Äôt know what to do, my parents are leaving me alone with him more and more (we all work but now it‚Äôs getting pretty drastic to leave him alone). if he chokes and it gets stuck in his air ways the only thing i could do is call 911 and i honestly don‚Äôt know if they would come fast enough. it‚Äôs really morbid but it is reality. his eating has been on and off. sometimes the refusal of food and sometimes he wants breakfast, lunch and dinner. which i assume is the dementia, but he won‚Äôt want soup all the time. and he is very picky. do i just make him shakes and smoothies when he‚Äôs home with me? i worry about his health if he eats candy and ice cream for all meals   (he would probably love that lol) any suggestions or tips would be very helpful.","first off please work on getting training on dealing with choking. it‚Äôs part of extremely basic first aid such as the heimlich maneuver. ems can take 15 minutes to an hour for some geographic locations and if somebody is truly choking on food most likely will have died by then or even worse being a situation that any recovery will mean that the person will have severe deficits above and beyond what they may have now.in terms of the textures of food and liquids. in the medical profession we refer to food as being regular texture if you can eat anything without having modifications done to the way the food is prepared. the next downgrade from regular texture is mechanical soft which is typically cutting the food into small pieces, making sure that the food itself is soft such as pasta or mashed potatoes. a lot of times we have the equivalent of mechanical soft if we‚Äôre eating softer foods that are in smaller bite-size portions. the next texture is pur√©e where the food is put through a food processor to turn it into a pudding like thickness almost like mashed potatoes but just slightly thicker.when it comes to liquids if you can drink almost anything that‚Äôs refer to as thin liquids.  if a person has trouble swallowing thin liquids the general approaches to use a medical grade cornstarch to slightly thicken the liquid so that it‚Äôs like nectar thickness. when pouring something that is nectar thick it almost looks like you‚Äôre pouring molasses. it still pours rather quickly but slower than if you were pouring water. the next step up from there is honey thick which pores just like honey and have the consistency of honey. the next thickness after honey thick is pudding thick which i don‚Äôt know a single person who tolerates very well.have you spoken to his doctor?  it sounds like he should be on hospice care at this point, or at least evaluated.  if hospice does not take him then they can get you some resources. you need to have a serious talk with your parents about getting him medical help now, before he does choke and there is nobody around to give immediate help.  honestly, this is not a problem about what he can and can't eat, this is a very serious medical issue.puree the soups so it is all one consistency. a soup that has a broth and chunks of stuff in it are difficult for a compromised person to manage because the person has to contain the liquid in the mouth while chewing the solid pieces. with old people and people with dementia, what often happens is the liquid will slip down the throat on its own, without the person actually swallowing, and that's what causes the coughing/choking. other ""mixed consistencies"" to avoid are things like very juicy fruits - for the same reason.we have my great aunt ensure nutrition shakes. you can get them at most stores in the us. we got her the chocolate ones because she started really only wanting sweet stuff at the end and we told her it was chocolate milk. i am so you and your family are going through this.not all forms of dementia cause problems swallowing. a proper diagnosis of alzheimer‚Äôs vs ftd vs lbd, etc. would help determine that.it sounds like a swallow study may be appropriate. his pcp could order this or neurologist if he sees one. it could be a different condition causing this problem as well.you should get him evaluated to see what he can eat. some people need thickened fluid or different textures.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/tz9b71,1

"i think many of us here have placed our hopes on something that would soothe, comfort or engage our loved ones with dementia.  i have learned, yet again, that dementia is a formidable foe.my mother is getting into the later stages of dementia and is in memory care.  she's always loved dolls and babies and i thought i would get her one of those weighted baby dolls to cuddle and coo over.  i read all the reviews.  i made my amazon purchase carefully, spending more money than one should for a doll.it arrived.  it was adorable.  it was huggable and sweet faced and i couldn't wait to see my mother's reaction.  oh, she loved it and exclaimed over it!  a true hallmark moment.   then, another resident came over to exclaim over the dear baby and its wee feet and soft skin.   she looked so wistfully at the doll in my mother's arms that i felt like santa with an empty toy sack.sigh. that resident has no real family.  i felt terrible.   it was sad.  i went home and bought another doll and waited for the amazon truck.i bet you think a hallmark moment is coming, don't you?i took the doll over to memory care this morning...cue the violins swelling...!ha.  the lady wanted nothing to do with the doll.  she was having a day and rejected it.  i said to the staff, it's okay, if someone else would enjoy it...sigh...they can have it.  the staff said baby dolls were much loved and someone would surely enjoy it.  they added my mother was crazy about hers.i checked in on my mom in her room.  no baby doll.  i asked, where is the baby doll? ""what doll?"" she asked in confusion.  i said, ""the new baby doll!"" as i started my search through the closet and under the bed.  my mom said, ""someone stole it""  just as i opened her nightstand to find the poor doll crammed in the lower drawer.   she was surprised to see it but told me to take it away, someone would want it and steal it!on my way out, i saw a resident had fallen asleep cuddling the other doll.  there's no hallmark moment in dementia.  there are things we can buy to make our loved ones' lives easier, but as i have learned, we can buy dolls or fidget blankets or memory marker boards or therapeutic mechanical cats and none of it will make a bit of difference to the person who has no idea where they are or who their family is or that they used to have hobbies and careers.all we can do is our best, but don't take it personally if the things you are trying aren't working!","the potentially ""good"" news in this, if your mom's dementia works anything like mine, is that you can always ""re-give"" her the doll and it'll be like christmas morning all over again. the doll might've been put in a drawer by a kind overnight worker-- maybe the doll fell on the floor overnight. your mom might have said ""i didn't want it to get stolen"" on auto-pilot, as a way to cover that she didn't remember the doll or how it got into the drawer. (again, this is all based on what my mom would say/do.)you are a kind soul. thank you for buying a doll for the other resident. (once mom moved to hospice and passed, i wasn't sure what to do with the comforting things that we bought her in her final weeks. we donated them to the hospice unit so they could comfort other residents.)aww. well‚Äî""hallmark moment"" is about memory. and someone with dementia has no capacity for that. you did make two people happy‚Ä¶ for a bit. and then another two, and another two, each time for a moment. it's kind of like the starfish story. a bunch of beached starfish stranded, baking, dying at low tide. child begins tossing them one by one back into the water. adult happens by, asks ""why bother? there are so many starfish, you can't make a difference."" child responds by chunking another starfish in the water, saying ""i made a difference for *that* one.""oh, so sorry.  this disease is such a bitch.  you just never know minute to minute what you will get from someone with dementia.  you love her, you are doing your best, you are learning that the disease decides everything and we are just along for the ride.appreciate this a lot right now. big hugsso true. everything gets smashed into a drawer whether it belongs there or not. wreaths, wall decorations, holiday decorations, big blankets, stuffed animals, etc. all because she doesn't want someone to steal from her. my family member has pulled off at least 4 drawer fronts trying to open over-stuffed drawers.it's a brutal and sad disease and i really hope there is some peace and happiness found once they pass. it makes no sense why some are afflicted and some aren't. like for instance my nanas both had alzheimers one passed at 84 and my other 80 year old nana is in the late-stages in the rest home she's non verbal, can't walk, and is really suffering daily with the disease. my nana is a really kind loving, caring, person who never deserved this disease. she never drank alcohol often or used drugs or committed any crime or harmed anything or anyone in her life she was a really good person and spent alot of her time reading, gardening, walking in nature and caring for her children. i don't know why good people have to suffer, and for instance my grandad is the total opposite to good he's a cheeky, manipulative, schemeing man he has narcassistic personality disorder and he is now getting dementia quite quickly at age 85 but still trying to scheme and create issues. it's just sad how it's survival of the fittest and good people get walked all over and suffer whereas bad people triumph and live longer.thank you for sharing.very helpful post. thanks...and all the best to you and your mom.you did have a hallmark moment it was just temporary. but it did happen for heraww. this made me more than a little sad and contemplative. my dad is heading that way and i thought we would have more time but yesterday, he suddenly looked at my sister in confusion and wondered who she was. my sister was scolding her daughter who is named after me, and my dad perked up. he seemed relieved to know someone and also seemed eager to have me show up to take him away from all these people he suddenly didn‚Äôt know. he asked where i was and my sister explained to him that this one is her daughter and my dad‚Äôs daughter (me) is sitting at the back. my dad looked over in my direction and i stayed partially turned away from him, but waved my hand where he could see and said ‚Äúi‚Äôm over here dad.‚Äù i felt so bad for him but i was afraid he would be more confused and agitated if he saw and didn‚Äôt recognize the me now. the more time i spend with my dad, the more scary and heartbreaking it is. i went from being angry a lot at his outbursts (completely unlike him) to now feeling so damn bad.i hope you have more good days than bad. bless your heart for donating the other doll to one who needs it. hugs for all of you here.that's very sad and all too familiar. in the last months of my uncle's dementia, i was struggling to think of a christmas gift and finally remembered one of his favorite candies. one that he couldn't get easily for himself and i knew i had a winner. i bought a big 3lb box of treats and, indeed, he absolutely loved it on christmas morning. and, in fact, enjoyed those treats constantly for the weeks following christmas.finally, on one of my visits in early january he asked me ""what am i supposed to do with all of this?"", indicating the box of treats. i said that he loved them and he'd been eating them almost constantly. he told me to take them away and that he never wanted to see them again and he couldn't understand why anyone would buy him so much of something like that. and, anyone that's been around dementia knows how angry he was too, right? i mean, he wasn't kidding and he was absolutely illogical and angry about these treats now. incredibly sad and frustrating. you just cannot win with dementia. i guess i'm glad that he got some enjoyment from them for a while.that was so beautifully written. i don't know how this would work for you - how about taking it to the car each night and bringing it back with you the next day? i do wonder about why she was worried it would get stolen. the fear of that overwhelmed the pleasure. but if you kept it...? just a thought.my wife was in the early stages of dementia. one night i made a nice meal of ravioli. it was good quality ravioli, and i made it look good on the plate. i felt good about paying attention to the details not thinking she‚Äôd notice, but it made me feel good to treat her like she is special.i gave her the plate and went to the kitchen to fix mine. i came back and her food was all gone. i asked her how she liked it, fishing for praise, and she said it was really good.i ate a bite of mine and our big labrador dog came over to beg (my wife trained him well!) and the dog promptly threw up on my feet. the whole plateful of unchewed ravioli. definitely not a hallmark moment.you have hit the nail on the head.my mum would not want 'things' cos they will be 'stolen'.  possibly your mum hid the doll to keep it safe and forgot about it.  i would find things 'hidden' in drawers and handbags... even fruit or half a sandwich..i left cuddly dogs and soft bodied dolls in full view in her room till she sort of started recognizing them as hers and safe where they were. or  just the further decline.  the cheaper items were the ones she preferred to the 'breathing puppy' and such.my mum was a pediatric nurse.  breaks my heart yet again when she holds her fave doll 'correctly'... and indeed the fave doll is soft bodied and came from a thrift store..so kind of you to bring happiness with your gift of the doll to another resident.so sorry you're going through this same hell.she might have sincerely put the doll in the drawer to protect it and forgot she did that. it sounds like she loved it. and other residents may have been grabbing for it or whatever. it‚Äôs probably a little like taking your favorite toy to preschool with you and getting upset when others want to hog it. the other woman might love hers too and was just having a bad day. i think what you did was great. i‚Äôd be pumped if someone gave me a doll when i‚Äôm an old lady lol. i always adored my dolls as a kid and i think i‚Äôd be so excited to have another especially if living away from family.it was soft chocolate chip cookies for my dad. up until the last three weeks or so, a cookie got him to do anythingüíî",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/trhrdw,1
"my partner has dementia and lots of anxiety and depression. she seems to sundown mornings. this morning was pretty bad. she's struggled with constipation on & off, though we eat decently high fiber. she probably forgets to drink water, and doesn't want to exacerbate urinary incontinence. on a hunch, i asked ""when's the last time you pooped?"" three-four days ago. ah-hah! will work on that, see if it helps! thought it might be useful to share.update. it wasn't just constipation. she's being crabby and anxious after the main event too. üòñ","probiotics help with constipation. my very private aunt, pre-dementia, finally admitted to us that she has been suffering from constipation for decades. i recommended probiotics; she refused, saying nothing can help. after a hospital stay 8 months later, she again complained.  i bought her some probiotics, opened the container, handed her the pills and said ‚Äúas an experiment, take them for 2 weeks.‚Äù she finally agreed and rarely gets constipated now. when she does, she adds 1 tsp of mct oil to her oatmeal or milkshake. before dementia, she called them a life saver.all of the sudden my wife was inexplicably losing weight with serious diarrhea. doctors did a complete work up on her digestive system, nothing. six months later she is taking constipation medicine.mom couldn't tell me if she pooped today or not.  i have no way of knowing.constipation usually causes an upset tummy so if my dad suddenly doesn't want to eat anything and is more lethargic than usual i will give him a laxative.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/tr4p78,1
"hey all,just joined this sub today because i am currently the chef of a care home specializing in individuals suffering from dementia. most of our residents are in their 80s/90s, a couple in their hundreds even!, and a couple in early stages who are still in their 50s. since starting work here i have unfortunately seen first hand what a horrible disease this is. one struggle we have is getting the residents to eat. i have researched and experimented at great lengths with different foods and techniques, and have seen some improvements. these changes include serving familiar meals that they grew up with, finger foods, small portions, courses served one by one, and lots of cueing and encouragement by the care staff. but there are still some residents who no longer recognize what food is, no longer receive hunger signals from their bodies, and basically live off of supplements (boost, etc). i have watched these residents take food out of their mouths and look at it as if it's something foreign to them, then set it on a table and wander away. meanwhile losing weight day after day. i have also seen residents who haven't eaten in days finally take a few bites of food, and how it lights up their faces and moods. seeing things like that make my day.i'm reaching in hopes that someone could offer me some new tips and tricks, are you a caregiver and have you found something that works for your loved one? being a chef and having all the credentials and experience is one thing, but when it comes to this disease the best experience comes from those who deal with this disease regularly and first-hand.thanks in advance for any suggestions you may have!edit: wow thank you all so much for your kind words and seriously amazing tips for me! i'm going to go through all the comments and make a list and see what we can make happen at our community! i honestly was hesitant to post because i was afraid people would tell me to quit my job if i'm asking questions like how to get the residents to eat. it's been hard not to take it personally. so i really appreciate how kind you all have been especially üôÇüôÇ you've given me several avenues of hope.","i just wanted to drop by and thank you for being wonderful. the chef/ cooks at my grandmothers home where she was very sick seemed to be the only ones who wanted to help her eat while the care workers treated her like a burden. their care meant so so much to us as i‚Äôm sure your care means to your patients and families.i noticed that my mom was obsessed with ""saving food for later"", she would only eat half of whatever i gave her, no matter what the portion size, and want to save the rest. she would never go back and eat the ""saved"" food. so i started giving her double  portions knowing she would only eat half.make it hot. not just the food, but warm up the plates, too. loss of smell and taste comes naturally with age, but they can still feel if something is warm.many of the older ladies i work with also believe temperature = quality. they're the generation of nice and hot, piping hot, hot and fresh, a hot home-cooked meal (and less charmingly, slaving away over a hot stove all day). obviously make sure it's safe and don't do this for people who need to be fed. but i've seen wildly different reactions to the same recipe depending on the perceived temperature. some of the ladies thought we got a new cook just because the plates/food came out hotter.i wish i had some brilliant insights for you but we are struggling with it in my household, also. fingerfoods and mirroring help to some extent but it looks like you have tried those. you have probably already tried asking their loved ones for their favorite foods. i wonder if you could look at it from a historical perspective. if a resident has regressed to a mental age of 3-5 years, what were popular foods when they were that age?other than that, i don't have much. my dad seems to love take out more than home cooking so we do take out a few nights a week. bonus points if there are a zillion little condiment containers. i know that sounds counterintuitive, but his eyes positively light up. and if he eats pico de gallo by itself instead of as a condiment? who cares, it's still healthy and delicious. thank you for caring so much about your career! ü§ósweets!  they can't eat pastries and candy all the time, but it helps to offer real food that's either naturally sweet, like fruit, or tarted up with a sweet sauce or glaze.i agree with those who said too much on the plate is overwhelming.  it's good to have space between the items, and to serve food that doesn't have to be cut to eat.my mother-in-law can't abide seeds, pits, or crusts,  and will pick the ""seeds"" out of seedless watermelon.  i cut the crusts off sandwiches and cut the crust off bread before toasting it.we haven't moved our loved one into a home just yet. but i know one we toured said they use bright plates to really contrast the food on it. carbs and sweets seem to be favorites in our house as of late.thank you for caring so much! at my facility, we try to make food bite sized so it seems less intimidating, especially for those that develop anxiety over meal times. it‚Äôs like preparing a meal for toddlers in that aspect. we also use tons of butter, cream, and sugar to make meals more calorically dense and tasty.""milkshakes"" -if you can make it look or taste like a chocolate milkshake they'll drink at least a few sips through a big straw.  which i guess you're already doing with boost, but, idk, as much protein, vitamins, and supplements as you can fit in there is all to the good.  they can't spit out the liquid as easily either.my grandmother is in memory care at an assisted living facility. how nice of you to want to help this population of often forgotten folks. my grandmother has no trouble desiring to eat yet. i do know she always complains about the food at her facility because she doesn‚Äôt know what it is. they are always doing things like mexican or italian or asian. my grandmother has lived in tennessee all her life. she is 94 years old. she doesn‚Äôt know anything about those foods. she wants traditional southern meals like meatloaf or fried chicken with traditional simple sides. so i‚Äôd say, know your location and prepare foods typical of the area.one thing i've noticed for all my residents: there is no one size fits all. make sure the nursing staff knows about everything you can offer, and always respond open to suggestions. i've seen a myriad of variations between nurses, one will take 'blended food' to mean a plate of slop, while her coworker will put in the effort of reshaping the separate ingredients, so it will still look like a meal. sweets go over well, some residents will literally grow fat. that's not harmless in their old age: it will make them harder to catch and help once they inevitably lose their balance. you already seem to be doing awesome things, they are lucky to have you!first off, thank you for your compassion and care. the people in your care home are so lucky to have you! unfortunately, everyone is different and so i don't know how much my experiences will help but here are some strategies i use with my grandmother. \- **anything in liquid form**; smoothies are great and even easier to get them to drink if it's with a straw.\- **culturally significant/nostalgic food**; my grandmother is british so things like black pudding and bangers and mash are great, especially for meals that are a bit more social because they're also a great conversation topic.\- **visible snacks**; i keep glass cookie jars all over the place with crackers, cookies, and whatever other dry goods i have on hand so the visual stimuli will get her to eat. similarly, having simple things like cut veggies, fruit, boiled eggs, or other finger food just out can tempt her too. pairing these with notes that say 'help yourself' or something similar is a good idea so they know it's ok to take whatever they'd like.\- **food you can play with**; creating activities around food is great for when my grandmother hasn't eaten in a while or is being especially picky (i guess because the eating part is just a by-product). two of my favorites were a checkers-like game we had with veggie nuggets and then a scavenger hunt we did together that involved things like ""go to the fridge and eat 3 cucumber slices"". unfortunately, these only work for those capable of the games portion unless maybe you did it in groups so that those with more cognition can model to those with less.\- **sauces**; once you find one flavor that they're happy to eat then you can try making a similar tasting sauce and put it on/next to everything else. for my grandmother, if she won't eat things i want her to like veggies, all i have to do is cover them with cranberry sauce or melted cheese and down the hatch they go. sometimes the combination is gross to me but it's one of the few things that can get her to eat greens so i don't question it.\- **quick mental tricks**; one of my most effective forms of encouragement to eat is also nice for bonding, you basically say that you only have something for them and they need to eat it quickly before anyone else sees or they'll want it to. it only really works for smaller, often hand-held snacks but could be a good way to get something into those who haven't eaten in a while as the ""quick"" factor often gets them to do it without thinking. since you're working with quite a few people maybe you could enlist a daily ""taste-tester"" or something so you can twist this into something a bit more of a system.\- **sweet things**; probably why the cranberry sauce works so well honestly, she will go for anything sweet. just be careful of their overall sugar intake because of the diabetes risk but if that's not a worry then why not let them indulge?\- **using the tv**; only really works because before my grandmother's dementia she had a habit of eating while watching tv, with people who don't have that ingrained habit it might only distract them.\- **children**; i worked at a preschool that was located in the basement of a care home and every few weeks we would do meals together. both the children and the adults absolutely adored it and because children are often picky eaters too but know they need to eat certain foods they may not like, they were amazing at getting the adults to eat especially if they were paired with one adult and given it as a job. if at all possible, i really encourage you to reach out to local schools for field trips to your care home - it's such a wonderful pairing for both the adults and the children in so many ways.\- **finger food**; in general cutlery can be frustrating so finger food or even food that's cut up into bite-size pieces can remove that barrier.since food is such an individual thing i think writing down anything that someone really enjoys is important. it may seem repetitive to eat the same thing every day to us but luckily they aren't burdened by that notion! i hope some of these, or versions of them, work for you. and again, thank you so much for the effort you're putting into this.my dad will only eat what has been placed on his plate in front of him from the start (e.g. no other courses, will say no to second helpings). i find it's a delicate balance between ensuring that his plate is full and not being too overwhelming/overloaded.my dad will only eat what has been placed on his plate in front of him from the start (e.g. no other courses, will say no to second helpings). i find it's a delicate balance between ensuring that his plate is full and not being too overwhelming/overloaded.you are a sweetheart for asking this. :)  one of the pieces of advice that our hospice team gave us when my mom would need encouragement to eat was to use red tableware, cups, and cutlery. not only do they provide a good visual contrast when compared to the food, but also evidently studies have shown that the color red can help to trigger hunger signals to the brain.  another thing is to find weighted utensils, which seem to help with coordination for those who get frustrated with using them. it helps them to better control their movements and be a little more successful with feeding themselves.  last, but not least, is that research has shown that the sense of taste gets muted during aging, especially with dementia. sweet is one of the last flavors that is really evident. so while instinct may be to kind of avoid spices and sugar, these may actually be good additions. even if you may feel the dish is flavorful, they may find it bland. and who wants a plate of bland food? :)i don't have any advice as my partner's father is not yet at this stage, but i want to thank you for asking this question. you obviously care about your patients much more than just providing their food and that is so rare to find. on behalf of your patient's families, who may never know how much you put into their relative's care, thank you.one thing i have done as a caregiver is the left hand trick where i slip food onto plates from the side they are the less aware of. another fun thing i have found is when cooking and activities do something together (which might be hard in the pandemic) the residents ‚Äúcook‚Äù with the cooking staff this can also encourage them to eat. some people before their diagnosis might have loved to cook. something else that i have seen success in is ‚Äúinternational days‚Äù i think the nationalities were selected based on disclosure from the residents. so if a bunch of residents were from germany we would have a big germany day with german meals and activities. something that connected the activities of the day and food. sometimes when i have worked in places a question that is asked when residents move in is what is your favorite food? i think that is always important information to ask. something else that is important to note is how does the food look? sometimes people do not have teeth which means yes there food might have to be mashed up. if it is not presented in a way that is desirable it might not be appealing for someone to eat. you have to be creative. i provided care for a woman who did not remember she was missing teeth. if you know someone likes a certain food you might have to use that as a base for other foods. i know someone with dementia whose favorite food is cinnamon toast crunch. when they came out with cinnamon toast crunch pancakes we got those. cinnamon toast crunch cake? in the shopping cart. the coffee creamer why not? sometimes you have to use that common ground and work from there. i know that there are people who use boost and nutritional shakes in ice cream machines. that can also change things up. sometimes you have to be creative and don‚Äôt be afraid to mix things up. i know before the pandemic in one nursing home that i was a cna at every once in awhile we would have an activity where hamburgers were delivered from a fast food restaurant. one time it was chinese food this let us find out what kind of foods they liked. for me it let me find out that one of our residents really liked spicy food.my husband has lewy body dementia. he will eat turkey sandwiches, cheese pizza, cheeseburgers, and chicken nuggets. he‚Äôs like a 5 yo. we toured several memory care facilities and they had chefs and i thought oh no! he would never eat this fancy food. at his day center, they serve sandwiches. as others have mentioned, foods they can pick up are better.thank you for what you're doing.my dad's care facility would often give him hot dogs (his favorite)- it helped for a while.my dad is in a memory care facility and his room is across from the kitchen/dining area. he naturally wakes up early and when he hears the staff he gets up and goes to the kitchen and they have a cup of coffee and a cookie or banana or apple waiting for him. it's very sweet of them. thank you for caring, i know my dad is in the safest place for him and knowing that the caregivers do nice, thoughtful things like snacks with his morning coffee is really heartwarming to me.this is sweet of you to think of better ways for the dementia patients to eat. my mother is in an aged care facility and is constantly losing weight. she has been put in a protein milkshake diet as of lately. when they first informed me of her weight loss, i suggested that she be given foods that she was used to eating. the facility (and the community) has a large population of immigrants who have maintained their cultural diets. letting the asian patients eat rice in every meal won't hurt them, on the contrary. i understand that advertising ""home-cooked meals"" sound fab however, at the stage my mother is (she refuses to use dentures), five star home cooked meals seem a far off manner to get her nourished. as for suggestions, i agree to serving them finger foods, sweets and foods that have been part of their younger years/lifestyle/culture. because it only boils down to one thing: get some nourishment into their system. grateful for everything you do.you are wonderful for asking this. one thing i'd mention that a lot of care homes overlook is that many elderly people don't have good contrast vision anymore. so like, mashed potatoes on a white plate doesn't look like food to them. but mashed potatoes on a red plate does. the smaller portions as ""courses"" definitely helps. also many dementia patients lose all taste aside from sweet. so anything sweet you can offer - even like sugar free pudding - helps so much.i am also a chef and just like we use a granita or sorbet to clear the palate between courses, something tart like lemon ice can kind of kickstart the salivary response and wake up the appetite.my aunt was one of those boost patients - almost catatonic, almost nonverbal, no interest in anything, especially food.  first of all, her doctor (whose wife specializes in geriatric patients) said to go ahead and let her have all the cake and ice cream she wanted and supplement with boost and a daily vitamin but to not insist on nutritious food like vegetables. i was horrified but it worked. i bought fancy, decorated 2 layer cakes from the grocery store, scones, and large muffins. also bought ice cream, sherbet and ice cream bars, which she loved. within days, her appetite had returned and she was eating more. some days, she would have 4 large (huge!) slices of cake and ice cream. the idea of eating all that sugar and empty calories drove me batty but it worked. after eating more, she began talking and walking more and she improved. i assume she had more energy?then i started replacing a slice of cake with a milkshake. i began making milkshakes with fresh frozen fruit, vanilla ice cream, milk or some of the 30g vanilla protein shake, strawberry or peach yogurt, 1/2 scoop of protein powder and 1 scoop of collagen peptides containing amino acids (amino acids are the building blocks of nutrition) and the secret ingredient, a generous splash of vanilla coffee creamer, to hide the taste of the protein powder. (a full scoop of protein powder changed the texture; even i didn‚Äôt like it.) after doing that, she has regained more interest in food. she still eats some cake but not every day; i make milkshakes for her usually 3-4 times/week. she eats a lot of yogurt now (as well as rice pudding and tapioca pudding - she seems to like the texture). and, thanks to a recommendation of a random woman walking by the house who saw her and recognized she had dementia, i now serve her a small amount of food on 12 inch plates because this woman claimed ‚Äúthey like to see space between their food; it makes them think they aren‚Äôt eating much.‚Äù it‚Äôs weird but the 12 inch plates are working so much better than the bread plates and dessert bowls i had been using. i knew enough to only give her small amounts of food but once i switched to the extra large plates, she actually ate more. i‚Äôve also been making ‚Äúsliders‚Äù instead of a regular sized hamburgers or other sandwiches and i cut any chicken, beef, fish into a smaller, mini sized portions before cooking it. you know those scoops you use to make cookies? she eats tuna and/or egg salad when i use that scoop to measure the tuna salad and place it on her 12‚Äù plate with 2-3 crackers. personally, i think it looks lonely but she eats all of it, sometimes asks for more. i don‚Äôt understand why she eats more when i give her sliders instead of 1/2 a burger but she does. and, when i order takeout chinese (her favorite), i only place 2-3 of the smallest pieces of chicken on her 12‚Äù plate with a very small portion of noodles/rice. she almost always wants more now. before, she was only eating 1 piece of orange chickens and moving the chow mein noodles around her plate. i now buy mini-slider buns and mini tortillas (street taco size). when i first began serving her grapes again, i only gave her 4 grapes and she always asked for more. i serve her 1 sliced strawberry. i ordered one of those mini-waffle makers. she loved the blueberry waffle i made her (she even commented on how cute it was) and wanted more. now, she wants 4 mini-blueberry waffles for breakfast almost every day (i add collagen peptides and a full egg). when she wants cereal, i serve a small amount in a larger serving bowl. she eats it all and sometimes wants more. i use a 3-4 inch cookie cutter and cut a circle from 2 slices of bread to make her sandwiches or pbj‚Äôs - and i cut them in half when i serve them. i know none of this makes sense and is the opposite of what i was doing, but it‚Äôs been working so i thought i‚Äôd share. she‚Äôs eating more, she is more talkative and can have conversations most days, she goes for walks outside and she has a basic knowledge there‚Äôs a war in ukraine (current events) which she remembers from day to day. oh, and most days, she can once again write her name and make a small list of 2-3 things she wants from the grocery store. i never really connected dementia with calories consumed before but there does seem to be a correlation for her.love this ask, and i can't stop upvoting everyone commenting too! one idea that i had is to see what other resources and professionals your facility employs, and organize a meeting with them. a speech language pathologist and an occupational therapist will have some good input and may even have more detailed personal information about specific residents that could really help. collaborative problem solving can bring a lot to the table!

"my mom has had a series of strokes over the years but has been able to care for herself, with help from me, for the last five years. she lives with me. yesterday, she stopped making sense altogether. she is being assesed for hospice this week but i don't think she will be accepted, which is fine. i ruled out uti delerium with antiobiotics and rehyrdation and honestly she does seem a little better but the crazy words and a few strange actions lead me to believe she's had another stroke. i guess i am attempting to find out how this will play out. a nursing home will terrify her so that's not an option and i can pretty much lift her. she is losing weight even though she's hungry but her overall weakness since yesterday is really pronounced. she slept all day yesterday. i am afraid of a vegetative state and my incapacity to know what to do. thanks","firstly, she‚Äôs very lucky to have you. regarding her weight, it‚Äôs normal for someone in her situation to be losing weight rapidly. her brain is working overtime these days and it‚Äôs burning up heaps of fuel, so if you can add in some extra cals into her diet to prevent her from becoming too boney this with provide her with some extra padding when she falls.might i suggest keeping a bit of a diary going as well? it‚Äôs a good way to keep tract of dates if you‚Äôre observing new behaviours, or if there‚Äôs an incident like a fall.yes her doctor has suggested doing a diary. getting her to walk is difficult because she tires so easily. i think whatever happened happened at a restaurant and she couldn‚Äôt quite make it out i was quite literally holding her up while she was holding onto her walker. but i agree that she cannot just be left to not thrive. the day will come soon or she will only use the wheelchair, which we have. now i have to think about a ramp‚Ä¶ i just made her lunch and added a few hundred calories and she flinched‚Ä¶ she was always little and a little vain‚Ä¶ still!i‚Äôm sure she does, but something is better than nothing. the simple act of standing up, having a little stretch and looking at the garden is awesome for her too.she might still know what she‚Äôs trying to say. can she draw a picture of what she wants or point to a picture? maybe point to yes or no. our brains have pretty specific areas for language so the other stuff could still be functioning.my aunt was losing weight, became weak and basically stopped talking but she‚Äôs always loved sweets. her doctor said she could have all the cake and ice cream she wanted. seriously. all she wanted, plus a vitamin and boost. so i started buying fancy 2-layer cakes at the grocery store and ice cream. at first, the woman who had been eating next to nothing, asked for very large pieces of cake, followed by ice cream. this went on for several weeks. she gained weight, started talking and walking more. then, i added milkshakes (fresh frozen fruit, ice cream, yogurt, a splash of vanilla protein shake or 1/2 scoop of protein powder, a scoop of collagen proteins (amino acids) and a nice splash of vanilla coffee creamer) and fresh fruit. she loves them. i started serving her 4 grapes or 1 sliced strawberry. i bought a mini-waffle maker. only gave her one the first day, sprinkled powdered sugar on it (she loved it). she now eats 4 mini blueberry waffles for breakfast almost every day. i make slider-sized hamburgers or sandwiches and serve them on a 12-13‚Äù plate. i buy slider buns and street taco size tortillas. she wasn‚Äôt eating as much when i served her food on smaller bread plates or dessert bowls but she eats more on her larger than normal dinner plates. it looks funny on the big plate; the food looks lonely but she eats more when i use the 12‚Äù plates.she‚Äôs talking more, walking and actually following the plots on tv shows. i never connected dementia with calories consumed before but, for her, there appears to be a correlation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/tq94kj,1

"hi. i‚Äôm taking care of my 81 year old aunt who may have had a series of mini strokes or may just be developing dementia. i took her in to see her doctor because she wasn‚Äôt eating enough and was getting confused. so he put her on 15 mg of mirtrazapine which i thought was awesome. she started eating more, sleeping better and was just more like herself, although pretty groggy in the morning. a month later, she began taking nameda and she has been doing really well on that but, here‚Äôs the weird thing. she‚Äôs about 5‚Äô3‚Äù or 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weighs 155 pounds. when she first started developing confusion, i noticed she was better on days when she ate a lot ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not like you can eat your way out of a stroke or dementia, right? can anyone think of a reason why my aunt does better on days when she eats a lot?  thanks.","sleep, exercise, healthy diet. those help your body and the brain. it‚Äôs not going to reverse anything, but it will help  stabilize. my mother has better days when she eats balanced meals and has a good fluid intake.you word it as if she does better on days that she eats more, but it more likely that she eats more on days that she does better. see the difference? she will have bad days and better days. those better days, she is more ‚Äúwith it‚Äù and more likely to eat.if she's eating more regularly, her body is going to function better. better blood sugar, etc. i know if my blood sugar gets out of whack because i don't eat enough, i get fuzzy headed and can't determine on my own how to assemble a sandwich.she did better when she ate because the body needs fuel(food).  my father only wanted to eat cereal, his dementia was getting much worse.  he also has hypoglycemia so his headaches were worse along with his confusion.  we bought him protein drinks, the days we got him to drink those his confusion was lessened.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/tkm44z,1
"my dad broke his ankle.  he has a walking cast boot but we dont want him walking at night cause hes groggy and unstablw on it.  and yet he needs ro pee 3 times a night.  so far, weve been staying with him to help him walk but i think this is impossible to keep up cause we qre exhausted.i was thinking he could wear an external catheter instead.  does anyone have any experience in these?  is this a goo or bad idea?","have you considered a bedside commode? i see them at thrift stores all the time. then he only needs a couple steps instead of a whole walk.try a handheld urinal. you can buy them in the majority of pharmacies. just have him sit up at the side of the bed to use it. a commode is definitely a great idea to have close by for bowel movements  but a urinal would eliminate unnecessary need to transfer back and forth when he just needs to empty his bladder.there is something called a condom catheter but they are not very successful to stay on. a urinal at the bedside is best. second would be adult depends pads.how about restricting his fluids?  don't let him drink anything after 4pm, that should cut down on his need to pee during the night.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/thry0a,1
"i'm living with my grandma, who has dementia at about a level 4/5... that is she can still dress herself and bathe herself, wash her own clothes etc. but any complicated task...preparing meals, paying bills, at times even counting... overwhelms and confuses her.  she is often uncertain about the day of the week and repeats herself endlessly within just a few minutes.  her short-term memory can be very bad, but her logic and reasoning skills aren't, she's very aware of what's going on around her, she even still drives because she's always aware of where she is and what the other cars around her are doing, just doesn't always remember where she's going unless you remind her.  she's never had an accident in her life.i have the feeling from reading this sub that i've moved in a lot earlier in the process than most people do... which is great in some ways as i can try to make her life as good as i can for as long as i can, but on the other hand i can't just do as i know is best for her either, a lot of times too it's easy to forget it's the disease because she's always been kind of contrary and resistant to anything new that she doesn't suggest herself, lol.  anyway, she has acid reflux really badly.  this is terrible, but it took me about a week to figure out what was even wrong, because she can be a bit of a hypochondriac... my mom had warned me about it, but it still took me a while to spot the pattern of whenever i went to church, or to spend time with my other grandparents, she would claim her stomach hurt as she either felt embarrassed to not want to attend church, or was jealous of me spending time away from her.   so last week when she said her stomach hurt, i didn't take her seriously and she went and checked herself into the emergency room.  she wanted to leave as soon as i got there, but i convinced her to stay until they finished all the tests.  they found nothing after five hours, and we went home.  but the next day, she was still saying her stomach hurt and then she said her throat was burning and i guessed it was acid reflux.  but she refuses to take tums or pepto bismal most of the time, she says it makes her sick to even look at.  same with water.  i've had to hide the instant coffee and soda, and it's torture trying to get her to eat anything plain, all she want to eat is candy.  which she can go out and buy herself.  she sundowns pretty badly and stays up all night  eating all the stuff you're not supposed to eat for acid reflux then is sick in the morning, both because she wants to lay on the couch and sleep, and because she can't sleep because her stomach hurts her too badly.  she can't understand what's causing the pain and thinks she's sick with an illness that i can catch, so she becomes upset with me being near her, and upset with the food i'm cooking for her because she ""can't eat"" because apparently good food and meds and water make her sick to her stomach to even look at.  another thing is she seems to be too hot and then too cold all the time, like every five minutes she's asking me to check the temperature, and then to either cover her up with a blanket or rolling up her sleeves and then her pants legs claiming she's burning up.  i try to keep the temp around 70, but whenever i leave and come back she's got it at 78 or 64.   i'm kinda at my wits' end here, both my mom and aunt live out of state and are counting on me to take care of her, but she is not allowing herself to be taken care of at all.","my very first thought is you need to take the car keys away, she is not ok to drive.  people with dementia get easily confused and then don't know what to do or how to do it and that could lead to her being hurt or she hurts someone else.  second thing, you cannot control her behavior.  you can try and find things to substitute , maybe nuts or fruit or just not have candy in the household.  third thing, she may be getting to a point where you might want to consider an assisted living facility where they would have activities for her to do during the day.  if that is not an option find a senior center, many have adult day care options, which would get her out of the house and give her daily activities and socialization.  my husband is also either hot or cold, he doesn't adjust the heat just the amount of clothing he wears. not much you can do about that.  he also has bad reflux but we haven't come up with how to tackle that problem yet. good luck.there are some tums smoothies that she may like. i like the assorted fruit flavors, and there is also a berry fusion flavor. i wouldn‚Äôt tell her they were tums, but maybe tell her they were after dinner candies or something. they aren‚Äôt chalky like traditional tums, so maybe she won‚Äôt know to refuse them. if she will take a pill, she can take a pepcid or something like that daily.with the food, it is true that people with dementia tend to enjoy candy because sweets are basically the last flavor they can taste strongly and enjoy. i would try to use this to your advantage, look online for foods that are sweet but more healthy. for example its more important for her to get hydration than cutting her sugar so apple juice and orange juice are great. alternatively you could put honey or maple syrup on everything that‚Äôs healthy lol. all this advice is assuming she‚Äôs not actually diabetic.she needs to stop driving. i know she never had an accident before but you never know when she goes out driving with a uti (very common with elderly/senior women with dementia, and makes sundowning worse) etc, the first one will be. and she or you could be legally liable if she hurt or killed someone and you openly allowed her to drive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/tfah80,1
"the one thing my nan still does is make herself cups of tea throughout the day.however more recently she's started putting milk and tea bags in the kettle so we've been trying to find alternatives of how we can safely give her hot water without having to worry about filling with water.anyone got any suggestions? we're rotating kettles and cleaning them at the moment, tried a hot water dispenser but they seem to have child locks which there's no way she could disarm herself.","what about using something like a keurig? even if you don‚Äôt put a pod in, it will dispense hot water.the only way that worked for my grandmother was to get her microwaving water to heat it up, and to provide her with mugs with handles that don‚Äôt get super hot. i‚Äôve covered up the other buttons on the microwave so she can just push the start/add 30 seconds button a few times. i hope you can find some way to help her safely carry on this habit :)what about something like an [airpot]( i have an old one but it kept coffee hot for over 12 hours. the only thing might be if she doesn't have the strength to push the top down.my mom loves to make her own latte with nespresso machine but was getting stuck on the steps. i had her walk me through it how she makes it step-by-step, then typed it all up and laminated it with check boxes next to each step. she can take a dry erase marker and check off each step as she goes. she loves it!i hope a solution to this issue is found. as a fellow tean enthusiast, i want your nan to have a cup of tea!i'm wo derinf if you could pre-make her tea for the day and put it in a thermos to keep it hot?what sorts of care resources are available to her? does she live with you or other family? or have caregivers during the day? also, how far along is the dementia?since this is a process that could be potentially dangerous (water/steam burns can be devastating!) i wonder if it would be possible to create a ""tea station"" for her to ""make her tea"" at, but not have boiling water involved? not exactly a play kitchen, but similar idea where she has all the ingredients and tools, just not a real electric kettle. and then the caregiver actually makes the real cup of tea and gives that to her. if she makes it out of order or a mess or something, then oh well,  it's more just about doing the activity right? although this is not something that would be ideal, since it still requires more work for the caregiver, and depends on how far along she is and if she would notice that it's not working. it would be great if they made ""safe"" electric kettles that just got warm, but not hot enough to burn!have you tried an electric kettle? an added bonus is when it reaches boiling it will shut off and the lid flips open for easy cleaning.would a one cup kettle help? something like this:[breville hot cup](appreciate there's still a fill with water aspect but if there's one with a big enough capacity it could be filled and ready for her and just one button to fill a cup.we used an electric kettle and i posted step by step reminders beside it. it helped for a while.we used an electric kettle and i posted step by step reminders beside it. it helped for a while.at home we have a water dispenser for 5 gallon (18 litres) water bottles that gives hot or cold water. the hot water temperature is hot enough to make tea, but not boiling. maybe it could work for your nan!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/tes3dp,1

i am currently doing work experience in a care home with some dementia patients in and i was looking for some advice on activities to do with the people to get them to do something they‚Äôd like. thank you,"i had luck getting small, unfinished wooden toys and having my dad sand them (think birdfeeders, toy cars things like that).  making cookies and muffins was always popular.  (the activities director always had a real batch of batter in the fridge to replace unusable ones).  everything from just stirring the batter and adding fruit, nuts, or chocolate chips to being given pre-measured ingredients to make the batter.  batting balloons back and forth either with their hands or two-foot sections of fun noodles was amazingly popular.  they'd go on for an amazingly long time.  sing-along sessions to old, familiar songs was also well-liked.  (don't forget to include hymns, and commercial jingles)if you are working with a small group of residents, then depending on their level of ability you could get them to collaborate on recreating something like van gogh's vase of sunflowers painting (can't remember the name). they could each paint a flower and you could stick them all together in the ""vase"" (also a painting) to finish it off.the christmas before this last one, i got mine making tree decorations out of coloured pipe cleaners and beads - candy canes, wreaths and so on.if you can lay hands on some real flowers and small glass vases then you could get them doing flower-arranging, which is a great social activity as well as a physical one.my dad loves to do things that make him feel helpful, like organizing things, dusting, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/t90dmr,1

looking to see others experiences with issues swallowing. my grandma is stage 6 (maybe now moving into 7) and has aphasia (trouble speaking) and now we think she has progressed to dysphagia. a few weeks ago she seemed to aspirate on a french fry at dinner. luckily she seemed to cough it out (did back blows) and a few days later my mom took her to urgent care to get a chest x-ray. grandma was still wheezing. it came back clear and was told she is just shallow breathing and try having her do deep breaths a few times a day. yesterday i got a call from her senior center that she choked on a pea at lunch. it involved abdominal thrusts and back blows to have her clear it and stop coughing. maybe 30 mins later her coughing had calmed and she could speak. i was just wondering how others handled it. i saw they can do a swallow test. if your lo had to change their food consistency was it a fight? we have a family of 6 (including her) and i'm not sure if she would eat if her meal appears different than what everyone has. we are on the search for a facility this year just because her care is mounting and i'm getting burned out. and this is a new decline i'm dreading.,"hey, sorry to hear this. they have exercises they can do with the patient to strengthen up the dysphagia. it can help. gotta watch for aspirating food. pretty typical to get left lung pneumonia from that in the elderly. for liquids, there is a product called thickit that can help. i've noticed that it's a use it or lose it thing that can accelerate like lightning with dementia. i've switched to a timed ""ok the tv goes off now and you have to read and we talk"" once a day. it has helped some. also, best thing i've done in awhile is buy a nutribullet pro with extractor blades. it's really made eating good nutritious food so much easier. i can even toss in raw carrots and puree them with beans etc and heat it up as a soup. it's really helped. best of luckedit to.add: yes, that swallow test can help as it can give them an idea how bad it is, etc. drs and providers like test results so they can dole out more services. it can make it easier for your loved one and you taking care of them. but rem you'll still have to yell at the hospital not to give them solid food. no one listens lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/t5sj5z,1

 ,"i thought it was mozzarella, which i would totally understand eating like that - until i saw the subredditname. i'm sorry your loved one is doing this to themselves :(people with dementia often experience something called agnosia. which is the inability to recognize objects (through sight, sound, taste, etc) it is quite common and extra caution should be taken to keep things that would be unsafe out of their reach. it can be very difficult with everyday objects such as soap, because it's obviously something they would need to use. i suggest finding a creative strategy with assisting with personal care. just being more mindful of their surroundings and what could potentially cause harm.uhm. . . remember to toilet them frequently for the next few hours. things might get messy.yes, i think so‚Ä¶.she is in memory care and i don't think she can get out of bed, so i am really confused. the soap is hard, but was wet from my washing my hands. it wasn't as ""bitey"" looking when it was upside down. i just noticed it when i set it down.maybe they could have left her in her wheelchair in front of the sink to wash her hands?maybe someone else wandered into her room and it was another resident that ate the soap?they *might* be teethmarks, but it also resembles the sort of erosion you see on a stone that has been under dripping water for years--if it was in the sink  and directly under a leaky faucet, for example, that could make it look like that.  the soap also looks incredibly soft/soggy, and the shape of it around the top of the ""bite"" also looks somewhat hollowed out--those would also happen if the bar has been under dripping water for a while.  what does the underside look like? from this angle, the ""bite"" out of the bottom looks considerably smaller than the top, and much less like a bitemark than the upper part.  unless your loved one has lost their sense of taste entirely, i *doubt* they're taking bites out of soap and actually eating them. it's been known to happen though, but if they have any sense of taste, they might have spit it out somewhere discreet (bathroom trash can, toilet, etc.).  depends on the person and their background though.could be. tasty.mice-rats eat soap, so maybe check for infestation.take your lo to the doctors asap. this could be very bad......",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/sx84a5,1
hi all. my dad's been suffering for a few years with dementia. he's probably at his worst in the evenings (sundowning). i try to take him out for a walk when i can but just wondering if anyone can advise anything else to try. he's on a bit of a cocktail of drugs which don't seem to be helping much. we thought maybe cbd oil might calm him but not sure if it's a good idea and might be too expensive without prescription. has anyone given a dementia sufferer cbd oil or found any other solution. thanks.,"try playing music he likes in the afternoon. i do this when my mother's sundowning acts up and it works wonders. i've created a couple different youtube playlists for this particulary.have you tried melatonin? i give my mom melatonin and keep a regular bedtime every night and wake her every day to keep a schedule going. it has helped her keep a pretty regular sleep schedule and it has seemed to help her with sundowning.one thing we do at work is try to keep lights on around them. sundowning is partially triggered by a decrease in light so if you give them a well lit place, it will hopefully help some. i've also learned that if they're in another place or time to just go with them if possible. trying to bring them back to your reality will only confuse and upset them even more.cbd gummies and oils are discussed alot on other forums/social media. some it works great and some it doesn't. if you state has cannabis stores, go and talk to them.cbd did nothing at all for my mom.  our hope was that it would relieve her constant anxiety, though, not sundowning. for sundowning, melatonin worked to help get her to sleep at a regular time (but did not help her stay asleep). activity, when she'd do it in the morning, helped with the sundowning in the afternoon. but everyone is different - it's worth a try! \[side note: cbd is not a prescription thing, at least in the us. there are tons of online sites that sell it at different price points, but they are all usually a lot cheaper than the bizarre ""got cbd"" shops that pop up in strip malls etc. look at google reviews to find a good one.\]are you in a state with medical weed?  maybe an eatable?my mom would start getting anxious and sometimes aggressive when she was sundowning...increase in confusion, forgets evening meds, etc. her neurologist gave her quetiapine for the evenings and it worked really well. instead of sleeping erratically and waking up at 2am thinking it's 10am and clattering around the kitchen, etc, she gets sleepy within an hour of taking it then sleeps 8-10hrs straight and is in a better mood. she still gets aggressive and has mood swings but they are less frequent and she seems well rested at the very least. although i would definitely get a kick out of seeing her after a thc edible...lolcontact [this]( buyers club and tell them what's going on and that price is an issue. they usually send a free bottle so you can try it. they will also give you dosage advice. tell them his age weight and what meds he is on.  they will probably recommend 3 drops 3xs a day. peace",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/svefen,1

what signs or situations made you realize they weren't able to live alone?,"when leaving his apartment in ther evening felt like leaving a 2-year-old alone in an apartment.she didn't know how to use the microwave anymore, wasn't bathing because she would always turn the shower on scalding hot so she was afraid of it, couldn't keep her stuff organized and clean, couldn't hang her clothes on hangers properly, couldn't dress properly (everything was always inside out or backwards), and the last grand finale event, turned a gas stove on to try to make tea but couldn't ignite the burner, so she was just letting it leak gas.letting strangers (solicitors) in the house, not bathing regularly, not eating properly, bills not being paid, flushing items (other than tp) down the toilet. but wait! there‚Äôs more! wandering the nhood and going into other people‚Äôs houses, trying to walk to the store (miles away) because she was no longer allowed to drive.gosh, this is hard.  i know my parents need to move to assisted living but my father doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs time yet. dad: 84. copd & pacemaker. mentally alert & caregiver to mom. traditional marriage dynamic meaning he doesn‚Äôt cook nor clean.mom: 84. dementia diagnosis at 80. has taken a few falls. osteoporosis coupled with weight loss- barely eats. very confused w/ poor memory. invents new stories. angry af & physically abusive to me (dad?) can‚Äôt perform simple meal prep tasks easily. doesn‚Äôt do her laundry (it‚Äôs getting gross) but does my dads. the kicker- she soiled herself 4 days ago & the pants are squirreled away in her room somewhere.is it terrible that i *want* a fall that requires minor medical attention so this speeds up the process in my dads hesitation.  i keep telling him that if he doesn‚Äôt move with her & something happens to him it‚Äôs going to be horrifically traumatic for everyone involved.falling and breaking her wrist was the tipping point. but before that missing paying bills, being scammed out of money, stopping bathing and brushing teeth, not caring for the house and yard at all, being uncertain where she was only a few blocks from home, forgetting her own personal history, losing weight, general confusion.ours was kind of complicated. but essentially falls was our big factor. her 2nd husband died and even prior to his death she fell a few times at their house. she was having more memory issues and didn't really cook. he was the more alert and cognitive person. without him she could not stay in a home alone safely.while my grandma's husband was still alive, we didn't notice she was having symptoms, because he would take care everything, like cooking, or they would go shopping together, etc. when he died, we immediately saw all the signs while visiting. ""suddenly"" she wasn't capable of doing anything. it just became visible after being disguised for so long. her husband didn't really realize anything was wrong either.when dad knew how to use power tools but forgot safety rules he used religiously in the past. drilling into wood on his lap and narrowly missing both thigh and power cord as i walked in, for example. this was combined with long absences when he took the dog for a walk because he got distracted and\or lost in the neighborhood he lived in for 50 years. mom had been directing him for years and we had no idea how bad it really was until she passed away.no longer allowed to drive 7 months ago, but the final straw was forgetting food cooking on the stove. thankfully, no fires; but it was only a matter of time. she's living with a daughter now.hallucinating and being convinced there were people living on her roof. neighbors calling me because she was outside in freezing temps screaming at imaginary people. when i flew up to check in, she was cooking dinner for said imaginary people.mom had been complaining about dad's memory, but, historically, mom complained about dad a lot anyway, so we took her complaints in the context of their marital history.a couple of things made it clear. the first was losing the ability to deal with his taxes. that seems pretty high level, but when he read a letter from the irs to me 3 or 4 times in a row on a single phone call like we hadn't already discussed the details, i knew something was up.dad was also always difficult about medications. he didn't like taking anything prescription, but he needed to take blood pressure meds. he obsessed over his bp and when his homeopathic and alternative treatments weren't doing the job, he started popping nitroglycerin tablets to control his bp - that only works briefly and causes more trouble when the effect wears off and the bp rebounds. so, med mismanagement, but with extra steps.interestingly, since he and mom have gone to assisted living and he's getting good med management, we think his dementia was a little better. could be the aricept too.she forgot how to use the stove and was only eating things cold from the fridge.  also, i realized that she wasn‚Äôt bathing very often anymore, and she had always loved her long daily baths.just off the top of my head, and these have all been in the past year or more, but has gotten worse the past month: she isn‚Äôt taking her meds. she doesn‚Äôt cook anymore but would gobble up snacks or any food that people brought over. her house which had been tidy and clean for 60 years, became cluttered and the toilet was dirty. she stopped getting her hair cut and she stopped wearing makeup. she claims to have showered but hasn‚Äôt. she wears the same clothes every day and they aren‚Äôt appropriate (capris in winter). she gets belligerent when encouraged to do anything, like put on a coat. she can‚Äôt work her tablet anymore or most electronic devices. her ability to operate the coffee pot went from poor to non-existent. she gets the cordless (land line) phone mixed up with the tv remote. basically she can‚Äôt operate things with multiple steps like a washing machine.my grandma accidentally killed her cat by giving her cat her (my grandma‚Äôs) medications. poor cat covered the basement of my grandmas house in vomit and diarrhea and eventually had to be put down. also she couldn‚Äôt understand medications and when or how to take them. she was cutting up her pills for no reason and placing them around the house. basically only ate pudding and made her diabetes worse. she also has diverticulitis and was unaware it flared up again until her church dragged her to the hospital.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/sgnv0o,1
"hi everyone. due to advanced dementia, my grandma needs 24/7 care which includes controlling when and what she eats. this means that we feed her at particular times every day, particular type of food (she has 0 teeth left). however, we have an issue: 1) she forgets whether she has eaten or not 2) i assume, her brain doesn't understand the feeling of being full anymore, and it seems like she is in a state of constant ""hunger"", even if she has just eaten a full meal 5 minutes ago. also, she would literally eat however much food you put on her plate, and i mean it - if she had access, she would just be eating everything non-stop in ridiculous amounts. she is roaming around and ""spying"" on us whenever we do something in the kitchen, thinking that we don't feed her. we started locking the kitchen cupboards, fridge, and the kitchen itself, because we have found her multiple times standing there and just eating plain bread in the middle of the night, etc. she never tells us that she is hungry, never asks for food, and always says ""no"" if you offer her more after she finishes her plate. but we can very clearly see that she thinks she is hungry all the time and thinks that she hasn't eaten anything for who knows how long. this makes it very hard for us to eat in peace because of her hiding around the corner and judging. it also means that we sometimes feel guilty and overfeed her. if anyone has a similar problem, how do you deal with it?","so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. do you all eat at the same time? that could help maybe and might mean you all eat together, unless she needs assistance with food. this way you can take turns maybe assisting - like one person does it one day, the other the next. she might be bored or lonely, so maybe encouraging having something to do might be good. it will get her mind off things.divide the portion into two and if she persists to want to have more, maybe give her the second portion after. fill up the plate with salad and vegetables - couldn‚Äôt / doesn‚Äôt hurt to get in some healthy 5 a day. she might be mistaking thirst for hunger. might also offer low calorie drinks too? also, leaving healthy snacks about, like fruit maybe. she can snack on those. could also speak with a doctor and dietitian or a local dementia support service as they can give specialised advise too :)talk to her dr. i have seen a few different conditions...mostly brain/neurological (and dementia could cause this)...where the function of switching hunger off/on stops working.i took care of a young guy with mental/developmental disabilities that he had no switch to turn hunger off. his family had to keep the fridge and cupboards locked like you do. if things were not locked up, he would even try to eat frozen foods and raw meat. for his condition, sadly, there was nothing more they could do than to keep things locked up and to give me meals/snacks at regular times.depending on what is causing it, there could be potential for medication and/or behavioral therapy remedies. but you will not know until a dr rules out potential underlying causes. it's a possibility if she is moving around/walking/pacing a lot, she could be burning more calories and thus hungrier. or, something with her dementia (or other cause) could have triggered a higher metabolism, and her body needs the extra calories. another thing i would recommend, even though you mentioned she sleeps a lot during the day...is to try to keep her awake during the day, and try to keep meals close to consistent in timing and size. if she sleeps all day and doesn't eat for 12 hours because she's been sleeping...of course she is going to be hungry and hunting for food, even if that time is in the middle of the night.also, as someone else mentioned...try keeping lower calorie snacks available for her to munch on. if she likes veggies, maybe have some celery, carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, etc...around for her to eat when she is hungry outside of meal times.would leaving the empty dishes sitting there serve as a reminder? i only offer this since you say she never asks for seconds. maybe seeing the empty plate in front of her reminds she she just ate. if you left it there longer, that could delay her foraging.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/se12md,1
"my mom is getting progressively more and more resistant to taking medication, especially in the evenings.we've moved what pills we can to other points in the day, but she absolutely has to take two trazodone pills just before bed, or she'll be a complete wreck the next day.the issues:trazodone is incredibly, incredibly bitter. they're ""coated,"" but it's a very thin coating that does nothing to keep the bitter taste sealed. afaik that's the only way it is available. we've been coating them in two additional coats of cake glaze (we tried a pill coat thing, but it was expensive and not great, and most pill-swallowing aids coat the mouth, not the pill, and if you think you're opening my mom's mouth and spraying stuff inside without all hell breaking loose, well...). that mostly works, except....she's started holding the pills in her mouth while swallowing her water. yeah that's right, she'll take the pill, drink the water, swallow, sit for a minute, and then spit out the pills. she's worse than my cats! due to her holding them in her mouth, the cake glaze dissolves and they're super bitter again; even though we'll give her new ones, she's more and more reluctant (understandably).she doesn't reliably eat dessert, so pudding is already iffy, and then the trazodone are so bitter that you really need excessive amounts of pudding to fully cover the taste. she has to take them right before bed, because they knock her out quick. i would be so grateful for any ideas about what to do.","my husband is a pharmacist and i asked him. he said there is an oral suspension that would be good for her. the vehicle for the suspension can vary from cherry syrup to ora sweet so bitterness wouldn't be an issue. he says you'd just need a doctor to write for a compounded suspension. there are many compounding pharmacies that can make this for you.we mixed the medicine in a small amount of raspberry or strawberry jam. then we used that jam on ice cream or even a 1/2 sandwich.google has told me that it can be made as a liquid medication. maybe her doctor can have it re-written as an oral suspension, it might be easier to hide or get her to take.there is a very bitter liquid dewormer that i had to give some of my foster dogs. we always mixed it with regular (not greek) vanilla yoghurt  because the vanilla & sweetness counteracted the bitterness. it should still work with powder. not sure if that would be different enough from pudding though. you could top it with jam, jelly, fruit, granola or cereal.perhaps consult your pharmacist about whether or not they can be crushed. the majority of our residents take them well when crushed in jam or sweet pudding (chocolate boost pudding is my go to). i usually add just enough to ensure one small bite off the spoon is necessary then i quickly follow it up with a sip of a beverage that is pleasant to them. for the most part ramping up the sweet component seems to over throw the bitter when it comes to administering meds to people in memory care so i wouldn't worry too much about it being even less appealing to her in crushed form.o hey, i saw a swallow helper thing in cvs one night (before pandemic). comes in two flavors. i thought i should look into that but never did. maybe it could help you? it might be like some version of the product thickit (?sp) that's premixed and flavored to help ""the medicine go down"". best of luck. laughed at how she hides the pills. they can get pretty sneaky loltry putting it in a small drink of something? crush it and mix it in if it can be crushed!try putting it in a small to medium glass of v8  spray whip creamtry lemonade, the tart sour taste kid good for disguising medicationthe one thing i haven't seen suggested yet is rice krispy treats. push them into the side of the treat, then pinch closed the hole. but if they're still with it enough you have to give treats several times a day so they don't know which one to avoid.big giant hugs to you. hang in there.this might be more useful for later stages. i crushed my dad's pills into a fine powder, mixed them with water, sucked them up with a needle-less syringe, and then squirted it into his mouth. this was when he was no longer able to eat or even really drink from a cup. i gave him plain water that way, too.if you crush up pills, be sure to verify with the doctor. some are time release and can actually deliver a lethal dose if crushed up.we are having the same issues with all of my moms. she was holding them in her cheek sometimes for hours, or she would chew them. my dad has asked her physician and pharmacist and they both say her pills do not come in any other form. he asked about crushing them so we hide them in stuff and was told not to do that either. its a battle 4 times a day getting her to take her pills.you might also give a sweet candy the same size as the med you used to give when you start the new protocol.  the brain will still associate the familiar action as the med she is trying to control/reject, but if it is sweet, it might make it less resistant.  this might help in the future if you have a med that can't be crushed if you can extinguish the mouth holding, and if she doesn't detect the ""reward"" of figuring out the ""trick"" she might stop doing it.(we dealt with paranoia,  so she was always suspicious she was being poisoned)apple sauce with a lot of cinnamon?been using apple sauce, works well most of the time.applesauce works great if they like it. i've been using ice cream, or baby cereal.can you put them into one larger empty pill capsule and then hide that in a sweet treat? i order 500 xprs nutra empty capsules online and shove like 4 different smaller pills into that one empty one. they come in all sizes. i‚Äôm thinking the extra capsule along with being hidden in a desert will form a bigger barrier against the bitterness of trazodone pills.like others have said, applesauce, yogurt, ice cream, sorbet. i'd follow the spoon of meds immediately with a drink of oj or lemonade. also i would think crushing them might make the bitterness more pronounced?i don‚Äôt know if it would work with trazadone, but some meds can be compounded into a transdermal cream than can be rubbed into skin. i work at a nursing home and the nurse would give one resident ‚Äúarm massages‚Äù to calm her and administer meds at the same time. i have my cat‚Äôs daily med compounded this way and i rub it into his ear. so much easier than trying to get him to take a pill!!try giving her soda with it. especially if she only gets soda around pill time she‚Äôll probably want to chug it and the pill will go right down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/sdjpac,1

 op has no idea what is yet to come.yeah, i get it. all i can say is that you will probably get used to what's happening and then things will change again.  i'm my father's full-time caregiver and i'm up close and personal with all of it. lots of tough times.small update: got a urine sample in this morning so test results should be back in a day or two. i spoke with mom's neurologist and told him *everything.*  he said it's all a hallmark of uti, so that was reassuring.  i also found out i can't up her meds if it isn't a uti, she's on the highest doses of memantine and donezepil, which is good to know.  anyway, feeling relieved a little bit.  hopefully the test results will confirm.hey! i think a lot of this is due to a uti!  i'm waiting to hear back from her pcp about an order for a urinalysis. i'll try to keep you all updated.get therapy stat. i actually started an additional day and new meds for my self and more exercise . it‚Äôs happening so fast i‚Äôve been here two weeks and every day is different. i‚Äôm currently working on selling her home and moving her close to me into a nursing home. two days ago she just took her pants off in the middle of the room for no reason. and when i asked her she said i don‚Äôt know and i said did you go to the bathroom she said no. and she didn‚Äôt she just took her pants off. it is so scary and so upsetting and i‚Äôll pray for you. in the meantime take his best care of yourself as you can! drink plenty of water sleep exercise eat well.i‚Äôm blessed that i have an asset where i can spend her money to get her really good care but there are lots of volunteer organizations that will come so you can have a break, there are daycare programs, etc. etc.you have to take time for yourself every day",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/s5tsdb,1
"my grandma used to be an amazing cook and baker.  she suffers from dementia and isn‚Äôt able to cook, or even make her own coffee anymore.  despite her condition, every time she sees me she asks what can she cook for me. when i tell her that i‚Äôm fine, she insists. comically enough, when i sometimes accept her offer (just for laughs) she would say something along the lines of ‚Äújust let me know how to make it, and i‚Äôll do it for you!‚Äù.   before every birthday she would ask me which cake i would like, in addition to her usual gift.   she always told me that i shared her sweet-tooth, and would in fact bake two cakes. one for the birthday party itself to be shared with all of the guests, and one just for me- so i could continue enjoying it for days.   my favorite cake by far was her amazing banana cake. no one in the family is able to recreate her recipe, despite our best efforts.   iphones have this feature that every so often it would make a small montage of a few random pictures of videos. today a six years old video popped up. the video showed my mom and grandma working in the kitchen, and when my grandma looked up at the camera she said ‚Äúworking on your birthday cakes!‚Äù.   i just can‚Äôt believe how far she has changed in such a short time. she is still loving and funny, but honestly, it‚Äôs not the same person.  this dieses is awful. i believe that we have the best of it because we were able to get her a full time caretaker, and have her live just next door. it‚Äôs still unbelievably difficult seeing her bewildered  and confused eyes every so often. i just miss my grandma.","i‚Äôm sorry üòû i know it‚Äôs not the same but here is an internet cake üéÇ along with some internet hugs((hugs))dementia sucks. we were full time caregiver for our dad, my 4 siblings and i, for 2 1/2 years in his home. i too am glad i have lots of pictures and videos, as do my siblings, of our dad to keep forever.demetia sucksdaddy didn't remember much toward the end, but he knew there was a ""national holiday"" coming, his 90th birthday. we bundled him up and had tee shirts made and had a drive by celebration for him, gave out cupcakes and ink pens. he was a good sport for 45 minutes.we had cake and ice cream later. his birthday was may 6, he died june 6thdementia sucksedit to updatei‚Äôm sorry!!! this is very relatable. my granny would say things like this all the time, too, right down to baking everyone a birthday cake. as they grow older they never stop being moms/grandmas and just want to be sure you‚Äôre taken care of, despite their inability to care for themselves. my granny is in a facility now due to needing a higher level of care but when i visit now she is so delighted to have company. even though it can be so hard to look into her beautiful sweet face and see those blank eyes, i always want her to feel as loved and as special as she made us feel by celebrating us when we were small :-) she‚Äôs never going to be the same person again, unfortunately. but you‚Äôll still catch glimpses of her personality so please hold out for those! i once had someone tell me ‚Äúthat isn‚Äôt your grandparent anymore‚Äù; i felt they were wrong. she‚Äôs always going to be my granny. as for your grandma, she‚Äôs doing her best, and i‚Äôm sure she feels your love :-) thank you for sharing. it‚Äôs not easy loving someone with this disease.grandmas and birthday cakes are wonderful things. not sure from your post if you have lost the recipe (and can describe it) or just need guidance on replicating the results for banana cake, but you might ping /r/old_recipies \-- they've worked miracles before.this disease dose suck! can you make the cake together? you can do some prep, pre measure and grandma can mix and help pour into the pan. hopefully create a great memory for you both‚ù§Ô∏èshe can feel the love and support you are giving her ‚ù§. she sounds like she was and is an amazing woman.many hugs to you. i know what it's like to lose someone you love in that way. with my grandmother, the special recipe was her rhubarb cobbler. she ran a hunting and fishing resort in the mountains for 40 years. we only got to visit in the summer but i counted the years until i was tall enough for baking lessons at that kitchen counter at the lodge.banana cakes and rhubarb cobbler for forever!she loves you, and her love language is cooking (as it was for my grandmother).  i might suggest that you just crave a peanut butter and jam sandwich  ((but before you suggest it, make sure those ingredients are out and available with appropriate knife for smoothing ingredients on the bread, or you might be surprised at what gets substituted !  ))",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/ryww4l,1
"so my stepdad has recently been progressing from mild dementia and has a difficult time reading and understanding labels. we share the tub/shower in my bathroom as the other 2 are just half baths, i use more products than my stepfather so i keep mine in a caddy in the shower. my mom will set up his towel and clean clothes in the bathroom for him prior to his shower and will show him where his shampoo and body wash is before he gets in the shower. about 3 weeks ago my stepfather had a shower and later told my mom he really liked the new body wash that was in the tub. my mom was a bit confused by that as he has been using the same container of body wash for a month and it is still half full. she asked him what kind of body wash it was and he said it was in a ""pretty"" purple bottle, i was in the room when he told her and i broke down laughing. the new body wash he was using is my feminine hygiene wash.his body wash is now in a separate caddy with a big r on it (first initial of his name) lol","my funny story from yesterday:my grandmother was looking at a calendar that she has just received of rescued draft horses. she keeps reading ""little giants"" instead of gentle giants. i've corrected her a few times, others let her say it. after the last correction, she went to the next page and read it as ""lentil giants."" i laughed to myself at that.dementia sucks, but somedays it's funny. my dad had dementia. one of my favorites, we went to a drive thru car wash. first i left my window down, so he asked what the hell was i thinking and we laughed. about half way thru, he said he hadda pee. i said dad, just go in your underwear(diaper), he started cracking up and said he already did!!dementia sucks, but there are some funny momentsmy mom's funniest thing is using random words. a few years ago i made brownies and she said she hoped they weren't dry. she took a bite and said, ""they aren't dry. they're...remote control!)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dementia/comments/rtwidj,1

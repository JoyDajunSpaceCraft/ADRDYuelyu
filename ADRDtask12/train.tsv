 hello! my name is ann.   my team and me are working on a 3-headed electric toothbrush which effectively cleans teeth without any complicated movements needed. we plan to adapt it for people with special needs and eldery health issues.    toothbrush concept:    1. it cleans teeth without any efforts and complicated proper movements, because the toothbrush has 3 heads, that cover the tooth from all sides at the right angle and with the right pressure. you just need to move it from tooth to tooth.    2. since the brush cleans immediately 3 sides of the tooth, it cleans much faster.   if you have any info about what should we take into account to make the toothbrush as effective as possible for people with special needs, please, click on the link below to answer some questions. i would highly appreciate if you could help us.   	0
hey all. to make a long story short, after a string of traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of alzheimer's. my great grand-mother was also affected by alzheimer's; however, she was older than my nana is now.  my nana has been divorced and my papaw is remarried to my mamaw (all these familial terms, lol). she has never hated my mamaw, maybe not liked, but never hated, though she now is certain that my mamaw and papaw got married immediately after my nana and papaw got a divorce and it burns her up. she genuinely believes it with her whole heart. to make matters worse, my nana was the one cheating on my papaw! so there's that.  i would argue that my nana is still in touch with our reality to whatever extent, but our timelines and belief of how events played out is so different. how the hell do you deal with something like this? do you play into it, knowing it's not the truth? just ignore it? arguing only upsets her.	1
i'll just quickly share my experience and advice and then a resource.  five years ago my family and i began noticing signs that my mother was having difficulty completing everyday tasks. initially, we looked at these things she was doing as quirky, elderly silliness. at the time, she was picking up my kids from school every day and they would notice that she seemed off and her driving was becoming a little more aggressive, she'd show up to school later and later, she had strange cuts on her hands and face, and one time she forgot they were in the car and went home instead of our house.  i decided to change our routine and i began picking up the kids. all good, right?  nope. basically, now that the kids weren't seeing her every day, we were no longer getting those all too important progress reports from them. we got busy with our lives, and we only spoke to her on the phone, and other some minor confusion, she seemed fine during those calls.  fast forward two weeks and her neighbor is calling us saying she is at their house telling them that there are people staying at her house, so she needs to move in with them.  we arrive to find her covered in bruises, unwashed, empty refrigerator, and untouched prescription bottles.  those final years of her life were up and down and full of resentment. she seemed angry with me, and frankly, i can't blame her.  so, now that my father-in-law has had some minor memory issues and one fall, we have had to have some difficult conversations, but i won't wait this time.  i took several online assessments, [like this one,]( as soon as i started to feel like something was off.  be proactive, get help from professionals, and take care of yourself!	0
my 71 year old mother has been dealing with alzheimer's for many years. i've been bathing her about a year now. dad turns off gas and locks doors ( supplying details to give a frame of reference ).  she often talks about going home to check on her parents (gone for 20 years) or kids (i'm her youngest at 34 years old) or whatever. she yells at my dad to take her home all the while saying their current home  is actually her house her dad got for her (it isn't).  we are managing, but what's best to say to her? when she pleads to me to pick her up and take her home? most if the time, i can change the topic and she forgets eventually, but sometimes she gets fixated. do i go pick her up and drive around? do i gently remind her she is home? do i just listen? what's best in your experiences	1
my grandma is 78 and in the 5th stage - she is conversational but mostly confused and if she's not at home she doesn't know where she is. she has a history of depression and mood swings and currently takes seroquel and aricept. lately she has been very unpredictable and upsets very easily, often walking out on her own out of anger (my grandfather follows her). she constantly threatens to take off and find a job for herself, spending hours yelling about it.  my grandfather is her sole caretaker right now, all other family are too far and/or work full time and cannot be there daily. it is very difficult for him (he is 85) and he is finding it exhausting. when she is at home she constantly wants to go out, even right after coming home, and when she is out she wants to go home. it is very sad for my grandpa as he says he can still take care of her and she can still shower/go to the bathroom by herself, but i know it is becoming unbearable especially with her typical mood swings + sundowning. she needs to be watched around the clock and he doesn't have the energy for that, now that he's taken on all the chores and cooking and cleaning.  right now, i think an in-home caretaker would make sense but i want to hear your opinions. was there a breaking point when you decided you needed to hire a caretaker or decided to move them to a care home? i am most concerned about the wandering at the moment, and giving my grandpa some respite from the daily housework. she will definitely object to it.	0
a friend of mine is currently living with her in laws, her mil is 52 with early onset alzheimer's, it has progressed a lot in the past year since being diagnosed. mil cannot work but is receiving ssdi. is it possible to find a memory care living facility for her that her husband could also be with her? i feel like it's not common in people as young as them, since neither are seniors. but they're still very much in love and attached and cannot live apart, but she of course needs help and care that the family cannot provide themselves. if anyone has any advice regarding this i'd appreciate it.	0
i’ve been in here for a while now, and i really appreciate the support i’ve gotten from you all. seriously i love you all. but i feel i’d really benefit from one person with whom i can share thoughts, feelings, and experiences with. if you feel you can be that person for met feel free to message me. thank you.	0
my grandmother, whose (likely) dementia has been worsening at an increased pace for the last two or so years, but she was always able to talk herself out of a diagnosis when at the doctors, and my grandfather was in denial about all of it. she now hasn’t been to a doctor in over a year for any reason because she doesn’t like to leave the house.   lately she has been alternating between confusing my grandpa for her abusive step father or not know who he is entirely. she would call my dad at all hours of the day and night to tell him there is a man in their house, she didn’t feel safe, and wanted to go home. my dad is always able to calm her down, so although stressful for all involved, my grandpa was still not convinced she needed medical intervention. she oftentimes thinks people are breaking into the house, someone is stealing their money, or spying on them.   my grandma walks hunched over with a cane. she can barely get around their small home on a good day. she hasn’t driven anywhere in 7 or so years. my grandpa has breathing problems and tires out easily, and often naps.   today, for the first time, my grandma left the house while he was sleeping. it is 30° and freezing rain here today, but she decided to go for a walk. a neighbor saw her down the street and took her back home. grandpa called my dad, who came over and had a hard talk about taking her to the doctor.   so, on monday they will call and make an appointment with her gp. what sort of questions should we ask in order to get the full picture and to help my grandpa understand it a little bit better? i know this isn’t going to be easy on either of them, but we want to try to make things as painless as possible. 	0
it’s been nine years now since my mom was diagnosed. since then the woman she once was is completely gone. sometimes i find myself thinking back to how she was when i was little and that woman seems like a complete stranger. i can’t believe how long ago those days were now. every now and then when i think about that i just want someone to hold me. someone to tell me that she’s ok and that she’ll be in a better place soon. i feel like i’m reaching out for someone that’s not there. it’s really hard. i know other people are going through the same thing, but that’s not really a comfort. recently someone gave me another spiritual perspective on the situation and that gave me a temporary more positive outlook on it all, but now here am, back having these negative thoughts. to everyone else going through this, i’m with you. this sucks, but we’re all in this together.	0
my dad has early onset alzheimer’s, diagnosis was about 10 years ago. he lives at home with my mom as primary caregiver and is still fairly independent although is starting to have some sporadic incontinence issues and difficultly remembering key life information. they were recently given some options for treatment of some cardiac issues that he has and i’d really like some resources to help my mom (with me supporting her) navigate the decision making process.  is anyone aware of such resources? she is connected with a social worker who she will talk with, but i was wondering if there were other books, blogs, sites that she and i could read to help understand the choices.	0
we have reached a point where mom is so confused she forgets where money is and then goes to the bank for more. yesterday she took out several thousand dollars and hid it somewhere, which she won't tell me where because she is starting to not trust anyone. so it's time to make her accounts inaccessible, i just don't know how to do it and still have her ss and pension checks go into them. how did you guys do it? i am her poa so that's not a problem.    edit: you guys are so helpful! i knew i could count on you guys to help. (((((hugs))))))	1
we are taking my grandma to a care home residence tomorrow. what are some suggestions you can offer me to make the transition easier for her and my grandfather?  we are afraid she'll realize we are leaving her there since she has some lucid moments when she gets a grasp about what's going on.  is there any way we can make it so she feels comfortable being there ?  this is a big step for us, and just want to make things go easy  for everyone .	0
"i've been living with my grandfather for 4 months as his caregiver. when i moved in he would take 1 or 2 showers per week, but now i'm lucky if i get him to take one once every 2 weeks. i'm sure this is a common problem in this community (i'm very new at this lol), and was wondering if anyone had success with certain strategies. mine is that i don't let him know how bad he smells but i will make comments like ""man what a beautiful night for a nice hot shower huh?"" and he always likes the idea of a shower, but getting him in there is difficult. it's getting embarrassing to take him out in public  edit: i'm 31m and he's 92m"	1
hi all, i'm a social worker and supporting a family dealing with early onset alzheimer's disease. the kids range from 30-15 in age and i'm struggling to find good books, links, and groups for them to connect with. any ideas? thanks for the help!	0
hey everybody, it's me again. [this was my last post in case anybody is wondering.]( it was really nice feeling supported from everyone, this sub has really become a source of comfort, advice, and knowledge for me.   i wanted to give a bit of an update. incontinence started earlier than my predictions, with the first recorded instance happening last night. i don't know if it was a full-blown accident, as it seems more like she didn't follow bathroom hygiene for a while and maybe it built up to the point of being visible? i don't know, and it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.   mil was walking around and had a large spot on the back of her pants that i pointed out to bf. he tried to talk to her about it, but it ended up with her denying and him losing his patience. she eventually took a bath and we swapped out the pants. bf was exhausted and he's been in shock pretty much all night. he doesn't want to believe that this is happening and wants to believe this is a one-off and that she still has another 6+ months before having to worry about continence issues.   bf is poa, and is feeling overwhelmed, saying he didn't realize that poa meant doing so much. i think last night was a huge eye-opener as even he realizes that fighting with his mom every day to change her underwear is a lot. he's been really sad about this latest step, understandably so. i've tried bringing him to the sub, but he says he's not ready for all that, although he appreciates it when i read some of your posts and helpful responses out loud for him.  we talked it over for a while, and he messaged his sister and we're having a small family meeting tonight after work. according to him, she hasn't been telling him all the awful details that have been happening when she takes mil out once a week. i'm not sure about this, because sil and i have talked about it multiple times. he says he was doubting both of our stories because he didn't see it, it hasn't happened to him, and that we were alone when it was happening. i pointed out that he's the one in the family that's famous for having a temper and also that he is a man and his mother has been getting increasingly sexist in the last year or so and that may be affecting the way she addresses him.  we also talked about our approaches to care. he admitted that he had been feeling like i was being a wicked witch and a bit of a dictator with trying to establish care. he also said i was being mean to his mom. i asked for clarification and explained that i keep my tone neutral and use easy to understand words when i'm asking her to do something because any other tone elicits an outburst from her as she really doesn't like authority, or me for that matter. he did acknowledge that i've never yelled at her, or sworn at her, or anything like that and that he didn't know that was why i was keeping voice low and that maybe he had misinterpreted what i was doing.  	1
i wrote this as a reminder to myself that even when i stumble and fall, i am still a dementia warrior, broken, bruised, but warring.  [oh you kings and queens of dementia](	0

i’m taking my dad to a nuero appt tomorrow. he was diagnosed with early stage alzheimer’s last august. he was told not to drive then. he has continued to drive, saying he’s fine.  tbh, i’m not sure if it’s time to pull his license or not. i don’t drive with him much. when i do, he’s ok. the last six months have been horrendous. three weeks after my dad’s diagnosis my normally stable step-mom had a full psychotic break and has been way off ever since.  she tells us stories about him and his driving, but we aren’t sure if they are true. she’s so manic and demanding that we can’t really tell the extent of his problems. we’ve really been focused on her issues way more lately as she has needed a lot more help. she was the one that ran things for the two of them and now she can’t balance her checkbook or follow a recipe.   here’s what’s has got me worried: - he has said, many times that if he can’t drive his life is over. it’s his freedom and once he loses that his life will be over.  - he has always been a struggle to deal with. he’s quite anti-social, prone to depression. he doesn’t do anything but sit at home and watch youtube videos and drive to a local drive thru for a diet pepsi most days. and my step-mom sends him to the grocery store every few days.  - my step-mom hasn’t been driving much since her break. she’s very uncomfortable behind the wheel.  - i live 45 mins away. my sister is closer. about 5 mins away. i know there are services available to take them places like the grocery store, but we aren’t sure they will use them.   ultimately i’m scared i’m going to see my father give up tomorrow. i’ve heard so many stories of people that decline terribly after they can’t drive anymore. i’m pretty sure the neurologist is going to really tell him to stop and it’s going to hit like a ton of bricks.	0
"my paternal grandfather passed away a few months ago after a brief but intense period of living with alzheimer's. he never sought treatment, and passed away from a bad fall. since it runs in the family, i'm concerned about my father. he has become increasingly forgetful, agitated, and confused. he has type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and a history of dvt, all of which he consistently takes medication for. he has a bmi around 40 and does not exercise or eat healthfully. he has not yet seen a doctor; my mother and i are preparing to speak with him tonight. he is generally resistant to speaking to medical professionals about what he considers to be ""mental"" issues, and i don't think he thinks it's a problem, just a natural effect of aging.  what would be the best way to approach the conversation with him? his symptoms are becoming more alarming each day, and i'm fearful that without early intervention and a major change in lifestyle, his prognosis will not be good. any advice about where to start and how to navigate this moving forward would be sincerely appreciated. thank you."	0
i hate to post such a sensational headline, but it really is true.  only bernie sanders will make sure medicare for all is enacted.     alzheimers research is in an exciting time, and everyone should be allowed to be cured of this disease not just the rich.	0
i come here as both a caregiver to my father and as a mental health professional who has been focusing on the impact of dementia particularly a parent's cognitive decline on adult child caregivers and their siblings.   i am a phd candidate at the university of louisiana monroe, and writing my dissertation on sibling relationships in the context of caring for parents with dementia. in particular, i am looking to explore how a parent's cognitive decline affects sibling dynamics.  i have been granted irb approval, and am looking to interview adults via skype who meet the following criteria:  \-identify as primary caregivers (or coordinate care) of parents with dementia (or any clinically significant cognitive decline)  \-have at least one sibling. 	0
he started taking seroquel at 25mg in june, then we had to increase to 50mg in september-ish after assaulted some caregivers and became agitated to the point of requiring restraints while in the hospital, and now...his symptoms have been getting steadily worse over the past two weeks or so. we've been living with him for a few months. friday night after getting his 50mg dose in the evening, around 4am he started pounding on our bedroom door, yelling and screaming, and attacked me - hit me (though not very effectively) with a metal basket, deeply scratched/gouged my arm with his nails, and left a few bruises. when he got up the next morning i was sure to give him 25mg with breakfast to try to keep him calm throughout the day as it seems like he's been waking up with hallucinations and paranoia, vs. his usual sundowning. he was still agitated and threatening by that afternoon and we had to give him 75mg in the evening to get him to calm down. this morning i had to hide his 25mg seroquel in his cereal because he was so suspicious and paranoid of me. 	0
ughhhh, i'm just very angry about the whole thing. i've been fighting with my bf for a while now about getting his mother onto a waitlist for a nursing home knowing that it'll be about 2 years before she gets placed. he has refused to and is now saying she doesn't have the low-income insurance that she needs to get onto the waitlist. i'm frustrated because he isn't doing anything to get his mom the proper care that she needs and it's going to get way worse before it gets better.  we live in a 2 bedroom apartment and the bedrooms and the bathroom is on the second floor. she's gained a lot of weight in the last year and is having trouble getting off the couch and the stairs are making her tired. i don't think she has much time left before she is unable to navigate them. she is also complaining of problems with her bowels constantly, of having diarrhea, which i suspect is her articulating that she is getting close to losing continence. bf is convinced that isn't the case and that it's simply her diet.  she is also getting increasingly aggressive. she is irritable and angry with both me and my bf's sister. she yells, swears and threatens violence. she also hurls a lot of racist statements my way (i'm asian). his sister and i are on the same page regarding her care and needs and it's frustrating that bf can't see it that way.  his biggest problem is that he doesn't want her to feel afraid and that's why he's resistant to her going anywhere. i understand his fear, but i feel that she is going to be afraid regardless and that it would be better to get her acclimated to a new environment sooner so that she has a chance to recognize her surroundings.   i worked as a nursing assistant to get through school and it's been really frustrating. i've worked in nursing homes and they're not as bad as people make them out to be. yes, they're not home, i get it, but they're not jails.   i've been trying to help him navigate the waters but he's been resistant to any help. when she was first placed on her meds, i mentioned that she should be on an antidepressant because of her behavior and to help her sleep. he eventually decided to take her off of it without telling anybody because he felt that i was too pill-happy and trying to overmedicate her. that led to a solid 2 months of her crying constantly, being angry with everybody and just having a really rough time before he realized that she really needed the meds.  i'm worried that she's going to need assistance toileting, and bathing soon and she won't let him help because he's a boy, and she's violent towards me. it's unrealistic to expect his sister to drive over constantly to help because mil is violent towards her as well. i feel like he is setting us up for failure because by the time she really really needs help, we won't be able to get help when we need it.  he told me yesterday that he'd rather the two of them move into a studio apartment and he can just deal with her so that she can die in her own bed. i'm really tempted to let him do it, but that would be a catastrophe, he has a very low patience threshold, constantly loses his temper, and isn't able to give any sort of structure to her life.   i'm just feeling like i'm watching a very slow-moving trainwreck and i'm tied to the rails.	0
hi, i am a high school student in need of some information for a project i am doing. with this project i will be writing and essay about the neurological effects of alzheimer's disease, as well as how the psychology of family members is affected when taking care of loved ones with alzheimer's.  i do not have any family members or friends to interview about this topic, but would love some feedback. i know that this can sometimes be a difficult topic to discuss, so please don't feel pressured, any responses are appreciated! 	0
"hello to everyone. i just found this reddit and i just felt the need to post. about six months ago, my 80 year old father was diagnosed with alzheimer's. we had noticed that he was forgetting when he was, and more importantly, this man who always balanced his checkbook to the penny had suddenly racked up tons of debt and had collectors calling him. shortly after the diagnosis, he was mostly ago, until about two months ago. he started falling constantly, wanted to go ""home"" (where this home was, we never knew) and was hallucinating people. it turns out he developed a uti on top of this, which made matters worse. they thankfully were able to clear that up, but it seems that the uti made him progress faster than any of us expected. we thought maybe we could do assisted living, but it turned out he needed more care than that.  so after a lot of talk and discussion, we made the choice to place him in memory care faculty. today was his move in day, and after spending about two months in an absolutely horrible wreck of a nursing care facility, he seemed much happier in the new place. he has his own room now and lots of people he can interact with. i know we made the right decision as no-one in the family could give him the proper care he needed, but i'm still a wreck. i know i shouldn't feel this way, but i feel horribly guilty about having to place him there. i have no idea why i'm having these feelings. i also am a wreck just knowing that he's slowly going to slip away and one day, he's just going to be a shell, i guess placing him there just kinda of confirmed it for me. is this normal? has anyone else gone through this?  i guess i just needed to let it out. thank you for listening."	0
"hi folks. i'm really struggling with what to do next and would love to hear from you all. this community has brought me a lot of comfort the past few months although this is my first post.   my mom's alzheimer's diagnosis was made aware to me early in 2019, and i have been watching her slowly decline further the past 6 months or so. i'm an only child who lives out of state (bout a 2 hour plane ride from her) and am her poa for medical and health, and trustee of her trust, so all decisions go to me.  when did you find it was the right time to move your loved one to full time care? i am not willing to become a full time care giver to my mom. we did not have a good relationship before her diagnosis and i have basically spent my adult life trying to recover from childhood trauma. i feel dragged back in to the dysfunction and abuse to manage her care, but have been diligent with liaising with all of her doctors, and doing my best to ensure she's getting the best care possible, implementing solutions like hiring housecleaning, homecare visits several times a week, getting pillpack, etc.   she's getting worse and worse and conversations are just cyclical like the same 30 seconds on repeat. she sits at home and watches tv, although recently she has even taken to just sitting, without even watching tv. i'm really worried she's only speeding her decline as she has very little social life and basically only interacts with her boyfriend (himself a 77 year old who does not seem to grasp the concept of this disease and how she might look the same but she is not capable of making decisions, etc.).   i have notes from 2 of her doctors right now (neuro and endocrinology) that state she is not capable of making decisions for herself and should move to assisted living. she refuses to accept this, and keeps telling me it's 10 years too soon to move. obviously, i will take her doctors' advice over her own opinion but i just don't know how to execute the move. if you talk to her she says that she's ""completely fine"" and has no health issues (she has multiple issues in addition to alzheimer's).   i guess i'm just looking to learn from you all how you executed a move for your loved one. i've toured 7 or so of memory care communities and the representatives always tell me that nobody wants to move or thinks it's their time to move. how did you do it and how did your loved one respond? i personally think that social engagement will be really good for her, but am struggling knowing she will be very upset, and that i will likely have to separate her from her dog, who she loves very much.  thanks for reading and thanks for your help."	0
my grandma who has been showing symptoms for the past 10 years or so (getting progressively worse) always feels the need to apologize for her actions/rambling/symptoms/forgetfulness.  &amp;#x200b;  it really breaks my heart, because i always let her know it doesn't bother me and i always try to brighten her mood by making some jokes about it (i've always had a joking relationship with her).  &amp;#x200b;  i'm kind of at a loss, because she has always been the type of person who is apologetic and feels like she is always a burden, even before her symptoms. i've never really had experience being around a family member with alzheimer's, outside of my great grandmother (her mother), albeit i was never really around for it.  &amp;#x200b;  i feel helpless, and i just want to communicate that her symptoms don't bother or annoy me. she's always been a sweet and caring person and i hate to see her have to apologize for something she has no control over.  &amp;#x200b;  &amp;#x200b;  regards,  &amp;#x200b;  a grandma's boy	0
hello r/alzheimers,  memory loss sucks. if you know of any person or family that suffers from dementia/alzhiemers and you live in the greater philadelphia area, please read and share this post.  i’m working to enroll participants in the continuation of a clinical trial which explores a ***non-invasive*** approach to the treatment of dementia/alzhiemer’s.   in collaboration with texas a&amp;m university’s dept. of neurosurgery, the quietmind foundation is enlisting individuals between the ages of 50 and 85 years who are experiencing memory problems and have been independently diagnosed with early to mid-stage dementia to participate in this trial.  after two successfully completed trials, this expanded trial takes place in elkins park, pa and only requires 3 visits to the location. each visit is also eligible to compensate for time and travel.  if you know anyone that might benefit from this treatment and would like to participate please feel free to send me a message or click to learn more	0

hi everyone. we lost my grandma to alzheimer’s last december and now my grandpa is progressing into mid/late stage alzheimer’s as well. he is extremely bored all the time and i want to find things for him to do. right now he pretty much just watches tv. the problem is we have gotten him word searches (his favorite pre-alz), easy puzzles, simple games, etc but he refuses to use them.   he is very stubborn and still lucid a lot of the time, so things that are too “childish” like busy boxes offend him. he is also still struggling a lot with not being able to drive.   i feel helpless because every time we talk he brings up the fact that he is so bored and can’t do anything. does anyone have any ideas how i can help? i live on the other side of the country so just visiting more isn’t currently an option.   (background info: he is about to be 87,  formerly a mechanic and handy man, mid-late stage alz, and lives in a small nursing home with round the clock care.)	1
just sitting with my emotions today and going through pictures and feeling still so much disgust at this disease. i hate it so much and i wish no one else had to watch their loved one go through it. big hugs to all of you in reddit land..., hope today is a good day for you wherever you are.	0
needing help with my wife(69) who was diagnose last january with ad. since the end of october she has had difficulty recognizing me as her husband and confusing me with someone with the same name and very similar (in her mind). it does seem to come and go but often when she doesn't recognize me she wonders where i am and where i've been. yesterday it kind of came to a head when she confronted me (she knew who i was) with where i've been. she also thinks she's not living in her home where we've lived for almost 35 years. how have some of you handled this type of thing? is it possible to ask her to identify something on she and i would know for her to understand who i am? very frustrating and any help or advice is appreciated. thanks in advance.	1
hi all, what do you guys do to keep an alzheimers person busy/interested/occupied? i know my family member does not seems phased my tv or music anymore. also a lot of things you give her she wants to eat. i try to talk with her. i wish there was something i could give her to play with. i'm not sure if i am describing this best but any idears would be great.	1
my late mother had alzheimer's for 10 years and at the time i thought i would feel little more than relief when she finally died, and that i'd already done my grieving when she lost the last vestiges of her personality; i even felt guilty about my callousness on the subject.  however when she died the grief hit like a brick. it was like the last 10 years didn't happen, and i thought about the person she used to be and all the things i missed about her, which was something i almost never did while she was still alive. it was a confusing, disjointed type of grief too, because the painful memories were from so long ago.	0
hi, i’m not sure if this is the right place to ask. i’ve been taking care of my grandma for the last 4 months. her alzheimers gets a little bit worse everyday, but so far we’ve managed.   today i noticed she doesn’t remember who i am anymore, that hurts like nothing else i felt before, but my main concern right now is that i can’t make her to take her pills.  i think maybe she doesn’t trust me since i am now a stranger. (?)  any advice would be great.  happy new year everyone.	1
"honestly a bit more of a ""just want someone to hear me""      visited my parents for christmas and my grandma in her assisted living home. i haven't for a year as the last time i did she didn't remember who i was, and it tore my heart to shreds. toughened my nerves and promised myself i would go see her this year, and it hurt just as much if not more. she remembered me a bit this time, but would instantly forget, but would say how i was quite a nice young man. i got a hug this time but it was during a "" not sure who you are"" moment.     my dad is also starting to show signs, at first i thought i was just paranoid but just in the last six months my mom has agreed he's slipping and it scares her. it scares me too and to put it lightly i've been mentally exhausted since the end of the summer. i'm an only child and the concern and worry about my dad becoming like how my grandma is, and the possibility that my mom may also, since it's her mom in the home, along with them having me later in life and being generally older (my dad is pushing 70 while i'm 24) doesn't help.     trying to cope and figure these things out but it's stressful. i've loved being an only child but at 24 i really wish i had a sibling who could help with this and not leave it all to me."	0
"been with my wife since i was 19 and had an overall happy marriage until this dreadful thing hit.   recently (last 6 months) i've become really friendly with another woman and we enjoy each other's company and are both keen to progress our ""friendship"" within the constraints of my domestic situation. i trust her implicitly.   i fully intend to be there for my wife but for the first time in a couple of years i feel genuinely alive again. i've told my adult children about it and although they don't want details, they are fine with it and want me to find a little happiness along the way, but whilst being discrete and respectful.  i'm not after permissions and validation from anyone just wanted to gather peoples thoughts on the matter, as my loneliness was starting to hurt.  thanks for reading.  reggie"	0
our specific details are below, but tl,dr: i would love to hear from others about ways that you’ve gotten your stubborn loved ones to accept in-home &amp; companion care services. what worked well? what totally failed? what recommendations do you have for getting them to accept the new normal?   our mom is entering middle stage alzheimers. she’s still highly mobile and that’s our biggest concern. she has gotten lost on walks, lost her keys on walks, got in a car with strangers that stopped (and asked her to buy them groceries…), and neighbors told us they witnessed her nearly cause an accident jay-walking across the busy road a block from her house.    my brother lives nearby, but they have three young kids, his wife is in school, and he’s got a demanding job – they help out as much as they can, but coming by daily to go on long walks simply isn’t an option.   we want to get her companion care to accompany her on walks and errands. as rapidly as we can, we want to also add homemaker care: she needs help/supervision in the kitchen, her never-stellar housekeeping skills are vastly diminished, and she’s quit doing laundry because she doesn’t want to waste water. i suspect she’ll be needing personal care within a year or so – she’s showing signs that incontinence is approaching. it is important to get her acclimated as quickly as possible.   she has so far been very resistant to outside help. for example, she lost her license a year ago &amp; we arranged for a family friend that she’s known for 20yrs, who works as a lyft driver to be her on-call ride. she only uses him for one ride a week and the rest of the time she expects someone to offer to pick her up, she’ll sometimes ask for a ride, or she just won’t go. she rejects any assistance that feels “outside” of family or church – the church folks really only give her rides to church activities.   we have so far erred on the side of trying to respect her desire for independence even though that’s resulted in a lot of wasted time and money on services she’s rejected. but we are past the point where she’s able to make good decisions for herself, so this one isn’t optional. we anticipate she’ll resist this too &amp; we’re trying to think of ways to help her accept that this is the new normal without resorting to command and control tactics.   suggestions on how to play it?	0
my grandma had alzheimer's or some form of dementia, i'm not sure if it was ever confirmed but i did unfortunately watch her mind deteriorate and run into cycles of having the came conversations over and over again.   i was wondering when would be an appropriate time/ age where i should try and get ahead of any symptoms and try to have an mri or speak to my doctor about it.	0
just learn i need to use parental controls on the tv. my mom has alzheimers, my stepfather is able to care for in their home and i try to support them both. my stepfather called me upset that their cable bill was $60 more than normal. when he called, he was told they upgrade plans. he argued with them and they took off the charges. i followed up to see why they were upgraded to the next package. the cable clerk explained that if you click on a channel not in your plan, the system prop asks if you'd like to upgrade by clicking again. this is what happened and between my mom and my stepfather, who struggles with the tv remote, i'm surprised it hasn't happened before. the clerk explained i could fix the upgrade prop with parental control options. please check your tv, this is such an easy mistake for those with alzheimers (and even without)!	0
hi everyone,  i’m looking for some advice. my grandma who has dementia/alzheimer’s ( not exactly sure)  lives with my grandpa alone together. he is her main caregiver, although she doesn’t recognize that he is her husband ( she thinks they were married at some point but not now ) and that she isn’t in her home. she will try and walk out the door to “walk and find her house”. my mother and i don’t live with them but we are close, we use a ring doorbell to see when she tries to leave and go over to help intervene although grandpa is usually able to handle it. my fear is that one day nobody will notice that shes left and we won’t be able to find her.  the thing is that she always takes her purse with her, does anyone know of a gps tracker that doesn’t need to be charged too often and works well, maybe that is compatible with an app. all suggestions are welcome.  thanks in advance!	1
my 82 year old grandmother was recently diagnosed. her long term memory is incredible, but she is completely dependent on my mom and i for day to day living. she cannot eat by herself, she cannot dress herself, she can’t put on a jacket or turn on a light switch or put her foot inside a shoe. today she walked into a fence and tried to pee inside a trashcan. my mom is a single parent and i am so worried about her. she hasn’t seen a doctor in 7 years because she has not been able to. i can see my mom burning out. she has lost her patience for caring for my grandmother and almost thinks that she is faking it sometimes. she sometimes hits her out of frustration. i don’t know what to do. i’m worried for my grandmother and my mom. my uncle does not help at all. we don’t have the heart to put her in a nursing home. how do you guys deal with the pain of watching someone deteriorate, how do you overcome caregiver burnout? i know that my moms behavior is unacceptable but i understand what has pushed her to that state.	1
i was just wondering if this is a thing or if there's something else she's picking up on. i have a pit-boxer mix and am visiting my family for the holidays. my dad (73) has been diagnosed with alzheimer's....he's of course very forgetful but also prone to making weird faces and howling...creepy laughter..etc. but when he walks into the room even not doing any of that my dog goes ballistic and barks and growls. dad never displays any hostility towards her she just acts like she's on full defense mode when he's around. is that something that anyone else experiences? thanks in advance!	0
my grandma has been dealing with alzheimer's disease for about 5 years. for the last year shes been in stage 5, she still had full sphincter control, she knew when to go to the toilet. but two nights ago she woke up wet.  i'm assuming she's stage 6 now  she's pretty far down , she's completely dependent on my grandfather. they're both 79 and i can see how it's consuming him.  she still eats and talks a lot , but lately  none of it makes any sort of sense.  i'm afraid of having to put her in a place to help my grandfather take a break for once , because she'll feel abandoned  and will probably be angry at my grandfather	0
so a couple weeks ago i made a post venting about the rough weekend i had with my mom.  well,  we went to the doctor and he changed one of her meds.  she was on lyrica for diabetic leg pain.  he changed it over to gabapentin.  after a rough couple of days with the new meds,  she is doing so much better.  anxiety is down. pain is down. she isn't acting out nearly as much and even she does its a whole lot easier to redirect her.    we also have a respite nurse coming once a week for now. getting away for some alone time is a huge help for me. thank you all for the support and kind words.    it means so damn much to me!	0
"my sister is 80 with worsening dementia. she's being well cared for in a group home near me, and i see her at least once a week. she remembers me, but not much else of the last 30 years. i'm bringing her to my house tomorrow for christmas lunch, as i have for the past two years. before that, after our parents and her husband had passed, she would cook christmas dinner and i would spend the afternoon at her house. when i talked to her today she said this would be the first year she had never made dinner, and she was stressed because she didn't have any presents. she also started to cry because they were having a christmas party at the home, and she didn't know anybody. first, she's lived there for a year and a half. second she used to be a very social, outgoing person. she didn't mind meeting and talking to new people. i understand all the changes. i'm getting used to it. but i'm worried about what will happen when i try to take her home tomorrow. once again, she'll be upset that i'm not taking her ""home,"" because she will once again be certain she has never been to the group home. i don't call her or see her as much as i used to since she's been in the home, because it always ends in tears. sometimes the home calls me because she's convinced that she's being held hostage and she's angry because they won't let her go. these things pass relatively quickly. there's some drama for about a half hour, and then they manage to redirect her and she forgets. but i feel so bad for her, wanting to go home. of course she doesn't understand that this is most likely the last home she will live in. anyway, just kind of needed to vent that. thanks for listening, and blessings and happy holidays to you and yours."	0
my mom forgets about gift cards so they never get used, and the place she lives feeds her more than she could ever eat so food is no good. we just spent 2 years liquidating and estate selling most of her stuff so i don't want to get her clutter. i have spent months trying to think of something and i'm having trouble coming up with anything. so what did you get your loved one with ad?	0
we think my mom has alzheimer's. she doesn't have a diagnosis but she's showing all the early signs, so we had her move in with us in march. most days are fine, but yesterday we got into a big fight. she picked up on an annoyed tone in my voice after she did something small but annoying that she wouldn't have done before her memory loss. she started yelling at me and i started yelling back. it got ugly. i don't know if i should have her keep living here. she gets on my and my husband's nerves, and it's been getting worse recently. we feel like she doesn't always appreciate what we do for her (provide her a free place to live with virtually no expenses), and she gets really oversensitive at times so i feel like i have to walk on eggshells to not offend her. we are expecting our first child in june and i know this situation is only going to become more stressful once we have a baby and we're not getting as much sleep.	0
i know this isn't as heavy as some of the stuff posted here, but i just needed to vent. yesterday at breakfast i was casually told that my grandad has alzheimer's. he's in his 80's so it's not a huge shock, but it still sucks. he's always been forgetful, but i guess i just didn't realise how much. he has a beach that he likes to drive down to, but it's a fair way away and recently he got so lost on his way home that the police actually had to be called because my grandma just didn't know where he was. i believe he arrived home at about 9pm. now he probably won't be able to drive down to the beach anymore (he still has to get a test to see if he can drive, but the area he's allowed to will probably be limited) and i just feel rea sad for him. he's such a great guy. he also has hearing loss, but he refuses to get hearing aids. i'm visiting my grandparents' place for christmas, i got here today and really realised how forgetful he is. and on top of that i'm not even sure he knows he has alzheimer's. anyway, well done if you're reading this far, i really just needed to vent. have a wonderful day!	0
"my father's partner has had some kind of dementia for awhile. i saw signs at least a year ago. now she gets lost on a 2 mile drive to the supermarket. she can't remember many events or activities, stays in the apartment all the time, repeats things often. can't remember my dad was in the hospital for 2 months about 3 months ago.   my dad has later stage parkinson's. he can't argue with her about her mental state or get her to understand she has something going on.  he doesn't have the energy and when he tries to talk to her she stresses him out so much his parkinsons goes into hyperdrive.  she absolutely denies a single thing wrong. her son talked to her and said maybe her hearing needs to be checked. she went to a doc with a prior conversation about the concerns by her son to the doc. he ordered an mri but she refuses to move forward. ""you all are crazy, there is nothing wrong""  anyway. i am not sure if it's so necessary to get a diagnosis but i worry because she is with dad all the time."	0
she had alzheimer’s for the past 5ish years and the decline has been fast and heartbreaking to watch. she lost so much weight. there was a time where she would scream in agony all day. she couldn’t do anything for herself and towards the end she even forgot how to eat, drink water, walk.  even though it has been five years, it feels like it all happened so fast. i remember one day she was telling my dad how she had been driving her car and somehow ended up in the middle of nowhere. and at the time, no one thought anything of it really. but after that, things subtly and gradually got worse. she would forget how to use a tv remote, forget where things were. and eventually she got diagnosed and i still didn’t really take it seriously. all old people forget stuff. but it just got worse and worse. she started to forget who my grandad was and would be aggressive towards him, she started having seizures...  it’s like my grandma was 3 different people. there’s the grandma i grew up with who was an intelligent, streetwise, quick witted lady who was the centre of our family, the glue that held us all together. then there is her as the alzheimer’s was in the early stage, the goofy, adorable, silly grandma who always thought our front step was a huge drop when it was actually tiny and giggled at silly nursery rhymes. then there was her at the late stage, an unrecognisable shell. she spent the last year of her life sat in a chair, a far off glassy look in her eye, being completely reliant on other people. i had started university by then and so i wasn’t around much. but if i’m being honest, i didn’t visit her enough. my grandad and my aunt and my cousins all had a role in taking care of her and when i was there, i felt like a spare part, useless. i was only close to my grandma, i wasn’t close to any of them and i’m a quiet person by nature, so i wouldn’t ever really have much to say. when i was there i felt so out of place...it’s so odd to feel that way when surrounded by family. as if the situation wasn’t depressing enough. not to mention it simply caused me so much pain to watch her suffer the way she did, to see her dignity taken away as people helped her use the bathroom, to see her slipping away. sometimes she would sit and just sob in agony. and that broke me completely.   i think i mourned her death long before it happened. she’d been gone a long time, her physical body just had to catch up. i’m angry that this disease exists and there are so many scumbags who will continue to roam the earth in perfect health while my beautiful grandma won’t. i am trying to hold onto the precious memories i have with her before this disease got her. i never want to forget the songs she would sing to me, the sound of her laugh, the way she would always tell me my eyes are bigger than my belly when i couldn’t finish my dinner, her beautiful smile, the way she smelt when she would hug me, the way she could fix anything, the stories she told me, the way she would always say “goodnight, god bless and remember those three little words: i love you” as she tucked me into bed.   no one will ever be able to fathom how much i loved her and how much i still do. i would give anything to hug my grandma one last time. i hope that one day i will get to do just that. goodnight god bless grandma, remember those three little words: i love you.	0
okay so with xmas coming up my moms side of the family is doing a huuge (37 people) get together at my grandparents house. they definitely have enough room for us all but there is one issue. my grandpa. for a few years now my grandpa has been suffering from alzheimer's. he has his good and bad days, but whenever there is a large crowd he just kinda shuts down. is there anything i could do to help him feel more comfortable or help him in anyway?	0
so my  mom is basically my grandma’s caregiver. she manages her money and takes care of her. so today my mother her my grandma talking to her sister who lives far away. she was telling her sister that my mom does not feed her,thats shes hungry,she(my mom) has took my card. all of this is a lie. my mother has been busting her butt trying to take care of her. my mom fixes all of her food. there are days that my mom tries and begs to make her eat something but she tells my mom shes not hungry. my mon brings her plates of food everytime she cooks.  another problem, she has been faking that her back is hurting. she leans over when someone is around but my mom has seen her walking normally during the night (my mom has a monitor in her room).   my mom and grandma live in the same yard so its not like shes being left alone for long periods of time. my uncle who is a alcoholic and is basically deaf without his hearing aid.  she sits around watching tv looking for things to order. she has ordered alot of stuff by calling. she has promised alot of people that she’ll give them money and gets mad when my mom tells her that she doesnt have the money to be giving away to people. my uncle is taking advantage of her illness by asking for money.(not the alcoholic)  my mom and i try to get her to go places all the time. ive asked her to go for a ride amd will say “ill go next week”. it comes to that week she puts it off. she wont even walking on the car porch or sit in the living room.  my main problem is thats shes telling people that shes not being fed when my mom buys or cook her food every single day  i know this isnt the place to look for professional help but i want to know what you guys suggest. i told my mom we may have to put her in the nursing home. if she keeps telling people shes not being fed this could possibly get my mother in trouble. something has to be done.	0
i posted on here a little while ago for support and man did i get it. i love you all. we’re all going through something horrific in life, but we’ve all got each other to confide in. today, i just watched harry potter with my mom. when i was young she used to read the books to me. now, whether or not she realizes what happening, it comforts me to watch the movies with her.	0
my mother was diagnosed with alzheimer’s around ten years ago. she’s is late stage now, can’t walk or talk or manage solid foods. yesterday she was the most alert i’ve seen her recently. she made prolonged eye contact with me and looked puzzled. after i talked to her for a minute or so her expression cleared and she struggled to smile. it affected me more than i thought it could have. it was such a precious moment. i thought she’d never recognise me again. maybe it’s wishful thinking on my part, but i choose to believe that even if she didn’t know exactly who i was, she was happy to see the face of someone she loved.	0
"i (20f) think my (65m) father has alzheimer's, but im not quite sure so i've come here to ask what y'all think about this. i have already told him that we need to go to the doctor and even though he's stubborn about that i think he will go sometime this week.  at around 18:00 he calls me downstairs and tells me that he's ""losing his memory"". i pressed him further and he told me that he ""forgot a conversation"" he had with a family friend that came by to our house today. so i sat there consoling him for an hour. he told me that he never felt like that before and that he couldn't remember certain things between 13:00 and 17:00. things were ""blurry"" and ""scattered"". he could remember yesterday and the days before well though apparently.  i was asleep and i thought he was too, but at midnight he calls me downstairs to the kitchen. i asked him what's wrong and he said he can't remember things. he asked me questions he already asked before today and i acted as if i haven't already heard them. he reiterated that this is the first time he's ever felt like this.  i sat there and told him that things are going to be okay along with other affirmations. we both went to bed and now i'm typing this up... if anyone has any input that would be great. thank you!"	0
she suffered a massive stroke about 6 hours ago. she is on seizure medication, is intubated, and is currently unresponsive. if she is unable to breathe on her own in 48 hours, we are going to honor her end-of-life wishes and remove all life-saving measures.   i knew this day was coming, but i'm not ready to say goodbye.	0
hi all! my grandma is starting to lose her memory (and i believe was told that she is developing alzheimers, but i'm not sure). anyway, what do i do? should i correct her? she never says she doesn't remember things, she just says things that are untrue with regards to recent, current events, and often forgets the year. for instance she thought she was 75 and not 86. she thought my brother was turning 17. he was 21. she says she didn't vote when she did. it was the week after the election. she said she hasn't been to the special exhibition at a museum. my mother took her there the week before.  i always just let the moment pass and agree with her, i.e. 'yes, it's a very interesting exhibition, you should go, i know you like that sort of stuff.'   my mum on the other hand is like:  ' remember we went last week? we went together and you said xyz.'  which approach is correct? she means a lot to me, and it pains me to see this happening to her. this is a terrible disease. the only plus side i see is that it's happening so late in life and that she had 86 good years. :)	1
my dad is in late stage alzheimer's and recently has started acting out. his doctor is ready to prescribe depakote. does anyone have any experience with a loved one using this medication for agitation? thank you for any input.	0
mom's been pretty deep in alzheimer's for a while now. at the beginning of this year she could sign her name pretty competently, now i'm not sure that she could hold a pen, let alone read, and she certainly can't sign her name. my dad's the primary caregiver, and i'm the backup. i had to give her a bath for the first time recently, which was upsetting, but it's hard to stop and consider your own emotions when there's a bone thin woman in the bathtub crying because she's cold. my sister's been pretty great, we've had serious conversations about moms decline, she's visiting frequently and making sure that she spends time with mom. my brother on the other hand has been frustrating to say the least. everytime he visits he's got his girlfriend in tow, he doesn't prioritize his family, he runs off and does touristy things with his girlfriend, and gets drunk and parties. he hasn't made time for the serious shitty conversations, and i can't express to him how frustrated i am because i haven't been alone with him in two years cause his girlfriend's always there. in the family group chat he always turns himself into the victim cause we're mean to him because we're frustrated with him and he doesn't have the emotional intelligence to figure that out, so i just confronted him about it, and he said he's gonna visit more this year, and i responded that's great and all but im beginning to doubt she'll last another year. which is true, but maybe a little too mean. i'm just upset cause really the time to have made an effort has passed but im also afraid that i hurt him cause he hasn't responded.	0
do alzheimers patients experience a deterioration in language skills of their secondary tounge? if they do remember both languages, are they aware they are speaking different languages?  my grandmother was just diagnosed and we often speak both german and english, and often switch back and forth mid conversation.	0
hey everyone. i’m here to look for a little support for how to best connect with my grandma (69yo) before she passes. she was diagnosed with alzheimer’s a few years ago, but had a recent steep decline. over the past few months, she has been in the hospital for erratic behavior and they think that she had several strokes while in the hospital (possibly due to psych meds, but that’s another story).  she’s now on hospice and can’t talk anymore. last time i saw her, she only seems to acknowledge others around her sometimes, often staring off into nothing for a while. she can’t feed herself or go to the bathroom by herself. i live a few states away, but have been trying hard to see her at least once a month. i worry every time i see her will be the last.  so christmas has always been very important to her. i feel bad not getting her anything, but i don’t know what might be appropriate for her. i thought of baking her something because we did that together, but i’ve been told she isn’t eating much. i always did crafts with her, but i can’t think of anything to make. it doesn’t have to be a gift, either, but maybe something i can do with her.	0
my grandfather is currently in the early stages of alzheimers. he is still living in a home with my grandmother, but we would like to purchase him something similar to a fitbit just in case. he currently wears a fitbit daily and charges it nightly. i am looking at an apple watch with a data plan, but didnt know if there were better options. he does not ever carry his phone with him so we need something outside of just phone tracking	1
dad's (90) facility is having a holiday party for the residents and family.  nice thing to do, however, this past weekend he tried to escape twice resulting in the facility placing a ankle monitor on him.  my father's alzheimers has him being very verbally abusive.  my fear is on this visit he will disrupt what should be an enjoyable visit for the other families.  anxiety level already increasing.	0

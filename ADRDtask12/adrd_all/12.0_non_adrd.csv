"dh and i have been the fulltime caregivers for dh's father who had a brain injury which has left him partially paralyzed for the last 12 years. he needs care for almost everything, every day of the week. that's all fine, but before covid we were at a neighbor's house and one of her friends was there. when this lady heard that we were the caretakers for my fil, she immediately said, ""oh, i know just how hard that is! i took care of my mother before she passed away!"" she then went on to tell us all about her mother, and in the telling of the story it came out that she had cared for her mom for a couple of months before she went into an assisted living facility. also, she wasn't physically disabled, she had dementia. but, she *knew* just how we felt!i remembered this event today and just needed to vent about it. thanks, i feel better!"," you are dealing with something very difficult. that lady shouldn’t have said she knows what you’re going through, but i would say to think upon her a little more kindly. i have a friend doing that right now - caring for a mother with dementia but not physically disabled- and it is very rough. every day seems like a month. there’s no gold medal for the worst experience. bless you for what you’re doing. i hope he and your husband appreciate you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/isxpkl/just_a_little_vent/,,Just a little vent
"feel like i'm struggling as a caregiver, it's such a hard situation to walk into. grandma having memory issues is difficult on its own, but now she also is suffering grief over the loss of her husband. she's having a hard time coping, and says things like she wishes she was dead too. so hard seeing my grandma, who used to be my emotional rock, declining mentally while feeling so much emotional pain.im trying my best to understand what care she needs. my grandpa was sick this whole year, that plus visiting restrictions caused by covid19 made us unaware of how bad her condition really was. she was diagnosed with mild stage alzheimers 2 years ago. after spending time with her i can see that it's gone into moderate stage. she still has most of her long term memory and is able to take care of her personal hygiene, but is too forgetful and confused to do anything else aside from walk the dog. wish she could forget seeing my grandpa after his suicide, it haunts her. the brain is so complicated.not sure if i can keep helping her. its exhausting, i have to follow her around and watch everything she does in order to keep her on track or prevent her from messing something up. she has been thriving since i've been here, and says that she appreciates my help. but i'm drained. and i am not giving enough time to myself and my college work. looking ahead, i don't know how long it will be until she needs even more care. feeling stressed and overwhelmed. any advice? am i just not cut out for this? or does everyone go through this?"," get connected with a social worker asap. this will absolutely wreck you if you do it alone. if she can financially qualify for medicaid that will help pay for care expenses either in home or a facility. ive had a lot of legal council over the last 5 years and although it varies by state, i could give you some guidance. i have been a caregiver for my 76 year old grandmother for a little over 5 years and she is now going to in home hospice today. if you aren't able to care for her long-term and she needs to go to a facility do your best to keep up visits. you never realize until it gets to the end how much you will miss them.looking back these were the absolute hardest years of my life and my grandmother has a huge list of medical conditions that have been endlessly managed during that time, including memory issues like your grandma (i started at 30 and had almost no help while also working full time). i do not regret for a second not putting her in a home. however, that is not at all the same situation for everyone and in home care long-term sometimes isn't right for you or your loved one. know all your options right away before you get too deep. also, any way you can get respite, take it. burnout is hard to bounce back from and i know it is easier said than done, but find ways to get a break. you are still in school, so you also have to consider your future. im dealing with end of life so i don't have a lot of time or emotional capacity at the moment, but i wanted to let you know i've been there and you can message me....it just might take me a bit to reply.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ir18rx/full_time_caregiving_for_my_grandma_83_with/,,Full time caregiving for my grandma (83) with dementia after the suicide of her husband.
"i recently became the full-time caregiver to my dad, who has parkinson's and dementia. during the day, he asks to get up and pee every 1-2 hours. therefore, since he can't hold his bladder for longer than two hours, we've had to start using briefs at night (attends). now we both sleep continuously throughout the night--i tried doing the ""waking up every two hours"" thing, but i was constantly tired and couldn't function during the day.this was doing the trick for a few weeks. but, for whatever reason, he's been urinating extra heavy at night recently. it soaks through his entire brief, pants, and underpad. he's drenched in urine when i wake up in the morning, and i don't like that at all.of course, he gets a shower immediately. i apply a thick layer of barrier cream to his butt before bed (currently using calmoseptine), and i also try to limit the amount of fluids he gets in the evening. however, none of this seems to help. i'm super worried about skin breakdown. any tips?#"," hi there, you may find this article helpful: [[adaptive pants]( that have a full back overlap can help with frequent changes or cleaning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/inhke3/any_tips_for_dealing_with_heavy_night_incontinence/,,Any tips for dealing with heavy night incontinence?

"i have been taking care of my mother for 10 years now, since 2010. i was an 18-yr-old only-child then, and she was a single mother whose entire family resides everywhere else in the world but where we currently are. so, there has been a steep learning curve, but i have been through a lot and i still am.one thing i can say to the young ones is to seek help even when all hope is seemingly lost. when you are feeling overwhelmed, write down questions. there are social workers in most hospitals, find them and ask them as many questions as possible. get their contact information. my mother has had a case worker assigned to her from her mental health facility, as well as her epd waiver program. i am unsure of how to get a social worker, but they are fountains of information that will help you navigate through this.a big thing i felt (and still do) was that i did not want to be a bother. i did not want to take up too much time and space. do not listen to that feeling. you may encounter a lot of ain’t-shit people - the most normal thing in the world is people not wanting to do their damn job. sometimes you must make sure they are doing their job; it is not like retail, where they can afford to slack. it is life or death, in many cases. do not allow them to play with your family’s life. never feel dumb when asking questions. take notes.where we are located, we can get home health aides covered by medicaid. an aide (not nurse practitioner, completely different) will come to your home and take care of your family member eight hours a day max, but if that isn’t enough, there’s something called the epd waiver program, which covers up to 16 hours a day depending on a 3rd party’s evaluation’s results. i believe there may be equivalents to the epd waiver program in many states, i highly suggest pursuing this option, even if there is a family support system.there are so many food delivery programs – my mom hates prepackaged meals, but they deliver fruits &amp; veggies too, for free! if you are having a hard time financially, this may help.there was a point in time where my mother needed to take 32 pills a day in total at 3-hr intervals. how i did this alone, i do not know. i got no sleep because of this, and because she was a flight risk. she is immunocompromised, still is a flight risk, but now she is wheelchair-bound, which makes the risk more manageable. 7 pills a day, twice a day. thank god. we are at a point unfortunately, where we are no longer attempting to nurse her back to health but are instead trying to maintain her current health status. there is a steady decline – she hates taking meds and can be belligerent. i am realizing that i need to start my life, my 20s are almost gone and i am ready to start a family. it is hard to deal with alone, and i find myself disassociating with the responsibility that once used to overwhelm me, which is definitely not good for her. something i struggle with currently is finding the right home for my mom. i have heard horror stories and i think i would lose my shit if anyone touched my mom or treated her unfairly. no place is good enough for my mom. does anyone have any tips to offer with finding a good home for her? she has officially been diagnosed with dementia which has opened a lot of doors that were not open before. she is only 54, and we have been rejected from many a program because of how young she is."," her age does make it extremely challenging. have you reached out to a local area agency on aging? if of a certain financial means, you could be connected to a care manager which can turn into a beacon and advocate through these tough transitions. and, even if you financially do not qualify for their care management program they tend to be a central spot in the community to learn of resources- and provide at least a list of places that could be a place for your mom based on criteria and age. your journey is one not many 20-somethings or even 40-somethings could ever understand.  i can just picture the amount of work it took to get the system to help you all along those toughest points. placing her in a home away from you will be another set of worries and advocacy than what you are doing now. there is no perfect place that will be “easy” but i find with time you will build relationships with workers and staff to make them a part of the team to share in the ups and downs of your mom’s care and life. there will always be the mediocre, burnout workers at places and this is hard to face when it’s your mom. working with those relationships you build at whatever future place is what i tend to tell families to focus on - you can look for just the bad and dwell on the bad or you can look at those trying to do the right thing and how can you advocate to the facility to make those things happen more for residents. i help families place folks in nursing homes that are often 80+ - it ain’t easy and it’s a lot of adjusting expectations and figuring out what matters the most.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/iidfx1/some_tips_i_have_learned/,,Some Tips I Have Learned

"i just wanted to leave some info for full time caregivers that i learned caring for my husband for many years.  he had alzheimer’s and dementia. some of the things i learned the hard way:1.  if your relative is getting lost while driving, you need to take the keys/ if you are worried that your person will get violent about it, ask the doctor to set up a driving test and have them take away their license. 2. you must take time for yourself.  you must allow yourself to grieve on your own and in your own way. set up some relief for yourself.3. remaining calm around your affected person is incredibly hard. try to remember to be kind, but also if you mess up, remember you are human.  there are people who understand.3.  ask for help from family or friends.  it will help4. there is a lot of stuff that you are not going to want to deal with.  i had particular trouble when my hubby’s bathroom habits left the bathroom. talk to the doctor, get help.     there is more, but everyone, as caregivers walks a different path.  the most important message i have for you is to take care of yourself too.  i didn’t, and when my husband died, two weeks or so later, i ended up in icu myself for two weeks, then rehab for a month + and i had to relearn to walk, and i was only able to stop using a wheel chair 3 months or so after the celebration of his life.  we were married for over 41 years.  i am still grieving"," sorry for your loss,  thank you for sharing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ifs7kd/taking_care_of_the_caregiver/,,Taking care of the caregiver
"my father passed away in may from complications with dementia. he’s always had hoarding tendencies, which became amplified as he aged. i often struggled as his caregiver to keep his home clean, as my adult disabled brother lived there, as well, and also contributed to the filth without helping to clean it. last year, i was at my wits end with trying to help him, as he became an increasing danger to himself and we couldn’t afford to put him in the kind of homes he needed to be in. luckily he’s a veteran, so when i found out about nursing care and pension programs through the va, i began applying. trouble is, there’s an enormous amount of paperwork needed to apply for these things, which took me months to gather, and the nursing home had a 4 year wait list. i went to every resource i could find. i even called aps in desperation for someone to help me help them, as we could only afford a caregiver for a few hours a week, and i was living 30 minutes away and working full time. i’d come over in the weekends and clean what i could, but the house would be trashed by the next weekend. dad refused to go to the hospital, wouldn’t go to the adult day care i set up for him, fought with and refused to listen to his caregiver, and even ended up hitting my mother. when i called the cops over that, i begged them and the paramedics to take him to the hospital. if i could just get him into a facility, maybe they could help me transition him elsewhere. they told me he refused to go, and wasn’t “physically” in danger, so they couldn’t take him against his will. this happened more than once. i knew their level of care was getting away from me, but i kept getting the run around from anyone i went to for help. finally aps got a public health nurse to assess my dad and somehow were able to get him into the hospital. from there, we had to 5150 him to get him into a geriatric psych ward and onto medication, as his behavior was so out of control that the nurses were struggling, and nursing homes were refusing him outright. at this point, his 2 sisters came out for a visit. a little backstory - they’ve both lived out of state for as long as i can remember, and visited rarely. i haven’t seen either of them in over 10 years. i haven’t seen my one aunt, we’ll call her j, since i was a child. anyway, they came to the house and j called me, yelling into the phone about how disgusting it was, and what have i been doing to allow this, and so on. she wouldn’t listen to me explain anything, and set her mind to the mess being a result of my laziness and not an impossible situation. she told my disabled brother that her father had been physically abusive to her, and she still treated him with more respect than i’ve treated my father. she also blamed me for not calling her for help, and when i tried to explain that i don’t know her at all and didn’t feel comfortable going to a stranger for help, she told me that was bs. she reported me to aps for financial abuse. they investigated, and of course found nothing. my parents had no money and i did my best to ensure they had what they needed regardless. i just couldn’t keep up with the mess. i feel completely overwhelmed by all of this and am wondering if anyone else has had issues with family members being mia, and then coming into a caregiving situation with no interest in facts and wreaking havoc? i’m just blown away by this entire experience, and it breaks my heart to think that my father’s sisters think i’m the caliber of person that wouldn’t bend over backwards to help my him.  unfortunately, my father’s condition worsened in the psych ward and the va nursing home we eventually got him into, and he passed away in may. i feel like i did my absolute best for him, but according to my aunts, it wasn’t good enough. i’m stuck with this incredible guilt now. i constantly question if i could have done better. maybe i should have applied for aid sooner, but i was thrust into caring for both of my parents and my disabled adult brother practically overnight. i didn’t know what i was doing. i was just trying to survive each day. anyway, i’m sorry for rambling on, i just needed to talk to someone about all this and am wondering if anyone’s been through something similar? thanks for reading this far."," hello there. first and foremost, i want to applaud you for doing your best and tell you that i admire everything you did for your dad, brother and mom. care giving is not as easy as most people think or as others make it look. it is draining, even when it is your sole responsibility. but for you, i admire how you bravely stepped up to care for your dad with dementia without knowing what is expected (from a nurse, dementia care is not easy) and still cared for a brother with a disability and your mom as well. i want you to know that you did your best and even with the passing of your dad, do not let that guilt of “you did not do enough” make you feel like it was not good enough. your actions at that time were based on what you knew, what you researched and the available/viable options. if someone feels like you should have done more, they should have stepped up and helped you. maybe they can be in a position to criticize then. but for people who you haven’t seen in ten years? oh, my friend, do not let them get the best of you, you fought like a real warrior and never gave up. i applaud and respect you for that.  secondly, family can be a source of caregiver guilt especially when they have no back story, have not been supportive in providing care or have not tried to put themselves in the caregiver’s shoes. some will come in with criticism that sounds like an “entitlement for better care” from you, blame you for not doing enough and not even want to know what you have tried so far because they are “angry” at you and the situation at hand and they will do absolutely nothing to help you when you need them. sadly, this has been your case. but i want to assure you again, you did your best. you reached out for help, you dedicated your weekends to clean the house while still working full-time and providing/caring for them. you are a hero to be honest. do not let your absentee aunts make you feel like you did nothing when they do not even want to listen to the efforts you made. do not allow them to belittle your efforts while they were away for ten years and you were still trying to maintain your sanity and still be the best caregiver. do not. if it is necessary, distance yourself from them. if they were a little accommodating and were willing to listen to what you did, then you can try and make amends, but that is not the case. sometimes even family can be toxic and for your own peace of mind, cutting them off is often the right thing to do. if you feel like their criticism or the caregiver guilt has really affected you psychologically, seek therapy or talk to someone in the care profession. sometimes you just need to talk/vent it out so that you can move on in peace. this will help you block them out even when they come back with the criticism, because you know and believe that you did your best and gave your all!!! i sincerely admire your resilience. chin up, smile and focus on yourself. you are such a champ!!! sending heroic hugs your way❤️❤️❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/iffzfa/judgement_from_family_has_broken_my_heart/,,[deleted by user]

"my mom; who has diabetes, late stage kidney disease, and whose dementia is progressing; has had some real struggles managing her treatments. just this year alone she’s been hospitalized twice - staying in the hospital over five days both times. she had a string of incidents where blood sugar has dropped dangerously low causing us to have to call 911 every day consecutively for three days straight. she has difficulty organizing her medications and since she started dialysis in february has been reluctant to attend regularly. she lives with my dad (her husband) who isn’t particularly competent in her care, but does get her to doctors appointments and tries to urge her to go to dialysis. because of the dementia i don’t think she really understands how important dialysis is and she bites my dad’s head off if he tries to push her to go. as a matter of fact, she gets incredibly mean, snippy and unreasonable with my dad for just about anything these days. i’m guessing it’s because of the nature of their relationship and the dementia. she’s currently in the hospital and has been there since sunday because she missed dialysis every day that week. my dad tried to convince her but she wouldn’t go. this week has been tough for her health as she’s suffering from fluid build up but the doctors are ready to release her as long as she has adequate rehabilitation care. doctors gave us 2 options:  24 hr care at home or short term stay at a nursing home. because of my parents finances, they can’t afford additional nursing help at home and it’s not covered under her current insurance. however her insurance would cover up to 100 days in a nursing home facility. my sister and i think the nursing home is the best option because the 24 hr care would fall solely on my father. however my dad disagrees and wants her to come home and insists that he will manage her medication, convince her to go to dialysis, and be her 24 hr care person. here’s why that’s a problem:  my dad is not suited to be a caregiver at all and even if he were my mom doesn’t listen to him. he’s had years to step up and be an adequate caregiver to her but he hasn’t quite done it. i would describe my dad as a person with so/so standards where “well enough” is all he’ll give as long as it doesn’t inconvenience him too much. she’s been struggling with medication for years and he hasn’t stepped in. with dialysis he hasn’t been able to get her to go, not really his fault but the facts still stand. i don’t think he fully grasps what a large undertaking 24 hr care is and when my sister and i tried to reason with him, he still insisted he could provide her care. he doesn’t even know who her doctors are as he’s been peripherally involved. doctors have told him face to face for years that he needs to help but because he’s stuck in his ways and only wants to do things his way that won’t inconvenience him. he does bare minimum at best. that’s why i have gotten involved but i can only do so much because i don’t live in the same city. i think he will do 24 hr care and leave her alone when it’s clearly stated that she can’t be alone during this rehabilitation time. additionally my mom doesn’t listen to him and is literally losing her mind. he thinks she sees the light now. i think dementia will continue to cloud her good judgment.is there anything i can do? i was thinking i’d talk to the hospital social worker and the doctor and ask if they can reason with my dad. i can think of two medical professionals that have documented requests of asking him to help but he just hasn’t. i don’t have legal rights to do anything but i want the best for my mom and i want to convince my dad that he’s in over his head. i don’t want to create strife in the family either. what can i do?tldr:  my dad is insisting that he can offer rehabilitative care to my mom when he has a track record of doing the opposite. how can i do something about this?", you definitely need to seek help from local medicaid. i hope that way you could get some assistance.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/idq9wx/how_can_i_convince_my_dad_that_hes_not_fit_to_be/,,How can I convince my dad that he’s not fit to be moms caregiver?

"i live with my older sister, and i'm the sole caregiver to our parents. my dad has dementia and limited mobility, so he requires constant and frequent care. it's backbreaking work, and i'm in pain constantly (and i'm only 24). i'm also the only one who ever cooks or cleans (because if i don't cook, then my parents can't eat). thus, our house looks like shit, because i'm usually in too much pain at the end of the day to do anything but bare-minimum cleaning (dishes, laundry, trash).i get the impression that, because my sister works full-time, she thinks i have it easy. although, she'll be the first person to tell you that her job is easy, and she can even read/sleep/play video games while doing it. it's a completely remote job, as we're all quarantining. she spends all her free-time in her room talking to friends, watching shows, and playing video games. meanwhile, i can barely even get sleep because dad needs to pee every hour, even at night.when i ask her to help me with anything, like empty the trash, she rolls her eyes and huffs. as if i'm inconveniencing her by asking for 5 minutes of her time. she asks like a child, yet she's 12 years older than me. it's getting so old having no help, but feeling as if i'm expected to do all the chores on top of care. what's worse is i have literally no one to vent to, except reddit.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/i6a7fr/no_one_to_vent_to_and_no_help_with_chores/,,"No one to vent to, and no help with chores"
"to all the people who are caregiver, to relatives or spouses, please try to find any way to get access to mental care. i am sure the sub has great advice on that.i took care of my grandma with dementia from 19 years old until 24 years old. the last 8 months were hell on hearth, she was angry, unstable and mean. another person.i took care of my uncle from 24 years old until 27 years old. he was schizophrenic, mentally disturbed and had a long list of crimes. he tried to stab me once, and managed to beat me up until i lost conscious. this is the reality of caring at such a young age in extreme poor area, you just have to continue to move and can't stop. when you bury them and say goodbyes, then you are left by yourself and your mind and mental health just collapse of tiredness. so, do not behave like me. do not underestimate the trauma that you are living, the consequences on your body, the sleep issues and the anxiety that transform itself in panic attack every other day. talk to a friend, a relative, a partner. talk to your doctor, therapist or nurse. do not brush it off. the consequences could be too hard to handle later on."," this is so relevant to all of us. i would say i'm lucky, my care burden is very light, but emotionally i feel like i am dying. even with resources, i have no help. i am completely alone. problems keep escalating due to misunderstandings, and my relative thinks of me as an enemy and refuses to compromise. my mental health is a disaster and franklyi don't know how i'm still functioning. i've been attacked so much and i have literally no options. this living situation is going to last years. there is no proof of what goes on here. no neutral third party. it was like this even without the pandemic. i have a very strong support system but that doesn't change what it's like at home.but it helps to know i'm not the only one. i'm sorry so many of us receive aggression for no reason, some of us from people with no mental or cognitive deficiencies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/i2lruk/to_all_of_you_that_are_caregiver_for_relatives/,,"To all of you that are caregiver for relatives, please keep your mental health a top priority.

"my father has parkinson's with a very rapid onset of dementia. he has very limited mobility and is incontinent at night, so he wears diapers.all night, every night, he yells. it's very high-pitched like having a newborn baby, or like a siren, i haven't gotten a good night's sleep in months. it's out of fear, which breaks my heart. but at the same time, if i can't get sleep, then how am i supposed to care for him? if i wake up and comfort him, he starts yelling again as soon as i leave.he's on some meds for his dementia, but no combo of meds we've tried have touched this issue. anyone go through something similar? what helped?"," have you tried anti-anxiety meds?  my dad has parkinson’s and one of his biggest issues is anxiety.  we even had to have an ambulance take him to er for back pain because he was in agony, x-ray & mri, a lot of pain medicine - nothing.  i suggested a xanax, problem solved.  anxiety shows in all kinds of ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/i1p732/anyone_have_a_parent_that_yells_throughout_the/,,Anyone have a parent that yells throughout the night?
"it will be a year now since dad was diagnosed with dementia (a complication of his parkinson's) and started requiring care. since that time, he went from taking care of himself completely, to barely being able to move at all. he currently can't stand up, stand in place, or walk without assistance.he can walk very slowly, but you have to hold both his hands (otherwise he falls). toileting and dressing have become difficult for this reason. he couldn't stand long enough for me to pull up his pants, so he's had to go with just a brief today. he starts falling as soon as i let go of him, and it's killing my back having to hold onto him/pull him up, etc.we're working on getting a medical bed for him (he sleeps in a recliner by choice) so that i can provde real decent care without having to worry about falls. although turning him might still hurt my back, it's the safer alternative. (also, i know turning pads help a lot, but do y'all have any more tips for turning people to provide care without hurting one's back?)to people who went through similar declines in abilities, how did you continue providing care without risking injury to both loved one and caregiver?"," i have had no back trouble just using a draw sheet.  just be mindful of posture and core support on your body.  i've been doing this almost 2 years and no trouble (though i am only 35, have no previous back injuries and in a healthy weight range).  as the other poster said, outside help is big but my mom is not on medicare yet so i have managed with very little help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/i0t7oz/caring_for_a_person_who_is_losing_their_ability/,,Caring for a person who is losing their ability to walk/move
"(this is purely a long vent as i have no one to talk to, so apologies.)i'm at the point where i just can't deal with it anymore.my father has parkinson's and dementia. he has extremely limited mobilty and can't walk/stand for very long. taking him to the bathroom and showering him have become rapidly more difficult in a short window of time, and our previous methods simply aren't holding up any more.i was just attempting to shower him, and he could barely stand at all. he also kept shitting. it just kept coming out, and i didn't have any baby wipes on hand. only toilet paper. there was no trash can either, so i had no where to put it except the toilet. it kept coming, so i had to keep wiping, else it would've ended up on the floor. then i hurried to sit him back on the shower chair before his legs gave out.i finished up his shower quickly, which was extremely difficult and insufficient (but i was about to pass out). all the while he kept shitting. then i dressed him and walked him out of the bathroom.before i had a chance to walk back to the bathroom and 1.) scoop the shitty toilet paper out of the toilet and 2.) cklean up the shit from the shower, my brother (the owner of the house) walks into the bathroom. he immediately starts cursing and yelling at me about the pile of toilet paper in the toilet.it turned into a heated yelling match. i told him i did my best and i couldn't help that dad wouldn't stop shitting, i didn't have anywhere to put it, and that i was going to clean it up when i was done. he told me to use my brain, and then he said ""move out"" if you're that dumb.was i in the wrong here? i didn't think i did something so terrible that i deserve to be yelled at. if i hadn't wiped his ass, then he would have shit all over the floor, which would've pissed my bro off even more. he's since apologized for yelling, but not for the hurtful things he said. i'm having a really difficult time being the sole caregiver to our parents, and i don't think he sees that. i've locked myself in my room and i can't stop crying."," first things first: your brother is an ass. if what you are doing day in and day out was easy, he’d be doing it himself. that being said, taking care of a parent with parkinson’s and dementia is a full time, extremely hard job. you’re doing that and caring for your mom at the same time and it’s got to be unbelievably draining on you both physically and mentally. getting yelled at while you’re doing your best is an asshole thing fir your brother to do. i would recommend that you sit down with your brother and let him know how hard this is on you. if you don’t think he’ll listen or take you seriously, write him a letter explaining how you feel and how hard it is to do what you’re doing every day. you need some help, not someone yelling at you. finally, crying is ok. dry your tears, straighten your crown, and handle it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/hz3c4h/need_to_vent_because_im_on_the_verge_of_a_nervous/,,Need to vent because I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown
"my dad has parkinson's, dementia, and diabetes. which means he needs to peed every hour or so, and if you don't get him up, he'll start yelling/pee himself. my mom and i were taking care of him on and off together, which is hard enough. however, she recently hurt herself (caring for him) and is out of commission for a while. which means i've been promoted to full-time carer.since his mobility is so limited, he can barely walk. we have a life chair, but it's still like dead weight when you stand him up from a chair. gait belts don't help at all. and he's so unsteady while walking that he stumbles, which in turn jerks my back and hurts even more. it's fucking killing my back. i'm so exhausted and terrified that i'll ruin my back for life (i'm only 23). mom refuses to send him to a nursing home because she worries he'll be mistreated (she worked in a nursing home and confirms he would not be treated well, since he's so loud and demanding). home health cnas only come for baths. we're still left toileting, dressing, and taking him to appointments. it's only getting harder, as his mobility keeps declining.do you guys have any tips or advice?"," check with some of the “foundations” in your area. the arthritis foundation in my town had all kinds of medical equipment that they loaned out for free, including hoyer lifts.  i was amazed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/hy3ezb/having_to_lift_my_dad_up_constantly_worried_im/,,"Having to lift my dad up constantly, worried I'm going to mess up my back for life"
"to start i live in england and recently my grandfather has become extremely paranoid and has made multiple attempts to kill us aswell as many threats this seems to be due to him having damage from a stroke last year aswell as cancer in his kidney and he's displaying symptoms of alzheimers (that hasn't been diagnosed but speculated by us and his doctor).he isn't physical stong enough to hurt us via his previous attempts (strangulation being his most common so far) however he has set traps where he looks defenceless but hides weapons - luckily we spotted them before hand. he doesn't sleep much as he believes we would kill him in his sleep instead he'll make blood curdling screams for help aswell as shout abuse all throughout the day and night. this usually stops when the nurses or anyone else arrives so we taped him and showed it however that didn't do anything.most of us are sleep deprived and yet even though he barely sleeps he seems to never run out of energy.all it would take is for him to find the right moment and i believe he could really hurt someone or himself. it took 3 of us to remove his walking stick cane (which he had used to attempt to strangle my auntie while she was eating) and 2 of us to remove a butter knife (it couldn't do much but if he ever got hold of a sharper knife well that would be worrying).we've hid stuff but he has his ways - today we found him with a long strap of fabric which he said he would use to strangle us or the nurse.he has some troubles moving but he also fakes some of it - i think to try and trick us.we just want help but everyone keeps refering us to the next person and it's going around in circles. i just don't want anything to happen, any suggestions on where to go with this? am i overreacting? is there a better place to post/ask this question? his attacks have all became more common the past couple of days the screaming/lack of sleep has been going for for over a year. i understand solutions take time but i just wanted to know if there is anything out there that could help?thank you for reading!"," if he's trying to murder you, he needs hospitalization.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/hxe40n/where_to_go_when_no_one_seems_to_help/,,Where to go when no one seems to help?
"i’m an in-home caregiver through an agency, and i’ve  been taking care of a 97-year-old woman for several months. her daughter (in her 70s) set up the service, but the client insists that she “doesn’t need” me, telling me to leave and that she’s perfectly independent. (she’s not, and she really needs someone there.) while the daughter was able to recognize that her mother was not able to take care of herself and seek assistance, she hasn’t acknowledged that her mother is showing signs of dementia (doesn’t know day/time/year/location most days, short term memory loss, doesn’t respond properly in conversation) and denies it whenever i or my manager bring it up. it’s a very sensitive subject. despite the client’s initial disdain of my presence, we’ve built a pretty good relationship, and we get along very well. she thinks i’m the “cleaning lady” who just happens to cook and do her hair, too. i’m going to be moving out of state soon, and i told my client this and that next monday would be my last day with her. she said she’d miss me, and she thanked me for everything i’ve done. i said i’d miss her too and that i’d see her the next day, and i left. later, she told her daughter that i had asked her to “take me out” and spend $$$ on me on my last day. understandably, the daughter called the office upset and spoke with my manager. i was able to explain that that was simply untrue, but the daughter maintained that i had attempted to manipulate and pressure her mother into spending money on me. the client had also said that i never wore a mask during my visits, which is absolutely false. my manager believes me, but i’ve been taken off of this client, and my hours have been significantly cut.  while i understand that the client cannot help misremembering things, i feel hurt that her daughter chooses not to give me the benefit of the doubt, after i feel i’ve provided excellent care to her mother for these past several months. i also feel that her willful ignorance of her mother’s condition is partly to blame, and it does everybody involved more harm than good. everybody says not to take it personally, but it’s very hard not to, when my integrity and my honesty are being questioned. i feel very hurt. how do you deal with these false accusations?"," you get a lawyer, that's how you deal with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/hwv3v4/client_w_dementia_falsely_accused_me_of_financial/,,Client w/ dementia falsely accused me of financial manipulation
"my grandparents moved in with us when i was 12-13. i became more of an ""official"" caregiver at 17 to my grandma after we no longer felt safe with the idea of her trying to bathe herself. her husband passed when i was around 18 (6ish years ago) and she hasn't fully been herself since. i don't blame her for the depression, though i've felt bitter towards her for some of her tantrums and more manipulative or flat out defiant behavior. even then i try to just tell myself it's the dementia and move on. it felt like parenting a stubborn child sometimes.about a month ago she got an infection and had to be taken to the hospital. she has been staying in a nursing facility since. due to covid we haven't been able to see her in person, just phone calls and 2 face times. had a video chat with her and her primary doctor and came to the conclusion that if she took a turn for the worst she wanted to pass at home.well, a few weeks later it looks like this is the case. i don't know, maybe i thought i'd have more time - if only a couple more weeks. now we're moving furniture and getting everything ready for hospice and the hospital bed and all that. i don't feel ready to see her in person again. she's barely eating and i'm told she's very thin and weak. i've gotten her clothes ready for the funeral. the doctor says she has 2 months max unless there's a change. i don't feel ready to start caregiving again, as selfish as it sounds. while she's been gone i had just begun to catch my breath and now as soon as i've gotten a gulp of air i'm diving back down again. we're going to take shifts staying with her and i can't help wondering which of us is going to be there when she goes. or worse, find her already gone. either way, the thought does things to my stomach. i don't know how to prepare for the end. just going to keep praying."," i'm sorry you are going through this. i don't have any words of wisdom, but i want you to know you are heard and my heart and sympathies go out to you and your family. you are human and it's difficult caring for sick family members.. i will keep you all in my prayers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/hudvga/after_3_strokes_and_2_heart_attacks_its_finally/,,"After 3 strokes and 2 heart attacks, it's finally coming to a close.

(we have an aide who helps out during the day and could hire another aide for night shifts but are reluctant to do that, for both cost and covid reasons.) i've been looking into door alarms, but there's a bewildering array, and many of them have the issue that the noise they make is described as scary or alarming, which won't work with him. if he tries to open the door and a loud alarm blares, he's going to go even further 'round the bend.anyone have experience with this and can make some recs? thanks!", smart caregiver has a wireless alarm system that has door and window alarms along with floor pads and chair and bed pads that instead of making a noise in the room or at the doors send a signal to a separate box or pager with the caregiver so as to not startle.we have it at our house for a loved one with alzheimer’s and it works well. the system isn’t very “sleek” looking but it gets the job done and seems to have a pretty good range. we have two story house and most of the alarms are on the first floor and the box is in an upstairs bedroom and we haven’t had any issues with range. also the system isn’t dependent on internet and the alarms are all battery powered on the monitor box can have battery backup also. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ht1v4e/door_alarm_recommendations/,,Door alarm recommendations

"my boyfriend has bpd and bipolar disorder. under covid especially (but honestly before then as well), there’s been a high need for communication, on his end. enter my dad, who has frontotemporal dementia. also obviously very high need, and very hands on. he’s been living with us through the pandemic because he gets lost and would not know how to handle covid. also working out some medical issues, not sure if he’s ok to be on his own. it’s a small space. i have been prioritizing my dad, because he’s got complicating health concerns (i’ve had to deal with his cardiologist, urologist, and geriatrician pretty regularly. working on a med regime where all three systems are ok, there are hiccups. just want him healthy and stable.) plus my dad has restless roaming, so we need to go for walks a couple times a day to burn him out so he’s tired enough to not pace. plus i’ve been doing all the cooking lately (boyfriend would and normally does, plus he usually does most of the cleaning, it’s just the place is so small he doesn’t feel comfortable with my dad underfoot.) boyfriend sometimes gets jealous? not his fault really, he’s used to getting a lot more attention. i feel like i’m always letting someone down. i’m stressed, mostly because i worry my dad will irritate my boyfriend (my dad repeats himself a lot, part of the disorder). and i’m on my feet all day. i have arthritis - lots of foot, knee and back problems. i do have pain meds and actually the walking is turning out to be good for me. but i do get tired. at night i want to zone out when my dad goes to sleep, boyfriend wants more couple time... boyfriend also is starting to lose it being cooped up in here with or without my father, depression is definitely knocking on the door when it isn’t present. i worry about him, too.taking care of my dad is actually no problem. sure he wants to move all day, but he’s otherwise easygoing, easy to be with. and i am happy to do it because it’s helping me deal with guilt from not being able to do more for him sooner. (before he lost capacity, before diagnosis, he suffered a lot and legally no one could make him get help.)taking care of the *two* of them might be doing me in :/ literally the only self care i can get in is a shower, once my dad’s properly asleep and not a flight risk. my boyfriend visited family for a night and my shoulders dropped for the first time in ages. he is more demanding than my dad. i love him, i do. but - although he’s made a ton of progress, with his amazing medical team behind him- his trip still isn’t  an easy one, and not just for him. (part of me is like, wtf would you do if i were working right now?)"," my 8 year marriage ended as a result of caring for my parents (both mom with dementia and dad with parkinsons). he cheated because “i didn’t have enough time for him”. i knew as time progressed i’d have even less time for him and i’d never trust him again, so i divorced him. my husband was quite needy but fully capable of caring for himself, but simply wasn’t mature enough to do so. he would make me feel horrible about myself because i couldn’t juggle a full time job, my children, my parents, plus all the cooking and cleaning. he’d give every excuse not to help.  my parents couldn’t care for themselves, and he knew all along that i intended to care for them when the reached an age where they needed me to.in some ways it was a blessing because i no longer had the stress of being a “mom to a husband”, however in other ways there’s obviously times i miss romance. it’s been 3 years now. honestly, at this point, i can’t imaging trying to have a relationship because i just don’t have the time for one. i’m not suggesting you leave your bf, and i’m not suggesting you stop caring for your father. this is all something you will have to figure out on your own. i am suggesting that try to figure out the order of importance in your life. personally, i try to make decisions based on not having major regrets later. for me, i knew i would most regret not taking care of my parents. i also know and very much respect caregivers who knew they would most regret losing their husband, and acted accordingly.i wish you luck, clarity, and serenity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/hig7jh/torn_between_parent_and_partner/,,Torn between parent and partner

"i’m a 22f college student who lives at home during the summers with both my parents and my 82 y.o grandmother. i am almost certain she is in the beginning stages of dementia as she is exhibiting both rapid cognitive decline and obsessive tendencies/behaviors. i also work at a res. school for kids with severe trauma and behavioral needs. it’s a really stressful job with an extremely high turnover rate but i still love it. however there are somedays that it is all too much. for bg, my grandma moved in with us around seven years ago after my grandfather died. unfortunately, the day he died she completely stopped living. for about five years her life was limited to only going to the grocery store, the drug store, watching tv, and visiting our relatives at least twice a month. about two years ago in june, she stopped being able to drive due to spinal stenosis and the pain medications she took for it. for months she could hardly move, until they realized she needed a hip replacement before they could do anything for her spine. she got the hip replacement and was in a rehab for about a month. ok, done. we get her out of the rehab and finally home but are told she has cancer in her breast and lymphnodes. they tell her (rightfully so) she is too old for chemo and needs to have a mastectomy. ok, done. she gets the mastectomy and my parents and i switch off caring for her and taking her to daily doctors apts. we are told she has some cancer cells remaining in her lymph nodes but that medication will stop it from growing for at least a few years. ok, done. at this point, it is february and she has hardly left the house for anything other than a hospital in months. the difference in her brain from june to february was both scary and depressing. still nothing is done for her spine either.so now it’s a year and a half later. my grandmother is still capable of doing a good amount of things: she can walk short distance with a wheeler, she can bathe/dress herself, she can empty some things from the dishwasher, and she is (slightly) capable of using her ipad. what she can’t do anymore is: cook, clean, use the microwave, change channels on the remote, keep track of medications, drive, or use any kind of critical thinking. as much as i love her, she is unbelievably ungrateful for all we do for her. when she wants something, it has to be right away or else she gets upset. she doesn’t even like the fact i go to school because she would rather i stay home to care for her.due to covid, she has spent the last four months inside the house. my parents have been working from home which she got very used too. my dad recently went back to the office and my mom is away from home right now taking care of my grandfather who just had a stroke (another thing i’m stressed about). this means for the last two weeks i have been the sole one caring for her on top of my very chaotic job. yesterday we got in a tiff when i couldn’t help but get visibly annoyed at her for something small (she had just been following me around, asking about every little thing i did all morning). she wouldn’t stop asking why i was annoyed and i told her i just needed some space. she told me she clearly “thinks too much of me” and will “never ask a single thing of me again” and that she would go sit in her chair and “shut up like the useless old lady she is”. i started crying on the spot because i already know her life is miserable and i feel awful every time i even get annoyed with her. she is extremely passive aggressive and jealous of younger people (which she admits to). last week i was late to work twice because i completely forgot what day it was. i’ve been unbelievably agitated the last two weeks. my brain feels like it is in a complete fog. it didn’t occur to me till yesterday that this could be cg burnout, but i feel like i have no right to complain. there are people who spend decades of their lives caring for people who can’t dress or bathe themselves. i don’t know if it is because of the job i work that i am burning out so easy. maybe i need advice or maybe i just needed to vent. and maybe i’m not so mad at her as i am mad about what’s happened to her. i’m not sure yet. either way if you’ve read this entire thing... thank you and i apologize for the earful!also, for a quick reference of what i mean by a chaotic job: i came about a quarter of an inch from losing my eye a few weeks ago when a student tried to stab it with a pencil. now i have a nasty scar right next to my eye. i’ve also been spit on, bitten, punched, kicked, peed on, you name it lol."," you suck it up until you can't. the important part is figuring out when/where ""you can't"" starts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/hgmi68/both_my_job_and_home_life_are_centered_around/,,Both my job and home life are centered around caregiving but i feel like I have no right to be so stressed

"i'm so angry and frustrated that i yearn for the day she comes back so i can fucking give her a piece of my mind!i'm just gonna give a quick background: since 2018 i (23f) am taking care of my dad (79m), i'm his only child and since he and my mom divorced i came to live in another city with her. when he got sick in 2018, none of his siblings told me anything about it (including him) despite me talking regularly on the phone with him. they hid it from me (and later of course blamed me 'for not caring about him). when i found out he wasn't even walking and was bedridden for at least a couple months (and in a very bad shape because his siblings weren't even taking properly care of him - they didn't cut his hair or nails, he had deep bedsore wounds, was constantly in pain, very thin,  they didn't even change his sheets for 3-4 days, horrible horrible situation) i flew to the city he lived and after 3 long and arduous months of caring for him, doing physiotherapy and managing to get him slightly better (and not thanks to my uncooperative uncles and aunts) i decided to bring him to live with me. that started a huge fight with one of my uncles and this other aunt and i basically had to argue with them on a daily basis so they could leave me alone. they hardly helped and i was never too much close with my dad's side of the family as most of them are just horrible people.moving forward a bit. my dad came to live with me and he only has a sister living in my town (my dad has like 7 siblings). i never asked for money or any help from them also because they didn't even want to help me taking care of my dad. when we arrived here, this aunt never looked for us. or any other family he has. but they all knew he was living here with me. last year in february she finally looked for us (after we were already living here for 6 months) and started 'visiting' (coming 1 day in two weeks or sometimes even 1 month). the problem is, she's a very fake and hateful person and every time she comes to visit she would talk bad things about me behind my back to the woman who also helps me take care of my dad. my aunt doesn't have the courage to say anything in front of me but is always badmouthing me to my dad's caregiver and of course the woman tells me everything. i don't know if my aunt's really that stupid and thinks she never tells me anything or she does this on purpose bc she knows the woman will tell me. maybe to get a reaction out of me or something.for an entire year i always knew she badmouthed me saying things like ""i'm killing my dad"" and ""we're letting him go hungry"" and ""he's gonna die bc we don't give him food"" etc and many things she makes up in that crazy head of hers, and i never said anything to her indicating i knew of the things she keeps saying behind my back. i always avoided any kind of confrontation with her but now i'm fucking done with this bitch.my dad always helped his siblings even well into adulthood as he is their oldest brother and always felt the need to 'take care of them' even more than he even took care or worried about me. he never sees anything bad his brothers and sisters do and always defended them, even before he had dementia. so he's also kinda useless into this and always plays into the things his sister makes up leaving us almost always in a bad environment after she comes to visit. and she keeps doing this always. she doesn't help with anything about taking care of him, always runs away when we need to do things like bathing him and changing his diapers but somehow loves to criticize everything. i never asked her for a penny, not to pay any meds (which are fucking expensive) or even when my dad was in the hospital, i paid for the entire hospital bill and none of his siblings even offered to help with literally anything. also, i really don't consider these people my family honestly. they've only tried to sabotage me and fight with me and always make up false stories and spread to the whole family. i only showed respect for them because they were related to my dad, nothing else, but now i'm not even giving a fuck. i'm done taking bullshit as if i'm committing a huge crime and that's starting with this bitch i call 'aunt'. next time she comes to my house i'm seriously gonna give her a piece of my mind because i don't owe nothing to anyone, she doesn't pay my bills and doesn't even help me with shit! why should i still take her bullshit silently just to avoid a confrontation? i wanna damn well confront her! i want to ask her what the fuck is her problem and if she thinks i'm mistreating my dad so bad she's invited to come and take him to her house so she can take care of him. let's see how quickly she will shut the fuck up.", you need to an estate lawyer yesterday,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/hcbo4c/im_tired_of_my_aunt_tormenting_me_about_my_dad/,,I'm tired of my aunt tormenting me about my dad

"my grandfather was discharged from the veteran's home a few weeks ago, where he had been for the past three months after falling and breaking his pelvis. per his doctors he should be assisted while walking at all times. however, he refuses to acknowledge this and just tries to use his walker to go wherever he wants to go, without asking for assistance or considering the potential consequences of his unsteadiness on his feet. i know he is doing this on purpose because sometimes i'll be sitting with him for half an hour and then as soon as i leave the room for a few seconds, he'll be trying to walk to the bathroom himself. more recently he's started trying to walk without his walker, which scares the crap out of me. i yell at him to sit down so that i can do whatever he wants to do. but he will just stand obstinately.   the routines of my care taking experience have been tiring (especially after already working a full day) but not too bad (showering him every few days, giving him medicine, administering blood tests, helping him get on the internet to check his stocks, serving him dinner) but the sheer disregard for the safety rules makes everything so much more difficult and scary. my aunty (who is on the ""morning shift"" of watching him) has said that all we can do is try our best to watch him. we've tried to instill the idea of letting us know when he needs to get up, but it hasn't worked at all. his doctor said he may have early onset dementia which is why his judgment is poor, but that combined with a lifetime of being extremely stubborn is a bad combination.   does anyone have advice on how to handle a situation like this? i'm thinking that maybe a heart to heart in regard to how important he is to our family and why walking alone is a bad idea might be our only recourse...and just hope that the message through to him."," you can't force someone to accept help.  u/xdisk has it right, but the big problem here is your heartache.  i'm sorry you love this stubborn man who's too macho to do what's right for him.  it must hurt a lot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/h8rkap/stubborn_grandfather/,,Stubborn Grandfather

"my situation is different from other posts here and i’m not sure if it belongs here, but i’ll take advice wherever i can get it!i’m 23 years old. a few years ago i rented a room from a 70yr old man who rented his house out to college kids, both for income and the joyous company. he was no normal landlord- he let us pay barely anything, or nothing at all if we had a tough month, so that we could save money and have a roof over our heads and he could have our energy in the house! he has no family of his own and he loved having people around to make the home brighter. he unfortunately has a grumpy attitude that has gotten much worse over recent years, i believe dementia is also setting in. everyone who used to check on him has moved away, but i keep in touch with him. he’s like a grandfather to me and i have great memories from there. recently, he asked me if i’d wanna move in and be a caretaker for him...he’s desperate to not be so alone, and also needs help cooking, and cleaning up after the bathroom, bathing, etc.  because of his personality, i can’t imagine anyone (including me) would wanna take on the responsibility of caring for him unless in a professional manner and for payment. i told him that though i care about him, i wouldn’t feel comfortable doing that. it was really hard to say no to this person who did so much for me before.the stories i read here are heartbreaking for the most part, and i’m not selfless enough to care for someone full time. however, i care about him and worry for his well-being, and am looking for resources to suggest to him that could help him, whether that’s emotional, financial, medical, etc. he’s a veteran and also receives disability. i don’t know how much it comes out to but not enough for a full time caregiver. he doesn’t have any money saved and actually owes a lot of money. he owns his house so he has somewhere to live, but it’s not paid off and will not be before he dies. letting people not pay rent is part of why he has no money, only debt. he did it to help out those who needed the help, and i feel so, so guilty for not wanting to care for him now that he’s the one asking for support. he has also spent ridiculous amounts of money on luxuries, but i attribute this to a deteriorating mental state, as he sends money to scams and can’t distinguish between scams and real things anymore. i just don’t know what to do, say, or suggest to him. are there any specific resources for vets that could apply here? gov programs that provide a caregiver? advice on whether discussing selling the house is a good idea?

"i'm really glad i found this place. i haven't been able to find much in the way of irl support groups, and it's been a rough time.me: my dad has lewy body dementia (lbd). my mother (72) is his primary caregiver. she's physically ok but emotionally overwhelmed. i'm living there to take care of everything else while she focuses on dad, as well as to keep a close eye on the situation. i work full time, though, so can't keep an eye on things 24/7.the issue: my mother has news/talk radio on 24/7, and it's making dad crazy. what tends to happen is that, due to the lbd, dad will get confused about something he sees or hears and then form a delusion around it. the lbd has made him very anxious, so generally these delusions are upsetting. examples: a few weeks ago the news was covering tornadoes several states away but dad became convinced that they were talking about here, so he was pacing the house, wringing his hands, shaking, pulling us away from doors and windows, demanding we get into the basement, etc. a while before that he became convinced he was a whistleblower who was in trouble from the government for revealing state secrets and now they were coming after him and he had to go into hiding to protect us. just today he became convinced that some russian guy called bernie sanders hacked my parents' bank account and stole all their money and was coming after their house next, and i needed to call chuck schumer to get it back. and so on.it's pretty clear to me where these delusions are coming from. not only is it upsetting to see him get so upset, it honestly gets exhausting for the rest of us to deal with, since he gets really fixated and cannot be calmed or redirected once the delusion takes hold, and sometimes he'll obsess over them for days. i know that, due to the nature of the beast, i can't eliminate all of his confusion and anxiety. but i think it's reasonable to, having identified one source, eliminate that source.thing is, i have tried to get mom to see the connection and limit dad's news exposure (or at least wear headphones), but she won't. she says she needs to watch/listen to her shows to stay informed. i just don't know what to do short of blocking those sites, but if i do, she'll have a meltdown, and that'll upset dad, so i'm afraid i'll actually make the situation worse, not better.has anyone been here? what do i do?  what can i do?", im going to be honest. being a caregiver sucks. if listening to the news 24 7 makes its easier on her leave it be. you cant cater to bim while stepping on her toes. if its not the news his mind will latch on to something else. and he still going to have a fit. you cant fix everything. and you dont want resentment. let her win this one,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ge1np4/how_to_persuade_my_mother_to_limit_dads_news/,,How to persuade my mother to limit dad's news consumption?

"👋 hi. first time posting. i will try to make this easy to digest.... but it might just be a long vent. im sorry and i will delete this if it is against guidelines. i am 30, female, ft student, ft work. i live a half hour from my 87 year old grandmother, and my drunk/drug addict/hoarder uncle who lives in her basement.the rest of the family (her actual children) live out of state. they have written her off because she won’t kick out the drunk filthy/dangerous uncle. my father has medical poa. he is out of state and busy running his business.my aunt has financial poa. she is also of state, comes 1-3 times a year for a day or two, and won’t relinquish any financial information. i have been taking care of my grandmother for over a year. i have pleaded for help and they have all ignored me, belittled me, and derided me. my grandmother has been showing increasing signs of dementia for years, no one will believe me. she’s also deaf and now fully incontinent. i have had to drive to her house in the middle of the night multiple times to call ambulances because the drunk uncle called me to inform me she was “lookin real bad” —to which i have recently found her suffocating in her bed, covered in her own feces.there have been so many specialists. it’s one thing after the other. i had her cataracts removed. then she developed a tooth abscess and didn’t tell me until it progressed to sepsis. then the uti’s because she didn’t tell me she wasn’t cleaning herself anymore. then all the cardiologist appointments. getting meds right. she won’t take her meds on time. she won’t use an alarm clock. she won’t get up and move. she won’t wear clean clothes. i often find her with food mess on her face. she has false memories. and will often refuse to answer you when you challenge her in direct conversation. or she will change the subject. or she will just tell you she is confused when you try to ask her serious questions. she’ll say really weird things out of nowhere when you spend enough time with her. i mean— weird. for instance, out of nowhere she informed me “yeah, she just thought i was god,” and after she went on for a while i finally realized she was talking about an old hairdresser of hers from 30 years ago- completely unprompted. however otherwise— she can appear very, very sharp. she’ll make conversation about current events. make jokes, seem jovial and enthusiastic. and she also lies. she lies about everything. she will cough for 3 minutes and then tell you she doesn’t have a cough. she labors for breath between sentences, then tells you she breathes fine. she lies about cleaning herself or feeling well. she fools everyone into thinking she’s “doing great!”i think she has early onset dementia. i think she presents with full personal neglect. i think she needs full time care.my family is fighting me on this. they refuse to visit her and have not taken her to a single doctors appointment or er trip in the past two years, only me. yet they tell me she is of sound kind and if this is the way she wants to live, so be it. they say i am too emotionally invested.i disagree. these are my values and my morals making me act. i want her in full time care. i want someone to wash her so she doesn’t die in her bed, covered in filth. i want someone to feed her and give her medications at the right times. i threatened to call adult protective services if changes were not made by those wielding the ability (poas). my family has stopped all communication with me, (and i them) except for my father, who is now working to get her home cleaned out, my uncle evicted, and to get her a 24/hr nurse or into assisted living. i think he may only doing this because if i call adult protective services, he is the one on the hook. but whatever. at least he’s finally doing something.i cried all day yesterday after my uncle called me a pest. but i refuse to believe that trying to get my grandmother into any semblance of humane conditions is wrong. and she has plenty of money in retirement and investments— it’s not a money issue. i’m pretty exhausted. i don’t even know why i’m writing this. i’ve just felt so alone for a long time. and now i have cut ties with all family members who refuse to help me get her care. it’s draining in a way i can’t word.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/g9y2p4/family_fallout/,,Family fallout

"hi everyone,i'm brand new here, and honestly haven't even had time to read any of the other posts just yet, but you were the first subreddit that came up when i typed in carer support, so i'm really hoping that this is the right place.i'm really struggling just now. i'm very new to caring for someone and i just need to vent for a little bit. thank you to anyone who reads through this.my grandmother was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago but managed to live on her own with the support of her three local adult children. my family had moved to a different country when i was a child. the family had decided that she was no longer coping on her own, and decided it was time to move her to a nursing home just before covid struck, but this clearly was no longer an option. as my university course became remote-learning and i had a little of the theoretical knowledge of how to cope with patients with advanced dementia (i am studying medicine), the best idea seemed to be for me to move in with my grandmother and become her full-time carer. this also allowed for fewer people to be in and out of her house all day, reducing her risk for coronavirus. i have now been living with her for the past two weeks.i love my grandmother to pieces, and we were always incredibly close. i am her eldest grandchild and i have frequently stayed with her for long periods before. i know that right now she is scared and confused. we had spoken years ago about how the one thing she feared in life was losing her memory (long before her dementia started) and now her worst fear is coming true. i want to be there for her and i want to be able to help her to stay in her own home and as independant as possible, but right now i'm finding it difficult. when at university, i live a fairly typical student life. i'm probably a little more restrained than your average student (no wild parties or frequent flings), but i'm not always the neatest and probably live off slightly too much ramen. having said that i am a fairly good cook when i want to be, and given my grandmother will insist she isn't hungry unless you put food in front of her and eat alongside her, i've been much more regimented with making sure i'm cooking two or three varied meals a day. (on a side note, she desperately needs nutrients and to gain weight, so i've probably been eating more veg than i have in years!) having said that she is frequently making comments about how she ""understands that she can't expect me to meet the standards she would set herself"", how ""young girls today don't understand the merits of a clean kitchen"" (whilst refusing to allow me to clean and insisting on doing it herself), and ""how i really should follow her recipe exactly"" (when the bread i made isn't exactly the way she'd make it without having ever let me know that she had her own recipe).logically i understand that this isn't really her fault, but today was the first day that i argued with her. i shouldn't have, but i was overtired and stressed, and i tried to reason her out of a position that she didn't have the capacity to reason herself into. i actually think i'm more annoyed at myself for not being able to accept that this wasn't the grandmother that i love criticizing me. this was alzheimer's being frustrated that it couldn't understand why the world was so confusing and different. i just need someone to remind me of that.seriously after two weeks of this, i have so much respect for all of you who have been doing this for so much longer than i could dream of right now. (and double respect for anyone that made it to the end of this essay!)"," old people can be extremely hard to deal with. mad respect to you for caring back for your grandma. just think back to the many years she cared for you when you were young and how you have to return it now. the roles are reversed and she's the child now. you have to treat her like a child. you know what she says isn't true. she's just being picky like how we all were when we were kids about food. yes, she can be unreasonable but she's a kid now. she reverted back into a child-like mindset. you have to coax her and play along. and don't ever let your self esteem get down due to it, or even question your love for your grandma. the fact that you chose to do it already proves a lot. do not feel bad about anything and do not take anything to heart. she's old now and whatever she says just treat is as the request of an unreasonable child that you have to coax. :) once again, good on you for caring for your beloved grandma!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/g3rckp/need_some_tlc_right_now/,,Need some TLC right now

"hey guys,this is about my grandpa and i want to know, how to deal with seeing him die/constant fear when he stops breathing.background: since 2013 my grandparents health decreased and we got somebody to live with them and care for them. in 2014 my grandma died and my grandpa health declined afterwards constantly. he had multiple strokes, the last one two weeks ago, suffers from alzheimers and multiple other things. due to recent circumstances his caregiver is not allowed to come back, because she spent her free time at her home in a different country and is not allowed to come back. my parents and one aunt are working in a necessary field, so the main care of my grandpa is on me and one aunt, on weekends both aunts and my mum. we can't take care of my grandpa alone anymore. he can't stand or walk, he can't lift himself from his bed or his wheelchair,... and you always need two to hold him properly. he is only eating yoghurt and we have to feed him. he is asleep for 23 hours a day, only awake to eat one or two times and to use his toilet wheelchair (i am not a native english speaker, no idea how this thing is called)question: my grandpa started to stop breathing and to restart after about a minute. do you have any tips how to deal with this constant fear of him stopping to breath? we all know, he will die soon and it is much better for him, but still... today, we played cards, when grandpa was still alive, and he ""helped"" me to win and i don't want him to die/i can't deal with the thought he will be gone soon. what are you doing in situations, when he is not breathing until he starts again?"," my grandfather passed in june. i was his caregiver for roughly seven years.at some point i came to see he wasn’t going to get better.so once a day usally during his nap, i would sit in my grandmas garden and think about the possibility and imagined the most likely scenarios. basically i’d run a simulation in my mind on what needed to be done.this oddly helped me in a way not sure if it would for you.though fair warning just because it’s the mostly likely scenario, doesn’t mean it will happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/fqn9tm/how_do_you_deal_with_near_death_relatives/,,How do you deal with near death relatives?

"hi, i want to apologize for the wall of text but i truly am lost, i am drowning and struggling to keep my head above water. (trigger warning for death.)i grew up with my grandparents, they took me in as a newborn because my mother didn't care to take care of me/was responsible enough to take care of me. they were in their 50s by then. growing up was fine and things were easy until my grandpa got a blood cancer diagnosis in 2011. it was manageable since he was in his 60s by then; i was still in high school but this is when i started taking my first steps into caretaking. i had to watch out for temperature spikes, i had to watch out for signs of pneumonia, blood clots, and other general things the more his disease progressed. in 2017, things took a turn for the worst and his health decreased more and more. 2018, i was officially in full caretaker mode; i didn't go back to school to finish the handful of credits i had left, i left the comfortable job i had there in order to be there to make sure he was okay which i never minded. my grandpa and i were closer than anyone in my family, so i felt like it was only right that i do this for him. in october 2018, i went on a short trip out of town without knowing how unwell my grandpa was, and he told me i should go, even though i desperately wanted to stay. but i bought the plane tickets and the person i was going to see in not so many words didn't want me to cancel the trip. four days into my trip, my grandpa went to the hospital and died of kidney failure as a result of his cancer. i feel guilt over this every day and it's hard to forgive myself; what do you do when a seemingly routine hospitalization turns into the last time you'll see them? this is where my grandma comes in. we've never been close, and she's been mildly abusive to me my entire life (verbal, emotional and sometimes physical) but the death of my grandpa made me feel as if i needed to reconcile and put the past behind us in order to make sure she was okay. she's turning 80 this december, and while i love her things have gotten exceptionally hard, even harder than it was dealing with my grandpa's frequent hospitalizations and incontinence. she went into the hospital august 2019 very sick, and i didn't know with exactly what until the doctors told us she needed to have emergency gallbladder removal. after her surgery, they moved her to physical therapy rehab to help her regain her movement since she was in a hospital bed for almost a month. it's at the rehab/long term care facility that the doctors told me she's in the early stages of dementia.while in the rehab, i tried to help the doctors and physical therapists with making sure she did the exercises (physical and mental) that she was supposed to be doing; but if she wasn't ignoring and yelling at the doctors, she was ignoring and yelling at me and it reminds me too much of my childhood. they wanted to send home help in the form of weekly physical therapists and cognitive therapy and medication except once she was home, she yelled and ignored them to the point they stopped coming with no notice all together. i felt too guilty after that to make her take the pills; i regret this, because maybe things would've been better. so now, it's just me taking care of things like cooking her meals, making sure her medicines and doctor's appointments are tended to, making sure she's keeping herself busy instead of staring at the television except she still fights me. she refuses to eat when she's upset with something i've said, she doesn't sleep normal hours, she won't let me ask the other family for help because it's gotten to the point where my health is finally plummeting. i've dealt with depression and anxiety since i was 11, and living with her without my grandpa around to talk to has made my mental health worse. i can't see a therapist or make appointments for my health as often as i'd like because she has separation anxiety when i'm gone, and i can't talk to her about how i'm feeling because she takes it as personal attacks, calls me crazy or sometimes downright turns her head away from me in an obvious show of ignoring me. we argue more and more until it's gotten to the point i can barely get out of bed for fear of what she'll say that day to make me feel terrible or to make me cry, but it's the guilt of my grandpa and knowing he'd want me to take care of her that keeps me here. i feel guilty that i don't want to do this. i'm 24, i was only two years into my degree and now i'm not sure if i can even go back because i've forgotten almost everything in the midst of death and grief. i don't have any friends, and the only people i can talk to are people on twitter but. no one wants to hear about something so depressing all the time so i slap on a mask and pretend i am coping but i'm not. i haven't felt this unwell since depression first stepped into my life and not since my first suicide attempt (that my grandma initiated). i have two aunts, a mother and even an adult cousin that all have more resources than me except they're the ones taking trips, going to work and living their lives without any regards to us. they only call her to make sure she's not dead, they never call me. i've never gotten along with them either, except for one of my aunts but it still feels so unfair that this is all my responsibility. i hate the bitterness i feel, because you're supposed to do this for family, right? except i feel like a shadow of myself, i don't enjoy anything anymore, i don't recognize myself anymore. i don't feel pretty anymore, i don't feel like i have worth anymore. and it's hard trying to take care of someone else when it feels like they hate you every single day but cry and say they need you when you want just an inch of space. i'm not sure what to do anymore. i need help but we don't have the income for home help i don't think. any advice would desperately be appreciated because i feel like i'm failing her and my grandpa, and myself. thank you to anyone listening, not many do lately.", danghey tell your family she's their grandma too they fucking better step upguilt them into ityou did right by your grandpa you were present as much as possiblenowwwww it's a bit much. got to get a caregiver to hang out sometimes,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/fh5i36/taking_care_of_my_grandparents_fell_on_my/,,"taking care of my grandparents fell on my shoulders, except i'm getting crushed under the weight of loss and grief."

"i graduated my bsn with a minor in gerontology in december 2018. i have had my cna for over 7 years by that point that i figured i should just study for my nclex in the coming months. living in the bay area in ca became too expensive i had to move back in with my folks in the greater la area. health issues flared again and money ran out, so of course my procrastination kicked in. i had to pick up another cna job. no hospital would hire me despite all my experience!! maybe my recent degree scared them as i would only be there for short period of time. so nursing facility it is... but then the cna license expired last summer. only other jobs available were home health. took the first one... woman running the agency said “oh she’s a sweet lady but has vascular dementia and alzheimer’s with recent stroke in june 2019 but is in a outpatient rehab recovering but she’s a catholic nun that’s starting to hit.” nothing against them. their community has been great. long story short new blood clots formed in her legs and she stopped being able to walk, so now she’s home hospice and bed bound now. this was back in august 2019.i am still here. i was working 12 hour shifts with her 3-4 day’s a week with her but her aggression and agitation was just becoming so bad i hated going to work. i burned out. i now just so 6 hour shifts a couple of times a week. my first cna job was hospice but at least we kept our residents comfortable. they don’t do anything for this poor woman. tylenol that’s it for her pain! she’s got severe arthritis/inflammation in her knees you can feel the warmth radiate when your hand just hovers over her. she screams every time i reposition her (no pressure ulcers yet. she still eats 3 meals a day with my help).i don’t take things personal. i worked in a major county general hospital ed with an interesting population and was told every degrading word in the book. she tells me to go to hell and shut up all the time. she tells me she’s going to kill herself and she wants my foot to kick her in the head. and she tells me she’s in pain her legs and back hurts. i tell her “main” nun/sister all this stuff but she says “oh that’s just part of the disease.” ummm no shit? i went to nursing school and worked in multiple units of a hospital... i know what i’m working with but just because she can’t tell you doesn’t mean she isn’t in pain. she grimaces all the time and she’s been literally laying in bed since august so i have no doubt she is very sore and in pain. the pressure on her pelvis and back must be so terrible. i do rom often but she is soooo stiff. i have yet to see the doctor come to do an assessment on her. only an lvn comes out. i voiced my concerns but he doesn’t listen. i reminded him 3 times to get me dicloflenac gel for her arthritic knee. she is prescribed 1mg xanax but of course the nun in control of her medication cuts in half so she doesn’t get her full dose. she claims it works for her but i’m the one with her most of the day and i’m the one that gets the lashing all day by this poor frustrated catholic nun. i need to get my nclex asap so i get out of this place but it’s just so hard to watch this lady essentially suffer. i’ve worked in a phenomenal hospice/palliative care facility and i feel we are failing at providing comfort to this women. i come home so agitated and helpless. i’m in no mood to study. the agitation, restlessness, loud vocalizations is just getting worse and the nuns that live in the house with her just close the doors. she apparently had a possible small tonic clonic seizure before my shift started this morning but i do see any signs of post ictal or high bp. though i know she’s very risk for it. sorry for the long post. i actually go on and on! i’ve been trying to watch teepa snow’s videos for some more resources.", why don't you take the test already??????,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/f2xels/so_overwhelmed_with_my_11_demented_nun/,,So overwhelmed with my 1:1 Demented Nun
"i want to start this off by introducing myself and explaining my situation.i have been a caregiver for members of my family since i was 20? or so years old.it started with my grandma, then both of my grandparents until my grandfather died. i went on to help my grandma until she was eventually placed in a home where she currently resides. they both have/had severe alzheimers/dementia and my grandma is a diabetic. i would cook, clean, and administer meds for them both. because of my experience with this, it was naturally expected of me to be there to help my mom adjust to taking care of my dad after his 3rd stroke. his first was in 2015 and his third and final was in march of 2016.i had been living with a friend for the past year and would occasionally visit my parents. up until the 3rd stroke, they were doing great on their own and they actually had a healthy dynamic. now some backstory: my parents have an extremely toxic relationship. my mom was a lifelong alcoholic until last year (explain later in post) and my dad was almost never home while i grew up. i am the oldest of 4, 3 girls and 1 boy as the youngest. i was expected to take on many responsibilities from an early age because of my mom's alcoholism. i constantly got into verbal fights with my mom while trying to defend myself. i would get in trouble for stuff my siblings did, i would fight back about how unfair it was that my youngest brother and sister were never made to do chores or clean. this affects their adult lives, with my brother only learning how to do basic things from his gf and my sister turning into an unchecked ego. ithere was a lot of emotional, mental and sometimes physical abuse that happened pretty much my entire life. my parents constantly fought and would refuse to divorce because they wanted to stick together for my brother. long story short about my brother: he is the christ child and can do no wrong. they worship him. standard sexism in the family unit stuff. my mom would bend over backwards to make sure my dad and brother got everything they ever wanted, while myself and my closest sister were treated like the help. i was the only one that was ever hit and anytime i did something that upset my dad, he would spank me and blame the pain on me, saying stuff like this hurts me more than it does you. i would get my behind shredded for making a b in 3rd grade. stuff like that. the one time i told a teacher about it, she contacted my parents and told them everything. i was having trouble sitting at school because my dad had beat my behind the night before for not cleaning my room in a timely manner.anyways, i will move on to the current situation. a few months after i moved back in with my parents to help out, my mom broke her back. burst fracture if her l1. turns out if you have a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis, and you drink heavily every day for 30 years, you make your bones so brittle that a sneeze could break your ribs.who knew right?so i was suddenly not just helping, i was taking care of both of them.now keep in mind the emotional abuse i had experienced in the past.my dad's emotional filter in his brain was basically destroyed. he lost his left side to paralysis. he would verbally lash out at me and my mom for little shit and on a few occasions he tried to hit us with his cane.he could have actually killed my mom if he had hit her but thankfully that did not happen.fast forward to now. i have become their full time caretaker and take care of literally everything.i could go on and on about all the shit that has happened in the last 4 years but this post is already too long. now i am completely burnt out. i can't be around my dad without being triggered violently and i have to stop myself from blowing up. my mom is a narcissistic guilt trip master and i literally cannot leave the house unless it's to take them to doc appts or to buy groceries. the few and far between times that i can leave the house, they both guilt me and make me feel terrible and treat me like a child. i'm gonna be 30 this year. i have no life. i have one friend. i almost never leave the house. we are living off of my dad's social security disability check which isn't enough to actually survive on. my mom is waiting to get on disability but they are taking their dear sweet time. we haven't paid rent in the last 2 months because if we did wouldn't have any money for food or for medicine and that's a whole other bag of dicks right there. both of their meds together cost roughly 800 a month. and that's even with my dad now being on humana and medicare.i don't know what to do. i desperately want to escape and get on with my life. literally everyone i talk to tells me to get out and i know i need to.but here's the thing...i would feel so guilty, despite everything. i would feel like i'm abandoning them. i have tried to reach out for help. nothing is working.both of my parents are technically capable of taking care of some things themselves but they won't do it and when i try to explain how it would help me greatly, it turns into a ""you're so ungrateful and selfish"" argument.i have to make phone calls for them that they could make themselves. fill out paperwork they could do themselves. i even have to talk to their docs for them because if i didn't, they wouldn't care and wouldn't advocate for themselves. there is an extremely unhealthy attachment going on here and i just wanna hear from anyone who is or has experienced something similar. i just need help. i am so fucking tired and i'm scared that i will send myself into a cardiac episode or worse because i'm under so much constant stress. thank you for taking the time to read this and i'm sorry if i have posted in the wrong area. this is my first ever post."," this is a truly terrible situation. wish i had better ideas for how to get you out of it, but someone already suggested calling adult protective services, which i

"hello all. it’s been an exhausting 24 hours. my little brother (23), fiancé (m25), and i (f25) have been taking care of our paternal grandparents for the last two years. our dad and aunt have been pretty absent until recently only because i forced my father to take poa within the last few months. my pop (grandfather) has been fragile my entire life. he was a coal miner but was sent all over the world to look at mining machinery and make diagnoses. he’s truly brilliant and gifted and never had any education past his ged. unfortunately the men in my family have horrible heart problems. great grandfather passed in the middle of meeting from a massive heart attack at 65. my pop (his son) is 82 so he’s done great (but has had open hearts surgery and so many other procedures, my dad has had a heart attack but refuses to go to the doctor anymore). two years ago my fiancé and i bought my grandparents home and moved them in next door (handicap accessible) so they could maintain their freedom a little longer. pop quickly deteriorated and we’ve become regulars at the er, hospital, and nursing home. we’ve only had pop home for 2 weeks at a time before he was back in the hospital and then to the nursing home for 90 days over the last two years. my mim (grandmother) has dementia but won’t seek treatment and has put so much stress on him. we all love her so much but she is a bully to pop at no fault of her own. it’s an ugly disease. she’s extremely manipulative and we’ve begged for help but have gotten nothing. she went as far as threatening to kill herself and slapped a paramedic when pop had fallen and amr was called to the home in the middle of the night. she blamed me many times and sometimes it felt like she didn’t see me as a granddaughter. she would scream at me for no reason and would think i was a home nurse at times. i know it’s not her but it still tears my heart up. pop has had to call the cops on her when he was home because she could be so mean. my blood pressure had gotten so high i was in stage 2 hypertension. yesterday i was heading out the door for work when i received a call from my dad that i needed to get to the hospital. pop coded 2 times and his heart had stopped beating for 15 mins. it took over an hour for the team to get him stable and then an eternity to get to see him. he was strapped down. had to tubes everywhere. blood everywhere (port put in his neck) ice cold, and green in color. his heart and kidney functioning are down to 10%. he’s lived the last year at 17% heart and 23% kidney. my little brother and i talked to him. held his hand. and tried to comfort him . i don’t know if he could hear us but we wanted him to know we were there. his body twitched a lot but i want to think it was him squeezing my hand to let me know he’s there too. this week we found out my little brother has 45% heart functioning and his valves are letting blood in and out. he’s been having problems the last year and finally switched doctors and within a week had some answers and a referral to a cardiologist. my brother told pop that he got his results back and that his heart looked good and he’s healthy as can be. we don’t want him to worry.   i just want to hear his voice again and tell me “everything is alright, kiddo”. my cousins (aunts children) haven’t even bothered to see or call our grandparents in the last few years. they’re 27, 30, and 34 years old. i couldn’t sleep last night so i browsed social media to keep my mind busy. all three cousins have been posting pictures and talking about all their memories on the farm and doing things with our grandparents that they never did. it enrages me. it’s silly to let it bother me but it breaks my heart for my mim and pop that they haven’t been around (they all live local too). the 27 year old is also diabetic and called pop a few years ago asking for a bottle of insulin. my pop didn’t even recognize his voice or know which grandson was calling. cousin didn’t even stay and visit when he came to get the insulin! his baby momma and 5 kids stayed in the car so he ran in and ran out. i know it’s their loss and they will have to deal with this own conscious but i can’t stand that they pretend to be involved. we begged for help and everyone was always conveniently “busy”. this has turned into such a long post and if you’re here with me to the end. i thank you. it means more than i can even express. my heart is so broken and i’m so lost. my wedding is in 2 months and my number 1 fan won’t be able to see it. i’ve dealt with loss before (friend committed suicide right after high school) but i’ve never watched someone deteriorate in front of me. i know i will get through this but it seems impossible right now. i would give anything to have one more talk with him."," i don’t normally respond because these are always so heartbreaking and i never feel like i have the right words to help.  i usually come to this sub to feel less alone.  but this one hit home for me. i’m in the same place with some cousins and family, but they’re out of state and i’m the only grandchild helping.  it’s super tough.  we lost my grandpa almost two years ago and they visited to claim dibs on his stuff (and my grandma’s stuff, even though she’s very much still alive).  your grandpa hears you, and he knows you love him!you and your brother and fiancé sound like fantastic people!  wish i had better advice other than that i think you’ll feel at peace with your choices where your family might feel regret someday in the future.  stay off social media (reddit excluded, of course).  that is what helps me.  it hurts when you feel like you’re just starting your life but you have so many responsibilities that none of your friends or family will understand.  seeing people doing fun stuff on facebook sometimes can be a bummer (although people only share the good stuff—we can never see what their lives are actually like).  it’s probably difficult, but take time for yourself when at all possible.  go on a coffee date with your fiancé.  i love wandering every aisle in the supermarket.wishing you all the good things, and hope your brother gets better news (my dad just got his second valve replacement—they’ve made a lot of advances in cardiac surgery so hopefully your brother can get the best and easiest treatments).  hang in there!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/etau73/my_pop_is_on_life_support/,,My Pop is on life support.

"hello fellow carers! throwing out a request for some advice/thoughts on making decisions about my father’s future. i am currently living with and caring for my father, who has parkinson’s dementia alongside other health issues. my mother died recently and i am now the sole carer and decider for the household (alongside my brother who lives overseas). dad’s house is currently a small house with bedroom, bathroom and sitting room on the ground floor level (all upside down and round-about) , with the kitchen and his current bedroom+bathroom downstairs in the basement. my parents always planned that he would someday move up to the ground floor bedroom and still have access to the sitting room and obviously the front door and outside! we have also been wondering about the possibility of moving. ideally to a bungalow (one level house) or an apartment, so that unlike in the first scenario, he could have access to the kitchen. first scenario is most definitely the simpler option. it would just involve some furniture moving and buying, with a little bit of possibly muddle-dum from dad being in a new room. (his dementia is relatively early, although getting worse by the month and he is very confused). the stairs are for sure getting scarier for him. thankfully i am here 24/7 and do all cooking, so really, him not being able to reach the kitchen is not a big tragedy for now and certainly not as his condition will certainly progress. also thought about getting a stairlift, but unsure how long he might be able to use even that and if it’s worth it.second scenario-move to bungalow or flat-possibly dad’s ‘old age dream’, but frankly one that should have been put into practice a few years back. alas they did try but found the prices were beyond their reach. there do seem to be a few available now, but in some not so nice areas that he doesn’t really know. and similarly with apartments. (he is also very fussy about noisy neighbours but beggars can’t be choosers hey!) moving would for sure give him the access to all rooms that may not be possible here. but i guess it’s quite obvious...i have my worries.-could he cope with a move...physically, mentally, financially-are we laying out huge stress, to put off the inevitable (going into care)-to afford what he’d really want, it would have to be in an unknown area (and so possible disorientation) and that is not so ‘safe’apologies for long waffling. just wondering if anyone has any experience with similar situations and any thoughts."," what about setting up a small kitchen on the ground level floor. small fridge, microwave, sink. this will give him a bathroom, shower (tubs are not good due to falls), living area and kitchen.  this allows a caregiver to use stairs and ""say hi"" as they come and go (he has his bedroom for privacy/sleeping).  the biggest concern is ""if he fell and couldn't reach a phone"" how long before someone discovers him?  i was out changing the oil in my truck and couldn't get off the garage floor for four hours. thankfully my son stopped by and helped me up, but i didn't fess up about how long i had been on the floor. since starting my boxing works outs i can not get up off the floor by myself (we have to practice on getting up without using our arms in class, harder than it sounds)dementia, by definition, means we forget thigs. pdd (parkinson's disease with dementia) is different than alzheimer's - so be specific with medical personal that as treatment/drugs are different.  with alzheimer's a friend's dad forgot how to stand, he would fall on the floor. so a much higher level of care. with pdd we have balance/stability issues but remember how to use a walker to navigate the flat. i'm 36 years into parkinson's. it started when i was 25, at 61 still active. my boxing classes (for parkinson's) help with keeping me active both physically and mentally.  my memory is not good, fine during the day but i don't drive at night. critical is reducing his stress and for him to get a good night's sleep./r/parkinsons for those with and family and friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/erk4w2/should_my_father_move_house_or_stay_put/,,Should my father move house or stay put?

(quotes to emphasize her face when asking). you can physically see her in pain, ask her whats wrong, she wrings her hands and like a little mouse whimpers out like oliver twist..., ""ccccan i have something to eat?"" (i just fed her a sandwich and iced tea an hour ago).  i finally cracked after days of this type of tip-toeing around me, as if i was going to explode, even if we just had a laugh about something, she would still act like a little mouse afraid of me.... i said, mom why are you afraid of me? she replied like a scolded child ""i don't know!"" as if i were yelling at her... no really... every interaction is like this, now.&amp;#x200b;you can create a situation, just by claiming it is happening. imagine you and i were talking. every time you spoke, i would cover my ears and ask you to please stop yelling. at first, you might apologize and check yourself, but if i did it again you might defend yourself and say that you are not yelling at me. and so, then i again say, see? you're always angry at me! at which point you whisper to me, that i might need to seek help. and then i start to cry because i'm afraid of you now, because all you do is yell.... by this point, you're probably ready to bash my skins....&amp;#x200b;this is what i mean by she is gas-lighting me. and old woman who has alzheimer's is gas-lighting me. ugh. i am useless.."," council on aging. look them up. alzheimer support groups. there has to at least be something online, like here, you can get information and maybe even look into putting mom into a memory care center depending on what financial resources are there (council on aging can help figure that out).",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/e8zt43/i_lost_my_temper_with_my_mom_today_not_proud_just/,,"I lost my temper with my mom, today.

"i had about three years living away from my mother. i was still 5 minutes away but i was still technically in my own apartment with only my beautiful fiancé. three years of being a normal young woman. since i was 15 years old it has been something. one surgery or procedure on top of another to fix my mom, grandmother with alzheimer’s moving in, my mom deciding it would be a good idea to leave my dad and move across country.the only times of the day or week that i wasn’t running errands for my mom or helping her take care of my grandmother were when i had to go to my menial retail job or my classes at community college. i missed a lot of work and skipped a lot of classes trying to be a normal 20 yo for a minute.by some miracle i found a wonderful boyfriend and he had to tell me that too much was being asked of me. i couldn’t even see it for myself. being my moms only support system and full time lackey was normal to me. the fact that she agreed to take care of her mother through her long and shitty (literally) journey with alzheimer’s but was offloading a portion of that burden on me without ever fucking asking never occurred to me. i was a dutiful daughter. don’t even ask me how long it took her to hire some fucking help for us-too long. yes, there was money available.so my grandmothers suffering finally ends when i am 24 and my boyfriend moves in about a year later to help my mom pay the bills because she is basically house poor until she can sell the house. he phrased it like she was doing us a favor. i wanted to leave like i wanted to leave since i was 19 but i couldn’t. she had no one, my brother was a a teenager and my sister...well. it’s always been different for me. in their defense it is always me she asks. when my brother was old enough and made enough money (barely) to move and she started trying to convince him that he needed to stay because he couldn’t really afford to go, it would be mutually beneficial to stay, he needed to focus on school etc., i told him to get the fuck out.when she sold the house a little over three years ago i finally got the fuck out.but then more things started going wrong with her heath. hospital, surgery, recovery. driving to her apartment to find her loopy and septic. driving to her apartment to take her to the er because she called me after passing out. when she didn’t answer her phone i enjoyed several anxiety filled drives to her apartment wondering what i would find. doctors told me several times that my quick thinking saved her life.so now with her most recent hospitalization it is looking like there will be no more attempts to “fix” anything. a drain in her side will prevent infection and her other conditions...well. there are a lot of moving parts. her care will be palliative now, focused on her quality of life.is there money for assisted living? nope. does she even have insurance since the divorce? nope.so my new husband and i (getting married in very early jan!) will be getting a house and moving her in. what i lose in having to live with her again i gain in possibly ending the constant nightmares about finding her dead in her apartment. i am 30 now. i barely had a “20s” and now they are over and i am right back where i started. i never wanted to be a caregiver.my fiancé said he always knew this would happen but i am burning with guilt for putting him through this. i want to have children in the next couple years but i can’t imagine tacking care of her and children. my career? i am always struggling not to let this shit hold me back and it doesn’t always work.thank you for reading.", i'm so sorry. i just want to give you the biggest hug.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/e4yia5/i_had_about_three_years/,,I had about three years
"my dad (76) has survived cancer twice but the treatments for those cancer battles have basically removed a lot of quality of life. he had tumors on the base of his tongue. radiation destroyed all of his teeth, fried his tongue and taste buds, and he lost the ability to swallow for about a year. his bones are so brittle they won’t support dentures. several surgeries later, he had the feeding tube removed and can now eat mush but can’t taste anything. that was all due to radiation. but the chemo... yeesh, guys. the doctors told us about “chemo fog” but said it would go away. it hasn’t! he is getting confused all the time, says the wrong numbers and words for common things, and can’t remember what he had for lunch. i’m really starting to worry about him. i don’t know if this is from the cancer treatment (about a year out from) or if this is a new problem. when i should make the jump to get him evaluated for dementia or alzheimer’s. anyone have any advice? thanks in advance."," a year out, this sounds more like radiation induced cognitive issues, not chemo. i'm appalled by the recommendations of pcp's to avoid diagnosis or minimize symptoms, seems a sure way to avoid the best treatments imo.  maybe there's regional issues i'm not aware of, where i am my patients have no difficulties getting into rehab etc because of mental health.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/e45vyq/when_do_you_test_for_dementia_or_alzheimers/,,When do you test for dementia or Alzheimer’s?

"sorry in advance this could get lengthy....in 2014 we bought a house with my mother in law. it is the perfect set up she has her own apartment etc. however since moving in with her she has become more and more dependant. at 80+ she is a daily drinker and chain smoker. so in the past 5 years she's suffered a mini stroke, two broken wrists, a stomach bleed, a broken hip, fractured ribs, and at least one concussion (all from drunken falls). because my husband is the major bread winner i've had on and off jobs while taking care of her. side note i happen to be in the health care field. she is also recently diagnosed with progressing dementia and doctors reccomend 24/7 care. today she smoked and almost collapsed. it's so sad watching her waste away to nothing. she is 90 lbs. she barely eats won't drink much water. i'm at my wit's end. we told her no more alcohol but she won't stop smoking and i'm afraid she will have stroke right in front of me. thank you for letting me vent."," at some point it becomes a safety issue with falls, smoking (fire risk) so you have to decide how she could get the best possible care. my mom is 90, we moved her into assisted living 2 years ago. she was living in our mother-in-law apartment for almost 8 years. she was very active until her health declined. i work two jobs so i would get her up and put her to bed every night. i took care of all the meals, bathing, etc and while i was working i hired an aide to be here 6 hours of the day. there was a gap of 2 hours when she'd be alone and that's when things got worse. she would forget i gave her pills in the morning and take them again, she would have full blown panic attacks where i'd rush home from work only to find her calm. eventually after a neurological event she was sent to a rehab and that's when my sibling and i decided assisted living was the best choice. she has good days and bad days, but we visit her every day (we take turns) plus her medicine is controlled and she has opportunities for social interaction. do what's best for her safety, but you have to have a loving detachment or you'll drive yourself into the ground worrying about what you have no control over. my sibling lost 8 lbs this year over worrying about her and i'm having issues with self medication. this is hard life stuff, so i hope you come to the best decisions.edit: everyone's situation is different. if i were financially able to care for her 24/7 i would. her health went down rapidly after her first hospital stay for high blood pressure. unless i quit my jobs and gave up my own health insurance there wasn't much choice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/e09z3s/i_didnt_know_it_would_be_this_hard/,,I didn't know it would be this hard...

"i lurk here often due to the fact that i have been the caregiver for many different family members in my short 30 years on this planet. recently (she moved in with us at the end of august) i decided to have my 70 year old grandma move in with me due to her having some troubling behaviors while living on her own. such as hiding important things like her purse in random locations, a couple of falls, emotional hardships and getting her car towed due to her not following her community rules. since moving in with me it has been a lot of issues of paranoia, lies, mental breakdowns and making herself to be the victim. as troublesome as this has been i still want her to stay because i don’t think she is capable of living alone anymore. well after the latest mental breakdown (november 7th) she was baker acted in to the local senior mental hospital due to the admitting hospital thinking she has dementia and was a risk of being harmful to herself. during her time there they diagnosed her with cluster personality disorder type b and said she doesn’t have any form of dementia. they say she has been struggling with this her whole life and with the proper meds and therapy it should be manageable. well for a couple of days she was doing a lot better but then she started to refusing to go to her therapy appointment and claiming she didn’t have any appointments. i work a full time job and take care of my 2 year old as well on top of caring for her. i don’t have the ability to force her to go to these appointments and she sets them up in times that she know i am unable to attend. she is aware she is doing this. well after an explosive morning she decided she need to go out and handle her business on her own. i let her go knowing it wasn’t the best idea but i didn’t want to fight with about her paranoia thoughts. she get lost and confused so that’s why i was nervous about her going alone. well while she was gone i thought it would be best to check her mental medication to make sure she has been taking it and turns out she hasn’t been taking them since thursday night. i don’t know what to do to get her take it without it turning into a huge fight. what do you guys do to get your family member to take their medication? also how do you deal with their need for independence but their not capable of actually handling the things they once were able to? i feel like if we can’t get this under control then i will have to move her out and never speak to her again due to the levels of disrespect and abuse i have been receiving from her during her mental high and lows. just the ways she has been disrespectful &amp; abusive to me: saying cruel things about my significant other such as he is retard lazy and good for nothing because he won’t say hello to her first. smoking inside of our apartment when she knows we can get evicted for it and a complete disregard for her great granddaughter health. lying about smoking. she claims it was an accident but it happened while she was on the phone with my mother and said “don’t tell autumnatoms but i’m smoking inside” so she knew she was doing wrong. calling me a liar, saying i’m mentally abusive to her &amp; making nasty comments to me about my weight, appearance &amp; how i live my life. throwing my stuff away and going thru my &amp; my boyfriend personal belongings. tldr: what to do when grandma doesn’t take medication? how do you deal with the struggle of losing independence? any help is appreciated. i just don’t want to throw her away like others have due to her mental illness."," sounds like dementia. i’d get a second opinion. if she hasn’t always been this way that’s not a personality disorder usually unless preceded immediately by a stroke.if you don’t have power of attorney over her, you may have to get it. that’s as much help as i can give.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/dxqton/looking_for_some_guidance/,,Looking for some guidance

(ex. they gain weight because they now have an aide taking 1full hour to get them to eat which causes weight gain) sometimes they do so well they no longer meet criteria to remain on service. but they dont have to discharge her right away. they usually have 90 days to reevaluate patient. they recognize this improvement may be temporary  before declining again. if they only see improvement they usually will give you plenty of warning before stopping services. but you can always ask for another hospice evaluation if she begins to decline again.  we hate taking away support that we know helps but there are pretty strict criteria to remain on hospice.ps talk with hospice social worker about your concern. they can help you find other support services outside of hospice.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/dw5041/caregiver_with_question_about_hospice/,,Caregiver with question about hospice

"my mom turns 93 today. i remodeled my walkout basement into a beautiful apartment for her, fully decked out with kitchen, bathroom, laundry room, living room and bedroom.  she moved in 5 months ago.  she is still recovering from that trauma. she gave up unpacking boxes months ago. she gets around with a walker, cares for her small dog, uses an ipad for facebook and email and grocery shopping from walmart. she has no dementia  but a (mechanically) sound mind.  still she struggles to maintain focus long enough to complete things. she has full vision in one eye, the other is 99% blind.  she suffers a lot of arthritic pain.  this is her greatest difficulty.  it’s caused her fitness to deteriorate to where she cannot participate in life. cannot or _will_ not, or both.  she sits in front of the tv and plays solitaire on the ipad.  she is really not in bad shape compared to many of the stories. my exasperation stems from the fact that she refuses to engage!  she doesn’t participate in the day-to-day activities of simple things, like involving herself in a phone call long enough to tell me about it afterward.  or upon seeing that she has no clean silverware to eat with, running the dishwasher.  her days are spent in a hazy daydream reliving old memories but without actively engaging in the life she has before her, which she clearly has the mental capacity for. and she doesn’t see why i get so exasperated.  what’s my problem?  why does it bother me?  why do i insist that she toss out the old catalogs.  just because the new ones arrive by the dozen every day in the mail!“don’t worry about it now.  we can do it later,” she says, about almost everything. life is too difficult. later. and everything she puts off becomes my next chore.  thank god my wife loves her too, and works to help her feel comfortable.  i’m not in it alone.  tl;dr: my 93 yo mom is mentally capable but refuses to participate in what little life she has left.  “use it or lose it”, the saying goes, and she’s not using hers.   - is she safe?  - does she feel safe?  - does she feel loved?all i must do for her is help answer those three questions positively.  my challenge is to be content with that.", have you talked to her doctor about depression?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/dp4bez/alive_but_not_living/,,Alive but not living
"my experiences as a caregiver inspired me to pursue a degree in clinical psychology. i want to help those with dementia and the people who love them. i am especially interested in how disruptive behaviors like agitation, rude comments, daytime sleepiness, or inappropriate behaviors (like lewd/sexual behavior) affect your stress level while providing care.if you are willing to help me better understand your experience as a caregiver, please click on the below link to complete the survey. it should take about 20 minutes and will ask questions about your experiences as a caregiver and your loved one’s behavior (how often it occurs, how distressing it is).findings from a study your group helped me with last year (thank you!!) were published in a medical journal. this study will also be published in a medical journal so that health care professionals can better help caregivers feel less alone in their journey.please re-post this link if you know others who may be able to help!questions about the study? contact caregiverksu@gmail.com“caregiver experiences of disruptive behavior in dementia;” mary beth spitznagel, phd; kent state university department of psychology, p.o. box 5190 kent oh, 44242.", this post has been removed. please post this in the weekly research wednesday thread. thank you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/dopmqn/caregiver_experiences_of_disruptive_behavior/,,Caregiver Experiences of Disruptive Behavior
"my grandmother has dementia, but has no diagnosis. for the last year that we've been caring for her, we've been pushing my family to get these appointments made so we can get a diagnosis. she was supposed to have this appointment two weeks ago, but the doctor's called hours before the scheduled phone appointment(which we were planning to be on) and changed all of her appointments. the big appointment is finally happening next thursday, my uncle will be taking her. however, yesterday she was supposed to have physical therapy for her arm pain and she tried to cancel it, but couldn't figure out how to get in touch with the office. instead she scheduled an appointment with her accountant, because she forgot my husband already finished her taxes for her. my uncle came to take her to physical therapy, but she made him take her to the accountant instead. as the big appointment approaches, she's been rebelling against care. when my husband goes in to cook dinner she says she's already eaten, which may or may not be true. she often heats up food in the microwave and forgets about it, we see food left on the counter, but we don't know if she's actually eating it. we're trying to keep her from driving, but she slipped out in her car the other day to buy groceries. there hasn't been an incident yet but my husband and i are just waiting for something to happen. i don't know what to do about these appointments. the doctor's know we're supposed to be on every call, but that doesn't mean they follow through. we don't have any power, we just live with her and we're financially stuck here because we can't afford to move out. if she decides she doesn't want us here anymore, we'll be homeless so we are terrified of pushing her too much. has anyone experienced this before? what do you do? my uncle has just advised my husband to sit by the phone in case the doctor's office call, so he can answer before she does. my husband is home all day because caretaking now takes up too much time for him to work or look for work (which is why we can't get out)."," i've been going through the not eating thing too, my parents are underweight.doctor explained that when you get elderly, the hormone that controls hunger can stop working properly. so even though they should be hungry, the brain isn't sending them that signal. which is both interesting and scary.our solution is to make a big plate of cheese, crackers, olives, nuts, stuff like that in the morning and leave it out...easy to just grab and eat. there's some waste at the end of the day, but they are eating it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/dkoh7r/grandma_changing_and_cancelling_appointments/,,Grandma changing and cancelling appointments
"why is it so hard for people to just send a quick text asking how you are? i go months without hearing from old friends and in the rare instance they do pop up they quickly go back to ghosting me as soon as they find out that, oh, grandma still has dementia and, no, things have not improved. even family who occasionally visits will tell my husband and i that things are worse than they realized, thank us for our work, and say we need to start a rotation before going awol for another 6 months. my husband and i have no friends and are stuck as caretakers because we can't afford to move, we've just passed the year mark and my mom and uncle have finally stepped in a little bit to at least try to get a diagnosis and talk about long term care solutions but we're so beyond burned out. i would give anything just to hear a friend say they're thinking about me. how do you cope with realizing the people who stood by you at your wedding are only fair weather friends?"," the worst part, for me anyway, is that, when they do pop up, they want to know how she’s (my mom) is doing. i know it’s well intended, but i don’t feel like talking about what i live 24/7 during the one time i’m out. it doesn’t provide relief, just reminds me how much the current situation sucks. and then you’re not fun to be around anymore...i hope you get the support you need",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/dis5jw/where_did_my_friends_go/,,Where did my friends go?
"just need to let off a bit of steam. i live with and care for my father, who’s recently developed parkinson’s dementia, after 18 years of parkinson’s. we lost my mum to cancer recently and it’s just me caring for him. getting pretty bogged down with the way the disease has altered his personality. i spend all day everyday caring for him, doing his paperwork and applying for important government benefits on his behalf. after days of me filling in forms, he has accused me of trying to stop him having these benefits. i understand that accusing others is quite common with dementia and that i shouldn’t take it personally. but heck, it’s pretty damned hard not to take it personally, especially when accusing or blaming others was a part of his personality before anyway! i have to admit to getting a bit angry with him. i am giving my all to take care of him and organise what he is unable to organise anymore. it’s hard to feel that he doesn’t want or appreciate what i’m doing. there are so many emotions involved, a lot to do with grief as well, but it all interlinks and generally comes out in frustration. it’s tough to care for someone that you’ve known your whole life and to try and separate the parkinson’s dad from my real dad. they are so similar!!!apologies for the rant! and breathe"," you need to take regular and periodic breaks from caregiving, the emotional and physical toll is draining, even more so  because your family.  the best thing you can do is take a break of a few days to a week. on the end your mental well being will be the best benefit for your parent. after all i'm sure of you ever had this conversation with your parent before they became ill they would never want to put this burden on youm",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/demtjq/my_dad_has_parkinsons_dementia_and_i_am/,,My dad has Parkinson’s dementia and I am struggling with his personality.
"apologies that this may be a long-winded post, but i’d like to get the details out if anyone can answer my questions.my maternal grandmother (85 y.o.) is currently beginning to exhibit what may be the earlier stages of dementia (short term memory loss, repeating things, anger over forgetting things) or possibly just old age. she still lives on her own (2 doors down from the house my dad and i live in), and is able to get through her chores, errands, caring for her cat, etc. as long as it isn’t something out of routine. physically, she’s as healthy as horse, still walks avidly, exercises, etc. mentally/emotionally, she isn’t so good. she’s been getting progressively more and more depressed (but in a mood-swings kinda way---some days she’s just a jolly, silly person). her husband died about 8 years ago, and my mother began looking after her (finances etc) after that. my grandma can be a stubborn, victim-mentality, hurtful person, and i watched her drive my mother into pretty regular binge drinking. this all came to a head when my mother suddenly died of cancer 2 years ago. the looking-after my grandmother fell upon me and my dad. the major issue we’re struggling with right now is how to manage her finances, especially the living trust. my mother had a good sense of the various accounts in which her money was located – but none of this information was transmitted to us before she passed. and my grandmother is 100% oblivious, as my grandpa took care of all the finances. so at this point, my dad and i are completely clueless as to the extent of her financial holdings. this is especially troubling given her mental decline – if she were to need some sort of specialized care, we would need to know where to pull the resources from. i am the executor of her/my grandpa’s living trust, but have no idea where to begin on collecting this information. many of you may suggest securing power of attorney. well… any conversation regarding my grandma’s end-of-life financial needs is either blown off, ignored, or met with hysterics and circular thinking. she carries this paranoia that we are out to take money away from her. i’ve attempted to have a calm, logical conversation with her about this several times, but the result is the same – dead end and increased paranoia/hysterics. we’re just really concerned that there is going to be no way to support her if she ever needs advanced care (and convincing her of this will be another struggle in itself).i’m currently trying to set up an appointment with the attorney of the living trust, in hopes of getting some kind of overview on the things i need to find out. can anyone share their experience on how to possibly deal with this legally / financially / interpersonally?much appreciated 😊 tldr: grandma's losing her mental capacity. dad and i have no concept of her financial holdings. will need to be able to provide for her care. she is uncooperative and paranoid. help!"," my grandparents had a living trust and i was the successor trustee and executrix of their estate. do you have the trust documents? it should tell you the attorney who set it up and my grandparents included the financial institution. my grandparents was set up at a bank with a trust department and they invested the money on their behalf.  the trust department was great and helped my grandmother manage her money and pay her bills. they helped me a lot and if your grandparents is set up similarly would be a great resource. do you have access to her mail? she should be receiving statements. i would also call the attorney who wrote the trust document. they should be able to ensure you have the most up to date version of any documents such as trust, power of attorney, medical proxy (if done). it sounds like your grandma is past the point of being able to sign legal documents but the attorney can advise you on that. you might need to file for guardianship, this will require that her dr declare her incapable of making her own decisions. i have never had to do that so i can’t provide any information on the process. did your mom file her taxes for her? if you have a copy of her tax return that can give you some idea of what she has for investments and any money she has coming in. i am happy to answer any questions you have based on my experience.edit: sorry i missed that you know the attorney and are going to meet with them, that is the best first step. i also use a financial advisor for my mom. they are worth every penny in helping reduce my stress and make life easier.  i brought them lots of random documents from various banks, stocks, and annuities and they did all the research for me and now manage all the accounts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/d5652x/how_to_help_an_uncooperative_grandma/,,How to help an uncooperative Grandma?
"ok, this might be a doozy so strap in. my mom is assigned 5 norco a day. she had an emergency splenectomy a month ago and she has renal cancer in her right kidney. the cancer in her left kidney was removed with laparoscopic surgery with a partial nephrectomy. mom is recovering pretty well all things considered but recently she has been complaining of pain and keeps saying that she is going to call the pain clinic and have them up her dosage to six a day. my mom does deal with chronic pain and the pain clinic kept her pill level to 5 a day last month when she had her appointment. they said the surgeons can prescribe her more pain meds for acute pain but they only deal with chronic pain. i have heard horror stories where the pain clinic will say you are not complying when you ask for more and they will cut you off. my aunt is an rn and says in her state they will sometimes take really elderly people off to comply with their regulations and she has had to refer some people as old as 90 to treatment clinics to watch for withdraw. to make this more complicated she takes xanex to sleep. her surgeon gave her a month prescription and we are going to a medicaid psychologist to get a psychiatrist referral to get her xanax monthly. the gp doesn't care that my mom takes xanex but she will not prescribe them and wants the psychiatrist to do it. she is slowly weaning my mom off them. the pain clinic nurse practitioner seemed to not know what i was talking about when i said the gp said the pain clinic and the psychiatrist work together to treat the whole person. my mom said that they will not prescribe pain medicine to someone who takes xanex but she hardly ever remembers what the doctors say and she tends to latch onto one piece of information (usually something she has misunderstood) and say it back with ultimate conviction. she was apparently told this a few year ago. i want to do this the right way and i don't want us to get blacklisted or something. i also do not want to get into the situation where we have to choose between her ability to sleep or the ability to be at a level 4 pain instead of a level 7 everyday. we do have a wound meeting with the splenectomy surgeon next week. we also have a meeting with the gp next week where i am going to request a neurological evaluation just to make sure nothing happened to her brain when she was non responsive because i really do not want her to have dementia. she is getting an iron iv next week to get her hemoglobin back to where it needs to be so maybe that would help. i just hate seeing her tired and in pain all the time. does anybody know what to do with the pain clinic or how to address this? thank you!"," my wife is a long term chronic pain patient so i have a ton of experience in this area.  a good pain management doctor absolutely should not fire a patient just because they ask for an increase in their pain medications.  this is especially true when a chronic pain patient goes through an additional trauma (i.e. a surgical procedure).&#x200b;my wife had to have a hysterectomy in july, so at her pain management appointment, we talked to the doctor and asked her what our options were.  the doctor suggested switching from norco to percoset for a month and that helped quite a bit.  my wifes surgeon also communicated with her pain management doctor and gave her several days of dilaudid for the days right after she got out of the hospital.&#x200b;people should never be afraid to openly talk to their doctors about their medications and symptoms.  you shouldn't have to live with a ""pain level 7"" just because you're afraid the doctor will cut you off entirely.  if you're afraid to talk to your doctor, find a better doctor.&#x200b;as for the xanax, as many have already said, the government is cracking down on the benzo/opiod combo.  talk to them about what other options may exist.  if they get her pain under control, it might even be possible for your mother to sleep soundly without the benzos.&#x200b;oh, and if you can, go to her appointments with her.  my wife used to hear things the doctor said in the worst possible light, and leave in tears.  when i asked her what was wrong, she would tell me what she heard, and my takeaway from the appointment would be completely different.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/d3zsuz/does_anyone_have_any_experience_asking_for/,,Does anyone have any experience asking for different/higher dose medicines with pain clinics?

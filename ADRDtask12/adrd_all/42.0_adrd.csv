"when visiting with my mom this past weekend i started thinking about the relationship between her pre-alz personality and the challenges of being her caregiver now.  it made me think what might be easier now if she were different then.for example - she was always ashamed of her body (and a bit critical of mine).  some of her go-to conversations now are ""i've been perspiring so much my hair is wet"" (5-10 times per day) or ""i hope you didn't inherit my fat thighs"" or ""i wish you could have gotten my hair instead of your father's"" or constantly wanting to compare height with me (3-5 times per day).  sometimes i think if she'd been a bit more self-confident during life then these wouldn't be her go-tos now.  another example - she was always worried about doing things wrong.  as a result now, she won't participate in the activities in her senior community (bingo, chair yoga, crafts, brain games, etc.), ""been there done that"" she says, or she'll claim a headache before or during activities.  while she isn't aware she has alz, i think she knows on some level that she's not 100% and is afraid to look bad/fail at trying something, so as a result she won't try.  she also hates when anyone tries to help her with self-care.  she's generally in good spirits but will rage if i float the idea of taking a shower.  sometimes i think if she'd not been afraid to fail or less worried about how she is perceived by others during pre-alz life, that she'd be a little more willing to do things now or accept help.  my takeaway from the first example is that it might be good for me to not get in the habit of saying negative things about myself or my body now, lest it become a go-to for me should i develop alz.  my takeaway from the second is to not care what others think of me or what i'm doing, and to accept help when offered now, lest me refuse help at a time when i most need it.  both of these are good, positive life changes to make anyway, imo.has anyone else had thoughts like this?  obviously, with alz if it isn't one thing it is another, but - it was interesting for me to think about the connection and wondered if others did too."," interesting conversation.  my mom was a 'good catholic woman"" who now curses like a sailor, stabbed a fellow resident and tried to stab a staff member (with her knitting needles in both cases) and refused to wear 'that damned bra'.  talks about sex and rape all the time.  she's often like a different person.  on the other hand, her anxiety and depression from pre-alz are still there and still causing problems.interesting to think about.  thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/584myx/link_between_caregiving_challenges_and_patient/,Link between caregiving challenges and patient personality (Pre-Alz LPTs?)

"we are caring for my mother-in-law (alice) who has end stage alzheimers. we have a perplexing problem as i am reaching out to see if anyone has encountered something similar.two things:1. alice very rarely speaks, but when she does say words, while they do not make sense they are pronounced correctly. when she is in duress (see below) or frightened she will sometime speak short sentences like ""please don't"" or ""thank you lord."" it seems that alzheimers is not affecting her vocabulary but her understanding how and willingness to communicate.2. in the last month alice has been walking less and less. she used to walk around the house a lot. in the last week she has not wanted to get out of bed to go to the bathroom. she is not in pain, she will attempt to get up but then stop and then look around. sometimes she will stand up with help, other times she will get half-way up and then seem to be in great distress and attempt to sit down and be grabbing onto anything/anyone for support like a drowning person. she will keep her knees bent and not fully support her weight. it takes two of us to rotate her around to the potty chair. we go through the same thing getting her back into the bed. sometimes, like this morning, it clicks and she stands up and pulls her diaper up without a problem. later, she will still get up on her own and walk around the house from time to time. it seems like all of the functionality of walking is still there, but the conscience use or understanding of that functionality is going. needless to say this is exasperating especially when there is clean up to be done. having her stand has been the easiest way to get her clean because she will actively resist any attempt to roll her over in the bed, bracing herself against anything she can get her hands on.it would almost be better if she were more incapacitated. as it is now, we know that she is on one level of capability physically, but cognitively she is on another... sometimes.we don't want to distress her too much, but at the same time we need to keep her clean and healthy.i'm looking for some advice from anyone who has dealt with this before. is this a normal stage in the disease?", i don't know what to say to you other than i feel your pain. my grandmother is going through almost the same. much love and strength to you. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/56t8cy/end_stage_care_question/,End stage care question.

"this is a story about my depression, what caused it, and how i am working to conquer it.  bear with me. it's pretty elaborate.  i am posting this in several subreddits so it might feel somewhat broad, but i want to help as many people as i can.i am 30. i started smoking weed when i was 13. it started innocently, like most of us. in today's culture it's pretty difficult not to be a little curious as to what it feels like to be high if you have never done it before. when i started, it wasn't nearly as accepted as it is today, so i could only imagine how the kids feel today.i was expelled from high school my freshman year in only the first week for possession, which pretty much sent my depression into a downward spiral. people think they're fixing the system by ""getting rid"" of the bad kids, by throwing them in alternative school or whatever your county may have, but really all it did was put me in a room full of kids who abused drugs. i was extremely depressed: none of my friends' parents would let them talk to me anymore, my parents were extremely disappointed, and i pretty much squandered every chance of getting into a good school. this lead to suicidal tendencies and a depression that would lead well into my twenties.i had older parents, and my mom was diagnosed with early-onset alzheimer's disease while i was in high school. i was 16. i was really embarrassed by this in a weird way: she would forget my friends' names, she would say really off-the-wall shit, or she would ask us about things that didn't happen or things that happened a long time ago in her childhood. because of this, i didn't let anyone into my house and never had friends over. years later, my psychologist friend helped me understand that ultimately this is because i was trying to protect her, because i didn't want people to think she was stupid or to embarrass her. admittedly, it was a little selfish, too.weed, alcohol, and drugs became my best friends, and i stopped hanging out with the kids that were clearly destined for success, and started hanging out with the ""bad kids"", similar to those from that school i went to, who were abusing drugs and alcohol just like me. if anyone says that weed is not a gateway drug, they're wrong. ultimately my weed use connected me with people who used lsd, xanax, vicodin, oxycontin, percocet, valium, klonopin, cocaine, mushrooms, dmt...pretty much you name it. and i wanted all of it, and in excess. i wanted to be numb.my mom's health continued to deteriorate, and when i was 18 my dad had a heart attack, a stroke, and had an aneurysm on his aorta. i was delivering pizzas at domino's while taking care of him.my older brother and i were forced to put my mother in a nursing home. before she was really sick, she told me that if she ever got a point where she couldn't take care of herself, then i needed to put her in a home. so that's what we did, and it's a decision i still struggle with to this day.this whole time, i was heavily abusing alcohol and drugs. i had developed a painkiller addiction and was taking up to 10 percocets a day, and was hanging on by a thread. i overdosed several times. i was smoking an 8th a day of weed. i was drinking whiskey by the fifth. amazingly, i got straight a's at a local community college while dealing with all of this. i was studying art and loved to draw and just being creative in general. but man...i loved to be messed up.a week before i was going to university, my dad passed away. he was my best friend and is still the person i have been able to connect with the most in life. my family was extremely poor because of all the illness, and the bank repossessed my family's house. at 22, i was homeless, i had a drug addiction, i was an alcoholic, and the only family i had was my brother who was in the navy in japan.i tried to tough it out and do the right thing and go to school anyways like i know he would want me to do. i moved into the dorms at 22 because i had nowhere else to live. i barely left my dorm room, didn't talk to anyone about what i was going through, and was drinking and smoking weed heavily every day. i had a few friends, i guess, but it was only friends that would drink with me. we never talked about what i was going through.the first semester i got all a's, but the second semester i pretty much stopped going. this is probably the lowest point in my life. i failed almost every class. i was forced to drop out, but at the same time, there was a tinge of hope: i played guitar in a band with some friends and it was actually have some success. i met an amazing girl named amber, and things seemed to be on the come-up, at least emotionally.just as things were getting better, i got the phone call that my mom was about to pass away. i went and saw her in the home one last time. amber had become concerned with my drug abuse and alcoholism, and flew me to live with my brother in virginia while he was stationed in norfolk. my brother had married a woman from japan. she wasn't very understanding: ultimately, she kicked me out of the house after a month because i wasn't going to get a job. i went and stayed with some friends of my family a couple of hours away, where i stayed sober for an entire week and tried to pull myself together. ultimately i went back to amber.at this point i was 25, i was in debt over $20,000 from school, i had no parents, no money, no house, no car. i was started smoking weed and drinking again. but amber still believed in me. she saw the person that i really was beneath the veil of alcohol and drug abuse, someone that i myself barely knew was there. after she received her degrees in psychology and music, we moved down to florida where she was from.my time in florida has been pretty good, honestly. i have grown a lot as a man since i was 25. i learned to program in php and started a career building custom wordpress themes for small businesses. i now own my own business, and even though i still struggle and don't make a ton of cash, i am so proud that i am even here and still trying.i have been alcohol-free for a month, narcotic-free for several years, and haven't smoked weed in about 10 days. it's funny to me that weed has been the last thing to go, and i will be honest, i am having a harder time not smoking weed than anything else i have had to deal with. i am reading tony robbins' book awaken the giant within, which is helping me challenge my core beliefs about myself and to rewire all of the negativity i have had my entire adult life.i proposed to amber a couple of months ago and she said ""yes!"", which was and still is the greatest feeling in the world.i am posting this because i want to help. if you are depressed, or are abusing drugs or alcohol, or one of your parents has cancer, or one of them has alzheimer's, or you are feeling alone...i can tell you from the bottom of my heart that things are going to get better and things will be okay. i truly love you, and i don't say that as a shrink or a counselor: i say that because i have been there, and i needed someone to tell me that really badly some days.  i still deal with the regret of leaving my mom in that home.if you need me, i want you to find a way to message me right now. let's figure it out. i will gladly do anything i can to help you figure things out, even if it's just listening. at this point in my life, i feel there's very little i can't handle or conquer. i know i can help you.thanks to anyone who reads. this is been very helpful to me this morning.j",

(last week i realized i no longer have to search out velcro shoes for my so, because while they were necessary at one time so he could put on and take off his own shoes but a friend pointed out i put on and take off his shoes so who cares if they tie or velcro). just try to be supportive of your mom personally as well. this is scary for everyone involved but even if she is in denial, it must be terrifying. if you can bring her favorite lunch by, or have a pizza delivered:) i have a dear friend who visits once a month and sits with my so for a few hours and pushes me out of the house to do something for myself. last month she was on vacation across the globe on the day of her normal visit. i received a call from her the day before and she asked me if i would be home. around the time she normally shows up the doorbell rang and it was a grocery store delivery guy with a few staples and one of my favorite candy bars. it was kind and i know that she spent less than a meal out, in fact the call may have cost more than the groceries! it doesn't have to be a grand gesture though, sometimes just a call or a card that says you are thinking of her will do it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4xq95f/today_i_noticed_my_moms_memory_is_deteriorating/,Today I noticed my mom's memory is deteriorating.

"hey. first time posting here, but i'm at a total loss.  my grandpa is 81 and has alzheimers. he can still do a lot of stuff, but he forgets stuff like what the plans for the day is, what he's already talked about (the same joke 8 times a day), can no longer drive a car, and because of alzheimers + hearing loss, he has a hard time keeping up with conversations.  my grandmother is taking care of him, and is doing her best, but she gets so frustrated - probably because he used to be so different from what he's like, now. unfortunately this turns into her snapping at him and coming off as insensitive towards him, as if she disregards the disease and makes it seem like he's forgetting on purpose.  i don't visit them often anymore, because it hurts too much to watch - the way ny grandpa is now, how my grandmother treats him, and how hard it is on her (they live just the two of them; ny aunts' families live in the same town but are busy with their own families).  honestly not sure what i'm even looking for. what bothers me the most isn't my grandpa and the disease, but my grandma and how she's treating him. i want to be able to visit without feeling like shit afterwards. a way to cope?"," i had the same problem with my mom dealing with my dad.  she gets tired.  she is tired of him asking 20+ times if we are going to the store. so we take over for her.  just keeping him in a different room watching a movie with him.  i'll take him out if i run to the store, picking up food or just out for a ride.  stuff like that allows her to breath and me normal again.  see if family members can help out maybe for an hour maybe once a week. you can come by and pick him up or even sit outside. just like with my mom & dad,  she loves your grandfather but this was not how life was suppose to be.  i hate to hear when she snaps at him...but the good thing is my dad doesn't care. doesn't phase him that he pisses her off.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4wkeja/caretaker_gets_frustrated/,[deleted by user]
"my grandma takes forever to eat food. she has her food liquified and moves her mouth like she's going to eat it, but it doesn't get in her mouth because she doesn't really widen it. it's like she forgot how. how can i feed her easily?"," my mother was like this as well.  it sucks seeing someone forget how to chew, swallow,  suck. we have her ensure as well and eventually bought a nutri bullet blender to blend her food with ensure, but that only goes so far. the real problem comes when she can't get liquids up the straw. can she swallow liquids without a straw?

feel free to talk about stuff from the week. it can frustrations or silly things that have happened. ," vent thread.  i love it.mom's currently in independent living with her husband, but apparently she's been leaving her apt very early in the morning and wandering the halls.  i realized at her last doc appt that she doesn't even know what decade we're in.  i repurposed an old cheap android tablet to be a dementia clock and programmed in mealtimes and recurring activities.  i hope it helps.  free app - the facility people want me to move her to memory care but she says she is ""not interested; i'll just move back to [childhood town she hasn't visited since her parents died 15 years ago]!""  i dunno what i'm going to do with that situation.  plus we can't really afford one parent in memory care and one in assisted living.oh yeah, one of the other ladies saw us checking out memory care and was like ""what were you doing on the other side?  they don't want to put you there, do they?!  you don't need to go over there, have you seen the people there?!  i was across the street (assisted living) and it was terrible.""  thanks, ms. pat.  -_-visiting this weekend.  i usually crash on their couch but apparently they're both dealing with some stomach stuff (bathroom is in their lr).  fingers crossed.  there is a hotel nearby if it comes down to it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4wb84q/on_fridays_we_vent/,On Fridays we vent!
"hello, i am hoping for some advice/guidance on where to start.  my dad was diagnosed by his doctor with alzheimers about a year ago.  since then he has gotten worse.  he still remembers everyone, but he is repeating a lot of things, and he forgets what he did just a little bit ago.  just last night he got into a car wreck which was his fault.  he is currently still in the hospital being observed for a heart arrhythmia (sp?)  my father has been on disability for the past 20 years or so.  he collects ss and has medicare only.  he just turned 64 years old and lives in western pa.  he lives with his long time girlfriend, but she cares for her recently disabled adult son full time.  i live 8 hours drive away, and with him getting worse i need to prepare for when he gets really bad.  i've seen both of my grandmothers go through this and i know it gets ugly.  this is all incredibly sad and i have no clue where to even begin.i am guessing i will eventually want power of attorney to make decisions for him.  i also know he will resist any kind of nursing home, but i feel his girlfriend will not be able to properly care for him.  some kind of in home type care would be ideal, but i know medicare is limited.  any advice at all is very much appreciated.  this is giving me such anxiety and its even harder not being near him to help.thank you so much in advance. i am grateful for a place like reddit where i can speak with others who have similar situations."," you definitely want power of attorney, including medical.  get this done sooner than later, while he still has capacity.  check with his doctor on how long it is safe for him to drive.  my mom's doctor sent a letter to the state fairly early; they in turn yanked her license.  she hated him for it, but i'm grateful she had to stop driving while she was able to remember she wasn't able to drive - i can't imagine trying to take keys from her now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4w05rb/lost_on_where_to_start/,Lost on where to start
"hello there,my aunt has been suffering from what appears to be alzheimer's disease, but may be some other form of dementia. the diagnostic aspect is unclear at this point.i'm just wondering if someone informed in the field of alzheimer's or general dementia research could give me a bit of information on the most promising latest developments in terms of drug trials and/or other therapeutic measures. my aim is to search for clinical trials which may be beneficial in tackling this demon.thank you", i don't have any specifics to give you but you might reach out to [the alzheimers association]( to see if they can help.  its probably a good idea to x-post to /r/dementia .,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4vtvqj/most_promising_clinical_trials/,Most promising clinical trials?

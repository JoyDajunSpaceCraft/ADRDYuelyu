"my dad has mild dementia and was prescribed 5mg twice a day for 3 months. he tolerated the medicine well without any side effects so the neurologist increased his dosage to 10mg twice a day. his paranoia and memory are much worse since starting the increased dosage.we let his doctor's office know today. they will let us know how to proceed, but i wanted to ask on here if anyone has had similar observations after dosage increases."," that med's pretty harsh imo, some 50+ side effects listed [here](have you got him eating/drinking healthy nutrition?  he's only at the mild stage, might not be too late to slow it down or halt it.  some of my healthy living tips are mentioned [here](",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/snw6at/namenda_increased_dosage_causing_more_confusion/,Namenda Increased Dosage Causing More Confusion

"my dad was removed from his facility two weeks ago and has been in the hospital since. he is moving into a new facility because his old one decided they didn’t want him back due to his irritability and aggression. the hospital didn’t have any issues with him, despite having to keep him to his room, something he hates. but we are moving on to better things, i hope. my question is, how i can help him settle into a new place? he isn’t orientated to space and time at all, so he won’t remember his old place at all, but he will know he is in a new place that isn’t “home.” of course i’m bringing his things, photos, his guitar, and what not. but is there anything else i can do except be there?"," my mother was first moved to a large retirement complex with wide halls and lots of space. it confused her worse and she kept getting lost. we moved her to a smaller apartment with less hall space etc. it helped immensely. she's still upset that she isn't home and she insists that she's going to buy another car and drive again but she's less confused than she was with a ""too spacious"" facility. there's nothing you can really do to ease his fear (and yes he is afraid) except be there. we don't argue with mom because it just doesn't work and it upsets her further. remember that when it gets to that point they've lost everything and now they are losing their memories.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/snvbn3/resettling_my_dad/,Resettling my Dad

"hello,&amp;#x200b;i hope this is a proper place to ask a question like this. i've been researching dementia for some time now, for a writing project. the project itself is written from third-person, from the perspective of several different characters. however, one of these characters is suffering from nerve cell death in their brain for a number of different reasons, and warning signs of early-onset dementia are making themselves present. everything that i've read about regarding dementia is usually from a third person (even in journalistic form), so i'm having difficulty trying to imagine what it is like to actually \*have\* dementia, making it difficult for me to write from this particular character's perspective. i feel like it would be a little cliche to just go off symptoms as viewed from the third person (i.e. character finds character suffering from dementia wandering around, lost, having forgotten where they are or what they were doing). for example, there is a sequence where the character awakens--as told from their perspective--having forgotten who they are and where they live, but because it's early-onset, the episode doesn't last terribly long before they suddenly have mental clarity and realize who they are and where they are.&amp;#x200b;can anyone explain what it's really like to \*live\* with early-onset dementia? what are these episodes of ""forgetfulness"" actually like, from the perspective of someone actually suffering from the disease? is it just like that--an episode? where somebody loses touch of their own reality for a period of time before suddenly ""remembering""? it sounds a little silly, describing it like that, but that's why i'm here asking this question, because i'd like it to not be a silly depiction. i'm also open to any reading material if anyone has any recommendations.&amp;#x200b;many thanks", i care for my grandma and she has progressed but i do remember some of the things from early onset.side note- she suffers from vascular dementia.i can think of at least one clear example. when my grandma could still drive (2018-ish) she left our home and went to church. she got home at her usual time and i asked her how it was. she told me she never made it there. she got lost and came home. she has lived in the area for 30+ years and luckily knows most of the main roads well. she told me she didn't want to drive anymore and gave me the keys. another example is losing her place while reading. she loved to read but i think could not remember where she left of even with a book mark. she began to underline the sentences. that way she knew where she was. so she had books that were just full of lines. giving up complicated tasks (like using the computer) for simple things. insisting she had changed clothes when she had not. things like that.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/snoxge/writing_dementia_from_the_perspective_of_someone/,Writing dementia from the perspective of someone suffering from dementia.

as the title reads my mother in a nursing home is in late stage vascular dementia.she’s bedridden incontinent refuses to eat but drinks plenty fluid. but refuses protein drinks cos she’s deemed them ‘medicine’. refuses all oral meds but is on morphine patches.she’s got a ulcer on her buttocks and it now has puss and a smell is noticeable so sounds like an infection. palliative team will attend nexti know without a doubt this isn’t due to bad care the home is incredible i’ve seen how they work and they’re not understaffed have t had covid outbreak they manage it well.they thought she’d pass at christmas but she made it through no co morbidities either.has anyone had experience with their loved one having an infected bed sore?, ask the hospice team. sometimes sores are part of the dying process. source: husband is a wound care nurse.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sktov8/bed_sores_pressure_ulcers_infected_anyone_had/,Bed sores / pressure ulcers infected - anyone had experience with this?

"we went to pick her up because she developed some sort of hoarding behavior and couldn't really get into her house anymore. she was apparently sleeping in her car, even in the snow for were not sure how long. now she's visiting us while we try to figure out the best plan for her and she has never been here. she's obsessed with finding missing objects. (delusions or past memories) she went walking down our street in the rain yesterday to find a jacket she thinks she thru over the fence at some building that doesn't exist, here anyway. we are worried about her safety but also wondering how best to manage her anxiety around this. when it's not the jacket its the dogs she left next door or her billfold etc. i'm thinking she may have a bit of ocd or hoarding related ocd / obsessive thoughts or fixations. are there tasks we can do or things we can say or medications we can try?", some of my tips were posted in this [topic](,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/skkx3x/need_some_ideas_for_my_aunt_pretty_please/,"Need some ideas for my aunt, pretty please?"
"i’m in rural northern california. mom has dementia. transitioning from stage four to five. my sister (who she has cut off and disowned recently because of something that didn’t actually happen - but is 100% real in her mind) and i have talked extensively over the last few years and we made the decision to a) leave her in her home as long as possible, and then b) when she it wasn’t safe for her alone we would put her in care. we were making a plan to rotate staying with her while we arranged that, and help her pay bills with her still being the primary agent. her paranoia and personality shift has now made that impossible. it’s evident i’ll need full conservatorship within the year. knowing it can take months . now i’m at the stage where i need to take action both financially and medically and i have zero knowledge of how that works. i need a social worker or something. resources. i’ve made calls to a few attorneys for first step consultations, and i contacted “a place for mom” so i can get a list of memory care units to get on waiting lists… but i’ll need to have guardianship before then because she will not go willingly. i don’t want to wait until she’s completely non-compos mentis because i don’t know how well care for her when she’s there and we have to wait months to get in someplace. ghaaas… i need a checklist or steps of what to do. i need like, a guide or something. it’s crazy that this is so complicated and difficult. i mean i am willing to do what’s needed… but how?"," you don't need guardianship. you just need medical and general power of attorney. a bit trickier if she has a trust, but still easier than guardianship. you can get your mom to go to the memory care unit, it's just hard. don't tell her your plans, get the list of everything the place needs, then find an excuse to take her to the doctor. the doctor will need to fill out forms, and your mom will need a tb test, etc, etc.on move day, just keep talking to her, taking turns with your sister or other family members, until she agrees to go. this could take hours. hug her and love her. imho it won't be any easier with guardianship.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/skjzz6/where_on_earth_do_i_get_guidance/,Where on earth do I get guidance.

"(dealing with someone with dementia can be dark and isolating.  sometimes on fridays we try to look at the lighter side of things.  which can include some dark humor, i guess...)mom: ""stop vacuuming at 3 in the morning!""me: i don't vacuum at 3 in the morning.mom: ""then tell your wife to stop vacuuming at 3 in the morning!""me: my wife doesn't vacuum at 3 in the morning.mom: ""then lock the doors!  somebody has been coming into the house at 3 in the morning and vacuuming!!""me: ...me: ...me: ...(i mean, where do you even go with this?)a few days later, when it rained heavily, our cellar's sump pump went on.

"i had a friend that suggested me to create a journal about my day as a caregiver of  someone with dementia. my mother in law is in home hospice with stage 4 lung cancer and dementia. it has been a hard time for us. what do you think of the idea and of my journal entrance? jan 26. i was able to found her dentures yesterday, they were on the freezer. but she misplaced it again today. two more hours looking for it. i found it on the jewelry box in her bedroom. i asked why she took it off and she said it bother hers sometimes. i need to think one way to prevent this from happening everyday. we had help from sister-in-law last night. she stayed overnight to watch over her. poor thing, she barely sleep because mother-in-law was up every 15 min to go bathroom. our new washer and dryer was installed this morning. she is already obsessed with it. i caught her outside three times messing around with it. saying it was bouncing (it was not even on). or throwing dirty clothes in the floor. i remind her that she shouldn’t go there because it is easy to fall. i know she is bored and want to be independent but she can’t do this anymore, she can’t even turn on the tv and change channels by herself. i need to think ways to entertain her that does not include her hiding her dentures.", i think its an excellent idea to keep a journal if you can find the time and energy to. i sort of wish i would have from the start of my loved ones diagnosis. my main reason to keep a journal if i did would have been to keep track of their decline and to express my personal feelings in this difficult journey with him. also to write down any helpful insights that you learn that maybe later on you could use. my lo was evaluated recently and the lady suggested i keep a journal to keep track of certain triggers that worsen his behavior. in short a journal can be a great learning tool. i too am dealing with his denture problems of misplacing them so i'm going to keep them from him til he needs them. i've been told if it becomes too much of a problem then it might be best to give him very soft foods and do away with the dentures completely. best of luck and support to you op!☺,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sjriwx/creating_a_journal/,Creating a Journal

"i try so hard to make an effort and call my mother. she lives alone still and is doing ok, very early onset.but i dread calling sometimes. i’m depressed and it makes me more depressed. she gets stuck on something negative and just vents to me. but instead of venting and getting over it, she goes on about it again and again. i’m then living it and having to experience this negative thing with her again and again.an example is her toxic relationship with her neighbor and friend. they are friends, then they fall out, then they are friends again. and it’s over the silliest things.i called my mother to tell her about my health scare and instead of asking me about it she just switched the subject on to “you will never guess what my friend said to me!” before going back on to a rant about her friend that i have heard a million times.i end up trying to get off the phone before the negativity gets to me. usually make an excuse about my boyfriend coming home or needing to get food. how do you shut off these things to stop them affecting your mental health?"," so she eventually gets ‘stuck’ on this high emotional topic.  can i offer an idea, to try? at another quiet moment, brainstorm some prompts about really positive past stories either important in her life, or a moment she had a proud achievement, or events you shared. the prompt could be you starting a short two sentences of the story or asking a question that gets her on that happy memory. avoid anything really recent. avoid wording like ‘do you remember…’ and maybe you need to adjust the simplicity of your phrasing to match her ease of understanding. you can have the list near the phone, to try one during her call. (probably after she got some time to express herself about the negative experience that was bothering her) this has worked for me to have some really lovely conversations about older memories. i have a book of questions (it’s supposed to be for ice breakers or something) but it gave me lots of ideas of happy topics too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sj5n9s/dealing_with_depressing_conversations_over_the/,[deleted by user]

"i'm 32(f) and since we got an early diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, the plan has always been for my father (62m) to move in with me and my partner when he was no longer able to comfortably drive. he had been travelling in a caravan, trying to enjoy his retirement as best as one can when faced with impending loss of everything that you are.my mother left him when we got the diagnosis, so she's not an option. my younger brother doesn't own a house to provide for dad. i'm the only option.i am currently 6 months pregnant with our first child after close to a decade of infertility. child is both very welcome, very unplanned and terrifyingly inopportune timing. how realistic am i being about the possibility of caring for a newborn, and for my dad at the same time? i also work full time but for the most part dad manages ok by himself during the day.so far he doesn't have many aggressive episodes so i manage ok, but i don't know how the change in the household (both routine and noise) will or won't trigger him. would love to hear from folks who have lived through what we are facing.i don't want to place him in assisted living any sooner than is necessary for him, but i also have no way to know how badly this might go. thanks in advance x"," congratulations on your impending arrival! i have two kids and a parent with dementia. i agree with other comments that i would recommend finding more help for him separately, because it will really be exhausting, and honestly difficult to do a good job caring for both a person with dementia and a new baby. for you, your dad, and the baby, the best situation will be one where the caregiver has the necessary emotional and physical reserves and respite. best of luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/silr1m/father_has_dementia_caregiver_expecting_first_baby/,"Father has dementia, caregiver expecting first baby"

"new to the sub, and i'm hoping this community might have some insights for us! i recently have noticed that my mum (64) is saying a lot of things, multiple things in each conversation, that are demonstrably false. she's always had very different views from me, and she's not highly educated so for a long time i wrote this stuff off as normal. but these days it's becoming more common for these conversations to make her irrationally frustrated and angry. last night she was spitting venom at dad for not making a recipe for dinner because he said they didn't have the ingredients and she made him list them out and started yelling that she had some of the stuff and he could substitute other things and then threw out some wild stuff like 'dont forget, she was making it for 8 people!!'. these conversations never make any sense, she gets so frustrated when people don't just agree with her and do what she says they should. so i asked my sister, who works as an ot with elderly people, what this might mean. now, she doesn't see them as often as i do, she lives interstate, and she believes that it is dad who is in early stages of cognitive decline but she isn't sure about mum. i spend a fair bit of time with dad, we get along, and i haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. but i get along better with him than i do with mum, and my sister gets along better with mum than she does with dad. is this playing a factor in all this? has anyone else had this happen? also, is there any way of testing our theories? or do we just have to sit and wait for it to get worse and then somehow try to convince them to bring it up with their doctor?"," my patient is a lot nicer to the family that visits from out of town, compared to the family that she sees every day. they can indeed muster all the energy to keep their cool for a couple of hours or days. also, the time of day matters. late afternoons and evenings tend to be worse than mornings.she may not notice the cognitive decline quite as much because it is so natural for mom (or you with dad) and her to think along the same wavelength, and be used to filling in each others' sentences. especially if you have a high-involvement communication style. maybe try consciously not doing that for a while.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/si8g1x/advice_would_be_appreciated_my_sister_and_i_cant/,Advice would be appreciated - my sister and I can't agree on which of our parents is entering cognitive decline

"anyone experience something like this?  my grandmother is 90, mid-stage, but early-ish mid-stage.  just over a week ago, on the 23rd, she went into the hospital.  it was just a little over 24 hours, and she didn't actually need to be there.  she woke up with a bad nose bleed around 3am, my grandfather couldn't get it to stop, called for an ambulance.  they were able to get her nose to stop bleeding, but she started going on about being dizzy, she can't sit up, she's going to pass out.  the thing is, she's known to do this.  she's had a few other mental issues her entire life, and this isn't something new.  my grandfather panicked though, and told them to take her to the hospital.  bad choice given what hospitals are like now.  long story short, she had to lay on a bed in the hallway from 4 am to 5pm, before finally getting a room.  had a doctor look at her that night, then again in the morning.  all that happened is her nose was dry (not surprising they run their heat at 76f at night), and she must have been picking at it.  noon the next day, she's back home.  since then though, it's like her dementia symptoms have doubled in severity.  she just lays on the couch most of the day.  she gets completely out of it for hours at a time, like she never has before.  the six months or so, there have been issues with her getting angry when sundowning, but not too severe, and it was only in the evening.now, she's getting angry and throwing tantrums in the middle of the day.    she's began going to bed some nights with her clothes on and insisting they are her pajamas and fighting about it with my grandfather.  she's stopped putting on makeup in the morning or fixing her hair.  she no longer wants to leave the house.  she won't go out for lunch or dinner.  i told my grandfather he needs to make her an appointment with the doctor, but this seems so weird.  her dementia has been a slow and steady progression over the past five years, with some plateaus for several months here and there.  but now, for some reason this 30ish hour hospital stay, which was for nothing serious, has triggered her to the point where her symptoms are more like someone who is entering the late stage. at first we thought maybe she was just a bit frazzled from the experience.  i probably wouldn't be in a good mental state if i was stuck in a hospital hallway for 13 hours with nothing to do.  but she's still like this 7/8 days later, and seems to be getting worse.  has anyone experienced something similar to this with a family member?", ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/si6cr6/short_hospital_stay_has_caused_a_severity_in/,Short Hospital Stay Has Caused a Severity In Symptoms?

"just some idle thoughts on a monday.before my dad was diagnosed, the idea i had of dementia was of someone just getting gradually but peacefully more forgetful.  a slide into dottiness, let's say, and a loss of ability to take care of themselves. awful, of course, but the main burden on the caregiver would be seeing to their needs. i had no idea that feeding my dad or making sure he took his meds would be the absolute least of our problems. i had no clue about the bizarre behavior that was in store, of the anger, the paranoia, the accusations, the aggression, the obsessive-compulsive behavior that turned every attempt to provide any kind of care into, potentially, and hours-long battle. i had no idea of how utterly relentless that behavior would be, day and night. i had no idea how my dad would turn into someone i no longer recognized, and not because he forgot me, but because he did things - awful, scary things - i would never have imagined he'd be capable of doing. and no one with that knowledge warned us about any of it. all the neurologist warned us about was that he might hallucinate, and if he did, there were meds for that. she didn't point us to resources. i googled for them myself. she handed out pamphlets but the pamphlets didn't say a damn thing about how our loved one was going to lose their minds in a way more reminiscent of severe mental illness than mere dottiness. i did find resources online and started to get an inkling, but that was only through support groups like this.do we just not, as a society, want to talk about this at all, to the extent that doctors won't even tell the truth for fear of spooking the patient or family? i think that's the case, but that leaves us all to stumble through this blind, not knowing what to expect and being blindsided by the reality of it. has anyone had a similar experience? and if this is how it works, how do we change it? can we change it, or will any attempt at raising dementia awareness fall on deaf ears, because no one wants to hear about what it's really like unless they have to know because, hey, they're in it up to their necks?"," i think that’s a hard question to answer because it’s a multifaceted disease that affects everyone differently. i agree that the psychotic aspects are grossly under disclosed by medical professionals. it seems that they only share on a need-to-know basis and on our end at least, it’s like “hey, here’s your diagnosis and it’s a life sentence that’s never going to get better or be predictable.” i’m in a similar predicament as you are but it’s coupled with years prior with mental illness. it sucks and is so incredibly painful to experience from observational, relational, and interpersonal stand points. i’d love to hear more about some of your resource findings for meds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sh4x6r/why_does_no_one_tell_the_truth_about_dementia_and/,"Why does no one tell the truth about dementia, and how can we change that?"
"our journey just got a little more complicated - mom's having problems with soiling herself. this just started and i'm at a loss about the logistics of dealing with it in a way that allows her to keep her dignity as much as possible. she lives in a memory care facility and it's a nice place, we take her out a couple of times a week for lunch or ""shopping"". i also take her to a local park/garden and we walk. however, with this new twist i'm not sure how to handle it. first off - diapers. so far i don't think she's full-out having bowel movements in her pants, although i can't swear to it. she just told my father about this yesterday. we thought it had happened before but it was sporadic. what is a good option for this type of incontinence? also - i haven't changed a diaper in 22 years (my youngest child who is now an adult). is the procedure pretty much the same sans changing table? if you're out with your lo and this happens, how do you handle it? i don't want to shame her if we have to change her diaper when she's out, or just leave and take her back to the mc to handle it if i can avoid it - that would seem punitive for something that's out of her control. if you are able to change the diaper, what the heck do you do with it if you're out? any tips, ideas, assistance would be highly appreciated. thank goodness for this sub - you all are a godsend to me. &amp;#x200b;tia."," a lot of good information here, just one more tip; a water bottle with a sports top makes a useful travel bidet.  you can fill it with warm water at the tap and bring it back into the stall to direct a stream of water where needed.  if it is a major disaster, you can even fill it with soapy water and then rinse.  my mom went through a rough period during her chemo where i'd use a hiking hydration pack.  it worked like a charm.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sh0mt4/diaperssolution_for_fecal_incontinence/,Diapers/solution for fecal incontinence

i'm wondering if care homes for patients with dementia are covered by medicaid/insurance typically or if it's all out of pocket. i'm trying to determine if when the time comes all my mother's savings will just be sucked up or if she will have some of her stay covered., ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sgrbzq/care_homes_and_the_costs_associated/,Care homes and the costs associated
"can it stay at a certain stage? does it have to? idk how exactly it works, but does it always have to end in death?"," there is a difference between symptoms of dementia and ""dementia"" as a diagnosis (which usually becomes more clarified with time to alzheimers, vascular dementia, lewy body, or fronto-temporal -- although there are close to 100 types of dementia).  symptoms of dementia can be caused from many different things. many times the dementia progress can be either reversed or arrested -- if they are caught and treated in a timely manner.but dementia as a diagnosis is brain failure and will end in death.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sgpzjt/does_it_always_have_to_progress/,Does it always have to progress?

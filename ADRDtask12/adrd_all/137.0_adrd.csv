"my mother has had lewy body dementia for the past three years. i recently read an article in a newspaper giving advice about how to care for a loved one with dementia. the gist of it was that you have to 'see past' the disease, as the person you love is 'still in there somewhere'.it said you have to be patient, keep calm, and try to inhabit the 'dementia world', wherever that is. it may as well have recommended buying a unicorn and riding it there.i'm not going to pretend i have answers, because i haven't. i've stumbled through the last three years with absolutely no idea if i'm doing the right thing or not.what that article failed to offer, like most of the others i've read over the past three years, is useful, realistic advice about the hundreds of bizarre everyday challenges that dementia brings with it. they don't tell you about the reality of what it's like to live with this appalling disease.they don't tell you how to deal with your previously kind, gentle mother swearing at you and hitting you in the head as you desperately coax her into the shower to try and get rid of the ever-present smell of urine.they don't tell you what sort of nappies to buy when she becomes incontinent; let alone how you're supposed to persuade her to wear one, or how to stop her taking it off and stashing it in a pillow case.they don't tell you how to persuade her to take her medication when she's screaming that she's going to call the police because you're clearly a member of the gestapo who's trying to poison her.they don't tell you what to do when she thinks that the small boy you pass on your walk is her grandson and so wants to talk to him. neither do they tell you how to placate the angry parents who think they've encountered the world's frailest child snatcher.they don't tell you about the helpful passer-by who insists on intervening because they've mistaken her having a meltdown in the street (and you desperately trying to get her home) for a geriatric kidnapping.they don't tell you about the resentment that arises when relatives become invisible and stop visiting, leaving you to deal with the whole sorry nightmare.they don't tell you about the hours of paperwork, endless bureaucracy and pointless meetings with social services you have to trudge through when all you desperately want is some advice and support, but it takes six months for them to assess whether or not you're entitled to even get on the waiting list for advice and support.they don't tell you about the hours you'll have to spend on the phone trying to claim disability benefits for her because the person on the other end insists that they have to speak to her personally in case, as her daughter, you're trying to steal from her. they're sorry but they really do have to check with her that this isn't the case, regardless of the fact that she can't remember her own name, let alone how to use a phone, because that's how the system works.they don't tell you about the gp's visible annoyance when you bring her to get checked for a urinary infection for the fourth time in six months, even though they were the one who advised you to bring her for regular checks. of course she's displaying peculiar behaviour, she has dementia, and they have lots of other patients to see today. cheers doc.they don't tell you about the friends she's had for years who gradually stop coming to visit because they 'hate seeing her like that'. i'm pretty sure she hates being 'like that' too, but she could really do with a friend. they'll all be at her funeral though, because that's what friends are for, isn't it?they don't tell you how to deal with the crushing realisation that she's never even going to be able to phone you again, let alone see you get married or be a grandmother to your kids.they don't tell you how to channel the anger you feel when you realise that your fellow 30-somethings' lives now revolve around marriage, mortgages and kids and yours revolves around a terminally ill, confused old lady who doesn't even know who you are. they've chosen their responsibilities; you'd give anything not to have yours.they don't tell you how to deal with discriminatory landlords who don't want her living in their property because dementia has rendered her, in their eyes, a 'threat to the community'.they don't tell you how to not laugh when she insists that you give 'the kids' a bath, because 'the kids' only exist in her head but you still run the bath and carry out an impressively elaborate child-bathing mime because it makes her happy, and she doesn't have an awful lot to be happy about these days.they don't tell you what to say when your 67 year old mother cries because she thinks she's 12 and panics because she can't find her (long dead) mother and she's packed all her belongings and begs you to just take her home.they don't tell you about any of these things."," this is beautifully, heart-wrenchingly, perfectly put. thank you for the vulnerability and frankness. hit me right in the chest in the worst and best ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/47p4po/they_dont_tell_you_these_things/,They don't tell you these things

"updated . . . . . . . . . . . . . so the move went better than i ever would have expected - but i'm a pessimistic realist. i changed my ""loving lie"" wednesday night to this:  the dr. wanted to change her medications, and wanted to have 24 hour monitoring for side effects.  rather than a hospital stay, we were able to get her a bed at the assisted living home we had visited a couple weeks ago.  she went for it, and even helped us pick out her clothes and stuff she wanted to take.  we didn't take a lot of stuff - since she thinks it's a temporary thing.  my wife and i got her moved in and my mom met the staff and some of the residents who were very welcoming to her.  when it came time for lunch my wife and i excused ourselves to go get our own lunch, but came back about an hour later.  we stayed with her until around 4, just before dinner for the residents.  she was doing well and did not get upset when we left.  on friday, my mom learned that there is a house phone that she can use, and proceeded to call my dad about 5 times, which caused some stress and confusion.  but we got through it, and mom sounded good when i talked to her.  visited her on saturday, and took her crocheting stuff since there were other residents (and staff) that want to learn how to crochet.  my dad visited her sunday, and my wife is heading there today.  the thing i was not expecting was the level of emotions that i went through this weekend.  i think i've kept all of this bottled up so i could function and get mom moved - and it is releasing.  i was (am) angry, sad, frustrated, guilty, wanted a hug, wanted to punch things, a shit storm of emotions.  it will take time to sort through all of this.one day at a time . . . . ."," one day at a time is the only way you can manage. the emotional roller-coaster is very difficult. it really surprised me how i could feel relieved, angry, sad and guilty simultaneously. i'm at the stage now where i'm often a bit sad. sad that my relatively young mother was struck down with this cruel disease. but i'm also relieved that she is receiving good care, she is safe, warm and as comfortable as possible. sometimes that is enough, sometimes it feels little comfort.thank you for the update and my thoughts and very best wishes are with you and your family",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/476c3x/update_the_move_is_done/,Update - The move is done!!
"my 83 year old grandma has been living with us for over 10 years and has alzheimers and diabetes. early on it was a real hassle trying to learn how to take care of her and deal with her illnesses but we've adapted and have a much easier living situation. fortunately my grandma still has strong verbal skills, can walk and is only forgetful of very short term events. the biggest dilemma with her is that she has become accustomed to jumping on every opportunity she has to sneak food from our kitchen fridge which is a problem as she doesn't combine normal meals and almost always go for carb heavy items which spikes her blood sugar to incredibly high levels. she won't hesitate to do this even after eating a full meal. we do have preventative measures in place which is primarily locking her door whenever no one is downstairs in the adjacent living room to supervise her. we end up feeling guilty for locking her door for so long that we end up leaving it open but she essentially waits for someone to walk upstairs and rushes to the fridge. though i realize her alzheimers can make her forget when she last ate and that her diabetes can cause her to feel hungry even has food in her stomach their have been many instances where we catch her sneaking food, ask her to put the food back and she proceeds to start eating it right in front of us until we forcibly remove it from her. her main target is often ice cream but we started keeping all of the very diabetic non-friendly food in the garage fridge which has a electronic keypad on it, this resulted in a multitude of unsuccessful attempts from her to access that fridge though she has succeeded on occasion when we forget to lock the garage door. it's these kind of events that tells me she willingly attempts to sneak food most of the time. i setup a small whiteboard next to her that i write down the time for every meal of the day and check whether she ate it. this has been helpful for her from what i can tell but it's questionable. on top of that i don't always remember to update as i'm not her sole caretaker and she sometimes misplaces the marker. no matter how many talks i have with her the one thing i seem incapable of changing are her food sneaking habits. i can understand if she forgets she ate recently but her food sneaking is very intentional. only passive security measures such as locks have been able to truly prevent her from sneaking food and even then only if we lock it which we sometimes forget. besides that the only other issue is her excessive knocking on her bedroom door. almost every time it's to inquire for her next meal which she likely already had recently. her balance has been getting slightly worse though this is most notable when she has low blood sugar which has led to some nasty falls. however through constant reassurance and reminders she now uses her walker regularly but even so still tends to fall with or without with blood sugar fluctuations. i make sure to be nearby when she has to travel through the house."," there comes a time when you have to ask yourself what you are accomplishing by tight blood sugar control. there is a lot of controversy about this lately:>but for someone who is 85 and frail, has other chronic diseases and already takes lots of medications, who lives in a nursing home or needs that level of care, aggressive treatment for diabetes is unlikely to pay off in better health, dr. lee said. looser glycemic goals might serve better.finding a doctor who is more in touch with the current treatment of an elderly dementia patient might result in less hypoglycemic falls and more ice cream.

"i'm starting to get quite worried about my father as he is causing a massive amount of anxiety and stress for my mother. i know no one but a dr could diagnose him for sure but everything i've read seems very vague and rare for someone so young. plus, my father absolutely refuses to see a psychologist and i don't think he is telling his gp about certain things. i just wanted to give some specifics to know if it's even possible as he's only 54.1. he has a medical history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, is pre-diabetic and has had a bypass surgery for eight arteries. all of his siblings have had similar issues though they've seemed to adjust their diets for better health. he has not.2. i've never known my dad to have a good memory. for the last 20 years he's been losing keys, wallets, etc. however, now he'll ask a question, walk away, then ask the same question two minutes later. sometimes he'll ask a third time. this happens two to three times a day. he's never been good with birthdays or dates, but now he can't remember when my mom tells him that she has to work that day or the next.3. my brother used to work with him. he had to constantly remind our father how to do his job. his job was putting caps on bottles at a factory. he would consistently miss bottles completely or put them on wrong. my brother was his supervisor and was able to cover for him. 4. he can't understand what is socially acceptable anymore. he went from teaching us that god made everyone equal to being vocally racist. he has no filter for things to say in public. my brother left his job because as a recovering drug addict he couldn't work somewhere that had drug busts in the parking lot. my dad told all of their coworkers my brother quit because he was 'dope sick'. there is absolutely no reason to believe my brother has relapsed. my dad should know this. our father was found to be smoking weed in my brother's car even after repeated explanation that it could put my brother back in prison. he doesn't seem to care and/or understand.5. the other day he sat and read the newspaper for 5 hours straight. he didn't understand why my mom was upset that he hadn't done anything else. 6. he showers like once a week and thinks we're 'picking on him' if we tell him he smells. i'm pretty sure he also wears the same dirty clothes over and over. he sees nothing wrong with his shoes that have no inner soles, multiple holes, broken laces and collapsed heels. my mom has been finding washrags he uses to wipe his bottom instead of tp.7. he insists he has undiagnosed add and does have a history of depression."," this site is a great resource, and this article talks about early onset alz.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/46yjv6/dementia_at_54/,Dementia at 54?
"i work in a social model of care and also a acute model of care facility, and i had to share the success i have had with a few of my residents. we introduced the *""fur real"" friends cuddles the monkey doll* to our residents and it wasn't 100% successful for all the residents but our female moderate-acute with vision issues had massive turn around. in two cases gp's have actually been able to reduce risperidone and citalopram doses d/t  75% decrease in aggressive episodes both physical and verbal over 90 days.  we had one lady who in our social model would pull the fire alarms (despite dementia proof covers) about once a week and we have not had an incident for 3 months.    the doll is great because its less than 100$  and it constantly demands attention, the eyes are very large and fur around it is soft, it responds to touch and voice and gives the resident a lot of attention that staff often cant. anyways if any of you are struggling with a resident who is female, and aggressive it might be worth a shot. kind regards.", that's interesting! we never had talking dolls where i worked. neat that it could help. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/46tcqy/massive_success_with_introduction_of_a_new_toy/,Massive success with introduction of a new toy.
"let me start by saying that when someone can't remember to wipe their own ass, they certainly can't remember that they have anything to apologize for. so if you are lucky enough to get one, it's pretty meaningless. if you have unfinished business (as in open wounds) with a dementing parent, what is the right way to get emotional closure? is it even possible? if a parent was cruel, abusive and neglectful to you, and the wound is still open, it is often human nature to keep longing for that apology (an authentic one), for a real reconciliation. yet dementia does not confer sainthood on anyone, no matter how wretched the disease. it is still the same person, yet now an even more difficult and demanding person than ever. and yet, it is only natural to want to be loved by our parents wholly and completely. it will never happen though, is the sad reality for many of us. at least not as a two way thing. talking to a demented person and expecting a sane response, is as good as shouting into a vacuum. so that leaves it to you (us, or me, whatever the case may be). there's always good old, fashioned christian forgiveness! yeah, but no. the punch to my head that left my ears ringing and my 12 year old body blacked out on the floor, is still a bit fresh in my mind 26 years later. that and all the names, the humiliations, the being kicked out of the house at 15. it all kind of sticks in my mind. forgive? fuck you. let go? i'd love to. but how? she's a harmless old nutter now, but i'd still not even attend her funeral. and everyday it still fucking hurts. it's like expecting something from a dead person that isn't really dead yet but might as well be. and i wish i could just close this wound once and for all."," in order for you to move on, you don't need closure from her, you need it from yourself. find yourself a counselor. it's completely worth it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/469zk3/dementia_and_reconciliation/,Dementia and Reconciliation

"hey everyone.  i'll be attempting to move my 73 yo mother who has frontotemporal dementia (for about 4 years) to an assisted living facility on thursday.  my dad has been taking care of her, along with my wife and i, and a hired caregiver during the day.  i know we need to move her where she will have care 24 hours a day, and to give us some peace of mind (if that's even possible).  i took her to visit the home about 10 days ago, and she liked it, seemed happy, liked that they have a cat there too.  but when we got in the car and talked about it, she said she didn't think she needed something like that yet.  we're going to use a ""loving lie"" and tell her there is a problem with the water/plumbing that needs to be fixed to get her to go along with the move on thursday.  i guess i'm looking for some support, stories, similar experiences from this group to help get through this.  i feel guilt for lying, guilt for moving her and giving up, just plain guilt.  i'm scared it's not going to work, that she won't adapt to the new house and routine.  any info you can share will be greatly appreciated.  thanks!edit:  i want to thank everyone that responded.  i will give an update as to how everything goes this week.", i had to do the same thing in march this year for my 76 year old mum and it's definitely not an easy thing to manage emotionally. you'll very likely feel a huge range of emotions from relief to guilt all at the same time. the only thing i kept telling myself was that my mum was now safe and in the best care possible for her situation. it's an awfully hard step to take but try to keep strong in knowing that it's the best thing for you all. hugs from me to you ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/45w6ye/making_the_move_this_week/,Making the move this week . . .
"hello everyone. i will make this as short as possible. i am posting for advice on my grandma, which i have just moved in with. she has done a lot of fucked up shit to me and my family since my grandpa died, and lets just say that there is a lot of greed in her. everything is about money and she never stops talking about how people are taking advantage of her. she does not clean, cook, bathe, or do anything much. she usually sits on her couch and talks to herself but she tells me she is telepathically communicating with people. she will ask me the same questions over and over again but does manage to put some things to memory over time. she only ever thinks and talks about one thing, and that is her non existent money and properties. my parents were somehow able to get her to get medical tests and scans done, and the doctor very clearly stated that her brain does not look like someone who has dementia or alzheimers.. he believes it is all psychological and recommended a psych eval. as soon as my grandma heard that she shut down and refuses to go to the doctor and calls him a ""quack"". when she tells me stories that im able to refute, she will always think of an excuse as to why shes right or why she thought that. she is never wrong.... i want to help her get out of this mind loop but im not sure how to handle it. she has so much anger towards everyone in my family except for me, which is why im able to live with her peacefully. i post here because she has many symptoms of a dementia/alzheimers patient but no one can force her to get her diagnosed. app refuses to do anything because in their eyes she is still a functioning human being.... no one will do anything for her. "," a lot of people from that generation (having lived through the great depression) get very focused on their money/possessions and the fear that someone is scamming them. that said, her behavior is in no way healthy/normal. in old age, it becomes more difficult to tease apart a life time of personality disorder or untreated psychiatric condition. but i tend to disagree with the conclusion that she doesn't have some kind of dementia. the early stages of alz don't show up in imaging. there is often no physical evidence of the the mini strokes that lead to vascular dementia. i think vascular dementia may be worth investigating too, not that it matters too much because none of it is particularly treatable. whatever the case may be, her behavior probably won't get any better and will likely become difficult at some point, and medication may help manage it. don't hesitate to get her involuntarily committed for a psyche evaluation when her self-care deteriorates to that point.

"my grandma has dementia and i am more than done with all the shit i have to put up with day in and day out. i am literally pulling my hair out every single day just trying to move on with all the stress i have to deal with.let's just start with a few things i have to deal with:1. name calling: my grandma is very religious and i'm constantly being called a ""demon"" or i should go die because she doesn't like the way her food is prepared, she blames me for ""supposedly"" for going into her room, or just for something so menial and retarded i just can't.2. my grandma loves to believe that everything is mine mine mine: this one really irritates me and just overall makes me want to punch a wall, because no i'm sorry but not everything is hers. after she's done eating she likes to take the plate and silverware to her room because ""she bought it"" and it is supposedly hers, and once it is in her room it then is lost forever in the dark abyss of her luggages (she doesn't use a dresser despite one being in her room). you don't know how infuriating it is having to buy and waste money upon buying new plates, cups, you name it just because my grandma took it. not to mention, she believes every single one of my own nike shoes is hers,  clothes of either my own or my moms are being stolen left and right, and just recently she stole my dogs fucking sweater. i don't know about anyone else, but when my own shit is taken i feel as though it is an attack on my own very existence, and best believe until whatever is stolen is returned i will not stand for such bullshit.3. too many questions: i feel as though i just tape a sign to my forehead that reads whatever question she's asking, and often times it's the same god damn question just asked over and over and over and over and over again. it'll really drive someone nuts. sometimes i get so tired of answering the same questions over and over again, so i just flat out ignore her and when i do that she gets mad that i don't answer her questions. i get so frustrated with this one because she asks questions such as ""where's my mother, father, or brother?"" and i of course for the millionth time in row have to break the news that they of course are all dead.4. she walks out the door: this one is truly my favorite as it requires me to waste my time and physically chase after her around the neighborhood. if my grandmother is truly upset, because of whatever reason it is she loves walking out the front door and going who knows where. you don't know how many times i've had to call the police because she wouldn't get into the car with me, and come back home and sometimes i feel so embarrassed having to call the police. not to mention, just recently when she walked out the house she started to throw rocks at my car (thankfully missed).5. hygiene: this one is just really fucking gross and there's no easy way to put this. but once my grandmother is done taking a dump sometimes i notice she doesn't really wash her hands even though there's a huge sign in the bathroom mirror that reminds her. all she does after depositing her shit is splish splash a little water and a smidge of soap onto her hands and doesn't even properly scrub. not to mention, she hasn't taken a shower since like november and me and my mom try and try our best to urge her to take a shower but no as she thinks we are attacking her.these are the things that only just scratched the surface of what i have to deal with day in and day out, and i know what everyone is going to say, it's the disease don't take it seriously, just brush it off. no. i am done brushing it off and i am taking this shit seriously. i also just want everyone to know that i am barely 21 years old (my birthday was a few weeks ago). i am a full time college student. so on top of all the stress of my classes at school i have to deal with the stresses at home. also no, i don't have the means to go out and live on my own. i'm certainly not a trained professional and unfortunately i am not being payed at all."," first off, i commend you for dealing as long as you have and for being a full time student at the same time. secondly, i agree with the others that you are in over your head and it's time for her to be in a memory care home. if she is wandering and you are routinely having to call the police to locate her, it is a sign that her disease has progressed to the point that she can no longer be cared for at home. the hoarding and hygiene thing (or lack thereof) is typical dementia. it will only get worse. i think you guys need to see what her insurance/medicare/medicaid will cover in the way memory care. it is too much on you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/44rrih/i_am_just_about_ready_to_kill_myself_living_with/,I am just about ready to kill myself living with someone with dementia
"day one of hospice, things were confusing, as the medical director from the sub acute facility said one thing and did another. looking back, i think my husband was already beginning to die. the first night i had to call the hospice nurse since he became more restless and spiked a fever. she told me what to do then said she'd come in the morning.her initial assessment was 6-8 weeks, then he'd slip into a coma. that first night i slept squeezed between the bed railing and his thin body, stroking his hair, singing amazing grace and swing low sweet chariot until i lost my voice and fell asleep for four hours.day two of hospice, while one son had to go to philadelphia for business, the nurse re-assessed my husband and said he had already started the transition, and had possibly 24-48 hours. she changed his meds, and said to administer more of some, every two hours. my daughter took the day off from work, quietly sitting on the sofa in front of the wood stove, with firewood delivered by her husband's brother. an aide arrived to bathe and clean him, even though i had taken several hours the night before to trim his fingernails and his beard.day three of hospice, after the nurse left at 2pm, a chaplain arrived. she asked a lot of questions about how we met, family members, and what his job had been prior to retirement. both she and the nurse said that even though he'd been almost deaf for years, in their experience, towards the end of life hearing seems to heighten. the chaplain put one hand on his leg; i had one hand on his feverish forehead and the other on one of his hands. she began by saying, ""so, paul, i hear you're an atheist but i want you to know god's arms are open wide, already embracing you as you begin a new journey.""she went on, saying that his work on earth was done, that he had been a good steward, a good son and brother, a good husband, a good father and grandfather, a kind and gentle spirit. i was surprised that instead of crying, i felt overcome by a swirling energy that started at my feet and circled my husband, then the chaplain. later, i told her this and she said she had felt [god's presence]( as soon as i opened the door, not so much from ""that room, where your cats are freaking out, but from you.""the chaplain left; the aide hugged me and left. i checked on my husband at 4pm, was slightly annoyed the aide had completely shaved off his beard and mustache, but happy she had put on a fire engine red collared shirt my father bought for him years ago. i was on the phone with someone who had me on hold when our younger son urgently called me to my husband's bed. i remember thinking, oh, fuck, i missed the timing of his pain meds. my son was attempting to take his father's pulse and he calmly said, ""i think dad died.""my son-in-law and two of the three grandsons had just arrived. [he came back]( and said yes, hugging me with tears in his eyes. he's seen death before. i called the hospice nurse back and said he just passed. she seemed oddly surprised, but said she'd be here in 10 minutes. she very efficiently checked him, and with a catch in her voice, pronounced the time of death at 4:53pm february 3, 2016.the eldest grandson came directly from an afternoon college class, striding past all of us standing clumped in the kitchen, and headed to the former dining room. after that, the youngest made some excuse to look for one of the cats ""under grandpa's bed"", then after pretzels and potato chips, the middle one slipped quietly into the room.i may not have recorded this exactly in linear order, but there was a point at which it all became surreal. dealing with his two sisters went alright, but the two daughters was beyond the pale, and may god forgive them until i can. maybe in the future i will write about all of the ridiculous red tape, but for now, i'm going to put another log in the wood stove. thank you all for listening by reading what i've been writing since his diagnosis of alzheimer's.paul carl becker ii (4/5/1939-2/3/2016). there are no goodbyes. i miss him already. i feel him everywhere.--i originally posted this [on a small writing site i normally post to]( but i wanted to share it here on reddit as my first contribution.", i got tears in my eyes reading this. your love for your husband came across in every word. my heart goes out to you and your family. so very sorry for your loss. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/44dz2n/dying_in_new_jersey/,dying in New Jersey

"i'm caring for my mom who has pretty mild vascular dementia, which mainly affects her short-term memory, but for whom care is pretty straightforward. this week we had lunch with one of her friends who also has dementia, but her short-term memory loss is a lot more pronounced; she remembers who people are, like who my mom is, but literally forgets things said 3 - 5 minutes prior, so she's asking questions that have just been answered. she's widowed, like my mom, and is currently living alone, even though she has grown children. i suspect that none of them are living with her because it's pretty exhausting to be answering the same questions over and over, again, which still doesn't justify leaving her alone, in my opinion. so, in living alone, while she no longer drives, she does ride an adult tricycle around the neighborhood, which, so far, hasn't resulted in anything serious regarding being injured or getting lost. what's troubling is that when another of my mom's friends has put the question to one of her sons about what if something happens, like a fall, his reply has been that someone in the neighborhood will happen upon her and make sure she's all right. this is troubling to both me and my mom's other friend, who has suggested, in the past, that she always have someone around to look after her. my questions are:* is the current situation acceptable?* if it's not, what is an effective strategy, approach, and/or argument to get her children to realize that she requires some sort of 24/7 care provision?* are we overreacting?the choices that i see are that:* she moves in with one of them, a caregiver is hired during the day with a family member being with her in the evening and overnight.* a family member moves in with her.* she's moved into a residential memory care facility.she currently living in the family home, so i suspect that moving her out would be a less than desired option. anyway, i'm looking for any good advice, including options that might not have occurred to me."," it doesn't sound like an acceptable situation in that she herself probably is confused and unhappy living alone being that she said she wanted someone to look after her. that said, since you are not family to her,  i am not sure what you can do besides call her adult children (not sure what your relationship is like with them), or call social services to asses her situation. having close to zero short term memory makes her an easy target for scammers, and i can't imagine how she gets her adl's and basic errands done without help.

"i know there is no true answer to this. i know there are hundreds of factors, and everyone progresses through this differently - and yet, there's part of me that really needs to know what to expect.  does it take months?  years?  how much of that time are they still truly ‘them’?  my dad was diagnosed with mild dementia a few months back, and i live 1,000+ miles away.  i'm struggling with the guilt of not being there with the rest of my family, guilt for leaving the burden of this on my siblings, with feeling helpless, and fear because i'm not seeing him every day and watching his progress. my mind immediately goes to a dark place when my siblings tell me stories.  at this point, it's mainly been small things.  at first, he just couldn't quite remember where he had just placed something down, or if you asked him where he had been working a job last week, he couldn't tell you. for the first time this past week while my mother was in the hospital, my sister drove him home and he had no idea where he was, he didn't recognize anything until she finally pulled up and he said, ""oh, that's my house.""  he's been aware of it though, and tries to make jokes about his bad memory. i've noticed he's become much quieter and anti-social, and i suspect it is in part because he doesn't want to say anything that is 'wrong' or reveal something he has forgotten. i see my parents about 1-2 times a year.  since his diagnosis, i've seen him about 3 times, but it's not something we can financially keep up without bankrupting ourselves.  and yet, there's this thought in the back of my head that says, ""how many more visits will there be while he's still my dad? while he still knows who i am?"" and then the panic sets in.  how long was it before you ‘lost’ your loved one to dementia? honestly, i just don't know how i should be feeling. most days i'm fine and i'm calm and then others it is like living on an emotional cliff.  last night, i couldn't stop crying just reading through this subreddit and picturing his future.  am i overreacting?  or jumping ahead of myself?  to some extent i feel like i am grieving him before he's gone instead of enjoying time i do have with him. i struggle between telling myself it’s okay to feel however i’m feeling, and trying to get myself back together and tell myself to suck it up, it’s not that bad yet, he may still have normal years ahead of him. when i try to educate myself about all this and try to find support through things like facebook or this subreddit for example, i find it upsets me more than anything - i want comfort but instead i get angry as i see exactly what my dad is in for in the coming years.  i struggle to know whether or not it is better to dive in and feel all this pain now, when we are still only at the very beginning – or try and pace myself and deal with it as it comes.  it’s so easy for me to numb myself to everything happening back at home since i’m so far away, but then when i visit, i get smacked in the face with all that has changed. i don’t expect many to have read through all of this – i think it was helpful for me just to put it into words all the conflicting feelings i’m having on this.  i feel selfish even focusing on myself as if this is all about me instead of about my father.  but even so… i’m dying to know… how much time do we have?", i read it's an average of 7 years from diagnosis. but some people live much longer. my wife lasted 6 and died in her mid 60s. is there a local alzheimers association? they have good info including for family and carers. often the person with dementia is oblivious. it's the family who struggle and the carer who has the mental  health risk ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/43vb38/how_much_time_do_we_have/,How much time do we have?

"i really need some advice. my grandfather was diagnosed with lewy body dementia three years ago and things are getting really hard mostly because my grandmother was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer on late november of 2015. because of her cancer she also experiencing mental confusion and she is wearing a colostomy bag that needs to be emptied every 3 hours, she can't do it her own and she always forgets the instructions and the bag is always unsticking. it's supposed to last a week but with my grandmother lasts a few days. my mother is doing the changes but she's no nurse and takes an hour to do it.meanwhile my grandfather can't be alone because he is paranoid and he is always hallucinating, we can't speak on the telephone without him pursuing us to know what's happening. he is one eye blinded and has glaucoma in the other eye. he refuses to eat, says all the time he's just waiting for death, is clearly depressed but refuses any help.both can't cook and we have to make their meals and remember them to eat, to take their meds, to shower, to go to bed and all things like that. my mother is putting all weight on her shoulders and i suggested to move them to a facility home. but we are afraid we are doing it without trying hard enough because sometimes they are well and things seems ok, you know? are we making the right decision?"," usually by the time loved ones are questioning if it's time, it really is time.i work in a long term facility and we get a lot of patients with dementia. i can't imagine how hard it is to make that decision but i try to comfort families by telling them that eventually they get to a certain point where the caregiver burden becomes too great for the average family. it's no fault of the loved ones, it's just the progression of the disease. if i were to have dementia later on, i would rather be placed in a facility with professionals trained to deal with it than to be an increasing burden on my loved ones. do your best to make sure it's a good facility.by the time we get patients we feel lucky to hear families say that they are just becoming too difficult to take care of, rather than the family waiting for a significant event as a wake-up call (ex: one patient was found alongside the highway, trying to eat rocks. another was found on the roof of his house. another had hallucinations and nonsensical speech, but his family still thought he was okay to drive!) :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4386ax/when_its_time_to_move_them_to_a_care_facility/,When it's time to move them to a care facility?
"maybe i'm a bit pessimistic here, but i kind of doubt it will ever be cured unless we cure aging itself. i feel as though we are trying to mask the symptoms instead of fixing the underlying cause. but having said that i'd like to hear others opinions on this. do you think dementia will ever be cured? if so when?"," prevention is always better than cure. and one possible preventable causes is water contamination. trace amounts of metals in our water supply, through constant exposure, eventually bioaccumulate in our bodies. our minds work overtime to get rid of excess metals on a daily basis. slowly but surely, our minds calcify under the burden of metal toxicity.once more emphasis is placed on purer water circulation, the potential for many accelerated dementia cases could diminish.other factors within our control, such as stress, pollution, inactivity and obesity also increase the odds of developing dementia. simple things, like drinking tea and coffee, may have a protective effect. green tea improves metal chelation - the binding of harmful metals into substances that the body can more readily discard. and regular coffee consumption is said to limit damage to the body on the cellular level. drinking high silica containing mineral water is also said to reduce the content of aluminium levels in our bodies, as the silica binds to the aluminium, allowing it to be excreted.there are treatments that can remove the amyloid tangles that form in dementia. and early intervention with these therapies look promising - but only in cases that have not already progressed far. ultimately, it is the therapies that strengthen our existing defences against attack that are key.galvanising our minds with myelin enhancing agents, such as lithium or valproate, offer a certain amount of protection against dementia in bipolar patients. perhaps low dosages could also be considered and administered to those without bipolar who are deemed at risk?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4369b9/will_dementia_ever_be_cured/,Will dementia ever be cured?

"im 19 years old, and have returned home from uni for the christmas holidays. my mother who is in her 50's was diagnosed with corticobasal degeneration (cbd) and alzheimers a few years ago, and is cared for by my father. usually when i return from uni for the holidays, i can tell the condition has worsened, however this time i can tell it has become really bad. my mum can no longer communicate properly and is constantly seeing things which are not there (e.g: someone killing people outside the window). the past couple of nights she has been unable to sleep and is constantly crying and screaming. now she is trying to escape from the house at any chance, even though she cannot walk properly or use her hands. it is very distressing to hear and see, and i think my dad is really struggling now as he can't sleep or leave her alone at any time. i want to be able to help, but will be returning to uni in a weeks time, which will mean even more work for my father. if anyone else is/has experienced the same situation, some advice would be greatly appreciated. what are the next steps, if my mother continues to be like this or worsens even more? edit: spoken to the doctor today, and they have prescribed lorazepam to my mother, however she still appears to be a lot more distressed than previously. thank you all for your kind comments and support. it's comforting to know there are people out there who know how difficult this is."," you are so young to be losing your mother like this (and your mother is so young), i am very sorry for what you are facing. having worked in a facility that cares for dementia patients, now is the time you should consider a memory care facility for your mother. it is cold out, bad weather. wandering is a real danger for people like your mother. she would be safer in a facility and have proper medication management for her agitation and hallucinating. you and your father could rest more easily knowing she is a place made to keep people suffering as she is safe and comfortable. everybody worrying and suffering with her at home doesn't improve things for anyone.

"my 89-year old grandmother has advanced dementia/alzheimer's. i am 1 of 2 grandkids, and specifically moved back to her city about 6 months ago to be near her during her inevitable decline. we have always been very close, and watching what has unfolded in the past few months has been unspeakably painful, but nothing compared to what i have witnessed in the past week.i will describe the situation as concisely as possible:since the summer, mimi has been confined to her lounge chair in the living room. her alzheimer's makes it difficult for her brain to connect with her extremities, so as much as she may want to get up and move around, she cannot without a considerable degree of assistance. she does not sleep at night; she just sleeps in 10-15 minute increments throughout any given 24-hour period. she has had a night sitter with her for the past few months who could comfort her and get her up to use the restroom throughout the night so that my 94-year-old grandpa could get some sleep. in the days leading up to christmas, we noticed her getting a bit more sluggish and tired, but failed to realize what was going on (sluggish &amp; tired changed from a 8/10 to a 9/10) and the day after christmas, we were unable to get her up out of her chair at all. this prompted a trip to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with dehydration and a uti.after 5 days at the hospital, she was discharged to the ""skilled nursing"" unit of a reputable nursing home nearby. from what my parents say, this could be where she remains. once she transitions out of skilled nursing she will most likely become a ""long-term care resident."" yesterday was the first time in my life that i have seen a nursing home. after mimi was admitted, i sat with her in her room for a while so she could rest, then sat with her at dinner. as i cut her food for her, i surveyed the room. not a family member in sight, just a bunch of 70-90 year olds hunched over in wheelchairs, in mostly complete silence. i don't know how to accurately convey the feeling in that room, but it will haunt me.she was wheeled back to her room after dinner, and after she said things like ""i feel like i'm in prison,"" ""i wish you would tell me what happened to me,"" and ""please come visit me,"" i began crying as controllably as i could as she drifted off to sleep. as soon as my grandpa arrived to sit with her, i excused myself and full-on ugly cried in the courtyard for about 15 minutes. based on the level of care she needs, i can see why my parents think she will have her needs comfortably met there. i cannot, however, comprehend how on earth they are ok with her being there, alone. i am doing everything i can with my work schedule to make sure i am there if nobody else will be there with her, like this morning at breakfast. my mom and grandpa were planning on arriving at 9, when breakfast is served at 7:45. picturing her sitting by herself in that dining hall makes me sick to my stomach. she is most aware in the mornings, and she knows she is in a nursing home, which she specifically stated she never wanted. i got there this morning at 7:45, and walked nervously through the system of corridors to get to her wing. some of the patients were already in the dining hall, and i frantically scanned the room, hoping i didn't see her and that she was still in bed. as i was about to head to her room, i spotted her sitting alone at the end of a table in the corner of the dining hall. as my heart shattered, my brain swirled to comprehend what i was looking at. why is she not at home? why are they ok with this? i rushed over to her and started talking to her, asking how her night was, did she sleep, etc. then came the questions...""what is this place called?"" ""what happened to me?"" ""why is that man about to fall out of his chair?"" and ""i hope this never happens to you, sweetie.""i haven't talked about the last few days, so i guess i just needed to get it out. i don't think there is anything that will make me feel better; i will be with her every day at breakfast so that she never has to be alone. i just wonder if anyone can provide insight on what type of care she will receive when we (family members) aren't around, and whether there are ever any good nursing home experiences. currently, i am devastated and cannot sleep because i know she is lying there awake, confused, and upset.tl;dr: i am very close with my grandmother who has just been admitted to a nursing home. i am devastated at this decision, and 1) cannot understand why my parents are ok with this, and 2) cannot bear the thought of her being alone and wondering why we have left her there. looking for insight from those with experience in this matter, as i know nothing about the world of nursing homes aside from the horror stories."," hello there, i am so sorry for the pain you are in and touched by your love for your grandma. i worked in a memory unit as a caregiver for two years, so i am very familiar with the scene you describe. the only thing i can say is that there are few good options. if does not seem feasible to give her round the clock care at home, as it seems the rest of your family is saying that they can't handle it anyomore. while it pains you greatly, the physical and emotional needs of the rest of the family such as your grandfather, need to be kept in mind. keeping someone at home like that, where by your own account she was stuck in a recliner, dehydrated, not sleeping and suffering from a uti, is arguably not a better solution than a nursing home. at least in a home, there are every 2 hour diaper/bathroom checks, frequent med passes to deal with the insomnia, agitation and depression of the residents. also, usually snack and hydration every two hours too. is it like a real home? no, but modern society and the ages to which people are now living, makes this type of home care increasingly difficult. you should discuss hospice care, either at a hospice center, her own facility or at your home. i cannot see protracting her life with more fluid infusions and antibiotics while she sits confused in a nursing home to be the kindest path.

[deleted]," i'm really sorry to hear about your situation with your mother. i think because you stepped up to the plate and took on her care the other siblings have been able to shirk their responsibilities. this likely comes from a place of guilt/fear and not an openly malicious place of selfishness. dementia as you know is terrible and heart wrenching and slow.the only thing you can do is tell them how you are feeling. while you may feel that it should be obvious to them how you feel and that they should be visiting more they will be blocking those feelings allowing their 'lives' to get in the way. i recommend after the holidays when emotions are not so highly charged that you go out with your siblings, to a neutral place and talk with them. no accusations, no shouting, write down what you want to say, let them know that you wish they would visit more, ask them to take on some responsibility so that they can see how much you do for your mother. i am also assuming here that all your siblings had a good relationship with your mother growing up. because that is something else to consider,children owe their parents nothing if the parent-child relationship was a bad one.i hope that you are able to find some happiness this holiday season and that you are able to talk with your siblings to see why they are not visiting often. my family does not visit my father, but that is because my mother is a psycho bitch and makes visiting him truly horrible (it is a long and shit story). i know he misses everyone, but i also know that he knew this would happen. it is heart breaking, but he chose her insanity and all. good luck with dealing with your siblings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3xl4yw/how_do_you_deal_with_family_treating_a_dementia/,How do you deal with family treating a Dementia patient like they don't exist anymore?

"right now i am sitting next to my mom hoping her morphine and anti-anxiety meds kick in. this dementia worked fast. from her early signs in 2011 to her now being bedridden and not communicating. i am mostly just writing because i cannot believe this happened. she was a teacher. she had a masters. she bugged me to have kids and when i did have one she couldn't even enjoy her granddaughter. at least she was aware around the time of her birth and knew her name. but now, my mom looks at me and calls me by her mother's name. she doesn't recognize me anymore. she doesnt talk anymore. she is barely hanging on atm and i am dying inside. this is my mom. this all happened within 4 years. 4 years. she wasn't even that old. she is 68 years old right now. that is so young but i know it could happen to people younger. i am grateful for her home hospice care though. the nurses that come by and check on her are so sweet and they talk to her as if she is family.i am rambling and i know it. i just didn't know this subreddit existed till today. right now my mom is hooked up to an oxygen machine. she was moaning/wailing about an hour ago. it was loud and her face was contorted in pain. i called the hospice hotline and they had a nurse call me back with a plan. i had to give her a full dose of morphine. and an anti-anxiety pill. her wails calmed down but its making me nervous. her nurse said this was a sign of decline and that hurts me so much. i dont want to lose my mom. i know she is in pain. she has two nasty bedsores we have been fighting for a few months so far. but i need her even if she isn't in there anymore. i love my mom and the thought of losing her soon just makes me so sad.i am blessed though with having a boyfriend who helps me with her. he changes her diapers and does her wound care while i maneuver her for him to do it. i know i am lucky to have him and lucky that he cares about her. he was the only one who supported me when we were struggling for a diagnosis. he helped me when everyone in my family was in denial and wanted my mom to just snap out of it. he was there when i kept breaking down and crying that i missed my mom. no matter how old we are, you will always cry for your mom or dad. my dad died in 2007 due to complications of diabetes. he had a heart attack and then later that night in the hospital, he had several more heart attacks. he lasted for only 6 months before passing. he died at my brother's home. i am watching the same thing happen with my mom. my brother's dont visit. i think it just brings back memories of our dad passing. its like deja vu sometimes. i wish i wasn't alone but even when they are here they just bitch at me. everyone in the family bitched at me. everyone had an opinion about how we should take care of her but no one offered to actually help. i am so alone even with my boyfriend. i mean, we have a toddler. when i am with my mom, he has to be with our daughter making sure she has all her needs taken care of. we don't even think of ourselves most of the time. i mean, we were hoping to get a date night this month. we had been looking forward to it all freaking year since we saw the release date for star wars. will we have that date night? nope. we got tickets on separate days in the mornings so we can see it but someone would be home with the baby and my mom. i miss my boyfriend. i miss date nights. i miss my mom mostly. she would be the babysitter. she would be the one spoiling the ever loving shit out of my daughter. and here we are, monitoring pain levels, checking diapers, wondering if the one year old will keep her bedtime, flipping through netflix and hbo watching movies while i keep an ear on my mom's breathing. this is not what life is supposed to be. i just needed to get this out. if anyone needs tips on feeding, changing, diapers, and anything else message me and i can offer some advice on what to do at different stages. we have been through it all. sorry for the rambling. :) dementia is hard on not just one person, but the person(s) who also take care of them.edit: update: my mother passed away this morning. her body was giving up but the doctors did all they could. her heart was the final thing to stop. i will love her and miss her forever."," for what it's worth, i'm sorry to see you go through that and hope for the best for you and your family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3x6gdr/dementia_and_my_mom/,Dementia and my mom

"i'm a med/surg nurse and i've taken care of my fair share of elderly patients suffering from dementia. i found that the patients whose social histories i knew the most about were often the ones i could communicate with the best. when a family shared information about their loved ones (occupation, favorite type of music, fav foods, hobbies, etc.), i was able to provide better, more personalized care.now, i'm thinking of creating a sort of electronic social record that stores social information about loved ones. families can upload and edit the electronic record and add links to youtube songs, add family pictures, videos, and stories. and all of this would be available via a private, password protected link that the families can share with facilities and caregivers. the goal would be to create a mobile app that could be played on a tablet while at the bedside. i think this would help nurses and caregivers such as myself. my question is if others think an electronic platform like this would be beneficial in the care of patients suffering from dementia/alzheimers.

"my mom was diagnosed with eod, ftd almost three years ago.  in learning more about this disease in that time, i think that she showed early signs of this illness at least 10 years prior to her diagnosis.  she's been a widow since 1987, and i'm an only child with no close relatives for either of us.she lives with her antisocial cat in a 55+ apartment complex on long island in new york.  my husband (36) and i (32) live in an apartment in connecticut, but we visit her every other weekend.  she volunteers at a church thift store a few times a week and goes to that church every sunday.  she also goes to a medical-model day center 4 days a week and finally has consistent at-home care through guildnet gold (basically medicare/medicaid insurance for the elderly) 6 evenings a week.  these daily outtings have been great because she's chatting with new people and participating in many activities.  she's unfortunately, or fortunately, also seeing the progression of dementia in other people which is sad, but also humbling.she's really with it most of the time, but also has had bipolar disorder and manic depression most of her adult life, so she has benign mood swings occasionally (i realize that this could/will get worse).  she also hardly gets any sleep at nights and has experienced this most of her life, so she can get cranky and tired early in the evening (maybe sundowning?).  she also has epilepsy, which her neuro believes is related to the ftd.  all these are controlled by meds, except for the sleep issues.she spends her free time watching tv, walking or gardening.  she consistently asks if we watch castle, grimm or person of interest, and the answer's always 'no'.  all she can relate to are shows and movies most of the time, but this isn't new as she did this most of my childhood.  she also doesn't socialize much.   people would describe her as odd, or quirk-filled.  she feels that people don't pay attention to her, but she's also a horrible listener, to her child and to people.  also, not new, but growing worse because of the illness, possibly.  fyi, her hearing is excellent, she's just always been a selfish, self-centered person.what prompted me to write all this was that she ran low on two of her medications and forgot which doctors prescribed them.  she got super anxious about running low, forgetting the doctors, and about letting me know about it, so her at-home aid called to talk with me.  i spoke with her doctor's aid about her 'script and they informed me that she missed a neuro appointment in october.  it also turns out that she has a bottle of medication with dispense directions that are out of date, and has run out of pills cause of this.  pharmacy now has the correct 'script and she's seeing her neuro next week.i'm thinking i'm really in denial about the progression of this disease.  a part of me thinks that she's ok with these current services, but then things like this occur and temporarily magnify everything.  they are not frequent, but i know they will become frequent.  yes, i know things will get worse, but for now it seems manageable.  am i fooling myself?  my mother?  is that how it is for everyone with dementia and their families?  when did you know, your parents know, that it was the next logical step?fyi, my husband and i checked out two facilities with alps beds, just to get a feel, last year."," can the aidecheck on her meds when they come in the evening?  or could her dr prescribe them all for the evening so the aide could always administer them to her?my experience with people who have dementia end up thriving once they adjust to their new, more supportive environment.  routine and structure, with someone closely monitoring her meds could really help her be less anxious and enjoy her favorite things.  it can take 6-8 weeks for the adjustment, sometimes sooner but sounds like she may need to be more closely monitored.

"i have spent time with many elderly people. i have provided caregiving for alzheimer's/dementia patients. besides loosing some abilities to perform normal self care, one of the first symptoms i will usually notice is asking the same questions over and over. i have see many elderly try and hide the fact that they are having difficulties. but, they will ask the same question, or even repeat the same thought/comment over and over again, because they cannot remember ever asking the question or making the comment before. this is a huge red flag.i have also seen many, many families deny to themselves that their parent or loved one may have alzheimer's and thus will put off providing them with the appropriate care needed until an accident happens. i believe denial among the family is almost as epidemic as dementia itself. this to is so sad. moreover, a lot of adults that have parents or loved ones with visible signs of dementia will put off getting the appropriate care because the parent or loved on is fighting against that possibility, and do not believe they are having enough difficulty to accept outside help. if this happens, is so important that the child (which is now an adult) becomes the parent. it can be very difficult to become the parent of your parent. but you must. and, you must make some decisions that your parent or loved one may not like. of course, be a very gentle parent to your parent, but do whatever you have to do to get them on board. tell them it's only for a few days or a couple weeks.my mother began calling my sister and me at work several times a day. she resisted in-home care. we told her we worried about her during the day while we were working, and we needed not to worry about her while we were working. she reluctantly agreed. within three weeks she thought is was one of the best decisions she ever made.

also what are somethings you should or could childproof around the house so they can't cause serious injury to themselves?," i think you need to get rid of the judgment about ""forcing"" someone to life in a group home.  there are so many issues at play.first off, i've been involved in care decisions for three elders in the family. * person 1 - i had the duty of convincing this elder to go into an assisted living facility.  they could have afforded in-home care.  unfortunately, some decisions in prior years made that logistically problematic.  the crux of the issue was accessibility.  due to mobility issues, the person developing a shuffle rather than walk, their home was no longer suitable.  yes, it would have been easy to remove carpeting or to change exterior steps to a ramp.  but the lack of a first floor shower is what really made the decision.  remodeling the house on that scale would have been extremely difficult.  had that elder moved to a single-story home in retirement, remaining at home would have been possible longer.* person 2 was obedient and used to following orders.  they lived in an accessible home that they took the time to remodel with old age in mind.  person 2 died before progressing to severe dementia and never got beyond moderate.  their spouse was healthy, they had several extended family members in the area.  between the family and in-home caregivers they were able to remain at home.* person 3 also lived in an accessible house near family.  that worked for a long period of time until it just didn't.  eventually they became upset with caregivers and was a bit combative.  this was a problem because they were obese and not easy to life, especially when non-compliant.  there came a point where single-person lifts were not going to work.  hiring 2 people round the clock would have drained their retirement savings blindingly fast.  so this person was moved to a facility that had specialized lift equipment and multiple cnas on staff for any given shift.in terms of what can be done to keep someone at home there are several things:* replace normal carpeting with high-traffic carpet * install grab bars * keep floors clear of tripping hazards* buy them accessible clothing * install a shower with a door & seat or a wheelchair accessible shower* get a hospital bed* use alarms so you know if the person tries to get up unassisted or if they go into areas that they shouldn't* be rich so you can hire 24/7 care* be very mindful of fire hazards ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3vz0ol/serious_do_you_think_people_who_have_dementia/,[Serious] Do you think people who have dementia should be force to live in a group home?

"my father was originally diagnosed with parkinson's disease 3 years ago where he lived in ohio and i just recently moved my parents to california so we could better help him.  i got him an appointment at the parkinson's institute in sunnyvale and the doctor there said he thinks he has lewy body dementia rather than parkinson's due to the progression of symptoms.  my husband and i suspected this when we were reading about dementia and parkinson's before this diagnosis. he is living in a memory care facility but i am worried that the care they promise is not the care they are actually giving.  i think it stems from being under-staffed.  memory care seems like a terrible place for someone who's memory loss is not linear (going in and out of awareness of his situation, etc.).  we aren't sure there is an alternative though.  any advice on that?  also, any games we could play with him or activities to keep him busy?  he is generally not interested in anything anymore and is hard of hearing and needs large print books to read (but only likes non-fiction).  thanks!"," if he is already wandering then he *has* to be in a place that he can be safe, even if it is sometimes not the most comfortable option. this is when you have to consider worst case scenarios, like the guilt the person who runs over him will feel. a family member of mine was killed in such an accident. dealing with them being a bit upset for a while at being locked up is preferable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3uh7wt/84_year_old_father_just_diagnosed_with_dementia/,84 year old father just diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies- need some advice.

"im not sure if there's another subreddit maybe i should post on, but here goes.in the past year, both my parents (dad 78, mom 75) have been diagnosed with dementia. dad's is more mild (mostly cognitive impairment), mom is alzheimer's. we had to move them into assisted living this summer—separately, because mom's dementia and delusions and agitation was pulling dad down a downward spiral.its been a few months now, and things have settled down a bit—though i now realize things never really ""settle down."" but i can't bear to see or call my mom much. now that i know shes being taken care of i find that i'm trying to close the door on her to save my sanity.i see my dad at his residence every other week—we laugh, and have lunch and talk, sometimes do puzzles and stuff.  he's changed a lot, but is still a person and i feel like its worth the hour-and-a-half trip to build on the relationship we have. mom is declining fast. when i visit, she's just fixated on leaving and being reunited with my dad, her husband of 55 years. (they get together once or twice a week—either i or my brother bring him over).she knows who i am, but nothing really sticks, and its the same 2-3 questions over and over. shes not really clear on where she is, or whats happening to her. i feel like 10 minutes after i leave its like i never came.my mother was an over-intellectual, opinionated, demanding spitfire of a woman. seeing her like this is eating me alive. i want to do everything and anything i can to bring her any relief or comfort, but i also pray for her to die.i feel like i'm slipping in quicksand. i get anxiety attacks just calling her—and the calls are just 5-6 minutes long with nothing really said.i have a brother who lives closer, and is very involved in both my parents lives. he hasn't given me a hard time, but part of my issue is trying to make sure i'm doing my share.how do you find the balance between obligation and survival? i feel like i'm at war with myself—part of me says ""you're selfish, you're lazy."" and part of me says ""save yourself."" i know thats normal in this situation, but how can i least start to heal, and find that balance?"," never allow yourself to think you are being selfish or lazy. you are doing your best to watch over your parents. this is a very mentally taxing situation to go through. the fact that you go see her every once in a while is you doing much more than others would do with their own parents.for your sake though, do what you can when you can. my grandmother has dementia and we had no idea for a couple of years. my parents moved her into their home from out of state and that is when we all saw that things were not sticking and she was time-jumping. i saw my happy parents decline from laughing with to yelling at grandma. no one teaches or shows you how to handle an ailing relative. my parents' goal was to never put grandma in a home but for their own safety and mental health they had to. grandma was becoming combative and tried to hit my mother with a frying pan. she would also disrespect my father in various ways including undressing and telling him he didnt live in his own house and that he couldn't tell her what to do in the house. it is because of my mom and dad that grandma was even being cared for. my mom is the only sibling out of 6 of them that made they effort to care for their mom. when your own blood doesn't bust a move to help or send money for care it is all on your shoulders you have an even heavier weight to drag. thank god your brother is active too in the care of your parents. the sibling support in all this in invaluable. just by you making an effort to call or visit your mom speaks volumes and don't let anyone else tell you different. being able to talk to your sibling and they know exactly what you are taking about helps in dealing with all of this.anyway, you have to take care of you. your mom is in good hands. let them handle what they are trained to do. yes, it is difficult to see her this way but whenever you see her don't look at what the disease has done to her. think about the good memories you have had with her and enjoy the moments of being in her presence. she is still physically here. even if she forget everything, use these opportunities to speak love to her. answer her questions again and again but keep saying your ""i love you's"" and give her your hugs. when you leave the facility or hang up the phone tell yourself you are doing your best and your best is good. then get ice cream or do something good for yourself because you may need to refuel yourself with energy, praise or just a peaceful setting/situation.hugs!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3ttjvb/i_feel_like_i_cant_do_it_anymore/,I feel like I can't do it anymore.

"for about 20 or so years of him doing contact jobs as a cadcam engineer, he would always say to my mother and me (when i was old enough to understand, i'm 30 years old now) that he always felt something was wrong or that something didn't feel right even though he didn't know the cause. this continued up until about 2003 when he was let go from his last job due to minor inconsistencies in his work performance. during the time of unemployment, the state i'm in offers a sliding scale health care system and the gp who was seeing him basically said that day he had diabetes and had it for a good while. he got on ssi and around 2004, we fell for the ""go back to work"" program and he got a couple of jobs lasting 2 years each, one in my state and one in arizona. this lasted til about 2008 when mom became the sole breadwinner of the house due to my father's deteriorating condition plus the ""go back to work"" trap that had ssi deducting a large amount of the monthly payout. it was about 2009 when things started taking a turn for the worse. during the intervening years between 2002-2009, he got a masters in it network management and was on the last legs of getting his phd before things really got out of hand. after many tests he was officially diagnosed with vascular dementia and it's been hell ever since. he has tried all of the drugs available but can only tolerate exelon patches which he was prescribed recently along with a pill regime of diabetes medications, insulin and oxycodone/apap (for pains associated with dementia) and at first clonazapam then diazepam for symptoms of his dementia (sundowning, anxiety, lack of lucidity). last month though, he had his first fugue rage state where he became violent, but we did get him to calm down after a couple of hours. he did break a few items but nothing of major value. i guess this comes down to one question; will these happen more often or do we need to fix this by making sure his psychiatrist knows (appointment next month) and in the mean time, what can we do to prevent an outburst like that in the future before they become more violent? could it be one of the medications he's taking? at the time of the outburst he was without the exelon patch, can not being on the patch cause such an instance or is it just our new normal now? thanks for any and all advice and suggestions. i would never wish any one, even my worst enemy, to have to be a caregiver of a dementia patient."," i have been diagnosed with early onset, for which there are precious few recommended medications. in order to stave off the progress as much as possible i take modafinil, and if i need to focus strongly, a nicotine patch - both strong cognitive stimulants.for day to day i take up to 500mg of caffeine and coconut oil, along with staying active with my hobbies, doing moderate exercise and a diet largely free of sugar and salt.the coconut oil i started after looking for and finding videos like this:it should do no harm to try him on 2 tablespoons of coconut oil for a month or so. it has a neutral taste and a nice mouth feel for me (in my coffee).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3t5ide/i_took_a_gamble_to_see_if_this_subreddit_exists/,"I took a gamble to see if this subreddit exists and I'm thankful it does.

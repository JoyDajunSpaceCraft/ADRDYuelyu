"i am currently helping my mom pack up so my dad, who had dementia, and her can move halfway around the world to be closer to family. they are going to move in with my brother till they find their own pace near by in brooklyn.i'm trying to make a list of things that he'll keep him occupied and not anxious. i noticed tv works well but almost too well. he needs a clock to tell him it's bed time, i'm thinking a toddler clock that shows red for sleep time and green for awake time night be good.i'm also thinning about gps tracking. what's a good option for someone that doesn't always bring a phone or wear a watch?lastly, any other tips? i'm worried that the new environment will be trickier than any of us imagine. he is slowly getting into the realm where his speech only make sense 50% of the time. i think he can somewhat recognize family but it's not 100%, even with his wife and his siblings or kids."," we got my father-in-law a clock like this: seems like a rip-off for what it is, but it was worth it.  i had been considering using an old android tablet and a clock app/screensaver, but i tested it at home and it would occasionally freeze or the screen would sleep and it would need to be restarted/reset.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9h7wh6/assisting_with_taking_care_of_dad_with_dementia/,Assisting with taking care of dad with dementia

"my dad is 89 and has dementia. we almost lost him a few times this year, came very close when he was in icu.  doctors were convinced he would be going as well.i have a friend, who i have known for 30 years and let’s name her denise. denise and i did everything together and always had fun. she was my best friend.but there were a few instances were i realised she isn’t really there for me. i was taken to hospital by police and ambulance around nye because i was suicidal. then i had to dog sit on nye because i couldn’t back out. i was desperate for someone to stay with me that night as it triggered me. my mum couldn’t come as she was looking after my dad. denise held a small get together at hers and i invited her over the day before to see the dogs but she couldn’t come, because ‘she was making jello shots’ she knew i was in hospital a few days earlier. the kicker ? when she needed a small, harmless op i sat with her in er all night and morning. i looked after her pet and visited her every day. the next morning she posts pictures of her having drinks with her friends. i had friends i never met or only knew a bit try and come and see me but couldn’t, as they lived in another state or had a night shift or kids.when my dad was dying, she didn’t reply to the message till the next day. just a generic ‘i’m here for you’ which is her standard. she’s never come to my place, she knows i’m stressed with university, work and my dad. never once offered to come my way. i always come her way.she had a breakdown a while ago due to work, messaged me. i right away go an uber and took her for dinner and listened for ages. we met once again when she was better, and she never once asked about my dad.i don’t want to be friends with her anymore. i had friends who i met a few months ago check on me more and look after me. i’m so hurt.", yeah no offense but she seems like a terrible friend. you gave her your time long enough.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9g173s/best_friend_is_not_supportive/,Best friend is not supportive
"my grandma has lewy body dementia. it is such a roller coaster, i never know what's coming.most of the time i use distraction techniques to combat the hallucinations and paranoia. and only sometimes i tell her the truth, like ""you do live here"" ""that's husband, doesn't he look familiar?""but...she's pretty loud, and delusions can happen anywhere...like on an outing, in the parking lot, on a walk. i have had a few awful incidents with both of my grandparents and since then i am super selective where i take her.it's so embarrassing. i know they say that people will be able to tell it's them with the problem and not you. but sometimes it seems like almost nothing works to control the situation. hate feeling like i have no control over the situation. when she is agitated/combative, it draws attention. you see the elderly in public but you never see them losing it in public. everyone always says hi to her (i don't think they can tell she is soooo impaired)i'm not a parent so everything i learned with her was on the spot.they say people with dementia can still understand facial expressions, so i try to show positive energy, smile, etc, and hide the frustration. she does not like to transition, like if she is watching tv she does not want to get up and change activities. but after like five minutes, she is usually happy on a walk. today, she kept telling me she wanted to go back, and i wasn't going the right way, etc. she will say loudly ""no! don't go that way, stop!"" over and over. i told her we are doing the same walk we always do, we will eventually go back. i also thought i should start ignoring her bossing me around, bc maybe she will stop, but its so hard to know what she understands.she also mostly only says no, to everything i ask her. if it truely is a tantrum...it lasts until she is tired out. otherwise this general behavior comes and goes...i almost don't know what to say when she says stuff on our walks. sometimes i do want she says, sometimes i keep going...and sometimes i stop. because nothing coming from her really makes sense."," it sounds like your taking the right steps. i find that redirection is generally the most helpful with delusions and hallucinations, depending on the situation. for example, on your walks, if she says you're going the wrong way you could say you're going to see some flowers, or there are some birds up ahead you want to see before you turn around. it also helps sometimes to hold hands. i've found just touch can be reassuring.when i've taken my father-in-law with lbd out i've been pleasantly surprised at how supportive strangers are. even if they don't know about his condition, they are generally pretty understanding when he has an episode.  you're doing your best. don't be embarrassed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9fzj0i/what_do_you_do_when_a_person_with_dementia_is/,What do you do when a person with dementia is freaking out in public?
"my family has been taking care of my grandmother (85 years old) for about 3 years now. she displays frequent bouts of confusion and paranoia and i'm not sure if she has dementia. i know that symptoms of dementia vary by patient but i'm just curious if this sounds like dementia to people with experience?&amp;#x200b;my grandmother has been living with us since my grandfather passed away about 3 years ago. technically she has her own apartment but refuses to sleep there alone because she is ""afraid"". at first, she spent the days at her place and my parents picked her up around 6\~7 pm after work since she hated being alone after the sun went down. &amp;#x200b;she's just gotten worse and worse about being alone since then and now takes the bus to our house at noon every day. it would be one thing if it was just that but her paranoia has been a constant. she often makes us drive her back to her place to ""check"" on various things: her rice cooker, the stove, the faucet, the windows, the lights, the list goes on and on. she has good days sometimes but other days she expects us to drive her to her place (a 30 minute drive each way) 3-4 times a day. if we refuse she will start crying and say that she will die otherwise or say that if we don't take her then she'll just walk there. she's alienated all of her friends back at her apartment complex because she calls them 6-8 times a day about whether her door is locked/her lights are off/etc. &amp;#x200b;the biggest incident was in late 2016 where she was very anxious about her rice cooker being plugged in. she had already driven back to her house 2-3 times that day to check herself. my father went with her and checked as well. we all knew it was not plugged in. our family was going to a movie and she pulled me aside and asked if my boyfriend and i could drive her back to her place to check. i told her no since we were literally standing inside the theater and had already bought tickets. as soon as the movie ended she started causing a scene in the parking lot and threw herself onto the ground and said we had to take her to her apartment or she would die right then and there. when we got to her place, her rice cooker was clearly unplugged. i even put my hand inside the cooker and found it to be cold - it hadn't been plugged in all day. but she insisted that it had been left plugged in and that it was a good thing we came back because otherwise her apartment would have burned down. &amp;#x200b;there haven't been any public tantrums since then but she has paranoia episodes at least 3-4 times a week. and she constantly lies about appliances being left plugged in. she recently taped her light switches to the off position because she's convinced that they randomly turn on in the middle of the night. (she spends the night at my house. she wouldn't even be home at her place to see the lights turn on.) her apartment management told her that this is a fire hazard and she should take the tape off but she thinks they are lying to her. &amp;#x200b;she's always convinced that people are lying to her. i travel out of state very frequently for business reasons and often take my mother with me. we try to tell our grandmother about these trips way in advance so she can make accommodations about going to stay with our cousin or at the very least be mentally prepared for our absence. but she always forgets all the times we let her know (and it's usually multiple times, more frequently as it gets closer to the date) until like a couple of days before our departure. then she's convinced that we didn't let her know beforehand or she thinks that we had lied about leaving earlier just to get rid of her. &amp;#x200b;i've read that change in personality might be a symptom of dementia but the thing is that my grandmother has always been a very stubborn and rather self-centered person. she grew up fairly affluent and powerful and still thinks that she has the social privilege from an old world class system. she is neither rich nor powerful now. i'm not sure how much of this is her personality and how much of this is an actual illness. my mother is considering taking her into see a doctor to see if this is really dementia. is there anything we should prepare beforehand? i apologize for the long-winded post. she's been putting a huge strain on my immediate family and i'm not sure what to do at this point anymore. my mother broke down and cried in front of me today after my grandmother insisted on going back to her apartment for the umpteenth time. i'm just really tired and would love any input/guidance you may have to give. &amp;#x200b;", i wonder if she could be helped by a mild anti-anxiety med?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9fp99z/concerned_that_grandmother_has_dementia_but_unsure/,Concerned that grandmother has dementia but unsure?
"this has been going on for a few months now. my mom (turning 65 this year) told me that she's been having concerns about her memory recently, and even set up an appointment with a neurologist to address this. i haven't heard anything about the appointment and her demeanor hasn't changed, so i don't think anything came of it. another doctor suspected her concerns could be due to a b-12 deficiency, and after taking b-12 injections for a while, i thought the issue could be resolved. but then two weeks ago or so she re-expressed these concerns while watching a special about dementia on tv, and my feelings have come back full force. she tells me that she's bothered by how she sometimes can't retrieve the names of things, including people. i asked if it's just normal ""tip of my tongue"" type stuff, and she says it doesn't feel that way. i've noticed that she's been more easily agitated/irritated these last few years as well. multiple times a day, i'll be going about my day and then something, anything, will remind me of dementia and all these depressing thoughts and feelings will just wash over me. i'm only 21, so i feel way too young to be dealing with any of this. i'm hyper-aware of everything my mom says and does, and i know this isn't healthy. any tiny behavior that could indicate some sort of memory or cognitive slip-up gets flagged, despite the fact that myself and other people in my family have similar slip-ups on a regular basis and i don't think they bothered me when coming from my mom in the past. i feel like they might be more frequent now, but i have no way of knowing for sure since i acknowledge that my fear could be distorting the picture significantly. pros for my mom: she's highly educated (phd), works in a demanding and intellectually stimulating (but stressful...) position, she eats plenty of fruits and vegetables and has an overall healthy diet, she enjoys puzzles like sudoku and reads a lot for fun. her side of the family doesn't seem to have a history of alzheimer's or dementia. her father was very sharp when he died and her mom was a little ""eccentric"", but nothing too disabling (she died in her 80's). cons: she has a lot of abdominal fat (type 2 diabetes, ""apple"" body shape), some high inflammation markers that haven't been reigned in, although she claims they don't cause symptoms (autoimmune issues run in my family), her job keeps her fairly sedentary, and she deals with a lot of stress.  i bought the book ""the end of alzheimer's"" by doctor bredesen and have been urging her to read it. she already takes some supplements but i've been working on a list of others i'd like her to take. the only way that i can feel somewhat hopeful and upbeat is by telling myself that even if she's in the very early stages of cognitive decline, all of this could be halted or even reversed. my paternal grandma has dementia and lives nearby, and watching her decline has been so traumatic for everyone. clearly this is where the majority of my fear comes from. her body is fairly resilient, but her mind is gone. i've seen how ugly dementia can be, and her case isn't even as severe as it can get. if either of my parents had to experience that, i don't know how i'd survive it. i already struggle with depression, and this would be the final nail in the coffin. i don't want to just let go and live in the moment. fuck that. i want to feel like there's *something* i can do to prevent my parents from dying in one of the most horrible ways imaginable."," i just feel like commenting to say that i’m 23 and my mom’s dementia symptoms have come on super rapidly/strongly in the past few months, so i really empathize with the feeling of being too young to deal with this... that being said, the fact that your mom is aware of what’s been happening to her memory is good, and if she is understanding of needing to receive more help in the (possibly near) future that should make things easier on everyone. i don’t have much more to say other than just wanting to empathize, acknowledging that this situation is just really fucking tough, and feeling alone at a young age with this is understandable!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9fm7q2/ive_been_losing_sleep_at_night_ever_since_my_mom/,I've been losing sleep at night ever since my mom told me about her memory concerns.

"on the 21st of april this year, my dad was hit by a car. near that time, he also suffered a double brain hemorrhage. afterwards, he has been permanently bedridden, and according to staff refuses to cooperate on physical therapy...we're told that, on top of physical injuries, he's suffering from fairly severe dementia now. however, i feel he has been deteriorating rapidly *after* being admitted, and i feel like something needs to be done to help.but right now, i don't know what i can do.what has stood out to me is that, initially, he seemed receptive to therapy. he had episodes of being, in a word, horrible to those around him, but he seemed to be earnest and stubborn about getting back on his feet.but little by little, he seems to be shrinking. firstly, his weight seems to be dropping like a rock in a bottomless well. it stood out to me most when he was moved to a different department temporarily because of blood test abnormalities, and i spent hours with him.secondly, he used to speak pretty well after he was admitted. his voice was a bit, err, gravel-like, but he spoke up confidently. now, he seems to mumble and whisper.thirdly, while he seemed receptive to training initially, he now seems to want to do nothing but curl up and hide. it's always uncomfortable, it's always painful, and so on.and, once more, i don't know what to do about it. * i'm trying to be there when i can for him, but it doesn't seem to do much. * if i'm in a bad mood i try to avoid being there - i want to infect him with good moods, not bad times, but it's becoming hard. i had him in a wheelchair for the first time recently, and i was trying to not cry the entire time.* i got him a radio, hoping staff would help him listen to music now and then - especially since he seemed to take an interest in having the television on when that was available. help. i don't know what to do. ask away. give suggestions. i'll try to follow here best i can.----before i forget, to summarize his current health:* after a brain hemorrhage in 1999 he had severely reduced function in his left side. these are part of the problems now - he seems to forget that they're there frequently.* after said hemorrhage he also suffered from epilepsy. it would not give him violent seizures, but i think it brings him close to fainting. he becomes horribly lost and confused when it triggers. * his epilepsy is triggered by quickly flashing lights - he can watch tv, but he could never work with cad because of intermittent refresh rates. it is also triggered by noises - noises like refrigerators, ""kid shows"" (esp. loud voices) on tv, stuff like that.* he's always been a scavenger. if there was food in the house, whatever the hell it was, he could devour it without thinking. as a sprinter right up until the last few years, this wasn't even a dent in his weight. in fact, he struggled to keep his weight up.i think that's all for now. thanks for any responses. i'll try to answer questions best i can."," any form of health problem or hospitalization has a strange way of making dementia worse. i saw it in my mom and now my sister. personality changes are the hardest for me, especially if they are angry. :-( i don't know what kind of mental health care you guys have in norway, but take care of your own well-being as well as his. if there is someone for you to talk to or groups of people in the same situation, that can help. as for him...sometimes there is little we can do except make sure they are receiving good care and are in safe place. my sister treats my other sister so horribly and meanly, yet she is nice to me. there is no logic to this disease. i wish you the best of luck and peace at this tough time.

"hello! i wasn't sure if this reddit was the  appropriate place to find others thoughts on the situation, but i  figured it was a start.a few things to start:i cannot convince her to go to a neurologist or talk to her doctor about this.my mother is 66she also had a recent bout with cancer and is now cancer free.my father is across the country and they do not have a talking relationship(divorced for 20 years)i live with my mother, because i had to assist her with the house and other things while she had her cancer.my grandmother had alzheimers.i do not believe she has had neurological exam in probably 20+ years....so, as i said my mother is 66 this year.over  the past 6 years, i've noticed an extreme change in her personality  from a easy going, loving mother to a demanding, disrespectful and  possibly dishonest person.its not as if it was a sudden thing, its something i noticed more and more as the years go on.i've  sat her down and talked to her about the disrespect shes shown me, and i  asked her to be more respectful and she had apologized and said she  would try better, so long as i respected her. but either she has  forgotten our conversation or simply does not care. her attitude to  others but to mostly myself and my fiance has taken a completely  different turn, even though we have done nothing but care for her, and  have done as she has asked of us the past few years.as  for her forgetting things.. obviously forgetting things is something  that just comes with age, but subtle things like her putting away,  clearly very dirty dishes into the cabinets, frequently leaving the gas  stove burner on and walking away, leaving and forgetting food in the  oven that is on, and on a few occasions forgetting some short  conversations.i remember i asked her to  leave the lights on outside for us, as we had gone out for the evening  and she didn't. but when i asked her about why she turned them off, she  seemed to think we hadn't been home all day, and never talked to  her.(this has happened on 2-3 occasions as i remember)..my mother is not proficient with tech, but i have shown her how to upload an attachment to an email many many times.but  she cannot seem to remember me showing her, or cannot remember a single  step of how i did it even though i've walked her slowly through it many  times(she was somewhat good with tech in her past, not great but could  figure out how to do this sort of thing..)she  constantly argues with me, it doesn't matter if i'm right or wrong, or  if shes right or wrong, everything is an argument, and she constantly  raises her voice and yells even if i am just making a suggestion or  offering a solution. this is completely unlike what she used to be.she  also used to be a very clean person, always wanting to keep a clean  house and kitchen.  but lately, within the last year she has just  started leaving her dishes on the counters and leaves garbage on the  floors. this is so unlike my mother because she used to always throw a  fit if the kitchen or house was messy.i  have taken up most of the cleaning. i have asked her if she could start  putting her dishes in the dish washer after she ate, instead of leaving  them out and she was absolutely livid with me for suggesting it. saying  that the dishes were obviously not hers, and that i left them there. (i  did not) i am a very clean person when it comes to kitchens, and i feel  disgusted when i see it dirty.i  could go on about how forgetful i've been noticing her becoming or how  her entire personality seems to be different in one way or another,  obviously the easy answer for this would be for her to talk to her  doctor about this, maybe even a neurologist but she has refused to talk  to a doctor, or mention it to her doctor.my question is:what should i do? i have no idea how to go about this anymore since everything leads to a fight.do  you think i should be concerned about something like alzheimer or  dementia? or does this just sound like age and stress is getting to her?i  love my mother, i do. but over the last year she has been a source of  never ending stress. it always seems like she wants to pick a fight, or  just hates me. its just so unlike how she used to be that has me  worried.i wasn't a perfect child not  even close, but i've not done anything to warrant her being so  confrontational all the time to me. and when i have asked her why, she  just says she doesn't know what i'm talking about and that she isn't  acting confrontational with me.i know  the fighting could end by me simply moving out, but i quit my job to  take care of her and i'm still going to college. my fiance is going to  college and working but we cannot afford an apartment. and i'm not  entirely sure my mother is capable of taking care of the house anymore.  she is not able to lift heavy objects and has become neglectful on  cleaning, and i have taken up cleaning the house as well as a good  portion of the cooking."," did she undergo chemotherapy for her cancer? chemo can cause extreme forgetfulness and confusion. i describe it as feeling like part of your brain was burned away by the toxicity. going through cancer and the treatment does cause some personality changes, it’s just an indescribable thing to go through, even with a good outcome. i would talk to her oncologist with her for an evaluation and depression testing. neurontin and anti depressants can help with the chemo brain.  i’ve never put my cancer experience against my mother’s dementia before. i think i just got a new perspective. both are awful but i would take cancer over dementia.

"the following chart is not specifically for alzheimer's disease but it provides many of the pathways and elements needed to better understand the disease.r/aricept limits neuronal cell death by inhibiting the release of intracellular calcium, but not so effectively that it changes the course of the disease.  namenda inhibits neuronal cell death by inhibiting nmda receptor activation, but not so effectively that it changes the course of the disease.the critical linchpin in the disease is a nitro-oxidant called peroxynitrite (onoo-).  the general damage caused by peroxynitrite in alzheimer's disease includes dna damage, inflammation, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidation, and protein nitration.  the specific damage caused by peroxynitrite in alzheimer's disease includes declining levels of neurotransmitters needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness,  an end to the regeneration of neurons in the hippocampus, lower levels of oxygen and glucose (which can lead to delusions), and the death of neurons.compounds that scavenge peroxynitrite, also partially reverse oxidation and nitration and thus help address many of the specific problems listed above and thus have the potential to partially reverse alzheimer's disease.considering the above, take a look at the effects of panax ginseng on these mechanisms and on alzheimer's disease itself.&amp;#x200b;

# korean red ginseng extract exhibits neuroprotective effects through inhibition of apoptotic cell death.red ginseng has long been used as a traditional medicine in many east asian countries including korea. it is known to exhibit various pharmacological effects, including anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-stress and anti-diabetes activities. to further explore its actions, the present study evaluated effects of korean red ginseng (krg) extract on neuronal injury induced by various types of insults using primary cultured rat cortical cells. krg extract inhibited neuronal damage and generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ros) induced by excitatory amino acids, such as glutamate and n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda), or by aβ(25-35). to elucidate possible mechanism(s) by which krg extract exerts neuroprotective action, its effects on apoptosis and apoptosis-related signaling molecules in neurons were assessed. krg extract markedly increased phosphorylation of bad at ser 112 and inhibited bax expression and caspase 3 activity. it also inhibited dna fragmentation induced by nmda or aβ(25-35). these results indicate that krg extract protects cultured neurons from excitotoxicity and aβ(25-35)-induced toxicity through inhibition of ros generation and apoptotic cell death. in addition, krg extract inhibited β-secretase activity, implying that it may reduce aβ peptide formation. taken together, these findings suggest that krg extract may be beneficial for the prevention and/or treatment of neurodegenerative disorders including alzheimer's disease.&amp;#x200b;

characteristic of dementia for the first 2- 2.5 years. rather, it was just like a switch was flipped, and all of the sudden my very rational, very intelligent, no-nonsense mother became convinced that the government/police was following her wherever she went, investigating her for some sort of fraud that she thought had to do with her not changing the address on her drivers license. there was a week where she was just freaking out, traveling covertly between and hiding out in various relatives' and family friends' homes, ultimately holing up in a remote farmhouse shared by my extended family, all the while talking about escaping the country because she was so scared she was going to be arrested. all of the sudden, every car, every passerby with a cell phone, any stranger who looked in her direction, looked ""suspicious"" to her. she became terrified at the prospect of traveling into cities. my little sister had to lie to her to get her to a downtown chicago hospital. when she was there she acted like she was fine and told the doctors she was feeling much better, but as soon as she left, as i was walking her back to my family's apartment nearby, she went right back to being convinced that everyone was watching her. the next morning around 6am or something, she woke me up because there was a car illegally parked in front of the apartment building. my mom has always been stubborn when she makes up her mind about something, and this translated into her utter, absolutely insistent denial that what she was experiencing wasn't real. my dad and uncle even arranged meetings with lawyers to help calm her fears about her ""legal issue,"" as she described it, but when each assured her that there was nothing for her to worry about from a legal perspective, she'd insist that they weren't specialized enough to adequately address her concerns. for the first 2-ish years, she kept believing that she had this legal issue and that she was under surveillance. she insisted on staying in various rentals in rural areas, and my family had to sell the downtown chicago apartment that she had just finished renovating and had initially taken a lot of pride in, because she refused to return, and the mortgage became too much to balance. during a stay at one rental home in suburban chicago, she was convinced that there was a pattern to the frequency of the cars passing the house. also during the first 2-ish years, she just lived between a series of rental homes, moving to a new one, either outside of chicago or in rural michigan every few months. in general, she completely stopped going outside, except to travel to another rental home. she also refused to drive herself, and insisted on lying down in the back seats of cars when traveling between locations, in fear that she'd be spotted by someone surveilling her and that they'd follow her to the new location. one time, leaving a rental house became an actual covert operation, with my family splitting into two cars that we loaded strategically, while hidden from the street, and after sunset, so anyone surveilling the house wouldn't have been able to see which car my mom got into. after the onset, she completely stopped using email, after years of loving email and using it regularly for business and to stay in touch with friends and family. she stopped using facebook. she stopped using her iphone, and would only use landlines and burner phones. it wasn't until last fall, so october/november 2017, that she actually began showing symptoms of memory loss. before then, even though both her parents had had dementia, and not until their 70s/80s, my family had been desperately holding out hope that it was just some form of psychosis from which she could recover. but finally in january 2018 we received a confident diagnosis that it was early onset dementia. it's fucked up because there are lingering paranoid elements, even as her memory is now declining rapidly. and there's more: from the beginning of this whole horrible mess that's completely changed the course of the life of each of my family members—and derailing any hope of my mom being able to live the life she wanted for herself when she was in her right mind just a few years ago—my mom has repeatedly and adamantly refused to get an mri. so the anti-psychotics she was taking for a long time during all of this most likely exacerbated what is most likely lewy body dementia...but the doctors can't even treat her for that without 100% confirming the diagnosis, which can only be done with an mri. but my mom is too afraid to get one—another figment of lingering paranoia. so her memory is suddenly vanishing and then that's it i guess. the weight of the sadness that comes over me when i think about everything that's happened feels like more than i can bear. any advice to deal with it would be appreciated.

"going through this now with my mother, 86, who has dementia. over 20 years ago, she signed up for a ltc program for herself, that was available thru my employer for extended family members. she has about $115,000 invested into it for home health aids. well, about 6 months ago, my brother and i decided that she finally needed it. brother is living with her and has been doing all of the hands-on care for about 4 years now. it's only the last year or so that she has started her downward descent in dementia.mother was a rn as her career, and she was always a very clean and hygienic person. about 6 months ago, she started deciding that all she needed was a ""sponge bath"" every few days, no shampoo. also, she has become incontinent, both ways, and refuses to wear depends, thinking that she can just wear a panty liner and rinse the panties out in the bathtub. that was the bottom line for my brother, and we decided to bring in a home health aid, as mother adamantly insists that she age in place. she has also become increasingly combative, angry and paranoid, something totally out of character for her.the new caregiver, who comes in twice a week for 4 hours a day, has gotten her to take a bath, thank goodness! brother is still working on getting her to use pee pads on her easy chair, but she is still resistant.putting mother in an alf or other such facility is out of the question, as my brother, sister, and i don't have the financial resources to do that, but mother still frets about this. my aunt (her sister), myself and my sister have all told her that she can move in with any one of us, as we have the room and time, but she refuses to leave her small mobile in the country, a long distance from an airport. she wakes up every morning saying that she wished she hadn't waken up, and also talks about my father, something that she hasn't done since he died in 2009. she says she is depressed.is this the normal progression of this disease? should we put her on antidepressants?thank you to anyone for listening....ps-i took a dna test which shows that i have an increased risk for alzheimer's, something my paternal grandmother had before her death. it is an unpleasant thought, but glad i live where there's pas :-("," my dad was taking what he called ""hospital showers"" where he got a washcloth damp and rubbed his armpits with it and called it good.​he was also having bowel incontinence problems and was using a washcloth with no soap to wipe his butt. then he'd set that on the counter to use again later after rinsing it out. no soap. he'd touch his hands to it, touch the sink, the counter, the door knobs, all without washing his hands. he'd wash the rest of his body with that cloth later that certainly still had poop on it. ugh. it has been a real battle. we wipe all the surfaces down regularly in the house. we've got an in-home aid coming starting next week and we're hoping they can get him cleaner.&#x200b;lack of hygiene is extremely common with dementia. i don't know why, but i've read it over and over again and we're experiencing it. he just doesn't see the problem with spreading poop everywhere. :/",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9alwg8/hygiene_issues/,Hygiene issues

"long-time lurker, first-time poster... the community here seems quite supportive. not sure if i'm looking for advice, or just a space to rant. my dad has dementia (mid- to late-stage) and mom is his primary care-giver. they live in the northeast, my wife and i live in california. they love california and visit as often as they can, at least once per year for the last 15 years. mom wants to come for a 2+ week visit and i need to tell her no. last winter we took a family vacation to upstate ny (including my sister, her kids and husband), which was a long drive for mom and dad, but man, the week was brutal. every day was a balance between keeping the kids entertained and keeping dad distracted enough not to get upset... but he got very upset multiple times per day anyway. mom didn't always let us know of each time. there were multiple bathroom incidents, and multiple instances each day where he'd just break down sobbing, or get mad and storm out of the house, or say he just wanted to go home, or that he wanted to die... brutal stuff.i got a chance to talk to mom during that trip about future travel and i came away from that thinking we were in agreement that she wasn't going to plan more trips with him, given how stressful and disruptive that trip was. but a few weeks later, she was asking when would be a good time for them to come visit? i'm thinking ""she can't be serious!?"", i told her i thought we'd agreed no more trips? she apparently didn't remember the extent of the conversation (wouldn't be the first time) and said she'd only meant no more ""adventure"" trips, like when they did multi-week trips to europe with some friends... which, yeah, ok, i'm on board with that, but why is that so different than coming out here? the last time they visited was pretty bad, and that was 1.5 years ago. he'd just started (according to mom) to have bladder control issues, especially at night, and sure enough there were a couple instances on that trip (made me question just how long that had been going on). bladder and bowel control has only gotten worse since then, so my first concern is just getting here... they won't take a direct flight, so it's likely a 10-12 hour ordeal, it's gotta be insanely stressful for both of them. dad's a big guy, 6'4"" or so, making air travel uncomfortable in the best case. how the hell can anyone assist him in the likely event that he can't use the bathroom during the flight? so not only would they stay with us, she wants to ""get out of our hair"" and visit some other nearby spots (wine country, central coast), but that just makes things more disruptive for him! i work from home as a freelancer and i can't imagine how i'll get anything done with them here for so long. it feels very selfish to think that wayfrom what i can gather from video-calls with them, and the rare occasion mom will talk to me without dad around, he's much worse now, no longer gets the concept of talking on the phone (when i say ""hi dad!"" he just repeats ""hi dad""), gets extremely agitated for really any trip out of the house, even his dementia group which he use to look forward to. anyway she emailed some potential travel dates, and i'm thinking ""what the hell do i do now?"" when this came up a couple months ago, my wife and i agreed it's probably a bad idea, and wouldn't it be better for me to go there? i've got to give her a firm no, though i know she'll be sad and disappointed and may not agree or understand. i've struggled with the guilt of living so far from my parents even before his diagnosis, and it feels like i'm cutting them off somehow, denying them the chance to see our home one more time - and our dog, dad really bonded with him the last time they came which was really awesome to see, but that hardly makes it worth it. i know mom needs some kind of escape too, some kind of break from her routine. me visiting them doesn't check that box, though i'm not really sure how important that is."," my dad is probably as far along in the disease as your is. my mother too, also has dementia. my brother and i (and my daughter and boyfriend) decided to take my parents to dc as a last hurrah family trip. dad complained nearly the whole time (10 hour car trip but that doesn’t include stopping every hour bathroom breaks). it was so rushed and no one had a good time. hindsight we should have never took that trip. i feel for you, this is awful",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/93qkig/no_more_visits/,No more visits

"my father (68) was diagnosed with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia a couple years ago and has been steadily declining since. he is completely unable to communicate with us on any level- either via language or even gestures. about six months ago he stopped washing and changing, which added a whole new layer of difficulty to the situation- you cannot begin to imagine the deeply vile and pungent odours a body which hasn't bathed in six months can produce; that is a build up of poo, pee, sweat, oils, dead skin, etc. it is a very sharp and unpleasant odour which lingers everywhere constantly. he is extremely resilient and shoots down all our efforts to help him. we have tried to bathe him, change his clothes, cut his nails (which are now over four inches), shave his beard (which is maybe a foot long), etc. not only is he so resilient with us-- he's actually better with us--, but with doctors, specialists, paramedics, personal help workers, etc. as well. nobody seems to be able to budge him. today we had a couple of very nice paramedics here who spent over an hour talking to us, but ultimately didn't accomplish anything due to his resilience. they were acp's, with the ability to sedate (which would 100% be necessary to transport him), but because his vitals weren't emergent they suggested we go another route and call back if things got worse. they did say they'd gladly take him to the hospital, but i ultimately decided against it because the full scope of his case hadn't been considered... he's not been out of the house in at least six months and would not cope with the new environment and all the new, constantly changing, faces. i'm seriously concerned he will suffer from an irreversible delirium once he's removed from his familiar surroundings. even if they show him the toilette in the hospital, he still won't register what it is because it's removed from his usual context. they would just pump him full of sedatives all day long to make him into a docile sheep. i'm also concerned the security and/or police, who can't seem to distinguish between someone who's violent and someone who's merely resilient, would manhandle him to the extent where they'd cause him sort of an injury. it's a very very fragile and deeply complex situation. we are in desperate need of some help, but the politics and bs make it impossible for a crisis like this to get any. so who's the help for exactly? he's been in dire need for help for months now, but no doctor is willing to pay a house visit and none of the personal care workers are able to do their jobs and wash, bathe, feed him. we're living in a hell the likes of which i never would of been able to imagine. don't tell me you're sorry and that your heart goes out to me, just tell me what to do. i want to avoid the delirium and do as much as possible at home."," hi, my husband has the same disease ppa, a mix of semantic and aggrammatic. we're at the point where no communication is possible, and he's needing help bathing and normal functions. first,  a psychiatrist is necessary. whatever you need to do at this point to see one is necessary. search around, more and more people are making house calls. i understand this is difficult, whatever you need to do to get him there to get help that you desperately need.  it might help to see the neurologist at the same time. explain your situation. they are usually very understanding. research one that has experience with ftd, it's a rare disease and the better educated they are, then the more understanding.  you can find medicine that will help with the behaviors that will not sedate him or turn him into a zombie. usually antidepressants or anti psychotics. but consult the psychiatrists advice.  it's entirely possible that at this stage several ftd behavioral variant behaviors are being introduced due to it's close relation.  with medication,  they can be more manageable. at that point, in home care can be possible. i completely understand familiar environments which is why i think routine is key. having a very strict routine helps immensely. dictating when to bathe when to sleep when to brush your teeth is very important and easy to follow even for someone who has no initiative.   a social worker will help with resources and programs that are available to you and how to access them, including the best fit for in home care. let me say that i am sorry, and even more so that i cannot begin to understand and that i also worry for my own future. best of luck.

"dear /r/dementiai'm writing as the son of a mother who is suffering from dementia in one of the later stages. i live 3 hours flight away from my parents. my relationship with my parents is not great. they were extremely controlling and clingy when i was younger. moving away was due to my need for some distance and privacy. however, i try to support them where i can, spending 6-8 weeks per year with them at the moment. my mother is suffering from advanced dementia. she has been unable to walk independently for some time, she is unable to solve a simple 2 piece puzzle or to recognize the matching memory cards from 4 cards/2 pairs. she is unable to express needs such as requiring food or water. she is not aware of where she is a lot of the time and has pretty much lost most of her previous interests and distractions. (eg. she used to listen to classical music for hours but now does barely recognize any music and has even less an interest in listening to them. my dad is always the optimist and insists that her condition is better than it is. he will for instance insist that she still always knows where she is or that she still recognizes me, when in fact she stopped recognizing me (as well as him) years ago. but he also a lot more active than my mother and tries to keep up his lifestyle where he regularly travels between two homes and tends to two large gardens. he has hired a part-time carer to support him, but this is mostly to enable him to continue this lifestyle. eg. he takes the carer along to the second home as my mum is nearly unable to travel in a car as opposed to have the carer look after my mum in order to be able to spend a day or so away. the results are that i believe my mother is lacking some of the basic needs of care. i'm hoping to carefully address some of this on my next trip to see them. but as i only see her every two months or so, i'm not really clear what these basic needs are. i have worked on a list which i have added below.i'd be grateful for any feedback on this list, especially omissions and items that i should not concern myself with. i've tried to also list this in my priority order. * medication: my mother needs medication 4 times a day. he is managing this and checking that she takes it. he prioritizes the prescribed medication over supplements that she has always taken. my concern is that some of these supplements (esp. st. john's wort) is known to reduce the effects of other medication and i keep asking him why he still wants to give it. my mother also rarely complains about pain at the moment but is habitually prescribed a painkiller (not a very strong one) and i want to address this with the prescribing doctor. * liquid: my dad regularly checks that my mother is drinking, but he does not record the amounts. as my mother typically uses a straw, a lot of the water is left/discarded when it is refilled. i'm concerned she may not be drinking enough, though she had 16 refills, they were often far more than half full when discarding the previous drink. i'm trying to get him to record it so he can discuss with a doctor if she needs to be put on a drip. * food: it has become very hard to feed my mother. i weighed her intake the last time i was visiting and she had about 80g of bread with ham in the morning as well as 100g of a stew. my parents only eat twice a day now (more about this is the schedule section). i'm trying to convince him to get a microwave as it clearly is too much for him to cook, alongside a delivery service. he tells me he often makes a soup that they have as the main meal for several days in a row. other family members have told me that a meal can be just a piece of cake.* schedule: my dad is usually getting up at around 9 am and prepares the breakfast - which always involves getting fresh breadrolls from the bakery and setting a table with a variety of things, most of which remain untouched. he then gets dressed and then helps my mother to get up. on the days i did not get involved, we never had breakfast before 10:30 am and usually not before 11:30. the `dinner` between 4pm and 7pm and my mother usually goes to bed at 8pm then gets up at 10am, giving here a total of 14 hours in bed. * my dad's schedule: my dad often is most productive after my mother is in bed and regularly does not sleep until 3 am. i've asked him to change this and try to get some sleep a little earlier. * hygiene: my parents have always hated to shower, but used to go swimming. usually in the non-swimming season they would shower once every two weeks and otherwise wash themselves with a small facetowel. i've felt that this is completely inadequate and have urged him to get his shower changed to a wetroom so she can sit and shower regularly but i'm not sure if this is common. * hygiene/clothing: my parents also always had issues with changing clothes regularly. my dad now gives her fresh underwear daily (i used to get scolded as a child for not weearing it 2-3 days), but her other clothes tend to be reused for often 1 week or more. i'm not sure what is common, but the clothes do stink and i felt incredibly uncomfortable around them. i want to prevent this getting to a level where a separation has to be forced, but i'm really looking out for advice how to best change this as well as what changes are the most urgent."," please don't take this the wrong way - but you sound so controlling. you cannot control what your parents are doing from *three hours away* by only coming to visit twice (if that?) a month. it sounds like your father is doing his best. it's a very hard situation to be in.i'm saying this from a similar situation. i have two older brothers. the both moved out, making me primary caregiver. one of them *never* got along with my mother but he always feels some weird responsibility towards her. it comes off as him acting more superior than us.i think there are some things that you should talk to your father about, but there are some things that you just don't have control over unless you are actually in his position. maybe see if there is extra help that can come to the house? see what insurance or local organizations can do to help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/92fvwl/strategies_to_support_the_primary_carer_from_afar/,Strategies to support the primary carer from afar

"i've been dreaming of you a lot lately, mate, and feeling daft that i ever thought you were gone. these visits are all very natural and pleasant, even verging on the mundane. there's no dementia in these dreams or even the sense of its absence. you ask me where the (insert random household item) is? and you're pottering and tinkering, in the moment, but available for a chat. and we do just that, we chat.even on the edge of disappearing you had your positivity and plans packed, continually lookin friday-forward, regardless of diagnosis or facts. fear and bitterness never found a home in you, mate. and i can hear ya say, ""no chance, eh?"" and i'll reply, ""course, mate, fuck that.""i was with you when you left us, so peaceful that i really wasn't even sure... but it's still raw on this side, mate. and i hear this aching chest acceptance is healthy, but i could really do without it, although to be able to fast forward or bypass it would damage me and discredit you, so i'm owning up to and acknowledging the nevers and no mores.paintings left unfinished. christmases to come. the great people and family you'll never meet. the sci-fi n shark films you'll never get to see. the things you'll never witness. the things we just won't do. i'll dearly miss your eyes, affection, good humour n smile... and your voice and stories that should have been recorded.at least there's no shitty, worldly dementia in death. that bitch may have broke your body down but it never broke your enthusiasm, or spirit, or affection for life and family.and for all that's left to come- big, small, sweet, routine, or sad- your absence will be in attendance and noted, but we can pretend a little for the special occasions... ""hey dad, sharp suit, new hat?""mum has told me for decades that she still talks to her dad, so i'll be doin just that, and i guess it's only weird if either of you suddenly start answering back.so i'll try and make good choices, and feel the pride for us and warmth you would have openly displayed......and i'll catch you around in my thoughts and dreams, mate, cause death has no say in that.", your letter made me cry. your father did a wonderful job raising you to become a great human being full of love.  i'm sure my son will miss his father as you do when this awful illness takes him.  keep dreaming! ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/92629u/last_letter_to_dad/,Last Letter to Dad

"hi, so today i got the bad news. mum was showing signs 3 years ago, which progressively got worse, to the point where shes' barely coherent most of the time, even though her memory works seemingly fine for most day-to-day things and she's still got a bit of a sense of humor. she's been diagnosed with alzheimer today. i have no further information (she's abroad). i'm going to do everything in my power to help her but i don't know where to start. i'd like to understand:\- which medications / treatment are widely recognized to 'help', if any ?\- assuming they messed up the diagnostic and missed pick's disease (for some reason she's showing every single sign in the book), and assuming they review the diagnostic, same question as above. \- considering i'm incredibly lucky to be wealthy, money is really not a problem for me. i can buy her any medecine, i can fly her anywhere, i can take her to any doctor.  on that basis , is there anything even rumored to work?thanks for any help. i'm devastated and i love my mum so much."," general word of advice: if anyone starts to show any cognitive decline, get their doctor to start them on a course of aricept+memantine as soon as possible. do not wait till a diagnosis of full dementia of altzheimers is confirmed. a diagnosis of early onset is sufficient to get the insurance to allow these drugs. if sleep apnea is present, you qualify for modafinil, an excellent non-addictive cognitive stimulant. (on a side note, all the drugs i mentioned are used by students to improve their cognitive functioning while studying, and fall under the definition of so-called smart drugs).fight or change doctors if you have to.  i did both 3 years ago, and although i can feel a general cognitive decline, i can still do things like my own taxes, banking, paying bills, driving, volunteering, gardening, etc.i say again - do not wait. at the first sign start taking action. go to nootropics if you are not able to find prescription help. im me if you need specifics.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/91wa04/the_post_i_never_wanted_to_make_mother_diagnosed/,"The post I never wanted to make: mother diagnosed with Alzheimer, what are the most effective treatments (money no object)"
"(also posted this in r/advice)my father-in-law has very advanced parkinson's and lewy body dementia. up to this point my mother-in-law has been caring for him at home, recently with assistance from 24/7 private duty caretakers, but it is getting to the point that it isn't safe for him at home any longer. he experiences severe psychosis, hallucinations, and paranoia. he is still ambulatory, though a major fall risk. he needs assistance with all activities of daily living. he can be very combative, violent, and is a flight risk. i'm trying to get more information about memory care facilities. my mother-in-law seems to think that if my father-in-law were to go to a memory care facility, the facility would still require him to have his own private duty caretaker since he is still ambulatory. does anyone have experience with this? is this true? also, does anyone have any idea about approximate cost? my mother-in-law thinks the monthly cost for the facility would be around $10k/month, plus with a private duty caretaker would be another $15k/month for a total of $25k/month. this seems crazy to me! how could anyone afford memory care with those types of costs?! they are in southern california if that helps and not eligible for medicaid.thank you so much! we are pretty lost here and are desperate for any information/advice."," seconding outreach to alzheimer's association. they make money hooking people up with living/care situations, so they are extremely knowledgeable and motivated. s cal is truly expensive for memory care but not $25k/month expensive. do your mom and dad have money? insurance? the place i checked out in wa for my mother ran about $4500/month, was the nicest place in the area, and she would not need an additional caregiver.

"my father is in his late 70's and is starting to worsen with his dementia. i hate seeing that because my grandmother had it and it just makes me break down every time my mom talks about it. my question is this: i know there has been some research done on the effects of coffee and dementia. my parents have never been coffee drinkers (which is funny, because all 7 of us brothers and sisters are). if we were to introduce coffee into their daily routine, given that he already has signs of worsening and that he's never really drank coffee before, would it necessarily help? and if so, are we talking about black coffee here, or maybe a little half and half?", try red wine ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/91gmu4/coffee_with_my_dad/,Coffee with my Dad

"i'm an only child with 3 children and one on the way. my father passed away many years ago. my mom has 5 siblings, some who can help but all leading their own various lives. my maternal grandmother passed away 3 years ago from complications of dementia/alzheimers. my mother was her primary caregiver. i have noticed a huge change in my mother in the past couple of years, steady but progressively worsening. i didnt think too much into it until about 2 weeks ago when she drove myself and mg kids to a water park 1 mile from her house and then picked us up about 3 hours later. each time she drove erratically when she used to be cautious but the main thing ia that she turned into a one way area in the parking lot and then proceeded to ""get upset"" about oncoming traffic. there was no traffic anywhere so i told her, each time, just to keep going because we weren't in danger but remember it next time. she did not remember and we went to the water park multiple times that week. she doesnt forget as much as i would think but she makes up stories and conversations from her part that she could not remember word for word. i let that slide but she has gotten very very agitated and mean. she thinks my husband is alienating one of my children because he told my youngest son he loved him and not my oldest son (he was in another room), she thinks my 12yo daughter doesn't love her anymore because she cant bring cool free stuff from her job anymore (she retired 6 months ago) which is so far fetched that the mother i knew would never say that!those are just a few examples. i have read that dementia isnt just forgetting but derious personality changes and i honestly dont recognize my mother anymore. her paranioa is a whole level i dont even know what to do with. she refuses to go to the doctor and i dont know what to do but she's pushing everyone away because shes so mean. if she had a diagnosis maybe we could do something and her try and see that not everyone hates her and that she may be misunderstanding. what did you do first? sorry its so long. i am just so confused about what to do."," i’m in the same predicament with my father. i made an appointment to see the neurologist but the day of the appointment he refused to go! how do you force a grown man, who thinks he doesn’t have a problem, to go to the doctor??

"hey guys,thought this might be a good way to release some built up stress/thoughts i've had for a while. my father was diagnosed with early onset ftd in his mid 50s. he was having a hard time at work and eventually got fired. he kept getting new jobs but the same thing would happen where he couldn't keep up with the work so he would get let go. eventually we all figured something was going on, and he went to a neurologist. i was 18 at the time and heading off to college. not too much changed after he was diagnosed, i could tell he was definitely depressed but he rarely let it show. my dad was an extremely likable, funny, and easy going.he was in amazing shape for his age and played tennis almost every day and ate well. he got on disability and would spend the days walking, listening to music, and working in the yard. the progression of the disease seemed to be pretty slow.fast forward almost 10 years, i am now 27 and my dad has been living in a nursing home for around 2 years. his health has declined rapidly in the past year. he doesn't know his relation to me or my mom but i can tell  he recognizes us. he cannot form sentences and needs 24/7 assistance as far as using the restroom, changing, and bathing. over the past 2-3 months he has been getting these recurrent utis that just make his health plummet. i'm not sure the exact diagnoses but he apparently also has some super form of e. coli. like i said i'm not 100% sure. around 3 weeks ago i was talking to my mom asking how he was (i live 2 hours away) and i could tell something wasn't right. she's afraid to tell me when he's not doing well, because i am constantly busy and have been fairly stressed the past year (i want her to tell me these things though). i came home to see him this past saturday and it was drastically different than my last visit. he seems to be on his death bed. he was so out of it and frail looking...they brought hospice into the nursing home to help. he was covered in sores and could barely move. my mom was giving him water with a straw and he barely had enough strength to sip the water threw the straw. i know he is not my dad anymore, but at one point he looked at me and just shrugged and for that moment he looked exactly like himself again. it's so hard to describe but i knew it was him basically saying ""i don't know why this is happening"" and it really messed me up. it's so crazy how fast things can change with this disease. last time i was there he was walking around just like normal. i'm not sure how much longer he'll be around (my uncle said he thinks it could be anywhere from 2 days-1 year) i guess i just felt the need to share this because i don't have too many people to talk to about it. sorry for any typos, i kind of typed this in a frenzy."," just want to say i've been through this with my late father, and i understand how indescribably tough it is. seeing small flashes of lucidity or moments where  'old' dad seemed to shine through were the most heartbreaking part of it all. i'm happy that we were there for dad when he needed us most, when he was at his most vulnerable, because we weren't always as supportive as we could have been. it seems like you're doing far better by your father than we did; being as compassionate as you are takes some strength, and he'd be proud of you :)he's nearly free. i hope you can find solace in that.hope it goes without saying that you can pm if you need. stay strong, i'll really be thinking of you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/917v0p/final_stages/,Final Stages

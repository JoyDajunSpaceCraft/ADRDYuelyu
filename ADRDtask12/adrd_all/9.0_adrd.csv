[removed]," alzheimer’s is a terrible disease. you must remember that they are dying. it is traumatic for them even if they can’t express their feelings. you could help both yourself and your lowd if you would create an evening/bedtime routine. for example, after dinner we would watch something on television then have a snack. i would lower the lights and transition to quiet music while helping my mother get ready for bed. we did the same exact thing every night until she passed in august. since we did the same thing some habitual memory could be used. it helped tremendously. take a deep breath. caregiving is hard. but it  will end. the person you are caring for will be gone someday. you will get your life back.  good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/qod86e/bed/,[deleted by user]

[removed]," that depends on so many things - what level of care do they need? can you provide it long term and still maintain some little semblance of your own life and health? what's your relationship like, and are you (and they) prepared for it to change from parent/ child to patient/caregiver? is your home accessible and secure in the ways they need it to be, or can it be made so? do you live alone, and will they need someone in the house 24/7? if you don't live alone, how will it affect your partner/ kids/ housemates? how good are you at setting boundaries?none of that is to say don't do it, just some things to think through. i know a lot of people say (often with a very holier-than-thou tone) ""i'd never put my lo in a home"" but look around at the assisted living / memory care facilities before you decide what will come closest to meeting their needs. also if you haven't already, do a trial run - have them come stay with you for a few weeks on some pretext of something in their home needing repair or something. you can also look at them living with you as a transition and have a roadmap for where, when, and why they'll move on to the next place.whatever decision you make, know that you're doing the best you can with the information and circumstances you have, don't let anyone second guess it. including yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/qmidye/moving_in_should_your_loved_one_move_in_with_you/,Moving in?

[removed]," this is so difficult, i am so sorry. i'm an art therapist who works with this population and my guess is he does not know how to cope with the loss and changes that are happening and so your mother is an easy, safe target. this being said, your mother does not deserve to be treated like this, of course. do either of them attend local support groups with other caregivers and folks with the diagnosis? that might be especially helpful for your mother. it is not uncommon for folks with alzheimer's or another type of dementia to pick one thing (this happens with terminal illness as well) to be blame and be fixated on. my guess would be that in reality, he does not want a separation from your mother, it is an easy way to lash out and hurt her.   if the therapist is not working out and he is open to switching, i might look for one who specifically works with the population and can meet him where he is, and perhaps take a fresh look at his medications. especially if it seems his symptoms aren't being managed.    how are you taking care of yourself? you also need support through this. this should not continue for the next 5-10 years, it will pass as the disease takes its course, even if it does not feel like it right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/qmi16p/any_advice_for_dealing_with_behaviorpersonality/,Any advice for dealing with behavior/personality changes?

[removed]," there's no way to really cheer you mum up. she's grieving and speaking from personal experience, it's harder than grieving when someone has died because this is a strange, ongoing sort of grief that isn't really recognised by the world outside of those in a dementia bubble. i feel awful whenever i have to visit my mum in her care home. i try to visit weekly but it's really tough and my instincts tell me to protect myself by not visiting, and pretend as if she's gone already because that's how it feels to me. i have to make a real effort to ignore those instincts and i feel awful that that's how i feel about visiting my own mother, but it's the truth. she doesn't recognise me and a lot of the time, she doesn't even recognise that i'm someone that she knows.if i visit at the wrong time for her medication (which is sometimes the only time i can get through depending on my work hours), she can either be asleep or highly anxious and trying to escape, at which point a visit is impossible because she can't process anything that's happening around her.so, no, unfortunately i don't think there's any way you can really cheer your mum up when she's going through all those feelings. what you can do though is be there to support her and allow her to talk about her feelings, and help her realise that there is no shame in anything that she might be feeling, because whatever it is, it is totally valid. it's a horrible, shitty situation and there is no correct way to feel about any of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/qjr3pc/my_grandmother_doesnt_recognize_my_mom_her/,My grandmother doesn’t recognize my mom (her daughter) anymore.

[removed]," we went through a very similar situation with our dad - it’s so painful and you have my empathy.laws & procedures can vary by state, so i don’t know if this will help you, but may be something to check. have you seen your dad’s full will and associated end-of-life legal documents? in our case, he had a specific document concerning guardianship specifying who would serve that role and that it would go into effect when 2 doctors attested that he was no longer capable to represent his own interests. we resisted using it for years, but eventually had to work with his docs to trigger this provision for his safety. it also applied to all business & financial matters. your sibling with medical poa should be able to get the right documents from his medical team if your dad already had this guardianship provision in place.once this provision was triggered, we didn’t even need to go to court. we carried the packet of notarized legal documents plus the 2 notarized doctor attestations to every medical, financial, or legal meeting and were able to act on our dad’s behalf. this allowed us to stop the n person’s access to his accounts, etc., as well as to proceed with arranging additional care, new living arrangements, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/qjdzz9/predatory_marriage_pt_2_red_lines_drawn_and/,Predatory marriage PT 2: Red lines drawn and crossed

[removed]," short answer: no. the disease will progress naturally in its own time. sometimes very quickly, sometimes slowly. forcing her to do things that cause her distress when it’s reasonable for you to do it only hurts her quality of life. this is a common misconception: that doing things for people that they used to do on their own, or that they “should” be able to do, is like aiding and abetting the disease and making it worse. that’s not how it works. alzheimer’s progression can’t be staved off by forcing the patient to do things that are now difficult or cause them anxiety. my advice is to pay attention to what tasks or activities are more difficult or impossible to do without anxiety as the disease progresses and fill in the gaps. unfortunately, eventually there will be more things you’re doing for her than not. that is alzheimer’s. it’s hard enough as it is. a caregivers job is to minimize the suffering and it’s a huge toll. you will probably need help eventually if you don’t already have it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/q7kifv/am_i_potentially_causing_her_alzheimers_to/,Am I potentially causing her Alzheimers to progress by immediately resolving issues that cause her distress?

[removed]," hi! i’m new here but am the primary caregiver for my father who was diagnosed with dementia 9 years ago. i would say do it; sounds (to me) like your grandmother is capable of this, but perhaps not for too much longer, which is the fear you mentioned your grandfather had. what i’ll say as someone who’s been in this for a long time, a bad day is worth it for a lifetime memory. others may disagree, i wouldn’t blame them. my routine for flying with my father (while he still could) is as follows. please keep in mind this was pre covid and the holidays are fast approaching. i pack for him and carry all id’s, tickets, and money etc. i also go over what he wants to wear the day before. obviously i give him a heads up but i try not to build it as something to worry and stress about, ie i try to treat it like one really long trip to the grocery store, far from ideal but doable, especially when i remind him why we need to travel (either for family or his health). i schedule the flight late morning/early afternoon so i have time to get him out of the house showered and fed without stressing him. here again others may disagree; i would fib to my father about the departure time and give myself at least two extra hours. if it’s at two i’m telling him noon. i get there still another two hours early. and again, that’s the extra time i give myself, he often does use it for one reason or another, and if not then it’s been an easy day and you have time to relax. i bought him a bracelet with his medical info and our contact information, i make sure he’s wearing that. i try to stay calm and make it an adventure seeing all the people. i make sure he uses the restroom before boarding. when it’s time to board i use early boarding for people with disabilities. i’ve just found it’s so much easier to get seated and settled without people literally pushing you to go faster. usually the flight itself isn’t too difficult (my father was a frequent flyer when he was healthy), i encourage him to sleep and i bring a pillow for it. deboarding i usually wait until everyone gets off and i work hard not to have connections that could be close and that would cause us to rush. yes, traveling is an all day thing unfortunately, no matter the destination. the bags, taxi, hotel are all usually pretty easy. if he keeps asking where we are i tell he what we’re doing there, and that makes more sense. so instead of we’re at x resort in dallas it’s we’re seeing your sister. the first will confuse him, the second will please and satisfy him. he’ll definitely want to rest as soon as we arrive, and besides a small dinner that’s of course fine. i won’t schedule anything social for that night or even the next morning if possible. if the wedding for example is saturday then thursday is the latest i feel comfortable flying. people are different, their diseases are different, and how they’re effected is different. this was what worked for me after a few really difficult trips. it may not work for you or others. sorry for the length, and my condolences on your grandmother.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/q7debt/hello_first_time_posting_on_this_sub_and_i_was/,Hello!

[removed]," try not to take those phone calls personally. i think about my mom, and what must be going on in her mind- most of it makes no sense because of the disease, but there are times when she’ll thank me repeatedly for taking care of her or apologize over and over- having known her my entire life, it’s out of character, but genuine. before alzheimer’s, she never would have said these things out loud- she would hate to be a burden to anyone, preferred to suffer in silence. now, she’s at a point where she knows her mind isn’t working right, and she knows she needs to be cared for- it’s scary as hell for her, and the way she expresses that fear is by heartfelt thanks and apologies for the people who are watching out for her. i try to put myself in her shoes as often as i can to keep perspective- imagine suddenly realizing multiple times a day that you don’t know where you are, thinking when someone finds you they’ll kick you out- and then realizing that you can’t seem to remember where your actual home is or how to get there- terrifying. even the realization that your mind is failing you when you’re trying to figure these things out, and sometimes can’t even recall the words you want to say- lashing out at anyone you have contact with if this is your world is understandable. that level of fear would make most people say almost anything to get help, but for someone whose mind is clouded, it’s even more forgivable when they add some edge to their comments- trying to make you feel guilty, “you must be having fun out there” etc. as far as dealing with that guilt goes, there’s no perfect solution that i’ve seen. for me, my mom lives upstairs in my place. as soon as i leave her room, even for a literal minute, she’ll start calling my name. frantically, as if there’s something terribly wrong. i used to rush back every single time, and sit with her until she calmed down. the reality is terrible. i couldn’t keep that up, i was losing sleep, waking up multiple times at night to respond, and there was never anything wrong, she just wanted company. so i cut it off. my bedtime is my bedtime now, any time i have to walk away- to do laundry in the basement, run to the store, whatever- i hear her calling as i’m leaving, but here’s what i tell myself.i do everything that i can to take care of her, as her son there’s no one else who would do more. i’ve turned my life upside down to make sure she’s safe, has everything she needs, and is comfortable. for me to give her the best care, i have to take care of myself too- this means getting a good night’s sleep, and doing what i can to minimize my stress. so, since i know that ignoring her calling (which has escalated to my name followed by a heartbreaking “please!) only means she’ll be scared for a while, but still safe- i’ve been able to draw a line there and accept that it is what it is. none of us can cure this. none of us can explain to our loved ones that they need to cut out the guilt tripping. all you can do is your best. for your specific situation, try the same thing- ask yourself, and be reasonable about it- what is the best you can do for this person, and yourself? you can’t reasonably be expected to fill in the role of family member here and take on a huge chunk of the burden, so you have to draw a line and get comfortable with it- face facts, even if you did overextend yourself to be there for this friend when even their siblings won’t, it’s not like your friends condition will improve- and those phone calls won’t stop either, and neither will your feelings of guilt. if you have to, consider ignoring/blocking those calls. check in with your friend on your terms. help out when and if you can, but don’t commit to more than you can handle out of guilt. you can do the right thing for a friend and yourself without getting sucked into a caretaker role that’s not yours.draw a line for yourself, and don’t cross it- make the line fair, and give yourself credit for doing your best here- and remember honestly all the time- nobody’s “best” will ever be enough.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/q5h4i5/dealing_with_guilt/,[deleted by user]

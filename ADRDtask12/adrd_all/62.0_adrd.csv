can assisted living with memory care handle patients with more severe dementia - or is a nursing home usually the ultimate destination? we have elderly relatives with mild dementia currently living in their home. they prefer to remain in their home but i have a feeling they will be better off elsewhere. i'm not sure if the typical assisted living facility with memory care is able to handle more severe dementia...or if al is just a temporary stop before a nursing home.," my mother has alzheimer's and is in an assisted living/memory care facility. the building she is in has higher functioning residents, some of them even have no dementia but are there for health reasons. this is wonderful in terms of stimulation for my mother.the other building has more of the late stage dementia patients. from what i can tell most of them just sleep most of the time, either in wheelchairs or on the sofa in the large living room area.there are a handful of higher functioning people in there, including my father, who seem totally fine with this.my parents will likely be out of money before my mom reaches that stage, but this place has agreed to keep her on medicaid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s706ab/assisted_living_with_memory_care/,Assisted Living With Memory Care
"hi! first time posting. my mother (70 f) has been diagnosed with moderate dementia based on her decline over the last 18 months and her score on the moca test. she declined 20% in the last 18 months. to compound this, my dad (70 m) passed 4 months ago, who was her sole caregiver, though he never saw it that way. he was the person who was with her all day, scheduling her appointments (which she is not capable of doing herself) and making sure she had all of her meds ordered and taken care of. we are looking for a way to tell her how impactful her memory loss is to us, her caregivers (my sister and i, 32 and 30 respectively, and her brother 76) and how we need her to accept some help. she has gotten lost while driving but had gotten better with using her phone’s gps to help her get around. she forgets many scheduled things and repeats similar stories upwards of 5 times in a short time frame. we are in the process of hiring companion care to keep her company and help her around the house a few days a week. along with being frustrated, we know this isn’t her fault but it does impact our lives by worrying about her daily. any suggestions for gently bringing up and reiterating how impactful this is for her family and how we can work together to make this journey a little easier for all of us?  thanks for your help!"," what's your objective?  to get her to worry about her impact on others?stress is not good, for anyone with mild cognitive impairment, as they have little enough cognitive reserve to have such an added distraction.  that she can learn a new process (use of her phone's gps) is good news.do you have time to invest in helping her eat more healthy?  i think much dementia is influenced by years and decades of poor dietary practices.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s6zjsn/moms_impactful_memory_loss/,Mom’s impactful memory loss.

"this illness is so sad. i've (f39) just recently had to put my mum (74) into care. we lost my dad (72) back in february and didn't know mum had dementia. apparently, she was diagnosed back in 2018, but he kept her secret for her and took on her care. i've worked really hard to have a really fulfilling relationship with them both over the past 20 years. i grew up with their alcoholism and it really effected me, but i sought help and it changed my life and let me find acceptance for their drinking. when dad passed our relationship was wonderful and my heart was broken. my mum had lost her rock and the love of her life. the shock of realising my mum wasn't just drunk, but in fact had dementia as well was like a second blow. it was clear they had been struggling. i tried to take on the things my dad had been doing, brought in cares, set up a new poa and had my two brothers help with looking after her at night. she's prone to infection and sure enough this led to a bad fall even in strong antibiotics. after that i realised i couldn't keep her safe. the three of us were working during the day, had cameras installed, neighbors keeping and eye out, but she was still drinking, wandering and landed in the hospital. she always said she never wanted to got into a care home, but i really didn't have another choice. the decision was excruciating, but there was no way she would have made it to christmas. i found her a beautiful care home after months of hell., hospital, intermediate care and assessments. today i went to see her and she was looking amazing. she's out on weight, doesn't drink and was having a very low day. telling me she couldn't stay there and she wanted to come live with me. i live in a top floor flat and she would never make it up the stairs, but on top of that she would still be at home all day herself and we would be back to square one. it's so hard to not just bin my life and commit to looking after her. it's what my dad would have done. but i feel like it still wouldn't be enough. having to tell her that i can't take her home is heartbreaking. the codependent in me wants to scoop her up and take her with me, but in my head i know it's not the answer. some days this illness is just shit."," this reminds me of my struggle with my mother. my grandmother and i had discovered after her wericke's diagnosis that she would still go down to the liquor store and get wine. she would order it through apps on her phone, too. even after recovering from an acute stage where she couldn't even recognize the rooms in her own home.i struggle with the idea of bringing my mother home from assisted living as well. it's better for her. she doesn't get drunk all day. she's eating properly and putting on good weight.  this reminds me of my struggle with my mother. my grandmother and i had discovered after her wernicke's diagnosis that she would still go down to the liquor store and get wine. she would order it through apps on her phone, too. even after recovering from an acute stage where she couldn't even recognize the rooms in her own home.we can only do all we can. we can't give up our own quality of life in the process. and it was the most loving thing you could do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s5knob/dilemma_of_dementia/,Dilemma of dementia

(we always referred to it as memory loss, not alzheimer's.)many months later, she called and told me she had seen a neurologist (!!!). i asked her what he said. she told me the neuro said it was dementia. she was very matter-of-fact about it, but she was probably just covering up her real feelings.so at least we finally knew what we were dealing with, so we could start doing research and making plans.and no, it's not fair. the best you can do is try to get her diagnosed so she can be treated. and keep her safe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s4ldm7/my_mom_is_only_56_and_has_dementia/,My mom is only 56 and has dementia

"i should mention it isn't the dementia part that pisses me off. it's honestly heartbreaking to see her decline in every way each time i see her and i hate it so much. but the thing is is that she is very demanding of my mom and aunt and never appreciates the love and care they give to her when they bend over backwards to satisfy her every want and whim she has.she was incredibly abusive to my mom and aunts as kids. she would beat them and emotionally abuse then as kids. it wasn't until now that i truly understood what they had to go through as kids and it fucking angers me how they don't see that and turn back into kids whenever she wants something.i was abused by my mom and i resent her for it but seeing how my grandma treats her i can understand why she treated me the way she did. maybe it's because i'm aware of how this isn't ok behavior but whenever she comes around i have to hold my tongue till she leaves.i hate seeing my mom like this. i hate seeing the strong woman who holds her own against the world try to appease a woman who will never be satisfied with anything. she nevers says please or thank you. she just demands demands demands and we have to give it to her or she complains the rest of the visit.i know she has dementia, i know her mind is leaving her every day and i shouldn't complain and i should give her some leeway because of it but i can't help but feel like this is unacceptable. i just feel so protective of my mom. i want to tell my grandma to just shut up and enjoy the meal my mom made her or the desert she brought over. my mom does everything for her but there is always something new to complain about after it.am i a bad person for feeling this way? i just don't want to see her anymore because i can't stand seeing my mom like this. i don't want to remember my grandma as this demanding selfish person who can't compromise on anything unless it's done her way. i just can't do this anymore.it's my birthday today and i was told i have to wait until tomorrow to celebrate because of my grandma and i just want to tell my mom that i don't want her to come because she will make my birthday about her in the end. like i said i know she has dementia so she can't help the way she acts but i still can't help but feel like this is unacceptable and should be delt with.this whole situation fucking sucks and i feel like i can't express how i feel without being told i'm a horrible person. i'm just tired man really really tired"," i work with people who have dementia and my mom has dementia. so i can tell you that you have to consider that your grandma is not the same person you used to know. it can help to try to think of her almost as a person with brain damage. if you look back on some of the things that happened and frustrated you, you can see the dementia and the person. also, she likely experienced a good deal of abuse too, making her the mother that she was/is.all of that said, i get so angry and impatient and offended by the things that my mom does or does not do. some days i just want to scream (at her, at myself, at my family members interacting with her).so...you're not alone. everyone will have their relationship with her that has its own dynamics and life. you can't control her or the relationships with others. you can control how you support your family and what your relationship will be.  do what you can, when you can. and remember that sometimes you'll do everyone and yourself a favor by rolling with it. easier said than done...i know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s3z7qh/my_grandma_has_dementia_and_its_pissing_me_off/,[deleted by user]

"it never get easier to deal with someone who has dementia. whether it's your loved one, a close friend, or your job it's never easy. a little back story: i use to work in a memory care unit for 10+ years. i love it. we were short staff or had crappy staff who wouldnt show up for the shift. so i would stay late or go in early. my normal shift was 9 hours long. i remember i went in 4 hours early to help out, worked my shift and then was asked to stay late. i had 20 hours in one day. i didnt mind one bit! i love my job. everything about it but the toileting and death. yes i was there alot when they were on the last moments. i was the one who was med trained to give low doses of morphine if it was needed. i quit once my grandma (nan) was diagnosed with it. ever person i cared for i saw my nan and would break down crying.last night my father called (nan is his mom) and told me she is in the hospital right now because she had a heart attack and now the drs suspect a blood clot somewhere in the chest. she is fighting nurses and drs. pulling put ivs monitors etc. she is scared and doesn't understand. my 2 a i aunts ate there and my dad show be shortly.  my nan is 2 hours away and i can't get there because of a winter storm. (ice snow and wind) i cry all night. didn't sleep hardly at all because nan was on my mind. she needs me!!! she needs someone who can comfort her distract her from that chaos around her. some one to be in her world and feel what she feels.  and i can't get to her. it's killing me. end of my venting session. thank you for reading. i just want my nan.", i’m so sorry you are going through this right now. 😢,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s3sxy3/my_nan_has_dementia_really_bad_had_a_heart_attack/,"My nan has dementia really bad, had a heart attack and is being aggressive to hospital staff."
"my dad was diagnosed with dementia 2-3 years ago and in those two years he has just gone down hill. he struggles to walk,  messes food when he eats, has problems with his bowels and incontinence. he is also extremely stubborn and refuses anything to make life easy for us. e.g wearing nappies...walking properly with his walker( he does not walk properly with it and just gets angry when we tell him he is walking wrong) refuses to admit he can see perfectly with his one eye..he has problems with his right eye and the doctor says he can see perfectly with his left eye...but he wont wear an eye patch to help him see better. he never listens and falls constantly he knows he cannot walk properly.  he never listens to us. gets freaked out about the smallest things..keeps my mom awake at night because he struggles to roll and light a joint and he smokes many..he nearly lost it when his weed ran out. he is not senile...he is fully aware of who we are, who he is there is nothing wrong with his mind he just has trouble finding words sometimes and acts like he has no strength but when he is angry he can hurt us and grab our arms. he laughs when he falls and we get upset and shocked about it....he thinks its so funny."," that was a beautiful response by korora705, so simple and true and heartbreaking, there ya go.i'm past your point op, but not by much.  my dad was forced into a home by the hospital so it made it a bit easier, but it's never easy.  i'm mostly to the point of acceptance now.i'm so sorry.  i don't have any really good advice, just sympathy.  you're not alone.  i would tell my mother over and over that if dad won't use the walker and falls, he falls.  he's not a small child that can managed, she cannot be held responsible for his actions.  there's spousal guilt that gets involved i think and mothering guilt too when the role of wife is switched to caregiver.i hope things get better.  you're not alone, sending you some internet hugs and love.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s3rkqy/me_and_mom_are_tired_of_my_dads_crap/,Me and mom are tired of my dads crap.

"i care for my grandmother 3 nights /4 days a week. she lives next door. she has a day time caretaker the rest of the time and stays with my uncle those nights.  sometimes she seems the same she's been from 80 to 90. other times , we deal with the classic things. she's very proud and stubborn and has been always so she covers the extent of it well. anyway , when i moved back here she had gotten really codependent on my uncle and he has ways he likes to do things. the family drama over her care was endless and i got my head bit off more times than i can count. i'm dealing with a severe pain condition so i'd retreat back home and let it be.4 months ago i had a spine stimulator put in. she took a fall the next day and was in rehab for months after a tbi . it's kind of a miracle it reabsorbed.we brought her home after with the caveat of she isn't going to be alone at all now so that's when i started staying. it can be hard to be the granddaughter doing it but my uncle lets me do things without micromanaging now. she has her good days and bad days and i'm not sure if the sullen withdrawn moments or the manic typical nana moments where she belittles me out of the blue are harder. i've tried avoiding known triggers and set up things accordingly. it's hard when it's her house - a point of pride. anyway - today i'm off and her caretaker texts saying the heat is stuck . i go check it out.  the ac is on 70 and the heat is on 75. she had pushed a bunch of buttons and locked it out. it wasn't until recently that i was trusted my uncle to even deal with it bc he's had to have the guy out a lot and doesn't believe that i know how to work w dual thermostat 😂 exhausting. anyway. the damage was done when i got there. i pulled the panel and the battery but it's wired with no way to disconnect. i checked the breakers but they aren't labeled. that would cause chaos. so now he's going to come lecture her or me and any time i breathe near the thermostat she's going to lose it. she fixates that it has to be on 75 and punched the wall. i've come in there plenty of the times where they were on the same temp. ironically, it was 71 and she's been hot plenty .she sleeps better at 70 . tldr-  anyone know if they make like a fake panel magnet to go over the screen that reflects a different temp than it is . the thermostat arguments usually happen in the morning when my pain is super high and i'd like to just avoid the my house 75 argument  all together."," \-(greatly reducing the impact of repeat occurences):  labelling the circuit breakers seems useful -- at least, pinning down which one runs the thermostat ( eg. pick a quiet time to shut them all off for a few minutes to see which one wakes up the thermostat and then red flag that one)\-perhaps tape over the thermostat temperature display?  good sleep's important, a lower temperature does help with better sleep",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s2hamg/thermostat_and_any_other_helpful_tips_appreciated/,Thermostat and any other helpful tips appreciated

"i just found this sub.  a backstory (sorry so long, but i intend to be posting a lot on here).  we were a happy family of 5.  three years ago, the head of my family, my brilliant older sister passed away at 48 from breast cancer.  my dad didn't go to the funeral, she lived out in cupertino (we live down south) and he can't leave the house, let alone fly.  he had no memory of her by the time she passed anyway.  we just found out my 40 year old younger sister in pennsylvania has stage 4 pancreatic cancer.  my dad has no memory of her either.  my family is falling apart.  my mom is his caregiver, they've lived in the same house for their entire lives and he will die here, no plans to move him anywhere.  he weighs about 75 pounds, but he still eats meals and can use the bathroom,  and he can walk very very slowly in a shuffling manner.  but he is rapidly declining.   my mom left last week to go up north helping my sis through her 4th chemo round.   i am taking care of my dad here by myself, i packed a bag and just moved in as soon as my mom left (he can't be left alone).  i live an hour away and by some miracle,  he definitely knows who i am and always tells me how much he loves me and loves my cooking when he sees me, so that is a relief.  he knows who my mom is.  he asks me 20 times a day where my mom is.  i just say out of town.  i lie to him about everything, i don't want to confuse him.  he wanders around when it gets dark and i just lead him back up to bed.  no major drama at all.well a few evenings ago (before he started sundowning this night), it finally happened.  he fell walking to the bathroom.  hard.  on his arm.  he lost control of his bowels, and started vomiting, unable to move but conscious.  i immediately called 911 and explained the situation.  i got my dad dressed on the floor and calmly explained to him an ambulance was coming but there is nothing to worry about.  i remained calm and told him i would be there the entire time holding his hand.  i showed him old photos of us together and he was smiling.   the paramedics showed up and i pretended to my dad that he was going on a fun excursion on a stretcher and he was totally at ease, everything was going smoothly.  until it wasn't.  they said i couldn't ride in the ambulance or even follow them to the hospital because i wasn't vaccinated.  they said stay home and wait for the nurse to call when he got into a room.  i understand, even though i had my mask on.2 hours hours later, the nurse calls to inform me he is in a room and she is about to give him the covid vaccine while he's waiting for the doctor to examine him.  what.  the.  fuck.  he hasn't left the house in 4 years, he weighs 70 pounds and was brought in on a 911.  i told her absolutely fucking not.  and if i find out they gave it to him, we were going to have a big problem.  he would never survive the side effects.  his blood doesn't even clot.  an hour goes by and the doctor calls.  said he didn't have a concussion but fractured his arm, which the doc bandaged up.  they said he's ready to go home and is being discharged.  it was 10pm.  i asked where do i park and, which room he was in.  they said pull up to hospital entrance and he is sitting outside in a wheelchair waiting for me to pick him up.  it was a 45 minute drive.  he sat out there alone at 11pm strapped down to a wheelchair in the freezing cold with nothing but a small blanket.  he was terrified and belligerent and said his arm hurt really bad.    i pulled up, got out of my car and banged on the door of the waiting room.  i demanded to see this doctor.   this douche doctor comes out with his discharge folder.  i said why is he alone in the parking lot, and where is the prescription for pain meds for his arm.  doctor says they ""do not give out prescriptions for opiates due to the potential for addiction.""  holy fucking shit.  i said ""he's 83 and has no memory of how he even got here.  give him some damn pain relief!""  dr. just said no and didn't even help me load my dad into my car.  is it normal to throw a dementia patient out of the hospital, alone, in the cold, strapped down to a wheelchair late at night, while sundowning, without so much as an advil?!!  they literally kicked him out of the hospital, alone at night in the cold.   he had soiled himself again when i found him.  he was terrified.  i cleaned him up when we got home.is this about the fucking vaccine or do hospitals just not give two shits about the elderly?  everything is fine now, he has no memory of it, but his arm is purple, he keeps asking what happened to his arm.  i've just been giving him advil with his breakfast and dinner.  he says he's not in pain so i stopped giving him the medicine."," best of luck op with your dad.  for your own peace of mind, please disable replies to this thread and do not come back here. unfortunately the topic of covid and vaccines are is split into two camps right now the right side or the other, its incredibly divisive and politicians, and bad actors are stoking the flames whipping the risk averse into a frenzy.  here's what the leader of my country said this week about the unvaccinated  [“they don’t believe in science/progress and are very often misogynistic and racist. it’s a very small group of people, but that doesn’t shy away from the fact that they take up some space. “this leads us, as a leader and as a country, to make a choice: do we tolerate these people?

hi! my mom has fairly severe memory loss and “possibly” very early stage alzheimer’s. she’s still fairly functional but is definitely stumped by some unfamiliar/non routine tasks. recently she’s been talking about how blue the daytime sky is - she brings it up frequently (as if it’s the first time she’s mentioned it) and the sky looks pretty much the same to me. she’s also fixated on the street lights as they are very orange (as opposed to white). is this shift in her perception of color common?," this is interesting, my mum said to me look what’s that green bird in the garden…. it was a uk robin so brown and fawn with a red chest. it was in shadows but definitely not greeni also suspect there’s something else with the colours as she thought she had no toilet roll. it was in the holder white against white tiles",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s1p7v6/color_perceptions/,Color perceptions?

"i’m 52 and suspect i have dementia, had this gut feeling for the past 4 years. these last few days have been awful with my family telling me ‘you told us hat 5 minutes ago’ but no recollection of doing so. going to get bread out of freezer but must have already been and done that, i could go on! i’ve plucked the courage to book a gp appointment for next tuesday to discuss it. i’m scared, i knew my chances of it is high, my mum and uncle had it, but they were in their 70’s, i’ve got hearing loss and never have slept an whole night in my life, 4/5 hrs on average. i don’t want to live through dementia, i have fibromyalgia, prolapses that i have to deal with on a daily basis but i can’t deal with my mind going, i’d rather end my life.   we put our dog to sleep so he doesn’t suffer so why can’t we have the right to die.sorry not sure what i’m asking, or wanting but maybe it’s just a rant to say dementia is a cruel disease"," sorry to read of your troubling situation. my wife at age 60 is going through the same thing… speaking from my perspective as her husband and partner, i have changed my thinking to look at myself as a support person and future caregiver. it’s only been 3 months since this came up as a likely diagnosis of ftd after a ct scan, and the first weeks were non-stop anxiety as i tried to get my head around what was happening, and then i came to terms with the reality that this was not an immediate death sentence and that we would have many more years together, albeit with a shifting balance in our relationship. make sure you are completely open with your gp. start writing out what you feel has changed with you; e.g. personality changes, loss of math ability, and difficulty with langauge and memory. ask for a full blood panel for the obvious things that might cause symptoms, and also a cat scan for any brain abnormalities (my wife has some left temporal lobe atrophy). best wishes to you as you come to terms with what is likely happening. i hope you have a good appointment and some conclusive testing from that, and i hope your husband will be able to adapt and be your loving partner and support going forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s1guwz/feeling_lost/,Feeling Lost

"i and my family think my mum (72) has some serious mental health issues, we think dementia is likely. she is a lovely caring person; the sort of person you'd bring a friend home to and she would fuss over them and make sure everything is perfect.in the last 2 years or so, she has changed, becoming fixated on odd topics (she watches hours of news everyday), become more moody and also very bitter. in the last week, she has been adamant it is the 28th of december, even tho my dad showed her a calender and tried to explain what day it was. she has had two arguements with people who were walking there dogs on the street past her house etc. it is so out of character. the problem is that she refuses to get help. my dad has asked her multiple times. i've mentioned it (in the guise of treating covid induced anxiety) and she told me my dad didn't want her seeing anyone. i’ve noticed these changes in the past couple of years, but it has swiftly accelerated in the past few months.i guess my question is, what is the best way forward? how do we get her help? i have not yet sat her down for a ""serious"" conversation as my concern itwill antaganoise her. any suggestions are much appreciated."," unfortunately for me and my mom (67), i raised concerns about her health and tried to urge  her to see a doctor for about 4 years. we had to schedule an appointment behind her back because she was losing so much weight, and so we used that as the focal point of the appointment instead of it being about her memory. it was a whole ordeal, giving the doctor warning about the situation, informing him on her refusal to seek care in the past, all this stuff we did behind the scenes, and we basically had to wait until we had an good opportunity to get her the care she needs. i don't know if this would have worked if she was more lucid, but the decline in the past 3 months has been more drastic than before so we had to work with that. they always say its better to get checked out sooner than later, but sometimes that's not always possible. keep advocating - if she gets upset by the proposition, looking back it was better for me not to agitate it. look for an opening and run with it if you can. the most you can do is speak up, you can't force anyone to receive care as much as we know they need it. in all my years of advocating, i know i did the best i could with the circumstances i was given.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s18lom/how_do_i_help_my_mum_who_i_believe_has_dementia/,How do I help my mum who I believe has dementia (but refuses to acknowledge any issues)

"so my father-in-law had a heart valve replaced about 4 years ago, then another heart procedure a year later. his mental acuity has been declining ever since. when his cardiovascular docs are asked about this, they essentially say he's lucky to be alive and it is what it is.without going into exhaustive detail, he's having a hard-time with short-term memory and generally how things work, where things are, what he walked into a room for, etc etc. but the main source of stress for him and his caregiver (his wife, my mother-in-law) is his daily insistence that he has to go to some kind of important event.the details are always a bit vague. it used to be a wedding. he would wake up every day thinking there was a wedding to go to. mil would tell him there was no wedding and he would accept it and move on with the day. sometimes he was more skeptical of there being no wedding, but it was more or less manageable.lately it has progressed to more difficult scenarios. last month it was a fight of some type involving men on horses, and he needed to go intervene. lately it's been an important presentation he needs to make, but he can't come up with the location or topic. the long and short of it is that he's having extreme anxiety about the need to physically go somewhere and do something that doesn't exist.his anxiety and insistence about these imaginary problems has been getting worse over the past month or so. he is able-bodied, meaning it may get to the point that he needs to be physically stopped from leaving the house. mil is at a loss about what to do, and i'm looking for any ideas. it's getting to the point that it's an all-day every day issue where he's constantly on the verge of a panic attack, which also has implications for stress on his heart.i suppose they could seek some kind of anxiety medication? playing along seems out of the question, as he has no concrete details on where these important events are taking place. so he can either be anxious and frustrated at home, or anxious and frustrated in the car or at some random location where these imaginary events are supposed to take place.what can they do? are there techniques for handling these kinds of delusions, either medicinal or otherwise? looking for something that can ease the burden on mil as well as stress for fil."," for my sister who had alzheimer’s, she would get upset if i disagreed with her. when she believed she had to go to work, i told her she was on vacation. when she wanted to go home, sometimes i’d get her in the car and drive around the block. by the time we got back, she’d forgotten all about her former home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s0pglf/fatherinlaw_has_daily_delusions_of_need_to_go_to/,"Father-in-law has daily delusions of need to go to a vague appointment, presentation, meeting.

"can anyone review my theoretical framework on psychological control and the causal factors behind a family of diseases including alzheimer's disease and other dementias, stroke, depression, and norepinephrine deficiency (aka dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency).these new theories support matsuyama's 1989 theory, that spoke of a relation between microtubule collapse and dementia.my thesis in brief: psychological functions are carried out by neurocircuits containing myriads of dopaminergic and norepic systems; due to excessive electrical signalling in ""dopamine-heavy"" types of brains -- the over-stressed signal conducting micro-tubules break down, which is the neuronal collapse. more the average signalling volume (due to more deployment of the evolutionarily backward dopaminic and lesser of the evolutionarily advanced norepic behavioral circuit elements), more the stress (either mechanical and/or thermal and/or chemical stress), which proves fatal in the end.the link to download my thesis:", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4vgsu8/neuroscience_theories_from_a_physicistengineers/,neuroscience theories from a physicist/engineer's perspective

"mom,i may never really know how tough the past few weeks have been for you, or even the past few years, because i can imagine that you've personally noted symptoms for some amount of time already.i've cried a lot recently. i've lived in this vacuum of political activism for the past year, and years even earlier, and i've become very emotionally tied in because i care about this nation, i care for people around the globe, and i understand the opportunity and privileges that you and dad and friends and family all around have given me. i prefer to not over indulge myself with personal recreation and self centered-ness all the time.the recent developments and what appears to be the end of a revolution are now dead for all intents and purposes. that one politician is a liar and a power and money addict who will say anything and do anything to serve herself. i'm holding out just 1% hope for a change of her heart.but even in that contextual loss, which has felt almost at hard as the last time that i ran competitively in a track and field meet, i struggle to express my heart aching to the new world where you, and dad, chris and beth, and jen live,  where we are as a family. its a new emotional challenge in life that no one can practice for, there is only reality when it comes.i know that you are still extremely clear minded and ready for decades ahead, your ability to keep the house together so beautifully, keep the job responsibilities at wally world for as long as you did, to deal with the gravity of your recent breast operation and treatment, and to deal with the every accelerating change of family and work between chris, beth, dad, myself and jen, and also the challenges that you've seen your sisters live through, between john's passing, kathy's stroke, and all of the irregularities that come later in life.its all an incredible swirl, and it creates stress and frustration. and this is why all people in their age should be given a retirement and given the freedoms and comforts of community and spiritual calm.this is your era for indulgence and an era for expression. drop the f bomb, make the lower joke than usual, have that wine or some gummies, and keep in mind that you're still the exact sally america that god intended for you to be.the feats of consistency, discipline, courage, and inspiration that author the story of your life can only be punctuated with a wildcard! you and dad beat me to the grand canyon! there are still dozens of great american geographical and cultural treasures out there which neither you and dad, or jen and i, or chris and beth have visited. i can promise you, and you know it in your heart and from experience, there will never be a day that passes where you and dad look back and regret going for a traveling vacation.jen and i depart for another road-trip about vermont tonight, under much needed circumstances. i am really struggling with my career yet again. freedom even if for only two weeks provides enough of a breath to fall back under water, but in the world of cubicles i'm not sure if i'll ever find land or a floating object to prevent from drowning. i cry in happiness to see where you and dad have been able to travel in the past couple years. its dad's moment to retire soon, and ensure that the two of you are fully released to enjoy yourselves.physically and mentally you are just beginning to feel a new perspective, an emancipation, where you go with the next 5 years, and then 10 years, will only be guided by your imagination, and maybe the house cats (if they have any say in it, bruce, jenny, ally, and rip altogether!).you deserve everything around you, every emotion and idea thats contained within you, and everything that lies ahead. let your imagination get creative, and keep chris and i on the hook for assignments because we owe you the world still. you gave chris and i each the childhoods of the american dream. comfort, fun, adventure, discipline, friendships, community, diversity, and most importantly love.you and dad take care while jen and i vacation, enjoy the soylent and gummies, and keep your thoughts creative, your trust steadfast, your faith focused, and your heart as warm as it always has been.no matter where your mind takes you, i'll always know your heartlove always,  your oldest, and wildest, son", very sweet. i hope you actually send this to her!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4v8s2o/not_the_sub_i_planned_to_join_this_week_mom_was/,"Not the sub I planned to join this week :( Mom was diagnosed recently, I wrote her an email"

"i hope this is the correct sub-reddit to post in, i am looking for some guidance on helping my best friend, her family, and myself.  a little backstory without getting into too much detail - my best friend's mother was diagnosed 3-4 years ago.  2 years ago, i moved to live with my best friend (we are both mid 20's) and to start working as a nanny for her sister.  when i was a nanny, i spent a lot of her mom and family.  all four of the siblings know me very well and often confide in me when there are hard days.. i am still working for the family - now as a legal assistant for both the daughter and husband of the woman diagnosed.  basically, i see them a lot, they all trust me a lot. i started dating someone seriously about a year ago and it just crushed my best friend - she started to see less of me, she became very sad, and i ended up moving in with someone else.  we have been much more civil to each other since moving out and are both happy we did it - and see each other almost every day still.  but i am worried - really worried - her depression hasn't improved since seeing a therapist and starting medication. we have one other friend that i know she confides in but it's mostly me.  when she doesn't want to wake up in the morning because she's so sad about her mom she tells me. when she is screaming through the pain we can talk about it.  but i'm not sure i am helping.  this family means so much to be and everyone else.  they truly are my second family and i am seeking some advice on how to be a helpful friend, a positive voice, and looking for ideas on how to make this easier for the family.  activities, words of wisdom, advice, anything would be helpful.  thank you for taking the time to read this.  what a horrible fucking disease to happen to anyone."," first as someone with a loved one that has ad, let me say thank you for being a friend to the family. this is a problem (like so many with ad) without a single solution. being there for your friend as a shoulder to cry on may be the best thing you can do. perhaps you can make an effort to do things with your friend away from home to distract? or simply take your friends mother someplace calm and enjoyable once in a while to give your friend a break at home. i take my partner to a koi pond at a nearby resort and feed the fish as a distraction on his good days. he enjoys it but it's also calming. i have found that music has stayed with my partner even when other things have gone so perhaps just sing a common song and if she responds try it again when your friend is within hearing, i find it a way to reach my partner even when he is unreachable. this is a terrible disease and the best thing you can do is be there and do your best to make sure the memories left with the family are good ones. i have a friend who schedules one afternoon a month to come over. she brings popcorn and spends 3 hours watching what ever my partner picks on netflix with him. they enjoy it, he gets time with others, i get 3 hours to myself. she says such a short amount of time once a month doesn't really impact her life, but boy does it impact mine! that 3 hours is magical!!!! it's coming up and i splurged and set up a massage. there will be time after and i may go for a quiet meal! i'm sorry this is happening to your loved ones, simply knowing you care will be a big comfort.

"about five years ago, the va diagnosed my dad (who is now 71) with alzheimer’s. it's gotten progressively worse, and he gets extremely angry and frustrated. in addition, he gets easily confused and has severe mobility issues.my dad currently lives with my sister (23) in rural new york. the situation is not ideal for him or her, and they're both under the poverty line. i (26) currently live halfway across the country. if i stretch my budget to the extreme, i can afford to send him about $500 a month barring any major expenses or emergencies. my dad is not willing to come live with my husband and i, because we live in a large city that he's never been to and he has panic attacks while traveling. obviously, the situation is not ideal, and we're looking into memory care units - but unfortunately, they're prohibitively expensive. like, an average of $6,500 per month expensive in his area (which is double what i make). has anyone had any experiences with paying for memory care? if it helps, my dad is a vietnam-era veteran, has medicare and social security, and my mom is deceased (so my dad is unmarried). he currently has no assets to speak of (no house, no bank acct, no car). my dad is also legally blind in one eye, and is considered partially disabled from his time in the military. i looked into va aid and attendance, but it appears that he would only qualify for up to $1,788 per month, which would be way under the cost for care. thank you for any advice. i'm extremely worried about my dad right now, so if any of this is disjointed or additional information is needed, please let me know.x-posted to personal finance"," since your dad is a vet, please look for a state veteran's home. in my state, it is a lot cheaper than private care. this is different than the aid and attendance benefit. i am unsure whether a&a can be applied toward the cost of a veteran's home, but if so then you may find the majority is covered.my father in law is in a vh close to where we live. it's about 1/3 the cost of where he was before. he does have some assets and a decent retirement income so i think he's paying the maximum amount. my understanding is that the cost is prorated based on need, so it can be a very good deal. it also seems to be a more suitable environment for my fil. before, he was in a place where it was mostly women so most of the activities were female-friendly (he only has so much interest in chick flicks) and he thus spent most of his time in his room. now at least he spends more time out with the other residents, and participates in some of the activities. not to make it sound like there are a lot of exciting things all the time, but some of the activities they've done in the past are fishing, cook-outs, bowling, and a ball game so what there is seems to be more guy-friendly.the veteran's homes, cost, and eligibility vary from state to state. we also had about a 6-month wait for the memory care unit.also, if you haven't done so already please contact a veteran's service officer ( and don't try to navigate benefits alone. the vso's we've encountered seem dedicated to making sure veterans are getting every single they deserve. since your dad is vietnam-era, some diseases like diabetes may entitle him to benefits so if he has other health issues please do investigate since that can help with finances quite a bit. my own father was a vietnam vet and due to possible exposure to agent orange ( he was granted benefits because of his type 2 diabetes. he was very surprised that this was mentioned to him, as it never would have crossed his mind.and finally, i agree with /u/no_on_in_particle about the alzheimer's association. they are a wealth of information for all kinds of facets of dealing with this awful disease.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4ugi0w/affording_memory_care/,Affording memory care?

"hi all, this is all very new to me and i'm not sure where to go for advice so i was hoping someone might be able to help. my stepdad is in a memory care unit in fl, usa. this unit has an outdoor area which he has access to with 8 ft tall brick walls. he is fairly young (60) and has always worked out and been in great shape, so he is able to jump the wall fairly easily.it's gotten to the point where he's jumped the fence multiple times per week, so the facility has notified us that we need to either transfer him to a different location or pay for someone to monitor him 24 hours per day. they are telling us that the cost for 24 hour monitoring is $12,000/month.i have a few questions: 1. that seems like an excessively high price? 2. i thought by definition a memory care unit was designed to prevent these sorts of escapes? 3. can anyone suggest any care options? i'm going to be moving home to help take care of him but i honestly don't really know where to start. i've thought about bringing him home and putting locks on the doors but that seems like putting him in jail. we also worry about trying different memory care units because not all facilities are reputable, whereas we know that this place isn't neglecting him or stealing from him."," yes, that is a ridiculous price. you could hire a companion(s) privately through care.com, and it still wouldn't add up to nearly that much. for frame of reference, we pay $1100 weekly for 24/6 care, in-home.  $12,000/month is an exorbitant fee and beyond ridiculous. for $12k monthly, you could bring him home and hire two live-in aides. yes, memory care is designed to keep patients safe, but nothing is fool proof. most people with dementia aren't able to scale a 8 foot wall. my question is why this area isn't supervised. it's great that the patients have access to it, but why is there no staff member close at hand to divert these escape attempts? what is the facility doing to keep him entertained? what are they doing to distract him, when he tries to escape? does he express a particular reason for wanting to leave, such as needing to work or take care of the kids? white lies may divert his attention.that fee honestly makes me think that perhaps they're trying to dissuade you from keeping him there. perhaps they can't handle his level of activity. if you bring him home, think very very very carefully about that. changes in environment are a big deal, and moving to a somewhat similar memory care unit may be an easier transition than moving back home (and potentially back into a nh if it doesn't work out). deadbolts and alarm systems are not a bad thing at home. they are the only way to keep a wanderer safe. it may seem like jail, but the potential for injury and getting lost is too high. there are ways to install the locks so that they don't really notice. keep in mind that unless you have a large house, you won't be able to let him outside independently- even a fenced yard is not enough, if he's climbing 8 foot walls. he will need constant supervision. if i were you, i'd hire a companion for his waking hours (i assume he doesn't have access to this courtyard at night), and see if this helps and if you can troubleshoot to stop the escape attempts. if it continues, i'd move him to a more secure unit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4stw0y/advice_needed_alz_patient_breaking_out_of_memory/,"Advice Needed, Alz Patient Breaking Out of Memory Care Unit"

"my mom and i have always been very close.  after she was diagnosed with early-onset alzheimer's i moved in with her.  i worked full-time and had a caregiver come stay with her during the day while i was at work.  after a couple years of that it became too difficult and i moved her into an adult family home.  she is now at the point where the afh is not able to give her the level of care needed and has asked me to move her to a memory care facility/nursing home because they can't deal with it anymore.my choice now is to quit my job to take care of her full-time or move her into a nursing home.  with what little brain function she has left, all she wants is for me to be with her.  i am the only one that gives her any measure of comfort.  she asks for me constantly throughout the day, and i'm the only one that she will not fight when showering her, changing her clothes, etc.without kids or a significant other, quitting my job is a viable option, except that i am in my mid-30s and doing this would prevent me from having any sort of life for the next couple of years and would likely hurt me professionally.my question to anyone who has been through anything similar is, how did you make this decision?  i feel like i would be a horrible human being for not doing everything i can to make her last year or two as comfortable and good as possible.  putting her in a nursing home feels like the opposite of that.  i'm also concerned that if i private pay the rest of her money away, they will then kick her out citing behavioral issues and i will be forced to quit my job to take care of her with no cash reserves left.  i've heard from multiple people that this practice happens a lot in my state (wa).sorry for the novel.  i am just wondering if anyone has been in the same position and what your thoughts are.", i agree with the other comments on placing her in a memory care unit. you need to care for yourself too.it's a terrible disease and demands 24/7 attention from the caregiver which isn't possible for one person.  my suggestion is to find a memory care facility with separate units for early and late stage alzheimer's.my mom was kicked out of a few places for behavioral issues and treated badly by other residents who didn't have similar memory or behavioral issues.  i found a memory care facility with separate early and late stage units.i questioned myself for placing my mom in a memory care unit.  there were times i wasn't happy with their care but i knew i couldn't do any better.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4rdvyo/looking_for_thoughts_on_putting_parent_in_memory/,Looking for thoughts on putting parent in memory care/nursing home vs. taking care of them

"so my dad was diagnosed around 2009 at age 72, he just had his 79th birthday and his symptoms have become exponentially worse. i live on my own on the other side of the state (california) so i can only be there so often to give my mom a break. while his symptoms already had included getting lost while walking the dog, not remembering family members, wandering off, lashing out and accusing my mom of stealing from him, the last few weeks have been tough. my parents were renting a house and their landlord decided to sell it and gave them 30 days to leave. they live in a small town where other rentals are in high demand, and my mom has not been able to find a house in time, so they're now in a hotel that my sister and i are paying for. this is really hard on my dad, he is confused and thinks my mom is doing this because she hates him, etc, etc. so my mom and sister have been watching him pretty much all day/night.so today i get a text from my mom that while she was in the shower, dad decided to leave. she called 911 and they found him a few streets over at a cvs, saying he was trying to go back to la to get a job. he was apparently very angry and uncooperative with police and they took him to the hospital. the hospital, along with my dad's primary doctor both said that his symptoms are basically not extreme enough, and they can't help. to go along with the doctor thing, my parents have no health care other than medicare. my mom has tried several times to go through medicaid (medi-cal?) and they get the response that their out of pocket max per month is $1800, which is about all they make each month. on top of that my mom can't work because she can't leave my dad at home alone anymore. so no real insurance, no doctors helping, nursing homes costing double what my parents make, and everyone basically telling my mom she is shit out of luck, she's at a total loss. sorry for the wall of text, but has anyone had a similar situation? can anyone offer advice/tips?"," unsure if you've got a bit of money to spare, but an lawyer specializing in elder care to guide us through the process and let us know available options was a really great thing for us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4qp3bh/care_options_for_lower_income_families/,Care options for lower income families?

"while not receiving much attention, this recent finding may be the key to understanding alzheimer's disease and to its effective treatment.""malinow’s team found that when mice are missing the pkc alpha gene, neurons functioned normally, even when amyloid beta was present. then, when they restored pkc alpha, amyloid beta once again impaired neuronal function. in other words, amyloid beta doesn’t inhibit brain function unless pkc alpha is active.""the pathway activated by pkc alpha leads to the production of peroxynitrite--the key oxidant in alzheimer's disease and caspase-3--the so called death enzyme.  this dovetails well with this much older study:a natural scavenger of peroxynitrites, rosmarinic acid, protects against impairment of memory induced by abeta(25-35).through oxidation and nitration, peroxynitrite inhibits the transport of choline, inactivates the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, and limits the release of acetylcholine from muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.  as a result, short-term memories cannot be retrievednow if amyloid oligomers were the only cause of oxidative stress removing the oligomers or using nearly any antioxidant would work.  but there are dozens of triggers for protein kinase c leading up to alzheimer's disease: they include an unhealthy diet (too much sugar, carbohydrates, and salt, for instance), moderate to heavy smoking, environmental toxins, psychological stress, and various genes.  this in part explain why so many treatments seem to work in mice designed to develop amyloid and not in human beings with the actual disease.  at this point, the only substances which can partially reverse alzheimer's disease are single-compound peroxynitrite scavengers that can easily enter the hippocampus (such as the terpene eugenol via aromatherapy) or substances containing multiple compounds that scavenge peroxynitrites such as ferulic acid, syringic acid, maltol, p-coumaric acid, and vanillin in heat processed ginseng and cannabidiol and terpenes (and thc if needed) in medicinal marijuana."," alpha lipoic acid also potently scavenges peroxynitrites:not sure whether they used the (r)-enantiomer (r-ala, the biologically active form) or a racemic mix of ala. i would recommend r-ala over the racemic version as it is speculated the s-enantiomer (left-handed version) may block the r version.anecdotally i cannot tolerate the racemic version for more than a few days due to side effects of falling asleep (hypoglycemia?) and pyrosis (heartburn). r-ala does not have these side affects but did make me feel pretty miserable for the first week i took it, although i was taking a much higher dosage.n-acetyl cysteine (nac) should also be beneficial since it ramps up endogenous production of glutathione.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4m4fpq/the_pathway_to_alzheimers_disease/,The pathway to Alzheimer's disease

"it's become increasingly apparent that my mother is exhibiting signs of dementia. some background: 63yo, married to my father since 1972, had a previous marriage and a child she put up for adoption around 1970. her parents died at 68 (father) and 62 (mother) supposedly of heart disease, but it's unknown is this is true.she's exhibited bizarre behavior since i was in high school (10+ years ago) but it has ramped up extremely in the last few years. she's always been extremely paranoid - she used to read my emails and listen into my phone calls when i was in high school because she was so paranoid that i was ""against her"". (i was a pretty model child - nhs, band, quiz bowl captain, worked 20+ hours/week, etc).i remember in high school that she had so many medications. xanax, trazodone, risperdone, paxil, elavil... it just seemed like a lot. after i started working in pharmacy i realized that she was pretty snowed with meds. she's always been a little peculiar - my brother in law describes it as making up stories in her head and then completely, 100% believing them. one example i can remember is her completely believing my nephew's birthday party was in their neighboring town, only to arrive at their empty house because they were in our town, and had even sent us invitations describing such.i left for college and moved 3+ hours away. just before graduation, my parents informed me that mom had breast cancer. stage 1, grade 4. she had a lumpectomy, several rounds of chemo, and 6 weeks of radiation. she remained her peculiar self, but nothing alarming. she suffered neuropathy in her feet and through the years has fallen frequently.the past year has been... different. i guess the most alarming situations have been away from home, involved in the planning of my wedding. every time i've met my parents (i live in the capital of our state, they live 2+ hours away, pretty rural), my mother has been completely thrown. she doesn't know where she is (adamant that i live on the same street as my sister, 45 minutes away), that my wedding date was on the 17th (it was the 14th, we actually had a small argument because she couldn't accept that she didn't know my wedding date), etc.the night before my wedding was a nightmare. the rehearsal was at the church at 4:30, and i asked my parents to be at my house at 3 as i had tons of stuff to do. at 1:30 my mom called from her cell phone (more on that later) saying they were minutes away from my house and... she forgot pants, other than the jeans she was wearing. could i take her shopping? she was very angry that i simply didn't have time to take her to the mall and that i suggested she borrow a pair of my pants, a size larger, same inseam. she was mortified that she was wearing a size 10 instead of a size 8. this consumed her focus for the rest of the night. she kept obviously hiking them up, ""holding"" them up (even though with a shirt over them it couldn't be noticed), anything to draw attention the fact that they were too big.she kept arguing that she and dad could find the church just fine. i asked her for directions. she gave me interstate exits and streets that don't exist. dad tried to calm her down and assure her that going with us was the best plan of action.we arrived at the church, and upon exiting the car, she lost control of her bowels. i had no idea that she needed to use the restroom, or i'd have had her go before we left. she didn't indicate anything to anybody except my father and me. luckily the church was unlocked and she was able to go in and clean herself up.leaving the church, i noticed her walking out with my sister's purse. i asked her where hers was, and she said she didn't bring it. we got about 7 miles away, nearly to our restaurant for our rehearsal dinner, when she announced that she'd left her purse at the church. it was rush hour traffic at this time and my husband, a very patient person, nearly lost it. i called the contact person of the church who happened to be locking up, asked him to search for it, and he didn't find it. she then claimed that she didn't bring it. i knew she was lying and trying to save face, seeing how upset my husband was.the next morning, she was supposed to arrive at my house for hair at 7:45. at 8, i tried to call her cell. at this moment, i knew she had left her purse at the church the night before, and had a sneaking suspicion that she'd hidden it in the church basement. it turns out i was right. she turns off her phone when she's not using it, defeating the purpose of having a cell phone to begin with. she also had not informed dad that she was paying for makeup - so i had to take my already very angry father to the atm to withdraw cash that he didn't know he needed to replace. it was then that he admitted that mom has been ""slipping mentally"", and that he didn't know what to do.long story short, we made it through the wedding. the other day, however, i found out that the morning after the wedding, at 6am, my father awoke in the hotel room and couldn't find mom. he searched every floor of the hotel (thinking she forgot the room number), only to be alerted by my sister's kids that she was sitting in their car, in the parking lot, in her pajamas. it's unknown how long she was out there, because she denies it happened.in the past week she's told us that she fell the night of the wedding and broke her nose. she has no bruising, no black eyes, no clearly bent nose, etc. we think she's using the ""fall"" to excuse her grandchildren finding her in her car at 6am in her pajamas in an unfamiliar parking lot. she's also claimed that she has a ""brain bleed""... but she's at home. we know it's bs. she also had no idea i was turning 30 this week. i confronted my father about it this weekend and he laughed it off (his coping mechanism). he thinks it's nothing and doesn't see the dangerous implications (what happens when she goes out to the car, starts it, and leaves the garage door down?), etc. in conclusion, my sister and i feel that we've exhausted options - dad laughs it off, our aunt makes excuses for her, and we know that she will get mad as hell if we imply anything wrong. is it ethically/morally wrong for us to contact her physician directly and describe what's happening? i know he can't tell us anything about her care, but are we right in at least informing him of what she'll never tell him herself? is this really normal behavior for a 63 year old? are we overreacting?please help. :( i'm sorry this is so long, but it really helps to vent."," i'm so sorry you and your family are going through this. dementia can be terrible to live through and to care for. the changes you mentioned can be caused by many different things including medications. this sounds to me like the time to get her general practitioner involved.  let the gp know what's going on and the denial that accompanies it. my so has ad and i waited to step in and wish i had not.  eventually i contacted his gp and told him what was going on. we set up an appointment and i put it on the calendar as any other appointment. the gp played it off as a general checkup and asked to call me in from the waiting room when my so failed a memory test. he had me record the second memory test he gave using my phone. this helped later when my so wanted to cancel the subsequent neurology appointment as it was ""unnecessary"".  hearing it from the doctor made it much easier to accept. stay strong, respect her feelings and fears, and get any family support system going. reach out anytime.

[deleted]," hi there. first and foremost, take a deep breath and go someplace quiet and relaxing for a few minutes each day.  allow yourself to make mistakes. there is no rule book for life, you are doing the best you can.   my so has alzheimer's disease.  it's not easy and the dynamic is different than a parent and child. i have no idea if your dh has early onset ad and no one here can tell you if he does, but it sounds like it might be time to get a doctor involved. these symptoms can be caused by almost anything (stress, medication, dehydration testosterone level changes etc) so a doctor visit is key.   my so was adamant there was nothing wrong. anytime i brought up the subject he got angry or shut down. i called his gp and asked for a call back. i explained the situation and set up an appointment.  i did this without my so's knowledge. i may have taken the low road, but i don't regret it. i put the appointment on the calendar as i would with all doctor appointments. he just assumed it was s follow up. i was in the waiting room when the doctor sent for me. he told me (in front of so) that as part of a routine physical he provided a memory test and my so failed. he then asked me to record a second memory test using my phone. the simple test used three random words that were told to my so and then the doctor would distract my so by asking a few questions like what did you do yesterday etc. then ask my so to repeat the words. it's not too difficult but my so only remembered one word. we left with a referral to a neurologist and my so didn't respond badly when being told this was a problem by someone other than me. that video came in handy two weeks later when my so no longer remembered the doctor appointment, test, or agreeing to see the neurologist.  once again, this is our story, you dh may not have ad. don't worry about making too many far reaching plans yet, take it one day at a time.   if i was having the specific argument you laid out with my so, i would buy another toothbrush. someone on this sub put it better than i ever could when they said to live with a person who has ad you have to live in their world. they aren't able to make it to yours. i find the easiest way with repetitive arguments is to avoid when you can and forget changing them, change the environment, or the item, or the way i approach things.    the one thing i would do before visiting the doctor (if i could turn back time) is get long term care insurance. making sure the policy covers home care and assisted living. i hope that all of this helps in some way.  remember to take **some** time for yourself every day. i mean every day. it can be done, you just have to make a firm line and not cross it. this is vital to dealing with stressful lives like you have described. reach out any time with a pm even if it's just to vent.

"i'm a social work major and i volunteer most days at a nursing home across the street from my house. recently i was assigned almost full time to a woman who has severe alzheimers/dementia. the nursing home isn't a very nice place, and they don't have many activities there to begin with (let alone for someone as anxious and restless as she is.) she also gets very anxious around lots of people (although not with me), and around most of the home's staff. because of this, i was told that she doesn't like to participate in any of the home's activities (bingo, card games, bible study, etc.) plus i believe that even if she wanted to engage, she simply wouldn't be able to. on my first day with her i suggested we color together, but she became very overwhelmed with the task of having to choose a color of crayon and admitted that she didn't think she could. she really, really likes animals and flowers (she told me that when she had a house gardening was her favorite thing.) when it's nice out we go outside and look at the same 20 plants over and over (which she loves), but when the weather isn't conducive, we're trapped inside with nothing to do. i usually try to engage her in conversation, showing her her own photo albums and asking her to tell me stories about the people in the pictures. but i would really love to think of some new things for us to do together that we can do in the confines of the nursing home. bearing in mind that she loves animals (real and stuffed:d) and plants, what would be something fun and non anxiety inducing for her to enjoy with me?"," first off, thank you. i always want to be with my grandma but for the time when i can't be, it's so comforting to know there are a few people out there who show love to them when we can't be there. but to your question, my grandma enjoys magazines, even if they aren't something she is too interested in. she can't really read anymore, but looking at the pictures and flipping through the pages seems to soothe her. also it's a very casual activity and so it doesn't feel like work to her like coloring occasionally can (sometimes she thinks it's a form to complete or something, and can get easily exhausted). i think that a photo book or documentary of different plants and animals would be fantastic like other people have suggested. if she likes dogs or cats, the show too cute! is a good one as it has soothing music and narration and very adorable animals and doesn't require any following of a plot. perhaps tending to even fake flowers could calm her? i know my grandma likes talking about her beautiful window garden, and even though the flowers aren't real it doesn't seem to bother her. thank you for your work, and i hope you both can have a wonderful time together!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4g1crb/just_made_a_new_friend_with_alzheimers_looking/,"Just made a new friend with Alzheimers, looking for suggestions for fun things to do together"

"alzheimer's disease is the result of oxidative stress exceeding the level of antioxidants in the brain--especially rising levels of peroxynitrite and declining levels of glutathione.  peroxynitrite (and to a lesser degree hydrogen peroxide) cause the formation of amyloid oligomers, plaques, and nitrated and permanently phosphorylated tau tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) not the other way around.  as long as oxidants are being scavenged, a person can have amyloid oligomers, plaques, and tangles in their brain and not have alzheimer's disease.neither plaques nor tangles change acetylcholine levels although they may affect neurotransmissions.  through oxidation and nitration, however, the transport of choline, its conversion to acetlycholine, and its release from muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are all reduced.  the ability of people with alzheimer's disease to retrieve various forms of memory is thus severely inhibited.to date no clinical trial focused on removing amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles has succeeded. several trials using particularly effective antioxidants have succeeded. as some examples: if the current approach to alzheimer's disease continues there will be no effective treatments for the disease.  rather than lowering bars and changing endpoints, one needs to change the approach to the disease to be successful."," you used the quote as if i had said to try to disparage me.  you keep trying to focus everything on me as if i am crank, crackpot, a scourge on the entire alzheimer's community.  the fact is quite the opposite.  it is not my crackpot hypothesis it is the hypothesis of some very reputable and highly intelligent scientists.  i don't sell anything and i don't make a guinea pig out of anyone.  i present the clinical trials and the case studies for people to read and to use that information as they wish.  i point out all side effects that i know of (certain essential oils high in eugenol can increases anxiety in some people with dementia, for instance).  your personal attacks are unwarranted and show an insecurity that the traditional understanding of alzheimer's disease may be wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4cqaqb/alzheimers_is_a_disease_of_oxidation_and/,Alzheimer's is a disease of oxidation and nitration not plaques and tangles

"mom (69) has end-stages alzheimer's. i'm basically a walking mess, hard to focus, hard to think, hard to not cry - literally.i'm just, i guess i just want to help make her comfortable, well, my dad is going crazy, has went crazy. his behavior is outside of reason at this point. i'm trying to encourage the family to afford more grace than we normally would, like to start manufacturing grace on an epic level - because we need it.anyone out there lost a loved one to this horrible disease that has family? my mom is young, us kids are grief-stricken, and dad has left the reservation, meanwhile - i'm trying to maintain the peace, well, because i love my mom - and she's not eating anymore, so it's just a matter of time, so i'm told....i'm just, well, i'm lost here. i've, we've, read about this disease, we've researched the crap out of it, and it didn't soften any of the blows along the way - each progression has been a shot to the gut. i can't even walk in the room and not cry at this point - seeing my mom like this is torture, i said selfishly. i'm trying to maintain for my dad, and my sisters, and my nephews and son, but as the days progress my resolve diminishes... i'm hoping that someone out there has some experience that they can share to help me navigate these treacherous waters, i feel like i'm swimming with alligators, and it is just a matter of time..."," my heart truly goes out to you and your dad. my mom is 86 and at this point she seems to vacillate between end stage 5 and beginning stage 6. four years ago, when she was finally diagnosed with alz., from time to time she would say, ""i wish i would just fall asleep and never wake up."" mom had 2 sisters that passed with alz. so she knew what was to come. she is confused much of the time now and her speech is not good, but i know she still feels the same way. i also know when the end comes, my mom, like your mom now, will have no concept of what's happening. at this point, her suffering will have already ended. yes, when my mom passes, i'm sure it will hurt a great deal, but at the same time i believe i will feel a great deal of relief that she finally got her wish and is suffering no more.god bless. one day, in the not to distant future, you and your dad will only remember the good times.

"my grandpa usually sleeps around 5pm. tonight he woke up at 8:15pm and asked me if i had dinner. we never asks me this so it's odd. i was assuming maybe he never fell asleep was just rolling around in his bed.30 minutes later, he walked back out again to the living room (where i was) to ask me if i want milk. there is milk in the fridge. i told him no it's ok, i am drinking water. he never asks me this (even when it is in the day-time). he is around 86 years old and has a nursing aid with him from 10-6pm. he usually stays in his bedroom since he can't walk well (only baby steps). so i was wondering if he had a dream about me when i was little and drinking milk or if he was sleeping walking? or maybe in his mind, he thinks i am a little girl/teen and was wondering if i had dinner yet or want milk. not sure. thoughts anyone?"," im a phd student studying alzheimer's disease. alzheimers usually comes on slowly over time, people will begin becoming more and more forgetful. something as overt as this could be early signs of the disease, but it could also be a stroke or something else. i dont mean to alarm you, i know nothing of your grandfathers current or past health. but if i were you id take him to see a medical professional as soon as you can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/4ba8w7/does_my_grandpa_have_dementia_or_alzheimers_whats/,Does my grandpa have Dementia or Alzheimers? what's the difference really?

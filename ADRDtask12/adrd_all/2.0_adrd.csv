[removed]," can be huge variety in timing - even within just alzheimers-type of dementia.  many factors: type of alz, how long the person has been living with symptoms before diagnosis, ""cognitive cushion"", other medical factors, etc.  within my personal sphere of over 200 friends with dementia, one of the biggest factors was sense of remaining purpose .  ""stages"" are usually all over the book, so generally not very helpful.personally, i have more than 20yrs since lost job and driver's license due to cognitive decline (41yrs old).  both grandmothers had 30-year journey with it.you might find vids at top and bottom of this page helpful >> ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/vbufc7/diagnosed_today/,Diagnosed Today

[removed]," my grandmother was the opposite. three of her siblings had ad, so i think she slightly expected it. early on, she would accept that she had it, but would call it her memory issues. she would make jokes about it too, like ""oh, did i ask you that already? i swear, i'm losing my mind a little more every day."" when it was getting bad, she would use humor to hide that she forgot certain things, like what year it was, or how old my brother was.it was when the she got worse, within the last couple years of her life, that she went into straight-up denial about having any problems. i think it really started when her doctor said she couldn't drive anymore (don't even get me started on grandma's vendetta against her doctor. she couldn't remember to take her pills, but she hated that doctor until her last lucid day).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/vbexul/have_you_been_able_to_discuss_the_diagnosis_with/,Have you been able to discuss the diagnosis with the AD-having person in your life?

[removed]," it’s such a strange feeling isn’t it? i don’t know about you but i feel like i’m bracing myself for the unknown. only now, six months after my dad’s diagnosis am i starting to feel less kind of ‘frozen’ about the situation. we’re now starting to tackle more practical elements regarding him stopping driving (he barely drove anyway, but is reluctant to be told he can’t) and applying for an attendance allowance and i suppose the next step will have to be sorting the power of attorney but the sense of dread around getting him to agree to that is so overwhelming, given he is not accepting of his diagnosis. i currently live and work around 200 miles away (and have done since i was 18, i’m 38 now) and stay with them a week every month (not necessary in terms of practical care right now but it’s more to support my mum in navigating some behavioural changes and give her a break from “keeping and eye” on him so she can get out and about) but i am single and do not have children so although i understand i will almost certainly need to move closer at some point as my sister is in australia (i think she’s struggling with this the most as she feels unable to offer practical help), i don’t know when that will be. i appreciate that i am lucky as my mother is healthy and able bodied (she is 6 years younger) but i know to keep her healthy and able to cope, helping out a for a week every month might not be enough, sooner than we’d all like.do you mind me asking how your family found the diagnosis process and interaction with the memory clinic? my dad had been in hospital with covid in sept 2021 for 10 days (first interaction with the nhs in 50+ years, excluding his vaccinations) and they did a brain scan then, due to delirium bought about by covid. the memory clinic used those scans, coupled with the assessment done at a home visit with the community psychiatric nurse to make the mild/moderate alz diagnosis in december. i’ll be honest, the best resource i have found so far in terms of initial guidance and support has been this subreddit. keep asking questions, keep sharing experiences, it honestly helps so much and the people here are incredible, so many people take the time to offer advice, share links.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/uv9bfm/uk_dementia_diagnosis_where_to_start_for_guidance/,UK Dementia Diagnosis - Where to start for guidance?
[removed]," i agree with you that the trailer isn't the right track for her.  your description matches the symptoms of the third stage in this model of alzheimer's (i'm not saying she has the disease, just that the description fits)  [  if she does have alzheimer's, the trailer wouldn't be a good fit for long because she will need more and more help and supervision, eventually 24/7.  you asked two great questions: ""how do you prepare for a further deteriorating mind? how do you prepare for her behavior to accelerate?""  i also suggest you or your parents call medicare with her and get on her account as someone authorized to talk with them.  same with social security and then her other sources of income. she will have to verify her identity, so it's best to do that now while she is able to read her address and give information to help the process.   she would benefit from a living will if she doesn't already have one, and also she needs to sign a durable power of attorney document so that your family can help her manage finances in the future.  both of those documents are available for a small fee on the internet if she can't afford an attorney. she should see a doctor because they would run blood tests to rule out certain treatable causes, such as a thyroid level that's way off or another disease, syphilis for example, that is treatable in the early stages.  they would probably label her condition ""dementia"" and eventually be more specific as time goes on and they have more insight into her progression. consider looking into the different causes of dementia.  if she won't see a doctor in person, try to make an appointment with an online doctor through an app such as zocdoc. you can even make an appointment with a neurologist on the app.   you can call your county's office on aging (or a similar name) and ask for ""options counseling"" for the situation. they will talk to you about your options. if she's not going to be living with your parents, she will probably need assisted living in the near future.  you could help by educating yourself on what kinds of assisted living arrangements are available.  one starting point is to see what shows up on google maps: [google.com/maps/search/assisted+living/](  you can call a few places and tell them you would like to know more about what they offer. to help her mind, you can call, visit, or send cards.  cards are great because she will reread them.  sorry this is happening. your family is lucky to have you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/uumu02/looking_for_some_insight_on_my_grandmother/,Looking for some insight on my Grandmother

"hello out there. i am a caregiver for my so's grandmother. a few years ago i noticed things started to seem off. i told her doctor and my in laws but everyone dismissed it. i kept trying to tell her doctor but he wont listen. i think he is a total quack anyway for other reasons which makes it that much harder.anyway my husband and i have been up all night taking turns watching her because recently, she claims people are in her bedroom and at her windows. she also gets lost in the grocery store which she has been shopping at since we met (13+ years.) i have told her doctor's office. they dont seem to care and won't help.i'm employed through ca ihss (in home support) and planned on leaving anyway. i love this lady but i'm tired of struggling financially due to slightly over min wage pay with no benefits or options to promote. i have my own immediate family to think of too.to top it off, my in laws had her cosign on a house! i have some moral objections here and am curious about laws on that.we talked about death with dignity but her doctor said he wouldnt help (fine) and concinved her not to include it in her advanced directive. sad because she often tells me she wants to die.i dont know what to do. i'm concerned i cant provide care but also concerned her doctor sees her as a cash cow and my in laws just want her for a house. i just want her to be happy and comfortable. i dont know how to see a memory specialist or get anything started by myself.please help. what do i do? how do i get started?"," very sweet of you to be looking out for your so’s grandmother. i agree with telling the doctor what you’re seeing as you have already done. unless you have poa or the family is allowing you to make these decisions-i can’t think of anything else you could do. certainly report any abuse, but in my experience-a call to adult protective services resulted in me being lectured on how i cannot take away another person’s independence without having power of attorney. my grandma was yelling at imaginary people on the roof and was outside in freezing temps hallucinating and there was nothing i could do about it. i lived across the country at the time. i told her dr-who said she would pray for her. she ordered up neurology tests, but my grandmother refused all care, including any in-home care. i finally paid a friend of hers (only person she trusted) to come sit with her during these episodes. it was certainly one of the most scary and stressful 5+ years of my life. i had to wait until my grandma burned all bridges and was not able to return to her apartment before i could convince her to move here, and then i had to trick her into going into memory care. getting a real evaluation didn’t happen until she was in memory care. not sure what good it would have done before that-the hospitals do not want dementia patients. skilled nursing doesn’t want them unless they are physically affected. my grandma was ridiculously healthy and strong in ever other way. the proper place for her was memory care…and it was wonderful but cost several thousand $ per month. does your so’s grandma have the means to pay for that?  maybe you are in another country with better resources-but in my experience in the usa i really couldn’t do anything until my grandma signed a poa. prior to that i watched her give away her possessions and money to scavengers…spent serious time and money traveling back and forth when neighbors and police called..and she fought me at every turn. i hope you have a better outcome!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v6szm7/where_do_i_get_started_in_terms_of_evaluation/,Where do I get started in terms of evaluation?
"so, it’s four am, been up since two thirty from my grandmother crying in horror because she woke up and couldn’t find her husband (he’s in the hospital, this is a daily conversation with her). we’ve been in the process of trying to move her and him to one of the long term care facilities. my grandfather is more for the physical side of things, but my grandmother more for dementia. but either way, we’ve been in the process for a week trying to get her moved in there since he will have to go too. by next week we should have more answers of how and when. i feel awful either one has to go and not live in their home anymore. if it was a perfect world we could have live in care. but it’s at the point they need 24/7 constant care. and am told that’s just not a feasible price. also, we did have my great grandmother’s in this same place when i was little and seem to like this place. well i came to the internet for advice for her nightmares, and hadn’t been at all worried about the care facilities. i know there’s been some bad history with them, but thought things were getting better. until stumbling into one recent post about a bad facility leads to another, and that people who have first hand experience seem to say it’s not that unheard of still?! how common is mistreatment in these places then? that they can seem friendly but in reality they’re not? i thought things we’re gonna be fine care wise for her but now i don’t know what to believe. i’m sorry if i come off in a panic in this post. logically it’s just from lack of sleep, my own mental illness, and just mental wear from caring for her for over a week now (thank gosh have some good support ❤️). but i now do still have genuine worry. i cant keep doing this caring for her 24/7, but don’t want her to go to a broken system. i just need reassurance that surely there’s good facilities, or if something is amiss that we can report it. just want her going to a good place. thank you all so much for just letting me air this out here. just typing this out has calmed me down. plus she’s back to sleep now so i think i finally can relax again."," please go in person to multiple care facilities.   use your ears, your eyes, your nose.they are all not the same.  i found a smaller, privately run one for my mother, one that works in tandem with several hospice agencies.  it is cheerful, spotless and full of music.  i come in at any time and find the staff making sure residents have comfort items on top of having their needs met- finding interesting things to do (one staffer plays monopoly with a table full of residents, another leads art projects that decorate the dining room), there are bunnies and a chicken coop in the enclosed garden, they make sure people have a cup of coffee, or they apply hand lotion or paint the residents' nails.i can't tell you how good i feel going in there.  the staff knows just what to say to each resident- one may need a soft blanket and a hand to hold for a few minutes, another one, quite salty with her language, demanded a f---ing liter of vodka for lunch and one cheerful and loving staffer said, i could get that for you but you wouldn't like it, because i'd drink most of the bottle before giving it to you.   and that line got a smile and a bit of a laugh out of the cranky lady (who i adore too).i've never seen any abuse.   one other clue- how long have staff been there?  a good place keeps their staff and if you know people have been there for 4 or 5 years that's good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v6qipd/need_support_please_anxiety_up_reading_bad_things/,"Need support please, anxiety up reading bad things about nursing homes/memory care"
"my grandmother is 88 and over the past few years has become more and more forgetful. in the past 2 years it has become much more noticeable. she has her keys taken away because her children are concerned after an incident of her getting confused and driving to a location she thought my dad would be at, but he had told her he would pick her up to drive her the next day. she no longer recognizes my cousins in photographs from years ago and forgets that i graduated college every time she sees me. she attended my college graduation and the next day thought i was in high school. two days ago i told her that her name was in the program for my cousins wedding and that i wish she could have been there (she could not attend due to the long flight) and she got frustrated and said that no, she was there. and asked aggressively if i was at the wedding too. she also insists she has been to two other foreign countries recently. recently when other members of my family greeted her we all hugged her but minutes later she said the last person who hugged her was the only one who gave her a hug. one other thing that worries me is that she gets scared at night and thinks there are people outside. she has many large trees and bushes in her yard and wants my dad to cut them down because she thinks someone is behind them. due to this her partner now sleeps over every night so she feels safer. i understand that things will probably only get worse from here but i'm hoping maybe this is just forgetfulness? she still has the same happy personality and has her sense of humor so i'm not too worried but it is still upsetting to see her forget things so easily."," yes, it sounds like dementia, aka old age senility. get the book *the 36 hour day* and start flipping through it as situations come up",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v6n09a/dementia_or_old_age/,Dementia or old age?
"i guess i just need to post this into the void. my mother was the glue that held our family together. i realize looking back now for many years she had subtle signs of memory loss. in the last few years, my father stepped up to take care of her, they had been together for over 30 years. my father was over ten years older than her, a colon cancer survivor. by all accounts a tough old slavic man. i knew my mothers dementia was progressing but they did a good job of keeping it a secret (in as much as they could, i am a dr + they lived on the other side of the country). my father was capable of caring for her and they are old school europeans who valued their independence. unfortunately my dad passed away this past october from a short illness, and prior to his passing we had emergently moved both of them down to my sisters in florida so we could take care of them. it was an incredibly traumatic event for my mother as she was not really able to understand what was going on, despite us explaining it to her etc. dad has been gone for 6 months. my sister has been taking care of my mother largely on her own - i live about 4 hours away and just moved to florida by myself as my husband is up in michigan finishing his surgical residency. i try to help her as much as i can, every other weekend, and we try to schedule so she doesn't go too long without me coming by to help. we did have a caregiver but were running out of money to pay her and had to stop employing her. the financial situation is different now, with things sort of stabilizing. anyway, my sister, who is about 20 years older than me is taking care of mom full time while also working from home full time. we have gotten to the point now where i am stepping in and making the decision for my mother to go into a home. my sister is on the verge of a breakdown. we have no family here in the states to help us. both of our spouses are in different states. its truly a horrible situation. i have been slowly priming my sister regarding getting mom ready for a home, as she is now truly requiring intense supervision for just about everything and i think my sister is realizing this as her decline has been incredibly apparent over the last few months since dad is gone. my mother is now coughing everytime she drinks something, she will likely aspirate. her gait is incredibly unsteady and she is becoming a fall risk. she no longer speaks much. shes not my mother anymore. i guess i dont know what to sayi am in my 30s and will have lost both of my parents in one yeari am not willing to lose my sisteri hate this"," if you haven’t already, check here: ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v6jbkt/just_need_to_type_it_out/,just need to type it out

"tldr - mom is miserable at al. it’snot the al’s fault, i don’t think, she wouldn’t be happy anywhere. but as the only person responsible for her, it does mean daily calls either from her with complaints, desperate to “go home”, or reports from caregivers about whatever bad thing recently happened (like soiling her furniture, or screaming at night). how do people manage this without breaking down themselves? longer:mom is now in al, with advancing mid-level dementia. she needs lots of supervision and care. she was/is textbook narcissist, in health she burned all her bridges and was always unhappy. i had to move her cross country so she could at least be close to the one person that’s willing to be responsible for her (me).unsurprisingly she’s miserable at al too. it’s on all accounts better than what she had going before the move, where she was mostly alone, not well cared for. now she’s fed, dressed, and attended on. but she has vague notions of what a wonderful life she used to have, partly due to dementia not letting her remember the last 5-10 years, and partly due to her narcissism letting her deny the reality that she didn’t actually have friends or engaged family. so she feels trapped in al and is unwilling to engage in activities or meet people or anything. mostly her energy is focused on complaining, to me if i haven’t turned off my phone. i wish i could let it slide but it often throws me for an anxiety loop. hoping others have perspectives or advice overall that can help my mindset.", my dad has dementia and is a narcissist too.  i tell myself it's impossible for him to be happy no matter what i do.  so there is no point giving up my happiness to try to make someone who can't be happy happy.  i'll admit i don't stick to what i preach as much as i should but it's definitely italy worth trying to live by this philosophy.i'd tell that care home that you don't want to hear every little thing that happens to your mom.  they are suppose to care for her so if she soils the furniture they should take care of it and you don't need to know (although i'm not sure how costs for repairs needed is dealt with).i'd also limit communications with her.  i myself even have a separate google voice phone number for my dad to call me at.  google voice is free anyway.  i turn off the notifications for that phone number so i only get his calls and messages when i specifically open the app and look at them.  i also like transcriptions cause then i don't have to listen to his voice in voicemail which google voice does automatically for you.  i'm sure there's other ways to achieve all this but that just what i do.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v6c6p1/how_do_you_not_break_down_yourself/,How do you not break down yourself?

"my grandmother is in her mid 90s and was diagnosed with early stage dementia last year. despite being elderly, she’s been pretty independent, but her cognitive decline has accelerated in the last few weeks. i have a very special relationship with my grandma—she practically raised me. of my mum and dad, she was the one parent i had who cared for my emotional needs growing up. she lives at home with my parents, while i live overseas. i call home when i can, but truth be told i havent been able to do so as regularly as i normally would do as every conversation with her since she was diagnosed has left me feeling helpless and empty inside. i feel guilt ridden. like the worst grand daughter ever. but seeing my vibrant outspoken grandma turn into this frail shell of a woman sends me into a deep depression that lasts weeks sometimes. our conversations never last more than 10 minutes—she gets stuck in a loop and can’t seem to talk her way out of it.last night i called her after a couple weeks and was devastated when she stared at my face through the phone and asked: “who are you?” i wanted to cry, but i wanted to hold it together for her as i know in her moments of lucidity her memory loss frightens her.i feel like i deserve this. that if i had made more of an effort to call every day that maybe she wouldn’t have forgotten me. she came to after a couple minutes but the whole thing has ripped a hole through my heart. i will make more of an effort to call home even though it hurts. and i will head home next month for a few weeks to spend some time with her. i’m not sure what the point of this post is other than to admit that i’m not ok. and that none of this is ok.this disease is so cruel. if anyone has any advice on how i can be a better granddaughter to her while living overseas, i’d love to hear it."," converse with her about her feelings, not about facts.

"i posted in this subreddit when i discovered my grandmother had dementia and overall, things have been going well except for the few times she has problems with her memory or forgetting things that just occurred. &amp;nbsp;  at any rate, today, my grandma had an episode where she became aggressive with my uncles. she apparently got so aggressive with them that she disowned them (for no valid reason other than something she thought had been happening). i call her before i put my son to bed since she likes to talk with him and when she answers, she is emotional with me; not ugly, just emotional talking about how she was being lied to by my grandfather. she then told me she was packing her bags and leaving tomorrow. so i drove over to her place to talk with her. when i arrived, the air in the house was as tense and my grandpa’s eyes looked like he had been upset and my grandma had these…the only way to describe it is a rabid dogs eyes. i sat with her and i just let her talk about what was going on, keeping in the back of my head that she was confused and things she was saying weren’t true….i just wanted her to feel like someone was listening to help calm her down. my mother arrives shortly after and my grandmother says something to her and suddenly my mother becomes confrontational with her, and it makes my grandma storm out of the house and into the back yard.  &amp;nbsp;  i confront my mother and my grandpa asking them to realize that it’s her disease and the best thing we can do is be empathetic to what she has to say, no matter how untrue it was. i ask my mom and grandpa to stay inside and i go outside to talk with my grandma so more. i tell her i don’t want to talk about why she’s angry unless she wants to. i then ask her to sit with me since she keeps claiming she will be gone in the morning and i won’t have much time with her left. so i just asked her to sit and be with me so we can enjoy our last moments together. we begin talking about something random and she begins to calm down but then my grandpa and mother come outside and sit down. my grandpa and grandmother start arguing and it makes my grandma storm back inside the house saying she was leaving. then she comes back out immediately and tells my grandpa to get his things and leave. he said he wasn’t leaving and that’s when my grandma tells my mom and i to leave the house because it’s about to get ugly. my grandpa asks her what she means by this and she says just don’t fall asleep with your eyes closed or your wake up with a hammer to your head. and my mom intervenes and the next thing i know, my grandmother is running at my grandfather and pushes him and begins to punch him in the chest. my mother steps in to stop her and she begins to hit my mother. i then jump in and bear hug my grandma asking her to look into my eyes and see that it’s her grandson tony. my grandma says i know who it is and then threatened to hit me if i didn’t let her go. so i let her go and she appears to raise a fist at me and my mom steps in defending me like a mama bear to her cub. my grandma storms inside, gets her purse and storms off from the house to the main road. &amp;nbsp;at this point my mom and i are emotional and my grandpa is beside himself and goes inside. i decide there was nothing else we could do so i call 9-11 and get police to come out to help while asking my mom to follow my grandma so she doesn’t get hit by a car. my mom does and after i’m done talking to the 9-11 dispatcher, my grandma shows back up at the house and is looking for her phone (which she had in her purse). the cops finally arrive and they are told what’s going on and go inside to talk with my grandma. apparently, she took some medication and had finally calmed down. however, because of her violence and aggression, the police had to take her to the hospital. she did not remember anything from what had happened and didn’t understand why she was being asked to go to the hospital. she was told she what she was threatening (suicide, murder, running away) all of which she couldn’t believe.  &amp;nbsp;my grandma has always been a georgia peach so for her to have this kind of aggression is completely something new and terribly depressing to say the least. i found out from my grandfather that she also suffers from being bi-polar and this wasn’t her first outburst. &amp;nbsp;  my questions are:  1. did i do the right thing by calling the cops to get her committed to the hospital?  &amp;nbsp;  2. should i hire a counselor to help my family coup better with the outburst? i am very disappointed in them for getting confrontational when she was clearly having an episode.  &amp;nbsp;3. based on her current stages of dementia…i read online that she is midway through the disease stages. is this correct or is this at a point where she may not make it much longer?  &amp;nbsp;4. my uncles were all called and realized it was her disease causing the outburst and so they are going to meet online (they all live out of state) with my mother tomorrow to discuss next steps and how they can help support this moving forward seeing that the disease is progressing so much. but what are some things we should be doing? if at all?!&amp;nbsp;tldr: my grandmas dementia has gotten to a new stage where she is aggressive and violent and the cops had to be called to get her hospitalized. i need some wisdom on what my family and i should be doing at this time.", some links that may be helpful for future planning:,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v5u591/aggression_and_violencewhat_do_i_do/,Aggression and Violence…what do I do?

"this turned into a rant.  i apologize.  i think i need professional therapy to process this :(my mom is right on the borderline of cognitive impairment and dementia.  she lives in a retirement community independently yet.  however, i handle every aspect of her life outside of that safe bubble, except for my brother handling her meds and her medacube.  it seems like there's always an appointment, an insurance change, finances to handle, phones to fix again and again and again, furniture to move, shopping to do...  i work full time, i work her needs and the time it takes into my schedule.  i live an hour away.  i don't/can't just visit for pleasure anymore, i'm always taking care of some administration thing, at least weekly.  frankly, even more relaxed visits aren't pleasurable anymore as this person now is quite different that who my mother was :( we had a good relationship all my life, but not at all close.  she was my dad's wife 100% and after we could take care of ourselves (4 or 5 years old?) she poured all her energy back into my dad, who died from heart failure in 2019... she and i had a polite and respectful relationship but there wasn't much support, so, honestly, i do what i do out of basic responsibility, not nurturing and powerful love.  and now, she's unfamiliar.  now my mom is sending me repeated messages about it being so long since she's seen me and when am i coming to visit?  we went to her neurologist appt tuesday and i was at her place for hours after work the thursday before completely resetting her phone (some bible app she clicked on took it over!)  she's sending these on the group chat we have set up with my two brothers, so at least they see how many times she brings it up.  i plan to visit her tuesday morning before work (but i can't tell her that since she won't remember it, at all and has like four calendars all over her apartment she uses randomly).  my daughter visited her yesterday.  my cousin brought her mom supper last night and invited my mom to eat with them (her sister-in-law lives just down the hallway).   my brother is taking her to a doctor appt tomorrow.  she loves her community and is very much a central figure there.  she goes to 9am coffee everyday and eats one meal a day in the dining hall. she has plenty of social stimulation.  i want to scream at her ""leave me alone!"" but of course, i don't.  more pent up emotion.  i can be randomly enjoying some relaxing activity, by myself, and in pops a message, nagging me to pay attention to her somehow and it plunges me into anger and blackness.  i'm not mad at my mom, she can't help it.  i'm incredibly sad that she thinks i'm ignoring her and never visiting.  all immediate things that happen to her or she hears just completely disappears right after they happen.  i don't know how to let her know i am helping her and visting her or seeing her or talking to her multiple times a week.  i can't tell her, she forgets.  i can't write it down anywhere, she will take down notes and tuck them away.  she took down the white board i put up for this kind of thing.  i'm at my wits end and it's only the beginning... my wits are not at all good at this type of thing and never have been."," this is so normal. i had to be sure to tell the relatives who live closer to her that we knew they were visiting and checking in with her often but that she told us that she “never” heard from them. at least so that when she told them that she *never*  sees us, they know it’s likely not true.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v5f6ko/forgetting_visits_telling_me_its_been_so_long/,"Forgetting visits, telling me it's been so long since I visited"
"me and everyone in my family is devastated.  i know this was coming and i know she is high up in age, in the high 90s, i knew all this and yet, somewhere along the way i lost myself in denial or complacency and will regret it for my lifetime.she started eating very little two weeks ago, a week now she’s been eating nothing but a few sips of milk. same with water, only a couple sips. can’t get up without getting tired, which leaves her bedridden. this is also getting worse, as the last time she got up, she couldn’t make it to the bathroom halfway without getting dizzy and falling back on her walker.the start of the decline of appetite to now has been three weeks. we decided to take her to the hospital two days ago, today will be her third day. the first day at the hospital, they didn’t do much, and we didn’t notice anything different. yesterday, she was put on iv fluid and they got her to release some of the stool that’s been built up. she had a better day yesterday but she still isn’t eating or getting up, her responses are still brief, or sometimes just a nod. she’s still tired and sleepy. i have to accept that its very likely the end , as much as it pains me. my focus for this final stage is that i want to be able to help her feel as little pain as possible, while still keeping her mental clarity stable so we can comfort and converse with her to the end. i would like to know if you guys have any input with the type of medication or processes that can reduce the pains of the dying. the day before we sent her to the hospital, she was groaning and groaning in bed, and it was just agonizing to watch. a second decision we have to make is if we want her to pass at the hospital or at home. we need to weight the benefits and negatives of both. my concern with the hospitals is the horrible visitor policy that doesn’t allow anyone overnight and only one visitor at a time. i’m not here to argue but if anything were to happen and none of our family could be there at night or all together, i would be filled with so much pain and rage. i was told everyone would be allowed to visit in the time of dying but that is not satisfactory for me, i want our entire family there all the way to comfort her. however, i think a hospital would  be able to help her with pain a little better than we could.does anyone have any input on these two matters? pain reduction and the final place of  passing? i feel so overwhelmed."," this is all very fresh in my mind since my mom just passed away a few weeks ago. she caught covid-19 and was given hours to a few days to survive whilst in hospital. we had her brought home for hospice care. she was at home for close to 2 months, during which it almost seemed as though she'd graduate out of hospice; she was eating, talking, laughing whilst watching comedies on tv, and we even got her up to walk short distances around the house. for hospice, the service provided an rn for periodic visits, an rn assistant to come daily  to help with changing and bathing in the mornings, hygienics supplies, and pain medications. we also paid for a caregiver to come in on week days. the end came unexpectedly. a week before she passed way, on a saturday night, she'd eaten dinner and was watching tv in good spirits. the next morning, we couldn't wake her. an rn came over and stated that she was in the final transition process. over course of the proceeding week, she'd periodically open her eyes, and would squeeze our hands, but was otherwise unresponsive. we'd monitor her vital signs and give her what thickened water via sponge stick that she'd accept. in terms of pain management, if her beathing became labored, we'd give her 0.25 ml morphine, but this only happened a few times. we also used a couple of other medications. when the end finally did come, my brother and i were right next to her, holding her hands and caressing her hair until she took her last, barely discernable breath, and her heart beat its last. it was very quiet and peaceful, in her bedroom of over 50 years. as hard as it was, i'd rather this than getting a call from the hospital that she'd passed away, as had happened with my dad, even though he was lucid and had gone out on his own terms (had said his goodbyes and said he'd be gone by morning).edit - the morphine is in administered orally with a needleless syringe, not via injection, so you can do this yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v5dl9i/nearing_the_end_for_her/,Nearing the end for her

(my sister had a fit because she wanted me to have my dad declared incompetent. i didn't see the need. )both of my parents were doing so well and my dad suddenly declined a few years before the pandemic. my sister has visited us once for two hours after my dad's dx and then stopped calling. she's ""protective of her free time."" she didn't even want her wife to work because she wanted her at home with her all the time. i'm starting to think my sister never intended to let me move in, and i'm guessing that her promises to help us with dad were lies too. she told my mom i was trying to take over the money and put them in a facility. i am trying to keep them in their home. (my sister is the only one with enough money to afford ltc for them.) my mom is now conflicted about letting me help more with finances. my dad is still giving my sister money we can't afford. i absolutely love my parents so much. they weren't perfect and neither am i. we've always helped each other out though. i knew eldercare would be a struggle for me with disabilities. i had no idea what dementia did to a family. it's so hard and i dissociate a lot of the time. i'm scared i'm going to die before one or both of them do and no one will care for them. plus, i spend a lot of time stopping people from taking advantage of them. i went from low blood pressure to high blood pressure in six months and it's complicating my chronic kidney disease. my doctors are begging me to reduce my stress. i can't get care for my treatment resistant depression and adhd here (rurally) either. my mental health is garbage. it's crushing my soul to watch my mom go through this. no matter what my mom does my father complains and is nasty to her. that's on a good day. i can't bring myself to mention the rest of the stuff. my mom and i are doing the best we can and holding each other together. she's able to do more than i can physically right now. i don't know what to do now that my dad can't be left alone and my nephrologist and the nearest trauma center is a two hour drive. he refuses to leave the house most of the time.i don't know what to do if my mom has an emergency and they fly her out of state to the trauma center because i hold poa for both of them. who do i leave alone? how can i possibly choose. my sister blocks me when i ask for help. i've lost thirty pounds in two and a half months. i am out of breath taking the trash out. my mom is losing weight too and has high blood pressure.we both need respite desperately, but my sister says it would be a hardship on her as a federal judge. she gets four weeks of paid vacation days a year and works from home!!we're only asking her for a week for my mom. i want to scream at my sister.

"when my mother was a small girl she had a chronic health condition and she spent most of her childhood in hospital. she suffered so much trauma from it that when i was growing up she would never let anyone know she was sick until it was severe. at the beginning of this year mom could hold a conversation but she needed help finishing her train of thought. she couldn't make food or keep appointments and she needed help to run water for a shower. she was content and the whole family helped to keep her busy with stuff she could do. there were times when the moderate became severe but only occasionally.then she fell two weeks ago.i was cleaning her bedroom. she was in the living room. i was away from her for about 5 minutes. it was the last step on the stairs and it's a miracle that she didn't break anything but she has very bad cuts on her face. she was in hospital for a week and when she was discharged she had gone from moderate to severe. she can't walk unassisted. she needs help to go to the bathroom. she has forgotten how to use utensils. she's incoherent.the worst part is what she keeps saying. ""please help me"". it's never when it's a concern over bodily needs (food, water, bathroom, pain, hot/cold, etc) and i know that because she will ask for help with everything physical (incoherently most of the time but distinctly). from a week of trying to decipher what she means when she says ""please help me"" sometimes she's asking for a cure to her dementia or to go home. she's still stuck in the hospital she spent most of her childhood in and just wants to be healthy again so she can go home. she wants a return to before. how do i look my mother in the eye and let her know that it's never going to get better for her? that it's really only downhill from here? that the best i can do is try to keep her comfortable?i can't. i keep telling her that help is coming and that she's healing very well from her accident but she doesn't believe me. i steer conversation away from anything hospital or home related. when she realises that she's actually home it makes her hysterical. the thinking is obviously, well if i'm home why am i still like this? i tell her stories about what everyone in the family is doing. i watch her favourite movies with her. none of it really helps. she is deeply deeply depressed from her condition. i don't know how but every time she says: ""please help me"", my heart breaks again. i'm trying mom. i'm sorry."," i think what she is saying is “i’m scared” and who could blame her. especially with her experience of the hospital. it sounds like you’re doing great. maybe acknowledge her fear. “i know it’s scary but i’m with you”. and try to think, what would her child self need to hear or want when she was sick? can you prop open a window for fresh air? play music? it sounds like you’re doing awesome with the movies and stuff. try more in that vein and think outside the box. hopefully you’ll find something that works. and for you, you are helping her so much and i think she knows you are. i think she’s trying to express her fear and not trying to imply you’re not doing enough. you are.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v44z9r/please_help_me/,"""Please help me"""

"my dad (93, multiple strokes over past 10 years, lbd diagnosis about 8 months ago) has been in a rehab center for the past 3 weeks after multiple falls at home (8 hours drive from me, in a small rural town), the last one leaving him lying on his face in a pool of blood until found by a caregiver in the morning. given his lbd diagnosis and the poa that i hold, i'm making the decisions, and i can't send him back to his house; he needs to be in a certified residential facility. so think about how upset the average 93-yo would be at being told that he can't go home, and then multiply that by 1,000 for his very, very difficult personality where he has always gotten exactly what he wants by insisting on it, pushing, arguing relentlessly, and basically bathing in his certainty that he knows exactly what is the right thing. and then add in some degree of cognitive decline (early stage, i think).i know that i'm making the right choice for his health and welfare, especially considering that he's going to continue physical and cognitive decline. but he is arguing relentlessly and creatively, and he sounds rational (in the way of his personality) when he is arguing for going home. but he's also confusing details, forgetting conversations, and confabulating. it's like the entire reserve of his cognitive capability is spotlighting on making a case for why he should return to his house but leaving nothing for anything else. the medical staff say that it's clear to them that he has dementia, but i keep falling into the trap of hearing him argue in fairly rational ways about why he should return to his house, and it's causing me to question everything about what i'm doing.my mom went through alz so i have some familiarity with this, but he's a very different personality, and he (apparently) has a different condition, so i'm having a hard time reassuring myself with comparisons to my mom. my mom was difficult, but she never argued forcefully and with any logic.anyways, i guess i'm mostly just unburdening myself, but if anyone has any experiences that would help me to understand what's going on or would reassure me about what i'm doing (or even any pushback if i'm doing the wrong thing) i'd love to hear."," i would question a dlb diagnosis at 93 after multiple strokes.  the number of wrongly diagnosed dlbs i've seen is high.  it's usually goes like this: elderly patient falls or gets an infection.  he becomes delirious or hallucinates and is labeled with dlb.if he is able to use logic to a surprising degree repeatedly while you try to talk with him then it's a good sign of his cognitive ability.  not to say he doesn't have cognitive impairments but staff at a facility are not exactly qualified to identify dementia.  prior to his dlb diagnosis, were your concerns about him living alone based on risk of falls or cognitive changes/confusion?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v2msi8/my_dads_lbd_and_willfullnarcissistic_personality/,My dad's LBD and willfull/narcissistic personality

"hello everyone. this post is hard to make, but my family and i have become caregivers to my grandmother who has vascular dementia. recently, it’s become extremely hard to give her care. she has chronic copd, on oxygen 24/7, and believes she can still smoke. there’s many other health factors involved, but it’s just too many to list.long story short, she’s become very aggressive and irritable with us, especially my mom and to anyone who refuses her cigarettes. after trying to find some sort of emergency placement for her, we, as a family, have come to the conclusion that we can no longer safely care for her. although we do not believe she will physically injure anyone, we are at a point that we fear for her safety, and the safety of the people in our household (do to her temperament and lack of corporation). when she first moved in, she would hide cigarettes and use our stove to light them. we had to start turning our stove off by the breaker. we also have to hide medicine and keys in fear she will take medicine that she shouldn’t take her forget she took it and take me. she also can’t drive but we fear she will drive. and that’s to only name a few things.we desperately need help, but we do not know what to do. we’ve advocated for putting her in some sort of nursing home where they can care for her 24/7, but she has refused so no one is helping us.if anyone has any resources or any advice, please, please reach out to me. thank you so much."," in my humble opinion, and take it w a grain of salt, i’d just let her smoke. she lacks the mental capacity to understand why she shouldn’t smoke, and she will continue to get violently angry if you take away something she’s physically addicted to. if there’s one thing i’ve learned through dementia caregiving is to pick your battles, most are not worth fighting. regardless you guys are all doing a great job taking care of her, and looking at memory care facilities may be a good option for the future. you should talk to her doctor about her refusal to enter a home, i believe there’s a formal process to deal w that",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v24q75/struggling_with_caring_for_my_grandmother/,Struggling with caring for my Grandmother

any experiences for navigating this system? he's on medicaid/medical. thanks ahead of time."," i just went through a similar scenario as you with my dad (76). the nursing home evicted him, giving me only a three-day notice because they used a small clause in our contract. typically, a 45-day notice is given. the nursing home did not help me find a place for him, even though they were supposed to, and they kept my community fee.i took my dad to the nearest hospital that is well respected in my city for geriatric psych. if they didn't accept him, i would take him to two other er's that has psych units. then, i had to beg for them to admit him. initially, the hospital told me they only accept seniors that are suicidal, homicidal, or have an additional mental condition. after i begged and let them know i had nowhere safe to house him, the hospital admitted him. thankfully, the hospital gave me a fantastic case manager who helped me navigate the system from a medical standpoint. my dad spent ten days in the hospital even though the hospital administration wanted him gone after three days.my recommendations/lessons learned that would be helpful for you:1. if your employer has an employee assistance program, reach out to them for help finding a nursing home. mine found multiple nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, and a discounted elder care lawyer.2. i reached out to ""a place for mom."" it's free for you, and the facility you end up at pays them. my salesperson/rep was terrific and referred me to so many facilities in my budget that did not pop up on a quick google search.3. reach out to any nursing homes you toured previously. i had a friendly relationship with two nursing homes that i turned down earlier.4. take time off from work (if you can swing it). i took three weeks off, and one week was spent physically touring six facilities and calling many more.5. be honest. when you call these nursing homes, be honest about your dad, his behaviors, etc. you do not want to be caught in this situation again, so it is better to be upfront about his needs. in the nursing homes i toured, the salespeople really appreciated my candor and told me yes, they can meet his needs, or no, they can't.6. look for nursing homes with a psych nurse on staff or a geriatric psychiatrist that comes on-site. when changes to his medication become necessary, it is so convenient to have someone on-site who could make immediate changes.7. don't think of the nursing home as his final home. think of nursing homes as leasing an apartment. as your father's needs change and the disease progresses, his current home may not be enough, and that's ok. once i accepted that fact, it improved the interview process and decreased my stress/anxiety.my experience kind of ended on a happy note. i found a nursing home for my dad closer to my home (10minutes of local roads) and cheaper than where he was before. the staff there is so much more understanding about his disease and has managed to get him to take his medication consistently, bathe him, and change his clothes. is he still a hot mess? yes. just yesterday, he took a kitchen pan, peed in it, and tried to hit the nurses with it. his last facility would have called me and threatened me with sending him to the er. the staff at his new home is trained and equipped to work with him. they managed to calm him down and only informed me it happened when i asked them how he was doing. the responsiveness and gentleness of the staff have helped me feel more confident about his current home. i'm using two out of my three fmla weeks to visit him daily, get to know the nurses, and let them understand that i am here; to contact me if they need anything.&#x200b;good luck with your dad and your search! i hope my monologue helps you know you are not alone, even in a small way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v1ce59/in_oregon_memory_care_increasingly_aggressive_dad/,"In Oregon Memory Care, increasingly aggressive dad with Dementia, he's about to be evicted"
i am exactly four months out from the end. we lived 420 days of hell with the most gracious live in caregiver. it is nasty. you will feel guilt that you haven’t earned. when you start to wake back into yourself you will still feel guilty even when everyone pulled their part. people let yourself be free. when they tell you to live you life do it. the end will remain the same. the shell that is left is not the person you knew in the past. cut yourself some slack. you are doing the best thing you have ever done.," reading your words and tearing up. my 77 y.o. wife is slowly declining, both cognitively and physically.  her family is back in maryland.   we're alone.  no way i can find time for myself except watching movies or on the computer.  not the same as being with people.  i'm the caregiver and i have untreatable bipolar illness.  yes, doing the best i can but i know she will get worse and this is going to become overwhelming or her physical health will take a turn for the worse and i'll have to put her into a long term care facility.  never was a great marriage but it is still painful to watch her fade away.  i don't know what life will look like or feel like when i have my life back.  i've forgotten the man i used to be though i know he's stirring inside of me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v1c67v/the_end/,The end

"so my mom,  early 70s, has dementia. we did get her into a semi-assisted living facility which dealt with a lot of problems. i don't need to buy groceries, worry about her cooking, or clean her kitchen/apartment. they administer her pills on the proper schedule. she has social engagements now. the biggest problem is that she won't stop drinking. not a crazy amount, but she's going through a couple liters of whiskey a week at least. her mobility is reduced, and she gets lost, so she takes a cab a few blocks to a liquor store, buys some whiskey, then comes back, adding up to around $150 all in.  she does not have the money to keep doing this. i got her into a program, she dropped out, since she doesn't see an issue. she can't really do therapy, since she has no memory. i've had numerous interventions to no effect. should i just get her booze delivered and avoid all this trouble and extra cost? i don't want to enable her addiction, but i don't know what else to do."," i'd say try to get power of attorney here, believe this should allow you to prevent her from leaving without your consent. i'm surprised they are letting her leave, typically residents with dementia aren't allowed to leave unless supervised; must be rather independent then? if she is very independent getting power of attorney would be difficult but i'd recommend looking into it as it may be very helpful here. goodluck",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v14fr1/mom_with_dementia_keeps_drinking/,"Mom with dementia, keeps drinking."

"my mom has been showing signs of dementia for 3 years and they've consistently gotten worse, though not horribly so.  she had breast cancer and went through treatment and after that treatment is when the symptoms started showing up.  it started with repeating herself occasionally.  in researching, we thought it might be due to the cancer treatment.  brain fog is a known side effect.  i talked to her about it and she explained what it was like and said she was sure it was from the cancer treatment.  here we are 3 years later.  she now refuses to drive anywhere except the grocery store, repeats herself all the time, and seems to be easily confused.  she stopped working during covid due to a downturn of necessity in her area.  throughout this, my brother and i have been very vocal to our dad about our concerns.  my dad would reason it away.  she would have really good periods and he would think it was getting better. it clearly hasn't.  i've brought it up consistently throughout the past few years.  in march, i was firm. i told him we have to act now. it's clearly getting worse and he can't keep putting this off. he agreed. he said he made appointments for april. then he ended up moving them. and i don't trust that he's giving the doctor all the information.  my dad has a way of minimizing things because he doesn't want them to be real. is there anything i can do?  i've talked to my mom about it. i've talked to my dad about it. my brother lives across the country and is virtually no help.  if we did finally get her to the doctor and they diagnose her, what can be done?"," difficult decision !  the info below is not yet public, because i need to make a picture for it.this draft page is written by truthful loving kindness (yes, that is my full legal name) for publishing at  , so please address any questions or comments to that website, regardless of which website shows these words.   .  in my opinion the three major reasons to go for early diagnosis (or diagnosis at any stage) are  there are several sources of dementia symptoms which can be resolved or arrested without further progress (if caught early enough).  imperative to find out if lewy body dementia is in the mix (because majority of dementia brains, at point of autopsy, had more than one type of progressive dementia).  diagnosis suggests research for insight on dementia symptoms and strategies, which allow the person to live a better quality of life (and with diagnosis, the care-partners can often access alternate care for their own doctor appointments, trips to grocery, meditation time, and other forms of self-care).  .  mayo clinic lists these as some common dementia symptoms.  cognitive changes  memory loss, which is usually noticed by someone else  difficulty communicating or finding words  difficulty with visual and spatial abilities, such as getting lost while driving  difficulty reasoning or problem-solving  difficulty handling complex tasks  difficulty with planning and organizing  difficulty with coordination and motor functions  confusion and disorientation  psychological changes  personality changes  depression  anxiety  inappropriate behavior  paranoia  agitation  hallucinations  (above at >>  ).  .  some reversible causes of dementia symptoms include  (there may be some roll-over on these, because with my own dementia symptoms i cannot remember all the factors for each term).  infections and immune-disorders  alcohol or substance-use disorder  metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities  tumors  nutritional deficiencies  subdural hematomas, (blood clots beneath the outer covering of the brain)  side-effects from medications, or combination of medications  normal-pressure hydrocephalus, a buildup of fluid in the brain  low levels of thyroid hormones, called hypothyroidism  low blood sugar, called hypoglycemia  hiv-associated neurocognitive disorders (hand)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v0bund/mom_clearly_has_dementia_dad_inactive_what_can_i/,"Mom clearly has dementia, Dad inactive - what can I do?

"my dad (my king, my hero) has dementia, it's been going downhill for five years now. last week he punctured his lung after a fall and got into the hospital. that's when my mom (his fulltime caretaker) decided that he couldn't come home anymore.i live two hours away (which is quite a distance in our country) and even though i still took care of him a lot, its her call. she feels a lot of guilt, so i keep telling her it's okay. butthat doesn't leave a lot space for my feelings. and what do i feel actually?  i'm tired. i can think of good things that might come from this. i have this constant subtle sad feeling that pops up. but i sort of feel theres a way bigger sad feeling locked away or even hiding. because the disease is so slow, i never got the big blown away sad feeling you get when something suddenly happens. but i think it should be there now. the 'this is a big step' feeling. the 'it will never be like it was' feeling.my very sensitive dad was someone who could get this to the surface. i dont know how.and then there comes the second part. besides my so roommate i haven't told anyone. the thing is. i missed a lot of comfort in my life the past few years. as i said, my dad was very good at this and always there for me. my mom is often more focused on how to solve problems or what it means to her. with other people i tend to not show how much something hurts, i'm always more focused on the bright side.this time, i want to share and not immediately after someone says ""im sorry for you"" say that its going to be okay. i've already noticed that getting comforted is easier with older people, i'm 30 and not a lot of people my age can really imagine how it feels and dont seem to know what to do.so yeah, a messy story, but i thought maybe you could understand. dementia is slow and a long wobbly road. tldr how do i get my feelings out after a long while of slowly losing someone. and what to do when someone comforts you and how to feel comforted?"," therapy. i always feel like i'm burdening my friends with my burdens, even when they genuinely want to understand and be there for me, but honestly much like it's better to let the professionals handle dementia at some point, it's also better to let a therapist help you work through your feelings about something like this. my therapist introduced me to the ""feelings wheel"" that i thought was helpful in just picking the right words to use when even that felt difficult. maybe that's a good place to start?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v04e7g/what_do_i_feel_or_i_dont_know_what_to_say_when/,What do I feel or I dont know what to say when people comfort me

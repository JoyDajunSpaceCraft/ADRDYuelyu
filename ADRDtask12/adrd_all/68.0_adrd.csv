," my parents went out of town two days ago, as per usual i watched grandpa. my dad told mehe had a big lunch at 3:00pm and to wait awhile for his dinner. okay, no problem! i was never informed that my dad got him three chocolate candy bars because grandpa is obsessed with them. i told grandpa “hey, just let me know when your hungry.” he said “okay”. later on about 6:00pm i asked if he was hungry, the answer was no. 7-8-9 not hungry. kinda of normal. he doesn’t eat much. tonight my dad comes in the kitchen and says “well no more chocolate for larry!” i said “why??”. apparently this 121lb man ate three chocolate bars then felt sick afterwards! lol i said well no wonder he wasn’t hungry. sheesh",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qxgjz2/dementia_is_funny_on_friday_post_come_tell_your/,Dementia is funny on Friday post.

"my aunt, who has lung cancer, stopped treatment and was being cared for at home by my uncle - wouldn't let anyone visit or help, despite my uncle having pretty bad balance problems. last week, he finally admitted he couldn't manage any more. she was sent to the hospital, he fell in the hospital parking lot, small brain bleed, sent to a hospital in another city. i came out to help. got her placed in a nursing home 90 minutes from their home (closest bed), and got him released from the hospital cuz his brain bleed was small and stopped on its own. then it turns out, he's got dementia, which was being masked by my aunt's managing everything and their stubborn isolation. now i'm trying to deal with her dying any day, getting him to the nursing home every day, his complicated medication management (type 1 diabetes), and longer-term, what to do about him. taking him to his gp next week to get him evaluated and figure out next steps. and i'm working remote full-time. thanks, felt good to just lay that all out there."," i heard you. this is my ils right now. my fil has vascular dementia, but physically strong as a mule. his wife has sh*t health, and short term memory loss.she is almost more disabled than him, but has managed to hide it better.please accept my virtual hug. i'm so sorry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qx7wbi/parachuted_in_to_a_minefield_a_rant/,Parachuted in to a minefield... a rant

"first time posting, sorry if my train of thought is kinda all over the place, i have a lot of thoughts and don’t really ever address them.my (21m) granddad (83, we call him dai so that’s how i’ll refer to him) is in mid-late stages of dementia, and has been living in a nursing home since my nana (84) broke her hip last winter. she feels guilty about not being the person to look after him, and had tried to hire my aunt and older cousin (since they both work in care) before they realised that he needed 24/7 support.dai was always very passionate about football, and my family believe that doing headers with the ball might have caused head injury that eventually led him to this point. he was always very sure of himself and stubborn, traits that my mum and little brother both inherited, so when the first stages appeared, he wasn’t all that different despite the absent-mindedness. i don’t even remember exactly when he was diagnosed, but he’s been showing symptoms for nearly a decade. it doesn’t help that my nana keeps things to herself so ‘we don’t have to worry.’the biggest incident was boxing day 2018. the night before had been fun, loud, and festive, but i woke up the next day to shouting and arguments. my mum and uncle were arguing with dai, unsuccessfully trying to calm him down as far as i remember, as he threatened to phone the police. he didn’t recognise any of us except nana, and wouldn’t listen to them trying to convince him that we were the people in the photographs around his home. he believed that we were a cult trying to brainwash my nana, since she was agreeing with all of us. he did end up calling the police, who were sympathetic towards us. one of the worst parts of it was when he aggressively insulted my brother, who had been his best pal for his whole childhood, right up in his face. while we knew he was unwell, none of us had any idea things were so bad.fast forward to now, where my family have gotten phone calls from his nursing home, saying that he’d been trying to headbutt staff. this came out of seemingly nowhere; while he’s always been stubborn and grouchy, he’s never been violent. we didn’t want to believe it for a while, but recently when nana visited, he suddenly started cursing and yelling at her for seemingly no reason. they haven’t told us he needs to move yet, but we’re hoping it doesn’t come to that; nana can’t drive and he’s nearby enough right now that she can get the bus. i’m not a carer. i haven’t seen him since before quarantine. he forgot who i was a long time ago. but i’m worried about my relatives; my nana, obviously; my uncle’s family who live in the south of england who only come to scotland twice a year if we’re lucky; my extremely emotional auntie; and my mum and bro who are just way too practically-minded to process everything properly. i don’t know if i can do anything, which feels even worse. i don’t feel like official dementia/alzheimers support groups are even for me since i‘m never even around the guy. i just feel powerless to help."," you care about him and what happens to him and those who do see him, so yes, support groups are for you too.something else you might want to look into is watching some teepa snow videos on youtube. she makes suggestions on things family can do. they might help your family understand and cope better as well.one thing i know you can do is call your grandmother and be her sounding board. try gently getting through to her that her guilt is misplaced. no one can take care of a dementia patient alone, especially not while recovering from a broken hip.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qwukda/i_dont_know_how_to_support_my_family_through_my/,I don’t know how to support my family through my grandfather’s dementia

i just wanted to thank everyone in this sub that has replied to my recent posts. i hope you know how much  your kind words and encouragement really helped me through this difficult time. we took my mom to memory care today. she actually did well. i held it together until after i left and then fell apart. this so damn hard and i just miss my mom. i'm so thankful to have this sub to reach out to and i'll continue to read the stories of those going through the same thing. thanks again.," moving my dad was one of the most difficult decisions i ever had to make. to be honest, it’s only been 2 months since my brother talked me into trying memory care at an assisted living facility.  i reluctantly agreed to admit my dad on a month by month basis as a respite resident mostly because i wanted him to be able to socialize but i’m still not convinced i made the right decision. they are very strict and extremely expensive. it’s not the money that bothers me as long as my father is well cared for and treated with dignity and respect.  i cannot visit with him as freely as i’m used to because they only allow 1 hour bi-weekly visits and an appointment is necessary 24 hours in advance. i don’t follow the two week limit but they let you know if you stay 20 minutes past the hour.  i see a big decline in my father in a short period which makes this even harder.  i have some tough decisions to make but for now i’m my father’s voice and will advocate for him as long as he remains there. i know this is a mouthful to absorb. trust me i cry everyday.  my advice is keep your eyes open and be an advocate for your loved one especially if not vocal. we tend to let our emotions take over and sometimes miss what goes on behind closed doors.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qvnk67/thank_you/,Thank you

"dad79 has been on the dementia decline for about 5 years now. i try to get here as often as i can - parents live in puerto rico - i live in the states. i was here last march and in just 8 months there’s been more issues. it absolutely drives my mom74 and my brother50 (lives with them) crazy when dad starts telling his stories. yes, it is annoying when he is like a record repeating over and over, word for word, stories from his youth. stories about other women before my mom. some stories become so outlandish, he flew a plane and landed it in a field. in his stories he is always the hero that everyone looks up to. he’s the best! people got up from their seats to let him sit and bowed to him offering respect. never ever was he like this. bragging wasn’t his style. mom can’t get him to shower or change his clothes. he doesn’t make it to the toilet and is often in soiled underwear. when i was here in march i took him to a podiatrist because he was limping so bad, his nails had begun to curl under his toes. he was combative when we got there and didn’t speak to me for a the whole day. that was the last time his toe nails were cut. eight months ago. once again he’s refusing to go. he refused to be vaccinated. he agreed and once he got to the clinic he wouldn’t get out of the car. a nurse came out to the car and he tried to kick her. then jumped out of the car and hobbled down the road. earlier today someone had come by to do some yard work. dad always took care of everything meticulously and i could see the confusion as he watched someone else take over his chores. so i asked him to take a ride with me and see some sights. it gave everyone an hour break. and i got to drive him around laughing and joking."," i'm sure most of us here completely understand what you're going through. my mom is much the same way. all her outlandish stories have her as the hero, assistance given to her is resisted, and getting her to change clothes is impossible, even though she has a dresser full of clean clothes.hang in there. dealing with this definitely can take a mental and physical toll. be kind to yourself. and most importantly, forgive yourself for everything about this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qvgc0l/just_a_vent/,Just a Vent
"so i posted a few months ago about how my uncle and his wife spend the money my grandmother receives for her care but they don’t want the responsibility.now it’s actually worse than before. my grandmother’s condition just keeps getting worse. she’s become quite aggressive now and very very stubborn.so recently my uncle and his wife have gone on holiday, abroad, which they could afford with my grandmother’s money. so they obviously dropped her off to my house (i live with my parents).just to let you know, my mother is blind and i suffer from severe anxiety (i take anxiety pills everyday).although my mum is blind, she knows her way around the house and can basically do a lot of things independently. however, she can most definitely not handle my grandmother; especially with the condition she is in now.i worked in a nursing home for two months, but i resigned due to my mental health because i suffered from panic attacks and  i cannot handle such pressure.we asked my aunty (dad’s sister) to take my grandmother to her house until my uncle and his wife return. but she wants no responsibility of her mother and keeps making excuses. her daughter (my cousin) actually works as a mental health specialist and keeps bragging about how it’s easy for her to handle people like our grandmother.but she refuses to take care of her when we requested her because she ‘has her own life’. my aunty does not work, she is home all the time and plus her daughter lives with her. they all are well aware of the situation but no one is willing to help.my grandmother actually needs a professional carer right now and i have discussed this with my parents. even though we can hire a carer through government funding, my uncle’s wife will stop receiving care allowance (she is registered as my grandma’s carer) and they could get in trouble for leaving her and going abroad.the issue is that my parents don’t want any drama at home with my dad’s siblings (who are honestly the most selfish and awful people in my life). so that’s why we can’t hire a carer through government funding. and we can’t afford to hire one privately. i honestly don’t know what to do."," if you've ever been around your grandma, who has dementia, you would already know how difficult it is for people who care for her. it can be emotionally and physically challenging, especially for someone who isn't prepared.if you're wondering why it is wise to know some common reasons family and caregivers may find caring challenging. some of which are:* **social isolation:** the act of caregiving for a senior adult with dementia can be time-consuming. people who care for someone with dementia experience a deteriorating social life, resulting in psychological morbidity.* **physical morbidity:** caregivers often experience a host of health issues. these issues are stress, cardiovascular disease, stomach ulcers, insomnia, and diabetes.* **psychological morbidity:** while this term sounds alarming, know that it refers to the impact of dementia on the caregivers' mental health. dementia is undoubtedly challenging for patients, but it can cause anxiety and depression in the caregiver.**conclusion**being a responsible family member, you may want the best care for your grandma with dementia. but, know that it can be daunting for the caregivers, which makes them resist offering help.nevertheless, it's nothing to worry about. instead, you can get in touch with a home care agency. they may provide you, caregivers, with the right skillset and coping skills needed to give quality care to patients with dementia. after all, caregivers with patience and experience can help others without taking a toll on themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qvf2sf/no_one_wants_to_take_care_of_my_grandma_who_has/,No one wants to take care of my grandma who has dimentia

"so.....i just wanted to see if anyone has any thoughts about this.  and i'm sorry this is long, i just found this sub and i need to tell someone about this.  i'm pretty sure my mother (74) has started down this road.  she refuses to get any test for it, to the point that i'm not brining it up anymore because every time i do she starts screaming at me.  anyways.  this started about a year ago, it kinda snuck up on me.  she would call me (she lives on the east coast usa and i live in the western usa) -- anyways she would call me and ask me to help her balance her checkbook.  she was having trouble with basic addition and subtraction (something she was always good at, she was faster at it than me using a calculator.)  this went on for a while until we determined it was time for me to have access to her finances.  making a long story short, i now have access to everything. she pays some of the bills and i pay the rest.  it hasn't been too bad for a while, save her writing an extra check to her car insurance company for a completely random amount of money -- like $359.26 or something (her premium is $115 a month and had already been paid.)  she had no recollection of writing the check and only when i went into her bank account, brought up an image of the check written in her handwriting and printed it out and sent it to her would she believe me.  not to mention that check put her account into the negative -- i had to use my money to pull it out of the red.  she's set to take an airplane trip soon (i'm dreading that) -- i typed up the entire itinerary for her, dates and times and when to be there....everything.  she's set to leave on the 22nd.  multiple times she's asked me, ""now, what day do i leave again?  the 16th?  is it after christmas?  -- ""no, mom it's the 22nd"" -- ""the 22nd???  you never said that.....""  --  ""mom where did you put the itinerary i sent you?"" -- ""itinerary??"" ...........  about 2 weeks ago she called me at 4 o'clock in the morning, i just happened to be awake so i answered it and she said she was tearing her apartment apart looking for her phone.  looking under her mattress, took all the cushions out of the sofa and chairs.......i said ""mom, your phone is in your hand.  you're using it.""  ---  ""well i know that, but i'm telling you i can't find my phone!!""  i honestly didn't even know what to say.  i think i just changed the subject.  another thing she does is call me for a certain reason but once i answer the phone at some points she starts talking quieter -- almost to herself -- i have to say  ""so what's the reason you called me again?"" -- ""oh yea i wanted to know \_\_\_\_\_"" -- the quiet mumbling also goes into odd tangents..... tonight she called me to ask if i could help her book a doctors appointment (which, when she wasn't explaining it fully and i asked her again she got mad at me).......somehow in this ""conversation"" she ended up talking about my cousin (her niece) who died  in a car accident in 1973.   i forget everything else that was said except when she said ""i'm not dealing with this anymore.  goodbye""  and hung up on me.  at which point i picked up an object in my room hurled it against the wall screaming every 4 letter word you can imagine and then broke down in tears.  but then, other times things are fine.  (relatively.)  i never expected this was what would happen to my mother.  physically, for a 74 year old, she's fine.  i take more meds than she does.  and honestly.......i just don't know.  i'm an only child and she's been divorced since she was pregnant with me.  so guess who is stuck with handling everything?  and, god forgive me, i resent the everlasting hell out of it.  i'll have no one to help me.  my family is fully of selfish assholes, nobody talks to anybody, so i can forget that.  it's all on me.  being as i'm her son rather than a daughter changes the dynamic somewhat if it gets to the point of needing help in the bathroom or such -- we'll have to get a nurse or something because i'm not moving back to where she is (where i grew up.)  i don't even know what i'm asking here but for anyone who got to this point, thanks for reading..", regular poa is for financial.   medical poa gives you power to make medical decisions if she is unable.   she should have a advanced health care directive also.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/quzipz/pretty_sure_my_mother_is_starting_this_pardon_the/,[deleted by user]

"it's been over 5 years now since i lost my favorite aunt to an aggressive case, at just 66 years old. i lived with her at the beginning (long before any doctor identified what it was), and most of the progression of the disease, so i watched and experienced all of the layers of her demise.  watching her be mysteriously robbed of her mobility, memories, and every last shred of dignity was tough to process.. but even worse, when she finally died, i felt almost nothing. it didnt feel new. i hadnt seen the woman i cherished in years. that infantile person that had successfully occupied her body, just didnt register to me as her. i didn't feel nothing. i definitely cried and was upset. but not like i should have been.. but we were very close, so my heart should have been decimated. but it just wasnt at the time. so i focused on creating things for the services that could help me identify and cope, like station cards to celebrate her life and tell her story, and hours of slideshows with her favorite music.  it all helped, but i just felt like maybe gradually losing her may have allowed me to deal with it piece by piece over time, and that i had subconsciously accepted the inevitable.   nope.   now, some 5 years later, everytime she crosses my mind, i have to process that i can never speak to her again all over, like its new information.  this is absolutely exclusive to her. all other loss, there's a sense of closure. i don't feel like this. i've accepted it, and found solace. just not with her.     and now here i am, about to visit a friend at a hotel in hollywood, and theres this painting of cher on the exterior of the building that looks just fking like her, and now i just have to wait here to stop sobbing, like i do everytime i think about her.   is this just me? does anyone else have this same issue?"," it’s not just you. my dad passed this summer after battling alzheimer’s and ftd for five years. i feel like i’ve been grieving him for that whole time. and the grief comes in waves for me. therapy has been helpful for me, especially for venting my frustration of the world moving on like nothing happened. my therapist helps me make some sense of my grief. i felt like when he first passed i was so distracted by planning his service and family drama that followed (yay) and now it’s finally catching up to me and i find myself crying at little things. i haven’t been able to listen to much music since he passed because every song makes me think of him. i started reading “bearing the unbearable”, which i recommend. grief isn’t linear, so i’ve been trying to lean into what i’ve been feeling when i feel it. sending you love and peace, i hope it gets easier (for both of us).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qs3h8n/how_do_you_all_deal_with_the_psychological_dismay/,how do you all deal with the psychological dismay from the experience?

"my mom(68f) got spanish influenza several years ago. hospitalized for several weeks but she recovered and lives a somewhat normal life. she has had continual memory issues and has trouble speaking due to part of her brain being injured from going septic. she’s worked with therapists and speech therapists and she’s doing alright for what it is but she often forgets conversations we’ve had or my siblings have had. she’s locked herself out of the house forgetting her key- stuff like that. but in the past few years, she’s developed vertigo and impacts her life often. my brother and i suspect a lot of her memory issues are from early stages of dementia (also her being sick didn’t help) do dementia and vertigo hand in hand? she ends up in the er several times a year from it and my dad works at the local prison so he is gone a lot. i worry about her being alone as she gets older and wonder how i can help her as symptoms get worse. her parents died in their 60s so we never saw how they aged (if they got dementia or alzheimer’s or nothing at all). is this a common progression?", agreeing with the other commenter. just a small detail i want to point out. faulty doses of dementia medication can mimic vertigo symptoms or increase the already existing symptoms.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qpthjq/vertigo_common_in_dementia_patients/,Vertigo common in dementia patients ?
"my dad is 81, living alone. we try and talk twice a week on the phone. he has always been healthy, but has become depressed over the years because he is alone. he has become more forgetful (can't remember names of things) and sometimes (rarely) will repeat a question he asked a few hours earlier.my biggest concern has become the paranoia and the aggression. he has always been paranoid and aggressive, given his line of work. he has worked in many professions that require risking your life for others and/or training people on how to protect themselves. he was very good at these jobs. his paranoia and aggression have ramped up in the past year. he thinks people are after him, which *may* be the case, but is also highly unlikely. he blows up on me very often. i have asked him to move in with us. i have asked him to move closer to us. he entertains the thought, but gets mad because he thinks i am babying him and he cannot take care of himself. i don't know how to go about getting him checked out by a doctor or if he will even go for it. he will not let me be his legal guardian for the reasons mentioned above. he does not want to deal with being old or consider that he may be losing his mind. i love him very much and am worried he may do something stupid. i don't know what i should do in order to make this as painless as possible.", this is my experience in a nutshell,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qpogul/what_am_i_supposed_to_do/,What am I supposed to do?
"i’m worried for my mother, in her past family history many people have suffered and passed from dementia/alzheimer’s. two years ago we lost our grandmother to it and the time we were taking care of her was rough, and i don’t think i can do something like that again.. what concerns me is that she’s been forgetting certain words and not making sense in her sentences from time to time. what really worried me tonight was she asked my dad what year it was and a few seconds later she knew. i really don’t know what to do because my entire family is disabled and live on services. i’m sorry if i’m incoherent i’m anxious at the moment."," sorry to hear that, it's tough..  maybe check out the websites &/ call dementia .org / alzheimers .org for your area?    less to ask them about yr mom, as only doctors can diagnose - more for support for you, & your concerns.  they also have resources & info for carers / loved ones of the memory lossed.   getting old sucks eh.   hang in there turtlequail !",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qp7aio/worried_for_my_mother/,[deleted by user]
"my 89 year old mother suffers from dementia and, for the past 4 years, has been a resident in the memory care section of a seniors residence. she has become convinced that a recently-arrived male resident, also suffering from dementia, though less advanced, is her long-deceased husband. at first the care aides considered it sweet or cute that they had “formed a relationship” but they have taken to spending all of their time together. whereas she was happy and light-hearted previously she has behaved angrily or acted out in the past few weeks. a week ago, when she was found in a state of undress with him in her apartment, we asked the staff supervisor to ensure that staff understood that they weren’t to be left in either of their apartments alone. the other day, after a care aide had attended to her needs in her bathroom, the gentleman entered her apartment and, when the care aide advised him that he wasn’t to be in her apartment with her alone (as we, her family, had requested), my mother slapped the care aide in the face hard enough to leave a welt. prior to this incident we’d been processing the whole “relationship” situation and how to approach it and now, this. questions: has anyone encountered anything similar? what was the approach to the situation? what was the outcome?"," her mood changes might be unrelated to the new relationship. or they might be related to attempted *restrictions* placed on the relationship.why is it so bad that these two elderly dementia patients are enjoying each other's company? is there somehow exploitation going on, or what? it seems on its face that it's not *that* big of a deal, sure it's awkward, but it sounds pretty benign.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qp5gr8/my_mother_is_confusing_a_male_memory_care/,My mother is confusing a male memory care resident with her deceased husband
"the last time i got to see her prior to today was in august because a wave of the delta variant forced her hospice into lockdown. we live quite a bit away, so not being able to see her for 3 months frustrated us because we knew consistency was key with her for the time being. in august she still recognized who i was. she didn't remember my name, but she lit up and smiled when she saw me and was always so happy to see me. fast forward to today, and i'm a stranger. even after a gentle ""it's ligma, nonna. i'm your grandbaby."" she just couldn't remember that she had a grandchild and kept pointing at me and making my stepdad promise to not bring _them_ along next time he visited.this rapid decline has blindsided me and hurt in ways i didn't imagine were possible. i've known about her cognitive decline for years, so i thought i had prepared myself for the inevitable and yet...nothing hurt more than seeing my favorite person in the world point at me and say that. i just don't know what to do anymore. my mother and my partner both say i need to make a choice if to continue visiting her and i just don't know how anyone can expect me to make such a choice. i either choose to stop visiting and have to live with the regret of not spending the last however many years she has left before she dies, or i visit and just cope with the fact i'm a stranger and there's no coming back from that. either way, i lose.this pandemic has taken my grandmother away from me in way in which i feel like i'm a terrible person wishing that death had been the one to take her instead. at least death is finite, right? the past two years haven't been fair and i'd literally damn myself to the worst layer of hell just to have my grandmother back.", ~~the pandemic~~ the *lockdown* took your grandmother away from you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qp46oz/the_pandemic_made_my_grandmother_worse_and_it/,The pandemic made my grandmother worse and it isn't fair.
my dad was diagnosed this year and i’m 30. my mental health has been terrible anyway and i am unemployed. he is late eighties and i’m in a constant state of anxiety/depression/fear. my mental health has been bad for long it makes me think i have worse mental health then him sometimes? i’m no where near as mentally sharp as i used to be and i don’t know if it’s depression or my situation driving me crazy??! does anyone else living with a parent with this have similar issues? like your mentally exhausted etc and in a fog?," oh god yes. i have a relative who tells stories of her younger days and that is really when she last had fun. and i started to realize the time since my last fun is getting longer and longer as the years go by. sometimes i would see older people at the grocery store who you can tell that talking to the check out person was the only person they talked to all day. i am now that person, still thinking about what the lawn guy said to me a month ago, because i am so isolated now. even in a pandemic people are wracking up new experiences and i am still thinking about a trip to the store i got to do this summer. it's not healthy. what kind of a weirdo will i be when this is over?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qp0y4n/is_anyone_else_living_with_a_parent_with_this_and/,Is anyone else living with a parent with this and it makes them feel crazy?
has anyone had the experience of a loved one being dx with mci but being pretty convinced it’s already well beyond that? we think this is our situation with my fil (72m) and it seems the dx is keeping some of the family in denial about prognosis. alzheimer’s runs in his family. any insight?," first, you should get a second opinion and ensure that you are working with a geriatric care physician, not a general practitioner.  this is a problem within the medical community and some of the problems i ran into.  gp is not really going to try and determine whether it's dementia or not.  a neurologist will just run their tests and provide you a ""high"" level of what they believe is happening (i could not get a diagnosis out of two neuro's we saw for my mom)you need to get matched with a therapist/psychologist who will eventually be the one that provides you the best to a diagnosis and approximate factor for phase.i cannot stress enough the need to work with a geriatric doctor urgently.in addition to all that, sign up for your local dementia/alzheimers associated and start attending their meetings.  they will have specialist who can help you find the best practitioners in your area.good luck op",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qoynu9/mci_denial/,[deleted by user]
my lo has parkinson’s disease and moderate dementia with hallucinations +at least 5 other conditions being managed. he’s in assisted living. my sister and i take care of his finances as a team. our brother who doesn’t want to come to reality falls for getting guilted by our lo regularly. lo is extremely paranoid about his money but was no longer capable of managing it(ie…literally almost lost everything because he never opened the mail) he never remembers anything he tell him about his finances and tries to interrogate our brother and convince him we’re withholding info. in addition to that well meaning friends of his who keep in contact via the phone who also don’t understand the disease process like to tell him things that get him riled up and add to his paranoia. he usually forgets it all fairly quickly but it can’t be good for his brain to keep being reminded that he’s not in control/capable of managing his life anymore. i’m sure others have experienced similar situations and i would be grateful to anyone willing to share their experiences and solutions., do you have weed paranoia,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qow4bd/paranoia/,Paranoia
"so my friend, very sadly, has just been diagnosed with early onset dementia at the age of 30. she's been on a rapid decline for 5 years and despite some very obvious signs we all put it down to a breakdown or poor mental health. through the years all of our friends tried to help her, support her and be there however her behaviour became so antisocial she managed to push everyone away. throughout this time her family have had very little interest in her wellbeing, often saying she refused help and they couldn't force her. 6 months ago she was sectioned after a call to the police for a welfare check from a concerned neighbour. fast forward to today we have only heard of her diagnosis through the grapevine and the family have requested that no one visit her. she's in mid-late stages and is fairly incoherent with minimal verbal communication. we are worried she may not have much longer to live and although we tried to help there was not much we could do to prevent her decline. not one of her friends has seen her in over a year and we are worried. the family doesn't tell us what's going on or involve us in her care. i guess i'm just asking for advice and people's opinions, ive never personally experienced someone close to me with dementia, i want whats best for her but also myself and friends are already grieving the loss of an intelligent, pretty, driven, funny, beautiful person to this horrible disease."," you are not in control of this situation and unless the family caves and allows visitors there is nothing you can do.  it is a sad situation all the way around, perhaps your friend would not want anyone to see her in her present condition and her family is following her wishes.  you say she is almost non verbal and incoherent, do you really want to see her in that condition.   odds are she won't even know who you are. wouldn't it be better to remember her in her better days than how she is now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qovgx0/friend_with_early_onset_family_wont_allow_visitors/,Friend with early onset family won't allow visitors

"hi there, i'm a long time lurker, first time poster. my father has early onset alzheimers, first diagnosed in 2013.  the disease progression has been slow but steady. family is dealing with it pretty well... all except for me.i have not been able to deal with my grief about this. i stalled for a number of years, first because i was wrangling with grief over my best friend passing away and just couldn't process it, and then lost another year and a half to a severe tbi.  recently i tried going to a grief therapy group, and that was horrible, lots of people dealing with the finality of death and loss and it just made the anticipatory grief that much worse.  i don't want to go to an alzheimers support group, because it'd be a bunch of old people who i can't relate to as a 30-something year old.i can't think about my dad without being reduced to tears.  i'm struggling (and failing) not to break down crying right now just typing this.  i cry about nothing. i cry with empathy at how frustrating it must be to feel so confused. i cry when he forgets my name. i cry when at meals he can't remember what he's eaten and doesn't recognize foods he's been eating for my entire life.  and most of all, i cry because i know this is just going to suck worse and worse and worse until he dies. i cry because i fear his death will be a relief (albeit a heartbreakingly sad one).i went out to a concert with him last night and nearly broke into tears over nothing multiple times throughout the evening, to the point where i was desperately holding my breath trying to control it.  it makes it hard to spend time with the family, and while i haven't specifically been avoiding them, i definitely am not going out of my way to see them.how long do i have to be unbearably sad before i can just accept this?  how can i possibly find a silver lining in an incredibly shitty situation?  ""try to just enjoy what time you still have with him now and be grateful for what he still has"" feels like a useless platitude, no matter how much i can enjoy our time together it doesn't make it any less heartbreaking watching him slowly slip away.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/95orl9/how_to_deal_with_the_sad/,How to deal with the sad?
"hi all,my grandfather is 77 and about a year into his alzheimer’s diagnosis. he has probably had it for 6 years now. he lives alone in an apartment but someone goes to check on him everyday. i seem to be his “it” person but lately he’s having problems with his e reader and i told him i just got into audiobooks and so he thinks he’d really like that so has anyone tried to do audiobooks, how did they listen, what was the experience like?  i know my local library has listeners you can loan out but i’m just not sure the right way to go about this?"," hi. if you're grandfather has access, lots of sites have free audio books to listen to direct or download. like the op said, choosing and listening to a book is a different experience to reading one. i used a device with my dad that was designed for folks with blindness but which could be a simpler tech re the alzheimer's. hopeyou're grandfather finds something he likes :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/94ys7s/audiobook_advice/,Audiobook advice
"just need to rant, but if anyone has suggestions feel free to comment. mom has been in assisted living for 18 months and is showing a steady decline. even though we have upgraded her care level the caregivers can't seem to get her bathed properly. i see mom about every 2 weeks, and it looks like her hair has never been washed. this morning i insisted that she take a shower and wash your own hair. i'm waiting for her to get out of the bathroom to see the results. she will not do this on her own, of course.my brother and i have talked to the directors, the nurses, and the aides, and we still can't get results. no one seems to take responsibility. i've been looking at a memory care-specific facility for mom, but my brother is hesitant to move her, not wanting to disrupt her routine.am i making too big a deal about the hair thing? i'm also unhappy about her lack of participation in any activities. she is getting fat and is not moving well. all she does is watch tv and go to meals. even then, it's a struggle to get her to go to meals, so they bring them to her room.thanks for listening."," i'm not really sure how assisted living/memory care work where you live, or where your mother is at in terms of her cognition, but here's my experience with al where my mom lives (canada). the wellness team (or whatever they call the care bit where your mom is) should be working with you on this stuff. 'thriving' should be the goal of care and socialising, exercise and actively engaging in life where she lives (including activities and coming down for meals!) are central parts of that. if that's not there as a bare minimum, then i would seriously consider looking at a different al option instead of memory care.of course every place will have its limits in terms of the individual help and attention they can give, but they should be transparent and clear with you about what those are, and how you can help provide your mom more support. i use an outside care agency who come in three times a week to do stuff with my mom that her facility just isn't set up for (i live in a different city, so they take her to appointments, shopping, make sure her clothes are clean and sorted, etc) i don't know what your mom's cognition is like, but if she's still capable of coming down for meals on her own with prompting and encouragement, bathing when she's prompted, continent and doesn't have any anti-social behaviour issues, then i would take a good hard look at memory care before you take that route. again, things may be different where you are, but if your mother still has the ability to socialise and find meaning and joy in activities, then memory care will be hard because the cognition level of clients there is quite low and care is focused on far more basic things (help with eating, bathing and behaviour). it's also about 50% more expensive (money you could be spending on 1 on 1 care in al). everyone's experience with the disease is different, as are the options and resources available. but for my mom, i've decided to spend more money now making sure she can enjoy life, and will be putting her in a much more basic public facility when she's ready for the next stage of care. the savings then will fund more one on one care from the outside so that she at least has someone focusing on just her every day.

"so my grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimer’s about 2 years ago. after she was diagnosed we hired help for her in our native country, not professionals but extended family that wouldn’t mind making a few dollars. we ended up running into a lot of problems with the people taking care of her and decided to bring here to the us where my whole family is with the idea that we would try to balance her care between all of us. weeks in and all of my aunts suddenly can’t take care of her, don’t have money, don’t want anything to do with her. and all of my grandmothers care is falling into my mother and i. i just don’t really know what to do anymore. they won’t help and every time we try to bring up the subject about her care they get defensive and aggressive. i’m thinking of selling my grandmas house and using the money to take care of her. but i don’t think that’s a long term solution. is there a way i can take legal action against them? or what else can i do? i’m 25 and i feel like i can’t even have my own life because i’m taking care of my grandma with my mother.", this is hard work to do and if you need to sell your grandmothers' property to help make sure she is cared for then i say do it. there is no way to force the children to take a part in looking after a parent. and not selling the house so there is a financial legacy would be hard for me to accept if it meant a miserable life for your grandmother and your mother. that money should be spent for her.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/938y1y/grandmother_with_alzheimers_out_of_4_children/,Grandmother with alzheimers out of 4 children only my mother will help

"my father is 72 and lives at home with me. over the last 7 years, i've noticed more and more loss of short term memory. he knews of my concerns and, despite my many conversations with him, he opted not to do anything about it. two years ago, he had an issue with his heart and opted to go to the doctor for the first time in my life. my older sister flew across the country to start the process of taking him to doctors including heart, removal of skin tumors, a sleep study, and a brain scan. he refused to let me or my sister go with him to the appointment for the neuro and wouldn't even tell us where or when the appointment was. he came home one day and said, ""they didn't find anything!"" and ended it at that. unfortunately, that didn't stop the symptoms or progression. i've tried again and again to find out where the appointment was so i could communicate with the doctor about my concerns but alas, two years and no where. my dad already lives with me because of financial need on his part and, aside from a distant sister across the country, his care falls on me. i'm feeling the emotional burden of this. i know i'm not supposed to get frustrated with him. i know it's not something i'm supposed to bring to his attention when he repeats the same question six times in a row. but i can't sit on my hands about the progression when i'm already so alone in this. in order to get him to a new neuro again and try and have more communication, i have to convince him somehow to go to a gp (which he doesn't have and already refuses to do), make every appointment behind his back, and take his medical privacy rights away without legal means (yet?). at at a loss. i'm feeling it. i'm 29 and have 72 year old father that's deteriorating before my eyes. i don't have anyone to share the burden with or who can even relate. he can still take care of himself, but i'm waiting for the day i get a call from the police because he wandered and got lost. at this point, i don't get concerned about this...but it's worse case scenario that i think about. i guess i don't necessarily have a question. i just needed to talk to someone who understands."," have you discussed any type of legal planning with him? does he have a will, a living will, power of attorney? check this link for information: perhaps a discussion about his wishes moving forward will help him to understand the burdens you, as the caretaker, might be faced with in the future. he needs to understand that this disease doesn't just affect him, it affects you directly as well. having a durable power of attorney will also be crucial in the event you do need to take matters into your own hands and make medical appointments and decisions for him.as others have mentioned, though, the alzheimer's association website is an amazing resource, so definitely check it out. hang tough!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/928f97/undiagnosed_father_with_no_diagnosis_in_sight/,Undiagnosed Father with no diagnosis in sight

"i need advice from somebody else who has dealt with this.so, my mother (60yrs) has alzheimer's and lewy body dementia. being early onset and having two types, it's fairly aggressive and she's quickly losing her mobility- which leads to the problem. my mother lives in a two story house and her bedroom is on the top storey. her partner has become her full time carer who helps her up and down the stairs, but it's only a matter of time before she tries the stairs herself and hurts herself. so, at some point soon in the future me and my sister (both with enduring power of attorney) will need to solve this two storey issue. but that means either moving her, or finding some way of building a bedroom downstairs and fitting a shower.**anxiety**my mum suffers from extreme anxiety. she was always anxious, but having dementia, especially the lewy body's means that almost anything (or nothing for that matter) can send her into a panic. so, any change in circumstance ***will*** really impact her. **to move her:**the case for moving her is pretty strong. it's only a matter of time before we have to, but while she's in her old house, he at least has something to hold onto. my sister and i are seriously worried that moving her out of her house while she's still aware could irreparably break her. without the familiarity of location we're genuinely worried about setting her into a spiral of anxiety that she won't recover from. the other consideration is that her partner is her primary carer, so we need to consider him too.**to change the house:**apart from the expense, (which would be considerable; both to the house price and to implement), we're worried about creating a situation where she won't feel comfortable having people around anymore. my parents split when we were young and mum built a life by herself - so she's very proud of our house. having a bed downstairs changes it from our house into a 'dementia house' in her eyes. we're seriously worried about the impact of that, especially around socialisation. that said, the cost is also a problem. mum was diagnosed three years ago, which gives her between two and five years or maybe even longer for her types of dementia. so we just need to make sure we can make the money last comfortably as well. **so, any advice from someone who's been in this position?**what did you do? any lessons you wish you'd learned sooner? any advice? i'm worried that no matter what we do, we could lose her to anxiety for good."," not quite in the same boat, as my dad is still quite physically mobile, but, his mother is in her late 90s and can't get around as well, so she has a bedside commode, a height extender on the toilet, and my uncles built a little ramp to get her up the one step to the bathroom. my aunt helps her bathe once or twice a week, and she gets her hair washed and set at the beauty school every week or two, which is really helpful.if your mother is worried about having her bed being in the living room or dining room looking inelegant, maybe try a graceful daybed? you wouldn't necessarily have to do a full remodel, just some redecorating and rearranging.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8z6841/advice_needed_should_i_move_mum_out_of_her_two/,Advice needed: Should I move Mum out of her two storey house?
"i am generally happy with my mom’s neuro. after a series of doctors he actually diagnosed her for which i am eternally grateful. he has an academic appointment out of a major research institution and is well versed in the current literature. he’s published. he’s pleasant to my mother and helped to get her anxiety semi-under control with meds. background/concerns1.) while her neuro has worked out of the same research institution for years, his satellite offices (where my mom sees him) have changed multiple times over the past decade. this happened again in june. 2.) this transition has been “bumpy” in terms of communication with the new support staff and information seems very confused.  i tried to reschedule my mom’s appt. and get her meds filled and was met with outright hostility, their refusal to call my cell phone, and the statement from staff that “dr. x has never even heard of your mom so i don’t know where you got his name from.” charming, instills a lot of confidence in the doctor and the administration of his office. her appointment at the new place is tuesday, so i’m going to try to feel the place out in person. but i’m going there with a lot of skepticism. 3.) i’m not sure we are getting much out of office visits. his nurse (who i don’t think transitioned to the new office) did a brief cognitive evaluation of my mom over year ago at her first appointment, but that was the first and only time. during office visits the doctor asks about her anxiety and if she is having bathroom accidents but that’s about it. he also doesn’t speak to me separately, so i am not free to fully express what’s going on because it upsets my mom. 4.) i don’t feel like the doctor and i are on the same page with the meds. he hasn’t upped my mom’s anxiety meds in 9 months because he wants her to be on alzheimer’s meds which he says will help with her mood. unfortunately the aricept made her psychotic and the insurance won’t cover the memantine. i actually give zero shits about her being on alzheimer’s meds: their effectiveness particularly out of the early stages are “meh” at best, her neuro actually published an article stating just this, and i don’t understand the point of extending her misery (and ours). i honestly just want her distress alleviated through palliative care. questions: 1.) is a neurologist necessary or even advantageous once the disease has been diagnosed? 2.) if they are necessary, what should an office visit with a neuro look like? what should we be getting out of it in terms of information and treatment?3.) if they are not necessary who should i take her to in order to manage her psychiatric issues? a geriatrician? a psychiatrist? her gp?"," update: so, funny story. tried to take my mom to new office for appt. today. problem was, the main university line set up the appt at new office but would only give me address, not the phone number.  they also refuse to call my cell phone (today marks the 6th futile request for them to do so). when i plugged the address for the new office they’d given me into my gps it took me to a funeral home. i pulled over and looked online to see if i had the address wrong. his website still has old information and only thing i could find was an insurance site that gave the same address i had. when you click the link on the “get directions” button on that site it also directs you to the funeral home. all rather macabre. it was massively frustrating that i didn’t have a number where i could reach the office. so i called home and of course they had called there instead of my cell. my father *again* gave them my cell phone number. they said that they would call me immediately. they never did. after an hour and a half of aimless searching, i went home. after yet more googling i think i figured out where his office is. the address they gave me omits the name of the (well known) medical complex it is in.  you need the name and number of the complex because there are technically 2 places with that same highway number address (in the same town), the complex information is what distinguishes between the two for the gps, the post office, and for everyone who knows the area.  the levels of incompetence are just astounding at this point. it just didn’t need to be like this and i’m sure i’ll get charged for a no-show.

"my mom has alzheimers and i’m her only support system. growing up it was just the two of us, and though we love each other dearly we fought like cats and dogs. she had mental health issues that manifested in a lot of very aggressive, controlling, and manipulative behavior. we’ve always been close, but we’ve never been friends. she controlled what i ate, what i wore, how i looked, who i was friends with - she even picked my courses in college and checked my grades. i was pushed extremely hard - to the point of addiction, and she had a terrifying temper. i was too fat (i’m 5’9 and weigh 125 pounds), an underachiever (i worked in biotech), and a litany of other things that aren’t worth going into. point being: she was difficult. she wasn’t a monster, she did the best she could and i had a great life. however, i do have some residual feelings of resentment. i wish i didn’t, but they’re there.after she got sick, i realized i’d need to be able to afford her care, so i quit my job and went to a top tier law school. i sold her house and moved her into a fancy memory care facility. i moved back into the area to be close to her. on paper, i did all the right things. but in our day-to-day interactions, i lose my patience more easily than i should and snap back at her too quickly. after 26 years of conditioning, i’m finding it really hard to let go of everything i grew up with. i feel so much guilt for not being better at this, and am constantly promising myself i’m going to do better - but then she calls and berates me for something and i snap immediately back into defensive. it’s just so deeply ingrained. and as her disease worsens, the already horrible mood swings and depression/anxiety she’s been burdened with her whole life grow worse and worse. i don’t actually fight with her, but i’m cold and distant. i know she can’t help it and i know she’s suffering, and it kills me that i’m letting her down emotionally. i want to be better at letting go of our past and not letting her trigger that part of me that immediately shuts down, but i’m failing. i’m failing myself and more importantly i’m failing her. i don’t want to look back and hate myself for allowing my immaturity to ruin the last years we have together. any advice on how to get through this, or how to be better at it?", i'm in a similar situation -- so similar it's spooky! and i will repeat what other commenters have said. i think you're doing a great job. not a perfect job -- none of us do that -- but a great job. keep going.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8t3b8i/advice_for_how_to_overcome_a_rocky_past_to_better/,Advice for how to overcome a rocky past to better care for a parent with Az?

"my mom died of dementia.  unless an autopsy is done there's no way to determine whether the dementia was alzheimers or not but in any case, what causes dementia, alzheimers or not, is a build up of beta-amyloid protein deposits along with fibrous tangles, also of protein, which inhibit neuron communication.  just out of the blue, in listening to a video related to another subject, mention was made by stamets of the ability of lion's mane mushroom  to dissolve the plaques and restore normal brain function.  what?  looking into it further, i found there is a lot of information on the subject on the internet, much of it also by stamets and others involved with the studies.  naturally the ama and fda don't know anything about it so don't go trying to get your doctors to verify or confirm anything - they haven't a clue.  do your own research.  there's plenty of information from reliable sources.  make your own decisions based on whether the information makes sense to you, but dig into it.  it just might make all the difference in the world.  had i known any of this while my mom was going downhill you can bet i would have put her on these natural remedies.  as it was, i did the best i could to see that she spent her last year or two of dementia-related strokes in her own home, in her own bed, with her cats and familiar surroundings.  private nurses.  she was 85 so she had a full life but it's a bit depressing to now know i might have been able to turn the situation around.  before the strokes started, her behavior had been very dementia related relating to her financial and personal decisions.  if i had known any of this new information, i would not have hesitated to give it a try.  this is the video where i first came across the information but there are other videos devoted entirely to the subject and with more detail.  in this video it is only mentioned about two-thirds of the way through.  it's a starting point for you.  forget the ""fda and ama approved"" studies and medications, none of which get anyone anywhere.those who have the intelligence and willingness to consider new information, take note.  it just might turn an ordeal into a relatively happy ending."," here's a link to a study, now two years old, that was done at salk institute.  i found the results to be counter intuitive since we all suspect pot to cause people to sometimes act as if they're brain damaged.  so all the more surprising to find out thc to be neuroprotective.

"hello everyone,(cross-posted this in the dementia sub)(first of all i want to give everyone who frequents these forums a big virtual hug, god knows we all need it. sometimes it's hard to feel like we're not alone… then i remember all the heart wrenching and occasionally heartwarming stories i read here. stay strong, friends. there are more if us than you know)i have a situation i hope maybe some of you have some experience in.i live in pa and am the durable power of attorney for my grandmother with alzheimer's. she is currently in a nice nursing facility which we pay for from her savings and social security. the bill is roughly $5,700 a month.  unfortunately, her money will not last forever… and this facility does not accept medicaid (which she will need when her money runs out).i have investigated a few local(ish) care facilities that do accept medicaid for a limited number of rooms/beds. i want my grandmother to eventually go to a place i know is reputable and that is not always the case with places that accept medicaid. there are 2 local places that i think look good, and of course both have waiting lists that depend on availability and when you applied (in theory, please keep reading).  i have applications in at these two places as of yesterday.i was told by a lawyer and a local senior care representative that sometimes it is easier to transition to medicaid if i have my grandmother placed in a medicaid-accepting facility as a ""self pay"" first for a number of months, then have the people at the facility who deal with medicaid help me get her enrolled in the program as her money dwindles.  my grandmother has about 61k left in the bank, and at the prices these places charge that will of course not last long. i know i am going to need facilitation with the medicaid process because i have already dug through 5 years' worth of her financial documents and her spending is extremely complicated. not ""bad"" or ""wrong"" but there are several things that will require explaining (my mother had been taking care of her at home for several years and paying additional aides/off duty nurses with cash) and i want to limit that as much as possible. the less they ask for (in terms of years) the better. it's a nightmare of paperwork. i was also told that although these care facilities are supposed to accept new applicants in terms of when they applied for the ""waiting list""… they will actually accept individuals with ""self pay"" money still available first (even though that is not how it's supposed to work). i guess they do this because with self-pay funds available there is a guaranteed income source for them, instead of just having to deal with medicaid to start. does anyone have any experience with this? it makes me extremely anxious. is it easier to transition to medicaid if you are *already* a resident of a facility that accepts medicaid? if for some reason i get her in to one of these places as a ""self pay"" and then for some reason she is denied medicaid, will they just kick her out? i don't have the money, space, or ability to care for her myself at home and my mother no longer can either (she suffers from ptsd and caring for my grandmother almost killer her the last time… we had to have an intervention).thank you all so much for any help or advice, it is immensely appreciated."," short answer: call facilities that accept private pay and medicaid and transfer her. 60 days out from when the money runs out apply for medicaid. that is what i would do. long answer: i can’t speak to pa, but i can speak to working in virginia. in virginia yes, if someone needs nursing home level of care and lives at a place that accepts medicaid, when the private pay runs out the nursing home will help apply for medicaid. they can then stay at that facility.speaking to your situation it would be better to transfer her to a place that accepts medicaid in the future. she can pay down and then when you are about 60 days out from running our of money, apply for long term care medicaid. it’s called long term care medicaid in va, i don’t know if that is what it is called in pa.technically a facility cannot discharge someone back home if it is unsafe or if money runs out.it may be helpful for you to call adult services or adult protective services in your area to find out if they have lists of nursing homes or could help you navigate this process.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8s9r0s/medicaid_trials_and_tribulations/,Medicaid Trials and Tribulations

"i just found out about this sub tonight. basically, i'm wondering if there's some sort of underlying reason for my dad's recent behaviour and how, or if, we can help him.as background, my father first began exhibiting symptoms of dementia around six or seven years ago. he refused to seek medical treatment despite our strong urging. our local physicians have only been aware of his condition for the past year.i moved back home to our small town after finishing school to help my mother and him. the three of us live in our family home, which we've owned for decades.in the past few weeks, dad has been waking up in the middle of the night - typically around 2 or 3 in the morning - and making loud noises, waking up the rest of the house. when asked what he's doing, he says he's going home. (he says this while standing in the bedroom where he's slept for the past 20+ years in the home he owns.)last night, he wandered out of the house and spent the rest of the night walking around town - we went searching for him and only found him at about 6 a.m.it's the third time in the last four nights that he's done this.in the evenings, he sundowns quite badly. he keeps asking, ""are we going home tomorrow?"" or ""where are we right now?"" or ""where are we going to sleep?""when we answer the question, he gets visibly agitated - he's so convinced that he's not at home that he swears and shouts and us when we try to explain, or when we ask him questions about why he thinks he's somewhere else or where he thinks he is.the three of us are getting maybe an hour of sleep a night if we're lucky. it's starting to affect my mother and i at our work - i've been unable to finish all my work and my bosses are breathing down my neck.we have looked into getting respite workers to come in and help take care of him, but they are simply not available where we live.we've got no idea what to do next. where to we go from here?"," you and your mom should both file fmla ( family medical leave act) with your dad's physician and your job. with that behind you, neither you or your mom will have to worry about your job while caring for your dad. it's a pretty simple thing, i found the forms on my jobs hr section, printed them out, filled them out, faxed them to my dad's dr and faxed the completed  forms to hr. apply for the max amount of hours you think you may need, that way, even if you don't use them all, you have them if you do. i've been just recently dealing with my dad's alzheimer's, so i've got loads of questions too. please feel free to message me if i can help in any way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8p73lm/my_dad_is_trying_to_leave_our_house_during_the/,My dad is trying to leave our house during the wee hours of the morning - how can we help him/get him to stop?
"need advice:my dad has alzheimer’s and i’m being appointed conservator and guardian.he is my brother’s landlord. according to my brother, in 2008 he promised that if my brother and his family continued to pay rent (which covers the mortgage) to live in the farmhouse, that one day my brother will inherit the farm and can then take over the mortgage he’s been paying down. dad and brother have no contract. two years ago, i asked my brother to please go to mediation with my dad to come out with a legally binding contract showing they both are on the deed to the house and he said “it’s none of your concern.” in 2016 my dad refinanced the farm without my brother’s consent, essentially taking away the eight years of mortgage payments my brother has been paying on the farm. so awful.fast forward to now. we are about to begin the medicaid spend down, and my brother will lose the farm because he has no contract. this will put my brother at $0, as if he’s never paid a dime toward the mortgage, or any other investment during this time.is there any scenario where my brother keeps the farm without paying market value for it?"," personalfinance is gonna be a shit show, try /r/legaladvice but i suspect they're gonna tell you to find a local lawyer to settle it. quite frankly, sounds like brother is sol without any sort of documentation though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8p6fjr/alzheimers_and_real_estate/,Alzheimer’s and real estate
"my grandmother has been living undiagnosed with dementia for about 3 years now. she refuses to believe shes losing her touch and i am her 34 year old grandson who lives with her and is basically a caretaker because she forgets to eat and take her medication other than that shes fairly independent with basic needs except her stubborn pride. today i had a blow up, she is forgetting one minute to the next, she thinks im belittling her by constantly having to correct her even though im simply stating ""you forget we just talked about this few mins ago"" and in her mind im making it up, she doesn't believe she was just told something or that something has just been explained and its gotten to the point where she now sees me as a bully, a bad person who isnt to be trusted. now the awful part is im going at this alone, her daughters arent interested in trying to help me, or her!! they are in denial as well because they say ""she acts just fine around me"" but they do not see the day to day, hour by hour changes that she goes through and now suddenly im the bad guy!! im afraid to say im gonna have to move out and give her up to herself or simply let her live alone for awhile. she has fallen 3x in one year, she will take her meds over and over forgetting she already took them, but ive gone and done all i can!!! i feel like once im gone, she will hate me for leaving, but if i stay she will hate me anyway so im at a loss....please tell me im not alone in this, can someone relate?"," my mom was that way. yelled at my dad when she misplaced things, accused him of lying, etc.things came to a head eventually. they were renting a house in central oregon and her car was usually parked under a tree. birds would sit in the tree and crap on her car. she got upset about it one day (when my dad refused to cut the tree down), grabbed the dog, and took off in the car to drive “home.”24 hours later, we get a call from a fire department in a little town in the forested area of northeast california. her car had ended up in a ditch and she got out with the dog and was walking around looking for my dad and i in the snow (it was august and no snow). if the fire department had not bumped their training day up, it is very likely she would gave wandered off away from the forest, into the high desert area (i think that’s what it was; no trees or anything) and we would likely have never found her.after that we tried everything to get her to a doctor. we were finally able to once my dad agreed to not be honest and tell her, but rather lie and say we were going to lunch and then to his appointment.it’s been a rough road. her new med has stopped her from hitting, scratching, and throwing things at him though (literally a miracle drug). after reading multiple books on the subject and the articles on alz.org, the best thing to do is don’t fight her on things unless it is an immediate danger, lie to her if necessary, and play into her delusions if it keeps her safe and happy. no one gets out of the disease alive, so don’t add stress to the situation.good luck! 🍀 ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8oouw4/grandma_is_in_denial/,Grandma is in denial
"tldr: after watching my paternal grandfather go through alzheimer's for fifteen years until he passed, my father is now showing signs he's developing it too, and i feel like i can't go through it again, especially now that i'm expecting my first child. am i terrible for resolving to minimal contact?background: i was raised by my dad and his parents. when i was 10, i noticed grandpa couldn't remember little things like the words to a short hymn we sang every week at church. ten years later, he began becoming paranoid (terrorists were going to storm our local beach). a few years later, we were not allowed to leave lights on at night because prowlers were hiding outside; he became physically violent and put under protective police care several times. i moved out at 23 after he struck me while i was trying to convince him there was no one outside. i did not think of his problems as a disease; i just thought he was an asshole. my grandparents refused to move into assisted living, and my dad, siblings, and i felt helpless beyond trying to take care of them and keep a relative peace. he wandered, driving, once into a tropical storm. my grandma, blind and oxygen dependent, lived in terror until she passed. his paranoia, violence, and abusive outbursts were too much. eventually it became too much and he was finally moved into a nursing home. he lost nearly all his mobility and speech, but returned to the loving giant who i had known as a child before he passed about five years ago.now: i'm noticing my dad starting to behave similarly. he is very combative and emotional. his facebook posts are hateful, paranoid, and deeply passive aggressive. he replies to posts in bizzare and totally inappropriate ways.  his messages to me verge on word salad, dependant on very old family jokes or the thinnest shred of logic. i keep in touch solely through his girlfriend, who is very sweet and polite. neither have mentioned any kind of diagnosis, but i know what i'm seeing again and i feel like i can't go through it again. if i hadn't literally watched his dad go through the same decline, i'd also  just assume he was being an asshole as many of my friends do. but i know what his behaviors are adding up to and i simply cannot do this again. though he lives only a dozen miles away, i haven't seen him in person in almost two years. i've all but unfriended him on facebook (unfollowed him and i hide all my posts). my siblings have just as little contact with him as well for similar reasons.another complication is that i'm now pregnant with his first grandchild due in september. he knows we're expecting a boy and when, but i only message him with need-to-know information in the most sterile and polite manner i can muster. his replies are overwhelmingly emotional as well as nearly nonsensical. i feel like i cannot invite him to the baby shower, birth, or to our home after baby is born because he will act out, and i know i will need to focus on my husband and son during that time. he has always loved babies, but i don't know if i can trust him to conduct himself appropriately around me or my husband that won't result in an altercation. i'm sorry for the long post, but i authentically appreciate any who might read this and offer kind words. thank you."," hi, i am late to this party - in part because i was ordered with no notice to fly across the country to leave my husband and go stay with my mom indefinitely (for the third time in two years) who has alzheimers at the time you were writing this. i'm back home now, because i've had it. everyone's plan for the remainder of my life seems to be that i will permanently leave my husband to be an unpaid unqualified 24/7 in home health care worker. i had a rather stern talking to on another forum about setting boundaries that was super helpful. the gist of it was that i can't allow my life to just end now - being forced into servitude for a decade (or more?) which will carry me through to just about the time i may start showing signs of alzheimers myself. to be honest, that plan for the rest of my years was making me feel suicidal.at the moment i'm still spending several hours a day coordinating phone calls and it's still completely disrupting my life. i want to go for a bike ride today to the store for example, but i can't because i'm waiting on a call from a nurse, and depending on that call's outcome, i need to call another person, and depending on that, rearrange hours that in home assistance is hired, and then report that back to my dad who is currently in the hospital - he and i are acting like puppeteers from a distance. that sounds whiny, but i have a surgical procedure tomorrow and can only eat jello, and only have one box - so 320 calories to get me through the day unless i get the callbacks all done. so i get where you are coming from. without judgment. i'm hopeful though that as i get more care options set up and the kinks worked out, that level of intervention will be reduced. my suggestion is to try to work with your siblings to set up the care he needs, but not provide it directly yourselves at this point if it's going to cause mental health problems for yourselves (depression, stress that causes physical medical problems, stress that affects your marriage or family relationships - and it sounds like all of that is a distinct possibility). what i'm working through with my mom is that there are three types of care she needs at this point. independent living in a retirement community that provides on site transportation needs, a health clinic i can contact as needed, and meals in a dining hall - with an option to upgrade to assisted living and/or memory care when the time comes. additional non medical assistance for a few hours a day that functions as a personal assistant - shopping, help making phone calls, feeding pets, cleaning. that's covered under a long term health care insurance policy they had. and some in home health care visits for things like ensuring she's taking her medication (she isn't), and when the time comes, help with bathing. that's covered by medicare - but only after the referral from a doctor goes through. we started that process last week. somewhere in there is the possibility that she will refuse the options she needs. that doesn't mean i need to move in with her. the referral for home health care through medicare includes assessments that go back to her primary care physician, and if she needs to be ruled mentally incompetent to make her own decisions, my understanding is that's how that process gets rolling. you may be able to talk with your dad's girlfriend to see if your dad has a will and final care documents that spell out who he wants to have power of attorney for if he has a medical crisis down the road that requires someone to make decisions on his behalf. one final thing - knowing that my family has a history of alzheimers, and knowing that there is the enormous societal guilt on the children to become full time care takers for the parents (you can see that in this thread), i had to think about what i want if and when it happens to me. the assumption in many of these posts is that we all want our children to stop their lives to become our care takers. that's not the life i want to condemn my child to, though. when i got back from this last trip, i called her and talked through all of what i typed out here, and told her it's fine to put me in assisted living, or whatever level of care i need, and i want her to do that guilt free. i emphasized that a bunch of times. i am going to continue to emphasize that to her through the years. partly i want to make sure my parents' needs are covered, but equally important is ensuring my kid's needs are covered, and this ongoing conversation, while i'm still able to have it, is part of making sure she can have a fulfilling life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8o3kwb/i_cant_handle_doing_it_again/,I can't handle doing it again...

(i think it might be frontotemporal dementia). his urine also has a very strong smell. i'm not even sure what it is. paint? it's really odd. i've been reading about the urine tests that can potentially detect alzheimers (i believe) at an early stage urine tests.has anyone done this? if so, how did you get your loved one to do the urine test? i know my dad would say no if he knew it revolved around dementia and/or alzheimers.thank you!"," i’ve never heard of a urine test that is currently approved for alzheimer’s. what can make urine smell, be discolored and cause confusion is a urinary  tract infection.  it can often present without the usual symptoms and just presents with confusion/fatigue.

"i saw a report on here \(which i now can't find\) describing how areas of the brain tied to processing music are not affected by alzheimer's.does anyone here have experience playing music \(specifically, music you know they enjoyed from their younger days\) for a patient with alzheimer's? do the patients remember things associated with the music? for example, if their favorite song is from 1984, and their child was born in 1984 but forgot their daughters name...what if they're asked to name their daughter while the music is playing? i'm sure it's not a black and white answer, but scents and sounds remind people of things forever, whether positive or negative, and really wondered how this affects those with alzheimer's.i realize the study named most things inconclusive as this is a huge field of research, but music lights people up in so many different ways and just was curious regarding anecdotal evidence."," check out *awakenings* and *musicophilia* by oliver sacks. *musicophelia* talks more about alzheimer's and other neurological disorders while *awakenings* describes patients with a particular disease, but they both offer fascinating insights into music and what it can do for the brain while keeping the focus on the patients as people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8ltvo8/do_alzheimers_patients_remember_more_when_asked/,Do Alzheimer's patients remember more when asked questions while music from their past is played?
"my mom has always been the best. so fun and kind my entire life. as of the past 10 yrs, she has been changing. shes now 70 and calls me and my sister in occasion to tell us these stories about my dad. they are still married and live together, however in different bedrooms. she thinks: 1. he’s putting something in her water and food to make her feel sick. 2. he spreads rumors about her to total strangers wherever they might go and they look at her strangely. 3. he has all the money and his cell phone and has hired someone to spread lies about her. 4. she schedules psychological appointments for my dad because she is fully convinced he has a mental illness but she is fine. 5. she has seen 3 psychologists but quit going to them because they were “unethical” and had received info from my dad. she goes back and forth with her drinking and my dad has become an alcoholic because of the constant accusations. ?????what is going on here? next steps?any advice would be very appreciated.", thank you!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8lrx4t/does_my_mom_have_alzheimers/,Does my Mom have Alzheimers?

i was looking around at my dad's pills because i like to know how meds work. so i found this pill called memantine and it turns out it's for people diagnosed with moderate to severe alzheimer's. my dad's aunt had it so i'm guessing it's possible he might have it too. i was just wondering if memantine is used as a preventive method against alzheimer's as he is prone to having it because of his aunt.. (?) or maybe memantine has several uses? or maybe he has already been diagnosed and haven't told me? i'm freaking out. he forgets things but he's always been a distracted person so i can't really tell if there's been any difference lately in him. i want to ask him but i want to be a little more informed first. thank you. ," for alzheimer’s, mementine was prescribed to augment donepezil.  it’s not a first round medicine.  they didn’t start my dad on it until the donepezil needed a boost.  and yes. you would know.  it sneaks up on the people who don’t know the person well.  the people who didn’t know my dad before my mom passed still think he’s just your run of the mill forgetful older man.  those who knew him before knew right around when we started seeing signs.

"my mother has early onset alzheimers/ dementia. she's most likely had it for the last 10 years or so but in the last 5 years is when it has been diagnosed and really started to progress. recently we had to call an ambulance for her because it had just gotten to be to much for my brother whom she lives with. things she was doing at home: wandering, banging on the walls and knocking on doors, very scared to be alone follows you from room to room even if you only leave for a second, needs help showering, doesn't wipe properly when using the bathroom, refuses to sleep and disrupts the sleep of others. my brother has a mental illness of his own and could no longer take care of her and it's just not possible for me or any other family members to. she has no short term memory. she gets very argumentative and obsessive about the smallest of things. she refuses to believe that she is sick .she has been in the regular hospital for two weeks, it's not a specialized ward for people with her condition. she stays on the oncology/ hospice floor. they have her here until they can find her placement in a nursing facility. at the hospital it has gotten even worse. she is constantly drugged up. she bites, kicks, punches, tackles the nurses and the one to one supervisors. she's become incontinent, doesn't want to eat, doesn't want to shower. she paces all day and wants to walk in circles on the hospital floor. she will not sleep even if she is tired, refuses to sit down even when she's complaining her feet hurt. she doesn't have enough concentration to watch a tv show, read, do a word search nothing. she constantly murmurs to herself and confabulates and talks nonsensically. all of this stuff is worse when she's drugged but when she's not drugged she gets aggressive agitated and violent. she can't recognize the toilet when it's right in front of her.they are giving her gabapentin and vyvanse. they are giving her haldol in pill form or in shots when she is very agitated. they cannot get her in to a nursing home because she requires constant supervision because she is unsafe.i am at my wit's end, has anyone else experienced this? does anyone have any advice about treatment/medications? is it the hospital making her sicker or is it just the alzheimers? sorry if all of this is nonsensical, i'm just typing and venting.", does she have an official diagnosis? i only ask because her symptoms sound a lot like lewy body dementia. if it is indeed lewy body dementia medicine like haldol can make the symptoms worse instead of better.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8kxspl/venting_in_need_of_advice_mother_60_early_onset/,"Venting/ in need of advice.

"i have been noticing... that it perhaps gets worse at night/late afternoon.i first started noticing memory issues in 2016. just with telling me stories she has retold before. - 65 years old- she didn't know how to spell a word in scrabble, i forget which one. but it was on the easy side.- mixing names with a piano teacher and another music teacher. - she tells stories/events over. not in the same day though. she says it has to do with telling her friends too, and forgetting who she told what to- once forgot wallet/sunglasses at a grocery store. the lady at the till had to remind her. (happened twice, once with another object left behind)- she's good with long-term memory. things that happened in the past. not so much of the more recent events.- her memory loss seems to be on a very slight decline since i last seen her. (last year, in person)i'm unsure if it's old age memory loss, or first symptoms of alzheimer's.sorry for the small amount of text... but i really need an answer. i talked to her about my fears and worries with her memory loss.i have also talked to her best friend. we both agree that her memory is not too good."," caveat: i am not a doctor, but i am a researcher studying alzheimer’s and related diseases. at this stage her memory impairments sound mild enough that it’s hard to say for sure whether it’s alzheimer’s or normal aging. i wouldn’t worry about it too much. if you notice more severe issues that interfere with her daily life such as getting lost on familiar routes, frequently misplacing important objects, etc. that may be the time to see a doctor.

"after living with us 4 over 7 years,my father-in-law is finally getting ready to make the move. we are getting ready also. if you are reading this then you know the struggles. in our case we had much support in the form of outside help. home health care people that would take dad out for daily rides and walks of the mall and local parks.  they added to our life and his. visits. you also know the slow steady progression,how every now and then another function disappears, the blank look, the need for more and more help to get through the day whether it's walking, eating  or dressing.dad was on the waiting list for over a year-and-a-half and then a few weeks ago a room opened up and we began the process. the staff, especially the greeting administrators seem to have a wonderful compassion for their charges. the intiall introduction was  when a  young lady paid special attention to him as he first entered the facility. we walked the long hallway to the memory care unit and when we sat down i asked him if he wanted some water he said yes she got it when she gave it to him he said thank you. they conversed, she asked many questions and stooped ro eye level or lower trying to get responses from him. he would respond finally at one point she indicated that she thought she was ""falling in love "" and that she had a new best friend. as we left the unit another client was rolled in on a bed, pretty much totally unresponsive and yet awake. we made our way back outside and while i went to get the car, the young lady continued to interact with dad. we finally got into the car after a struggle that has definitely deteriorated  in just the last few weeks. as soon as the door was shut and i proceeded to drive away he said "" she really wants me""  at 92, with  end stage alzheimers.one of the saddest parts was walking from the parking lot up to the facility carrying dads clothing in a plastic trash bag . it's come down to tha,t struggling to walk step-by-step, inch-by-inch, literally, into the facility where his final days will be spent."," i know this very well, we moved my dad to a facility about a year and a half ago. at first i was just so happy my mom would finally get the break she deserved and it was a positive experience all the way through that walk back to car after we left him there. my entire family just broke down. it gets better, your dad is in a better place with the help he needs. hopefully you’re close enough to be able to visit often. i see my dad every week or two and he still recognizes me for the most part, and even if he doesn’t, he’s still so happy to have the company. it’s a tough situation, but for the best. hope this helps.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8ksbvi/the_move/,The Move
"my mother has been having some memory issues off and on for a couple years, but it's been worse over the last year. within the last six months, it's started significantly impacting her life.we got the news today (after mris, blood tests, cognitive testing, etc.) that it is indeed dementia and that her symptoms are considered ""moderate"" at this point. since she's been having symptoms for some time, this diagnosis is obviously not a complete shock. but of course we are still reeling.any thoughts on what we (my father and i) need to be thinking about/planning for?my parents are both retired and are financially secure. they already work with a cpa/financial planner and have pretty good health insurance. so i'm not so much worried about the financial side of things as i am about not knowing what to expect from the future and what kind of decisions we will need to make in the next couple of years.any advice or shared experiences would be much appreciated!(crossposted from r/dementia, i hope that's ok!)"," i wonder is it possible now though? we looked into getting this drawn up and the solicitors told us that mum couldnt sign it now ( shes in moderate stage too ) as she would not be ""of sound mind"" do you live with or near them? i guess mentally prepare yourself that you might have to help your dad out alot, it's going to be really stressful on him. my dad is amazing to my mum, we love him so much, but i can see it takes its toll on him. so you need  to support him as much as you can. remember to ask him if he is ok too, i know this is happening to your mum, but this is the woman he's spent his life with slipping away from him, (so to speak ) and it can be really tough. my dad has only started to talk about it now in recent months and mum was diagnosed three years ago. personally i made a resolution to make more memories, got a really good camera and i vowed to take more pictures. and cherish every moment. take care of yourself too. at the start i tried to do everything, like i was almost convinced i could reverse it. now i have accepted it and i can enjoy times with her more. and dont forget there is always someone to talk to, even come on here and just out everything you are feeling. everyone here has been through it and knows the feeling. it's good to talk. take care x",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8ka9r2/mother_diagnosed_with_dementia_now_what/,Mother diagnosed with dementia.

"so, mom's in late 70's and has dementia. bro and i took care of her in her own home for about 4 months. it was awful for my family to have me mia several days a week suddenly. i work full time,  have 4 kids -- 3 in hs and 1 started  college, husband works 60+ hours a week,  very busy, so not able to pick up much slack for me at home.  bro has no kids and lives 40 mins away i live 20 mins away.  bro owns mom's house and has high paying paying gig work and lovely, successful wife. bro moved mom into his home to sell her home. he likes arrangement  and mom seems to be doing well. i was not part of planning. i  am  expected to cover 1 or 2 days of weekend. i can't take it. i am fried with my work/family and now my two days off are committed to caretaking or squeezing all housework/parenting into 1 day on weekend. the kicker? mom favored bro and had issues with me (even bro admits she has issues with women but thinks i should overlook this).  bro wants to do caretaking  and i don't think i can do it.  do i have options?"," what types of things do you do on your days off? are there any than can be done with your lo alongside? or at her place with her? watch a tv show, bring over lunch, read to her...?your kids aren't little either... i've raised three myself. at those ages, there really isn't that much intensive hands on parenting to be done! they can spare you a few hours twice a week. unless there is something wrong with them developmentally, they could also take a few hours to entertain their grandmother at their uncles house, right? seems like modeling for your kids that family is important would certainly mean you and kids could spend at least a few hours every weekend during the last few year/months of her life. i know this comes off as guilting you and i don't know anything about you or your family dynamics. however, it seems you already feel guilty and just want strangers here to make you feel better about your decision to not help. if you don't want to help, be a grown up and own that. you may not have had a great relationship with her but it doesn't have to stay that way. do your kids dislike her too? this is a chance to change things if you want to.this is hard and i don't ever fault someone for knowing their own limits. i wish you good luck with whatever you decide to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tnauci/i_am_the_bad_guy/,i am the bad guy

"almost 4 years since her diagnosis, though she surely had it longer.  it was a slow, steady decline until january.  then she got covid and i think that just sped everything up.  she never fully recovered.  in february, she went to the er because she was having seizures.  turns out she had a urinary tract infection that went septic.  spent a few days in the icu, then several more days in a regular hospital bed.  from there to a rehab center, but still bed-ridden and her mind was deteriorating rapidly.  didn't recongize people, thought she was a child at times, and in constant pain.  last week, she was moved into hospice care and was giving straight morphine for the pain, which helped a lot but made her totally spaced out and even more incoherent.  and then yesterday, she passed away.  it's heart breaking, but at least she can finally rest and is no longer in pain."," this happened to my gran , covid in january , rehab center the asst living .. jan-march such a decline .. i suspected uti and i was right .. turned septic thursday went to hospital and died saturday",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tkwgau/moms_gone/,Mom's gone
"i've lurked these boards for years, trying to solve the riddle of what our journey would look like, when it would end, how it would end, what i needed to do to be prepared for everything.  i read the posts from others about their journeys trying to find similarities and trajectories.  there's not as much information out there about vascular dementia progression as there is other dementias, so i'd like to share our experience in the hopes of helping others.  my loved one had vascular issues for years.  she had had heart surgery about a decade ago but was doing well.  she was still able to walk on her own up until a year and a half ago.  i had been helping her for years but noticed in late 2016 - 2017 that she wasn't caring for herself as well as she used to. i talked her into selling her house since i was too far away to come as frequently as she would need. she moved into an assisted living facility.  she didn't like it one bit, but she did it.  that's when things really started to progress.  the moved really highlighted just how bad she had become. her memory was still very good - thankfully that remained in tact for much of the last 5 years.  little things started to go, but people and events stayed.  her dementia seemed to mostly attack her ability to figure out or interpret the world around her. one of the first things i noticed was her having difficulty writing checks.  not remembering bills necessarily, but moreso how to write a check.  letters that she would write started to become more messy. words would be misspelled (she was an impeccable writer and flawless speller) or inverted or used incorrectly.  she also had difficulty using the key to her door.  when we would go shopping, she had difficulty reading the packages and only recognized items she purchased each week.  i admit, these seem like pretty advanced issues, but i didn't notice until i looked back in retrospect what all these things meant.  she was very good at covering, especially in her own home.  while in the assisted living, her disease progressed slowly.  she was able to walk about, go out to the stores and get her hair/nails done, anything she wanted.  she ate with utensils and drank from a cup with zero issues.  she toileted independently and had no incontinence.  her memory remained good.  the main progression i saw during this time was that she started getting rid of everything - she gave away stuff or cut it up or ripped it and threw it out. fidgety type behaviors i guess.  she called friends and family for chats or gripes but the agitation that she expressed at this time did become increasingly worse. she lived at the assisted living for years until she started having falls.  she went to the hospital (during covid) and they wouldn't allow anyone in with her.  she ""came to"" in the hospital and panicked.  she thought she had been kidnapped and was being tortured.  they chemically and physically restrained her.  all they had to do was let me in to explain to her and hold her hand, but they wouldn't.  i will always resent that with all my being.  covid was no excuse to do that to her.  needless to say, this event really damaged her.  she never recovered.  she was placed in a memory care unit from the hospital.  she went from walking with a cane to being wheelchair bound for the rest of her days.  her dementia progressed rapidly. the last 1.5 years she spent in this facility she slowly became less and less able to talk. she could ask questions and would remember many things still but if you asked her a question outside of the usual ""how are you?"", ""are you in any pain?"", ""how was your dinner last night?"", she would be unable to understand or answer appropriately.  she also became incontinent - first single, then later on about a year in, double.  she became unable to drink from a cup without a straw.  she stopped using utensils  and could only feed herself with her hands.  she spent much of her time with a blank stare and didn't engage much.  she had always been such a social person.  the last few months, she finally started to forget me.  she knew me, and with some explaining, she would remember me, i am so incredibly grateful for that.  but when i would see her, she would look at me for a while, i'd tell her in as many different ways as i could, that i was hers until she'd finally remember... and then she was so happy.  i cherish that so much.  the beginning of the end for her was a bump on her leg.  we don't know what caused it, but for a month, it didn't get any smaller.  she didn't express any pain at all and the doctors said to treat it like a contusion.  they assumed she bumped the wheelchair or table or something of the sort.  one day, the skin gave way and it burst.  the wound was treated and it appeared as though it was finally resolving.  unfortunately, it became infected.  she was taken to the er at the first sign of fever. the amazing doctor there called me. she was so compassionate and respectful of my loved one. she said my lo had sepsis.  she had read my lo's healthcare directive and knew that she didn't want any antibiotics and so suggested hospice.  i agreed and the placement was made.  before she left the hospital, though, an er nurse called me and asked me if i wanted to talk to my lo on the phone. i spoke to her for a few minutes, told her i loved her and that i was on my way and would be with her in a few hours.  she didn't respond, but the nurse said she was blinking her eyes and was listening.  i am forever grateful for that nurse, because that was the last time i spoke to her while she was awake.  she arrived at the hospice but wasn't responding when they tried to give her something to drink.  she was no longer able to swallow.  fluids and food were then stopped.  morphine was administered.  she never opened her eyes again.  i stayed with her as long as i could each day - leaving only to eat and sleep.  on her sixth day, i left to get lunch.  i kissed her and told her i'd be back.  on my way back to the hospice, i got the call.  she had passed ten minutes ago.  i wasn't there.  i didn't want her to be alone, but i suppose that's what she wanted.  i wanted so badly to be there with her. i hope she wasn't waiting for me. she was so very loved and i was so very loved by her.  what a blessing our love for each other was. &amp;#x200b;ultimately, our dementia journey lasted 5 years of active management although it probably began before then (i just didn't recognize it). i don't think she had any ""step-like"" progression like they say. hers was just a slow, steady decline, punctuated  by two hospital stays.  there were no strokes or big health events.  she was 95. i hope this may help some of you on your journey with your loved ones.  while you're going through it, it's so frustrating and so hard.  the not knowing is tremendously hard.  keep loving them as fiercely as you do, even when you don't feel like you're loving them, you are through your actions.  love is an act as well as an emotion. let your acts carry you through the times when your heart's just not in it.  and be kind to yourself.", thank you so much for sharing some of the details of the progression of dementia that you noticed and your kinds and loving words towards your loved one.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tkvabl/our_journey_is_over_our_story_with_vascular/,Our journey is over.

"i am pissed...i am furious...2 years gone and i still cry, i still want to scream all my fury and loss up into the sky. if you have the time, i'd like to tell you a story. i will try not to ramble, but it's a story that needs to be told if only to hopefully put it to rest....  growing up it was my mom and i, we had my grandparents and aunt and uncle's but they were rarely around. my grands were abusive and the others indifferent. my mom put herself through college and worked her ass off to put a roof over our heads... something i never really understood the strain of until i grew older.   she had always been eccentric, always a little off but in a fabulous way in most regards. we had the first home computer in our neighborhood, one of the first to connect to the internet..she loved art, music cooking and medieval history.i'm telling you all this to gain a grasp of her intellect.  my entire life i never heard a lie leave her lips or a curse worse that calling someone a ""nut nut"". was she perfect?? fuck no. i had been asking her to seek help for mental health issues since i was 20...i'm 42 now. i promise you this is all relevant.   she started really sliding down hill around 15? years ago. it's hard to judge times...like i said she was eccentric, i just thought my crazy mom is acting like my crazy mom. until it was more than that. i blew off a lot of what in retrospect i shouldn't of because they were very, very big warning bells. what finally woke me up to her mind truly slipping was that she could not remember what car was mine parked in my own driveway, a car i had had for 10 years.  a bunch of other slips started happening, couldn't remember my kids ages, her personality started to rapidly change... very very! angry. i did finally manage to get her to see a psych doctor. the list of disorders was almost a page long ( this happened before she got to far gone btw). ptsd anxiety depression were at the forefront. then the delusions started. 'theres someone climbing on the roof"" "" there's a peeping tom at the window'  she made multiple phone calls to the police about a random neighbor and a highschool friend trying to drive her crazy.   i became very good friends with the police.  i should state that at this time she was living with my alcohol grandmother as my grandmother's caretaker. they did not have the best if relationships at the best of times.  my grandmother was also a horder.  the situation progressed until the council of elders intervened. my mother's doctor would not listen to any of us, wanting only to focus on her diabetes...bitch the lady can't take her meds if she can't remember them.  she was finally placed in an assisted living facility. unfortunately she continued to decline at a very rapid rate. she would constantly try to escape thinking my grandmother's house was right outside. she got very mean and very violent even as her body forgot how to function, by the end i couldn't get her into my car to take her home for weekends.  i'm losing steam writing this. 2020 hit and i couldn't see her at all until it was to late, but really it had been to late for at least 4 years...that was our last really coherent talk anyways. i got to talk to her on the phone a few times but always set her off. i got a call from the home that she was in the hospital for a uti...later get a call from the hospital that i had better get paperwork signed cause it looked like she was checking out soon. ketoacidosis. her whole body is shutting down.  i run down there, an hours drive from here, covid regs so i can only stay 15 minutes and that's only because it's an end of life visit...fuck that. i climbed in bed with her, put on her favorite music on my phone and i laid right there for an hour. that is where we did goodbye. i had a few blessed minutes where she was there, where she knew who i was. it didn't last long but she hadn't known me in 3 years so i will take that time to my grave 2 days later she was moved to another hospital even farther away, i was told to come say goodbye again. it was an active covid floor so i had to sign a bunch of waivers and get suited up in a marshmallow suit. i called all the fam on video chat, laid down next to her husk and tried to be as brave as i could as i talked and tried to assure everyone without breaking myself.  i got the call she had passed that night.  no wake, no funeral..just me by myself going to deal with the morge and her ashes.   bottom line to anyone still reading...i'm still pissed. i'm furious something like this could happen to someone who tried so hard to be a decent person despite all the odds and unfairness and suffered so much before dementia got it's hooks in. i want her back. i want the time that was robbed. she died at 62, she left me in her 50s. i hope when my time is up i get to sock god one for all the people lost within themselves cause it's a living hell.  end rant"," i feel your pain completely. it’s not fair. and it is such a horrible way to die. i lost my brilliantly clever and funny mom on dec 13 last year. when i think about the last 10 years — all the warning signs, all the big changes, all the incidents that accelerated her decline, up until the fall she had that broke her arm and led to her death a month later — and my heart just aches for her and how her life was for the last little bit of it. i don’t wanna have that kind of existence in the final stretch of mine. just give me a handful of pills or send me to oregon so i can die in peace before i lose everything i am. i’m the youngest of her 5 kids. and i’d argue she was closest with me in the last couple years, even though our relationship was probably the most volatile and problematic. one beautiful thing that happened because of the dementia (especially in the earliest stages) was she was so much more open to my way of seeing the world. she had less fear of being judged, she felt safe with me & trusted me. i can sometimes find comfort in those thoughts. but then it’s easy to get stuck in the “i could’ve/should’ve done more” cycle. it’s infuriating to think of alllllll the ways i tried to help out and unite all the family caretakers in our plan of action, only to be completely ignored and not taken seriously. her quality of life could’ve been so much better than it was in her last years. i am so fucking grateful that i got to be with her when she died. i think about it all the time. i did something similar to you — laid with her on the bed, or on the comfy chair right next to her bed, listening to the love story soundtrack, which she always loved. my sibs and i got 3 days with us all together with her. hospice said the absolute latest she’d still be alive was monday morning. they woke me up sometime at 7am to tell me she was having her final moments. and i did my best to fill her with love and peace as she left me. that’s all we can really hope for in the end. that our last thought will be a good one. fuck, i loved my mom… she deserved better than she got. i’m sorry you went through all of it alone. even though it’s been a rocky road sibling-wise for me, i can’t imagine not having them to grieve alongside of. and it’s nice to think there are 4 other people that truly know exactly how i feel and that we all hurt for the loss of her. i’m so happy that you got that special time with her. it will be a source of comfort to you in the many years of grief you have yet to feel. honestly, it’s also really comforting just to be able to know anyone else that’s felt the agony of dementia, and be able to swap stories. most people have a 3 month window of when they’re willing to wanna hear about someone else’s grief. after that, people tend to think you should be over it & they have much less patience to deal with a sad, grieving friend. luckily, everyone here i think wants to share their story as well as hear others’ tales of grief. it helps. so thanks for sharing, and thanks for

," i will start off by stating that i'm based in the uk. me and my mum take our dog for a walk most days at roughly the same time, and for awhile now we've seen a woman wandering around singing to herself, singing whilst riding her bicycle and constantly hanging around children on the park. we thought maybe she is just a bit eccentric and is maybe one of the children's mum, as she is spotted round them often. she even got involved trying to play football with them once. today however, a large group of teenagers, most of whom we see on the park daily just playing football or cycling around, were tormenting her and taking her dog's ball away from her and wouldn't give it back. one of the teenagers was trying to get it back so that the woman would leave the park. my mum shouted to them to give it back to the woman so they gave it back to her and she left. whilst this was happening, me and my mum were observing the situation trying to make sense of what was happening, two of the children from the group came over to us and said that she won't leave them alone and that she's a paedophile as she apparently followed a young kid into a bathroom or something. how much of this is true i do not know. my mum said she had noticed that the woman was always hanging around them but thought she was one of the childrens' mum. most of the group then went and sat down on the grass and a man appeared a few minutes later. we heard him saying that the woman is not well and that they need to ignore her when she's hanging around them. anyway sorry for the massive essay. im just concerned that this stranger might have dementia or some kind of similar mental illness. i don't know who she is but i'm worried that she will either get hurt, her dog might get hurt as she left it on its own on the pavement when she tried to get the ball back or that she might need some support. i don't want to get involved really as its not my place and i don't know her personally. i just feel sad for her mostly and that if she isn't receiving any kind of support that she may get worse over time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tiquuz/a_woman_who_i_see_most_days_at_the_park_when_im/,A woman who I see most days at the park when I'm walking my dog was being tormented today by a large group of young teenagers.

"this is more of a vent post... my grandma is 87 and lived on her own up until a couple of weeks ago. she is in good health but doesn't get around well and is 90% deaf in both ears. for the past few months, she had had some hallucinations but they were pretty sparse and inoffensive – like she would hallucinate that there were rats in her bedroom, but then the next day she'd realize she had been hallucinating and laugh it off and be fine for a few more days. things have escalated dramatically over the past month. my cousin and her husband went to visit her and throughout the visit she was accusing the husband of stealing things and trying to kill her so he could sell her jewelry and hide her body. after they left, my parents got a call from her neighbor, who said they found her sitting by the road because she'd fallen while running from a knife-wielding murderer. my dad drove out immediately and found her terrified and hallucinating that there was someone hiding under her bed. she refused to go to the er and they had to call emts. they checked her vital signs and checked for a uti but everything was normal. when my dad got her back home he convinced her to come stay with them.after my parents got her to their house she seemed to be doing a little better, they had her following a routine, eating on a schedule, drinking plenty of fluids, getting to bed at a reasonable hour. they put me on skype to talk to her last weekend and she was lucid and able to have a normal conversation. however the hallucinations ramped up again and they ended up putting a baby monitor in her room because she would stay up all night long walking around talking to invisible friends and relatives, and one night they found her frantically trying to leave the house. fast forward to last night – i heard from my mom that she was up all night screaming that my parents were hurting themselves and trying to kill her. she'd locked herself in the closet of the guest room and was screaming that she would call 911 and that they would ""never get away with this."" they eventually had to remove the doorknob to get to her, and they found her absolutely terrified on the closet floor. they had to call emts to take her to the er, where they're still waiting now (god bless the usa, it's been like 5 hours apparently). anyway, i don't know whether i'm looking for advice or what but i'm just absolutely devastated, both for my grandma and my parents who are suffering through this. they tried an antipsychotic but could not get her to take more than one dose.  they cannot do an mri because she has a cochlear implant for her hearing loss, and without an mri i don't expect them to be able to get a diagnosis anytime soon. they live in the rural southwest us and doctors/specialists are few and far between. i guess if anyone has anything to suggest from experience, that would be great. if not, then thank you for coming to my ted talk lol."," my wife had many of the same hallucinations.  her doctor gave her seroquel and they disappeared and her life is back to a more even keel. hallucinations and delusions are gone and she sleeps 11 hours peacefully at night.  she took seroquel in the morning, afternoon and night, but is so much better she only needs it at bedtime.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tipll3/grandma_is_hallucinating_nonstop_thinks_everyone/,"Grandma is hallucinating nonstop, thinks everyone is trying to kill her (TW)"

so my grandma has dementia and i was wondering why it is that she can remember certain things. i did a quick google and understand that it affects short term memories etc but right now she barely remembers her kids (my dad and aunts) but remembered my dad’s newly wed wife so it doesnt really make sense to me. lately ive been getting into psychology so id like to know for that but mainly if there’s triggers or something we can change so it doesnt keep getting worse or at the least remember her own kids it would be life changing for our family.," different types of dementia attack the brain in different ways. it usually damages the short term memory first and then starts damaging the long term memory. think about it like this: when you start a fire you can't burn the large logs first, you start with kindling and then move up to the larger logs over time. so the short term memory goes first (remembering where you put the keys, whether or not you brushed your teeth, etc), then the stuff that happened the most recently (deaths in the family, recently moves, retirement, etc), then the middle stuff (having children, getting married, graduating college), then the earliest memories.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tigg85/somebody_that_knows_about_dementia_help_plz/,Somebody that knows about dementia help plz
"hello everyone. sorry for the rant/vent but i just... need a platform of sorts to let some things out i guess...?  as the title suggests, my grandmother has alzheimer's disease. it's late stage. i feel like i could just wake up any day now and learn that she's passed away and it weighs on me.   i'm 19 years old- so pretty young still i would say. i am also a full-time college student and so these things just continuously put weight on me every day. i am so afraid of her passing suddenly and the grief will just completely wreck my school life. i almost flunked high school due to depression and so i am trying not to make any sort of repeat with this newfound ""chance"" i now have. it's conflicting- because part of me feels awful for just ""waiting"" for her to pass away. of course, i don't want my grandma to die, but this disease has destroyed her so much it's like she's just a physical shell at this point. she is my last grandparent, after all. but at the same time, me internally hoping that she will at least die when i am not in school is such a terrible thing to think about and i feel so... selfish, quite frankly. she's the one with the disease, after all.  every week or so, i see her- except it's just a depressing experience at this point because alzheimer's has taken such a toll on her. i'm trying to spend at least a good amount of time with her while she's still here but it's hard to do so. she's incoherent and does not remember me nor a good chunk of my relatives and requires assistance to do the majority of things if not everything. i'm not surprised at this but it still hurts a bit, you know? plus, i know she is the only person holding my family together because her children aka my aunts and uncles are in a feud over finances and god forbid what happens after she leaves this realm.   i've been crying tonight like i do every few weeks nowadays when i think about her. my parents do not know about this. it's just so stressful, and it also feels like i'm looking into the future because dementia runs in my family. my other grandmother also passed from the same disease before i was born. every time i notice my parents forget something it just sparks a tinge of pain within me because of that fear that they will develop the disease too and i can't really do anything about it. i was also raised in a culture where children are expected to take care of their parents when they're older, so the possibility of me having to be a care-giver myself one day also haunts me because i've seen what it is like and also feel a bit selfish for not wanting to do such a thing.   i really don't know what to do anymore, or how to even properly cope with something like this. it's a cruel cycle of waiting for her to die so she can finally be at peace and then feel bad for thinking such a thing. am i a bad person for thinking it'd be better for her to pass away at this rate? how am i supposed to live knowing about this slow and cruel decline towards death my grandmother is facing, and that she's almost at the finish line? i've always wanted for her to see me graduate but i know it is likely that she will be gone by the time i finish any sort of degree. seeing my friends be able to interact with and spend time with their own grandparents is like a stab in the chest reminder that i will never be able to have such a relationship. i am happy for them yet i can't help but feel... jealous about it. i do have a few very vague memories of my grandma back before alzheimer's got to her, but i've since long forgotten a good bit of it myself- such a cruel twist of irony, isn't it. i love my grandma very much but it also hurts so much seeing her like this. i am in pure agony.  still, if you're still reading this, thanks for your time. really. i may not know who you are but just know i am thankful you'd put off some of your time to read this. i do not expect a lot of attention and for this to just float around in the reddit ocean forever and that i am content with. i just want to let some of my thoughts go, and after typing this i think i feel a little bit better. well, i stopped crying a bit ago at least, haha. maybe i can finally go to bed."," you say that you are in education. in some ways, that is a very supportive environment. please reach out to the mental health support that is provided by your institution. they will have professionals that can support you much more than the internet can, and they will also be able to help you receive reasonable adjustments if that should be necessary. there is nothing wrong with your feelings, but you may be at risk of depression. a professional will be able to give you a diagnosis and propose steps to help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tigea3/i_dont_know_how_to_cope_with_my_grandmothers/,I don't know how to cope with my grandmother's Alzheimer's

"i live in las vegas, my mother is in georgia.  this is the fourth visit. my mother and i had no relationship, and now we do. i knew when she started calling me last summer and saying things like, ""god bless you"" i knew things were serious.this visit i came out to see an attorney and get advanced medical directive, power of attorney, and a will done.  that happened yesterday afternoon. after months of telling me she had an attorney to see but could not find the name of the person and all she needed was, ""to update the will.""  after fruitless searching at her house for the existing will, at the attorney appointment she said she had never had one done. to be perfectly frank (the whole point of this post) i'm bored sitting here and a bit exhausted. the attorney appointment was a big step. it's done. the will and other forms are simple. and now the formality is after it's prepared and i've seen a draft to get her to actually go sign it. i suspect it will be another $450 round trip just to ensure she goes and signs it. mom just asked me why she hasn't heard back from the attorney and she isn't sure he's any good.  it's saturday and like i said...met with him yesterday morning. she needs the tv on constantly, can't stand having ""no noise"" yet she's never paying attention to it and wants to talk to me constantly. i'm a fairly quiet person and get distracted easily (add) so it's irritating...always was. there's a lot of old feelings coming back especially this visit. we've had the conversation 8 times at least today about me getting a copy of the will. when her mother died she didn't get a copy of a different will she wasn't aware of until two months after my grandmother died.  the house that was to go to her was already sold and she has no idea what happened to any of the contents of the house. she doesn't want that to happen to me. so continues to repeat it despite me repeating the attorney is going to email me a copy in draft and in final form.by the way, that isn't what happened with my grandmother. the will part is true, but the house was sold with my mother's participation. she got the net proceeds from the sale. she needed help getting back on online banking since her bank was bought out and is transitioning over to a new website. she continues to ask if she needs new checks because they say the old bank name on them and if the checks are going through because she doesn't know. i look at her check register. she's perfectly balanced the checkbook and is marking when every check she writes clears. she just asked me to help her get back on the computer so she can she her bank account because she doesn't know when her retirement and ss money comes in. we did that yesterday too.and another thing bothering me. the notion of ""get her to a neurologist"" that well-meaning friends are telling me isn't quite that straightforward when you live across the country, or even when i'm here.  she claims she will find one and i don't need to worry about it. i've finally (this visit) gotten the name and information for her pcp which i told her i will make an appointment with to get a referral to a neurologist. i contacted four neurologists around the atlanta area that i knew i could at least take her to. three are not accepting new patients, one is ""not that kind of neurologist."" but i don't have to do that, her cardiologist said he would find a neurologist for her.  the same thing she told me in november..."," oh sure, it’s frustrating. it probably won’t reassure you to tell you that your mother’s brain is very dysfunctional and it’s only going to get worse. i doubt that your mother could see a neurologist on her own. even if she did, she would “showtime” and present as better than she really is. at least, you can look into arranging transport for her to an appointment. my city has a paratransit system for people who can’t take public transport. there are only three categories of dementia, mild, moderate, and severe impairment. that makes it a bit deceptive.  my husband is mild to moderate but he can’t be left alone safely. i don’t see how she’s living alone. is putting her in a home an option? take a deep breath. this whole situation sucks big time. you’re doing great by getting the legal stuff settled.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ti4bwy/the_fourth_visit/,The Fourth Visit...

"this is kind of a long rant but i just don't understand some of the actions my family members are taking in relation to the care of my grandparents. they have been both diagnosed with rapidly progressing dementia and alzheimers within the last 7 months. my grandfather is definitely worse. he's mood has changed, and he's joyful and happy all the time which is nice. he's never forgotten who i am and he knows what i'm talking about. he'll also ask me how things went two weeks after the fact, so he's still there. my dad took over his finances last summer and has severely restricted my grandma's spending. she has a credit card limit and her card gets declined when we go out for dinner. they did this because she was buying my aunt too much stuff (who's mentally unwell and lost her son).  they have over 10 million dollars so it's not really a problem for her to spend money, but i get it. i just found out my grandma was diagnosed 2 months ago with dementia and alzheimers as well. i didn't realize how bad she was, i just thought she was getting forgetful when she would tell me the same story after a few hours. they now have 24 hr care, which is great. but i am no longer allowed to sleepover and i'm so upset about it. i can now only visit from 1-8 pm to put them on a strict schedule. i only slept over because it made them happy and i liked having breakfast and reading the paper with them in the morning. i also worked as a home health aide for 14 years so i thought i could help them if they needed it. i'm graduating with my phd in may, and my dad told me they couldn't come to my graduation. i'm so sad about it, and i get that it messes with their schedule. but they really wanted to go. are these restrictions to make them have a set schedule normal? i just want what's best for them, but i don't understand why taking away things that seem harmless and make them happy is helpful. i don't have a good relationship with my dad and my stepmom, so i think it's also me feeling resentful towards him."," i think a set schedule and routine is a good thing. with regards finances, there are alot of scammers out there who target the elderly.  my dad nearly lost his life savings had i not popped in after work for a cup of tea. try not to resent your dad for his decisions. it will be difficult for him too. if anything this could possibly bring you closer if you can both be constructive. you might be in his shoes one day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ti27qa/can_someone_please_let_me_know_whats_appropriate/,[deleted by user]

"im just really sad and don't really have anyone to talk to right now so i want to share what my family is going through right now.my aunt passed away this morning.  it's been a slow burn.  she had cancer back in the early 00s, always had her routine appointments since she was cleared but since it had been 15 years with no sign of cancer again, they stop doing those kinds of appointments.  this is my tip for the day: continue making those appointments if this happens to you, or loved ones. im uncertain if it would have saved her in the end but right now i wish it would have.anyways, it did come back. about three years ago. and about a year and a half ago, we were told she only had two weeks left to live by the hospital. well, they were wrong and im not sure if it's good or bad that she had more time. she suffered and she didn't want people to see her suffer. the last day i saw her was saturday and i knew it would be my last time with her. i love her dearly and i hope she feels so much better.now, her mother who is my grandmother, has dementia and has been diagnosed for years. we are sure she knew her daughter was sick, especially after her bad spell and the hospital giving us two weeks. my grandmother was traumatized seeing her daughter in a hospital bed in her home and saying how god should take her instead. so we are sure she never forgot that, or her illness. but saturday, when our family was together at the nursing home my aunt was in, my mom took my grandma back to where she lives and it seemed like she just forgot the whole experience of seeing her daughter. and my aunt looked and was much worse than she was after her bad spell over a year ago. saturday was four days ago so now we know that she doesn't even know that she went to go see her daughter.today around 4:45am, my aunt passed away.  now i'm not sure how my grandmother is going to handle this. it seems like she's reliving the pain every time she saw her daughter and i dont know how many times we will have to tell her she's gone.this is the worst thing i can think of telling someone with dementia."," hi everyone.first, thank you for the kind words, it really means a lot to have support especially from people who are very understanding of the situation. i didn't expect to receive this much guidance, i had planned on making responses individually but most of the statements are the same. this one really wasn't my call to make. i live almost two hours away from my grandmother and the closest to her is my mother. i was the one who called and told my mother the news this morning and she felt obligated to go in person to tell her mother. i respected her decision but i really did not want her to be alone, so my cousin drove there as well and they broke the news together. as you can imagine, she wept, said god should have taken her and kids aren't supposed to go before their parents. it's truly a cruel and unfair circumstance. my mom has been with her all day so she hasn't been alone. but like i suspected, mom told me she's reliving it every so often. i cant say i disagree with most comments here, my only issue is that we still have a viewing and a funeral to attend to. this isn't something we can get away with right away and the strangeness of my grandma's disease is that from time to time memories will pop up. now i know in a lot of cases, they can remember things from their childhood but not what happened in the last hour. this is also my grandma but now and again she will remember things that happened recently. so i dont know. this is a very delicate situation, i do not want to break her heart every day of her life moving forward. but how do we respond if we do lie to her and suddenly she remembers for awhile?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tff1qn/having_to_explain_that_her_child_died/,Having to explain that her child died
"i'm living with my grandma, who has dementia at about a level 4/5... that is she can still dress herself and bathe herself, wash her own clothes etc. but any complicated task...preparing meals, paying bills, at times even counting... overwhelms and confuses her.  she is often uncertain about the day of the week and repeats herself endlessly within just a few minutes.  her short-term memory can be very bad, but her logic and reasoning skills aren't, she's very aware of what's going on around her, she even still drives because she's always aware of where she is and what the other cars around her are doing, just doesn't always remember where she's going unless you remind her.  she's never had an accident in her life.i have the feeling from reading this sub that i've moved in a lot earlier in the process than most people do... which is great in some ways as i can try to make her life as good as i can for as long as i can, but on the other hand i can't just do as i know is best for her either, a lot of times too it's easy to forget it's the disease because she's always been kind of contrary and resistant to anything new that she doesn't suggest herself, lol.  anyway, she has acid reflux really badly.  this is terrible, but it took me about a week to figure out what was even wrong, because she can be a bit of a hypochondriac... my mom had warned me about it, but it still took me a while to spot the pattern of whenever i went to church, or to spend time with my other grandparents, she would claim her stomach hurt as she either felt embarrassed to not want to attend church, or was jealous of me spending time away from her.   so last week when she said her stomach hurt, i didn't take her seriously and she went and checked herself into the emergency room.  she wanted to leave as soon as i got there, but i convinced her to stay until they finished all the tests.  they found nothing after five hours, and we went home.  but the next day, she was still saying her stomach hurt and then she said her throat was burning and i guessed it was acid reflux.  but she refuses to take tums or pepto bismal most of the time, she says it makes her sick to even look at.  same with water.  i've had to hide the instant coffee and soda, and it's torture trying to get her to eat anything plain, all she want to eat is candy.  which she can go out and buy herself.  she sundowns pretty badly and stays up all night  eating all the stuff you're not supposed to eat for acid reflux then is sick in the morning, both because she wants to lay on the couch and sleep, and because she can't sleep because her stomach hurts her too badly.  she can't understand what's causing the pain and thinks she's sick with an illness that i can catch, so she becomes upset with me being near her, and upset with the food i'm cooking for her because she ""can't eat"" because apparently good food and meds and water make her sick to her stomach to even look at.  another thing is she seems to be too hot and then too cold all the time, like every five minutes she's asking me to check the temperature, and then to either cover her up with a blanket or rolling up her sleeves and then her pants legs claiming she's burning up.  i try to keep the temp around 70, but whenever i leave and come back she's got it at 78 or 64.   i'm kinda at my wits' end here, both my mom and aunt live out of state and are counting on me to take care of her, but she is not allowing herself to be taken care of at all."," with the food, it is true that people with dementia tend to enjoy candy because sweets are basically the last flavor they can taste strongly and enjoy. i would try to use this to your advantage, look online for foods that are sweet but more healthy. for example its more important for her to get hydration than cutting her sugar so apple juice and orange juice are great. alternatively you could put honey or maple syrup on everything that’s healthy lol. all this advice is assuming she’s not actually diabetic.she needs to stop driving. i know she never had an accident before but you never know when she goes out driving with a uti (very common with elderly/senior women with dementia, and makes sundowning worse) etc, the first one will be. and she or you could be legally liable if she hurt or killed someone and you openly allowed her to drive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tfah80/how_do_you_deal_when_your_loved_one_is_sick/,How do you deal when your loved one is sick?

it’s been 4 years since my mother has been diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy and it’s getting progressively worse. i do the best i can to help her and my step dad but it’s getting to the point my siblings want to have lunch and discuss a contingency plan. i’m just scared to death of someone wanting to put her in a home but i can’t do anything if that’s what they decide. being that we don’t have the income for a good one. has anyone had a similar experience and if so any advice they could throw my way? just really want to keep her out of the states hands,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tenxkl/pca/,[deleted by user]
"so, if i'm being completely honest, we waited too long. the process for applying for medicaid should have begun a year ago (or more). but, now we really need help and are looking at a medicaid planner. basically, you pay $$$ and they do all the paperwork for you and send it to the right place, and get you through the loops. their mission is to (paraphrasing): get you and loved one the support you need, while also ensuring you don't break the bank, and also getting through the bureaucracy nightmare and red tape.so, has anyone found success using one of these planners? more specific details in the comments."," i'm working with an elder care law firm in kansas. the cost is high, but definitely worth it. they've saved me more than i've spent by giving me legal ways to exclude assets from the ""spend down.""  saved me almost $25,000.  furthermore, the firm i'm working with has nurses on staff that check in on my wife on a periodic basis to evaluate the nursing home for proper care and to make suggestions.  they've also updated my will and power of attorney papers so that if something happens to me, my kids won't have to go through a big mess getting my affairs sorted out.a good elder care law firm is worth their weight in gold.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/telbh5/anyone_ever_use_a_medicaid_planning_service/,Anyone ever use a Medicaid planning service?
